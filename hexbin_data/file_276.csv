Yet an instructor, in newly considering this suite of interrelated pedagogical strategies, faces a number of important instructional choices. Different features and their related values and learning outcomes are profiled here, including: the level of student autonomy; instructional focus on content, skills development, or nature-of-science understanding; the role of history, or known outcomes; scope, clarity, and authenticity of problems provided to students; extent of collaboration; complexity, in terms of number of interpretive perspectives; and, perhaps most importantly, the role of applying versus generating knowledge.","Allchin, Douglas",CBE Life Sci Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3763004/,276
1488,"Retrospective diagnosis of a famous historical figure: ontological, epistemic, and ethical considerations",2014-05-28,"The aim of this essay is to elaborate philosophical and ethical underpinnings of posthumous diagnosis of famous historical figures based on literary and artistic products, or commonly called retrospective diagnosis. It discusses ontological and epistemic challenges raised in the humanities and social sciences, and attempts to systematically reply to their criticisms from the viewpoint of clinical medicine, philosophy of medicine, particularly the ontology of disease and the epistemology of diagnosis, and medical ethics. The ontological challenge focuses on the doubt about the persistence of a disease over historical time, whereas the epistemic challenge disputes the inaccessibility of scientific verification of a diagnosis in the past. I argue that the critics are in error in conflating the taxonomy of disease (nosology) and the act of diagnosing a patient. Medical diagnosis is fundamentally a hypothesis-construction and an explanatory device that can be generated under various degrees of uncertainty and limited amount of information. It is not an apodictic judgment (true or false) as the critics presuppose, but a probabilistic (Bayesian) judgment with varying degrees of plausibility under uncertainty. In order to avoid this confusion, I propose that retrospective diagnosis of a historical figure be syndromic without identifying underlying disease, unless there is justifiable reason for such specification. Moreover it should be evaluated not only from the viewpoint of medical science but also in a larger context of the scholarship of the humanities and social sciences by its overall plausibility and consistency. On the other hand, I will endorse their concerns regarding the ethics and professionalism of retrospective diagnosis, and call for the need for situating such a diagnosis in an interdisciplinary scope and the context of the scholarship of the historical figure. I will then enumerate several important caveats for interdisciplinary retrospective diagnosis using an example of the retrospective diagnosis of Socrates for his life-long intermittent neurologic symptoms. Finally, I will situate the present argument in a larger context of the major debate among the historians of medicine and paleopathologists, and discuss the similarities and differences.","Muramoto, Osamu",Philos Ethics Humanit Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4049481/,276

However, the mean-field approach cannot show the detailed contagion process, which is important in the control of epidemic. To fill this gap, we present a novel approach to study how the topological structure of complex network influences the concrete process of epidemic spreading. After transforming the network structure into hierarchical layers, we introduce a set of new parameters, i.e., the average fractions of degree for outgoing, ingoing, and remaining in the same layer, to describe the infection process. We find that this set of parameters are closely related to the degree distribution and the clustering coefficient but are more convenient than them in describing the process of epidemic spreading. Moreover, we find that the networks with exponential distribution have slower spreading speed than the networks with power-law degree distribution. Numerical simulations have confirmed the theoretical predictions.","Liu, Zonghua; Wu, Xiaoyan; Hui, Pak-Ming",Front Comput Sci China,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133550/,276

13175,Residency redeployment during a pandemic: Lessons for balancing service and learning,2020-09-23,"BACKGROUND: The therapeutic strategies of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) tend to be comprehensive. Improving the major symptoms and quality of life (QoL) is as important as postponing the process of fibrosis. However, only pirfenidone and nintedanib conditionally recommended by guidelines and no definite proof indicate that they can significantly ameliorate the main symptoms and QoL of IPF sufferers. At present, multiple types of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) interventions alone or in combination with conventional western medicine managements are widespreadly applied in IPF treatment, which seemingly have a promising clinical effect, especially in ameliorating the main symptoms and improving QoL. Subsequently, the number of relevant studies in systematic reviews(SRs) and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials(RCTs) increased significantly. Hence, we plan to implement an overview to collect, evaluate, and summarize the results of these SRs. METHODS: An all-round literature retrieval will be conducted in 9 electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, CNKI, CBM, Wanfang, and VIP. We will focus on the systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs for multiple TCM interventions alone or in combination with routine western medicine measures in IPF treatment. The main outcomes we follow with interest include the improvement of major symptoms (cough, dyspnea) and QoL. Secondary outcomes will consist of minor symptoms improvement, clinical total effective rate, lung function, blood gas analysis, 6-minute walk text, adverse events, acute exacerbation, all-cause mortality, and IPF-related mortality. Two reviewers will independently select the SRs satisfactory with the enrolling criteria, extract key characteristics, and datas on predefined form, evaluate methodological quality by AMSTAR-2, ROBIS and PRISMA tools, and the quality of evidences adopting GRADE method. In case of any divergence will be reached an agreement by discussion or adjudicated by a third senior reviewer. We will perform a narrative synthesis of the proofs from SRs included. RESULTS: The findings of this overvew will be presented at relevant conferences and submitted for peer-review publication. CONCLUSIONS: We expect to obtain comprehensive and reliable evidence of IPF treated by diversified TCM interventions from the potential standard SRs, which may provide suggestions for future RCTs and SRs.

17409,Is This Science? Students’ Experiences of Failure Make a Research-Based Course Feel Authentic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Timely and accurate diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is challenging, requiring specific tests including chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and limited by access to specialist centres with a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Here we describe PerFECT 2.0, an Italian web-based platform designed to create a network between tertiary centres with an MDT (hubs) and secondary centres (spokes), aiming to facilitate the diagnosis of IPF. METHODS: PerFECT 2.0 went live on 1 November 2016. Spoke centres submit anonymised documentation (HRCT images, pathological samples, clinical data) for a second opinion on the potential diagnosis of IPF from a hub centre. HRCT images are quickly uploaded, with patient-identifying information automatically removed. The hub centre views documentation online (no downloads allowed), makes any further information requests, then returns their second opinion as free text. An e-learning area contains educational material and simulated training clinical cases. Metrics were collected for 2017–2019; a user survey was conducted from 30 June–31 July 2020. RESULTS: Ten hub centres and 137 spoke centres have registered. The requests for a second opinion numbered 251 in 2017, 270 in 2018 and 265 in 2019 (overall mean 19.9 requests per month). The proportion of requests answered was 100.0% (251) in 2017, 100.0% (270) in 2018 and 97.7% (259) in 2019. The mean response time was 15.7 days. In the user survey, of nine hub responders and 19 spoke responders, 78% and 74%, respectively, reported that the platform is easy to use, and 100% and 89%, respectively, would recommend the platform to colleagues. CONCLUSION: The PerFECT 2.0 web-based platform has created a network that enables secondary centres to gain quick and easy access to a second opinion from a tertiary centre with an MDT through online evaluation of anonymised documentation, thereby facilitating and supporting the timely and accurate diagnosis of IPF.

23564,Grippe A (H1N1) en réanimation,2010-12-18,"Respiratory disease is a complex phenotype and the diagnostic can be attributed to multiple causes including viral infection (e.g., respiratory coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus), bacterial infection (e.g., pneumonic spp.; lungworm), and vena caval thrombosis. Moreover, the impact of respiratory disease in cows varies with the stage of lactation when the disease is detected. In general, intense management practices facilitate the detection of respiratory disorders in dairy cattle herds relative to beef cattle herds. Thus, we propose that study of respiratory disease incidence in a large dairy cattle data set as paradigm to advance the knowledge on the factors influencing the incidence of this disease across cattle types. Respiratory disease information on 6,283 Holstein cows across four U.S. states and nine herds were evaluated. Two descriptors of respiratory disease were evaluated: days in milk to respiratory disease detection and the binary detection of respiratory disease. Survival analysis was used to study the days in milk-to-disease. The binary variable respiratory disease detection was analyzed using a binary logistic model. Lactation number, season, region, farm, body condition score, and milk yield level (3 levels) were included in the model as fixed explanatory effects whereas sire was considered a random effect. Incidence of respiratory disease was lower in summer relative to winter, and there was a nonsignificant trend on lactation number. Body condition score had a significant effect, with higher body condition score associated with lower incidence of respiratory disease. Farm, body condition score, and milk yield level had significant effect on the time when respiratory disease was identified. The heritability estimate for incidence of respiratory disease was 0.4, suggesting that despite the high number of potential causative agents, selection for less susceptible cattle can be an effective strategy to reduce the impact of this disease. The heritability estimate of the days in milk-to-disease was 0.13, showing that non-genetic components may play an important role on the stage of the lactation when the disease is detected. These findings contribute to an animal health project (USDA-NIFA-ILLU-538909) and a multistate project database (USDA-NIFA-AFRI-003542) for direct measures of health and fertility in cattle.","Goncalves, T.

Since about 1960, there has been a concerted and prolonged effort to reduce or eliminate this outcome; the efforts have been successful, but new challenges continue to appear, mostly in the form of emerging infectious diseases. This chapter reviews two relevant issues: the possibility of predicting microbial threats to blood safety and the interventions that may be used to reduce the risks of transfusion transmission. While there are only limited opportunities to predict relevant infections, there are effective measures to enhance blood safety. These involve appropriate selection of donors, implementation of effective tests, and development and implementation of pathogen reduction.","Dodd, Roger Y.",Blood Safety,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120977/,276

Complications of blood administration range from rare but severe reactions (hemolytic transfusion reactions) to more common, and also associated with significant morbidity and mortality, such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-related circulatory overload (TACO), and changes in immune system (transfusion related immunomodulation [TRIM]).","Cywinski, Jacek B.",Basic Sciences in Anesthesia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121298/,276

This chapter endorses the restrengthening of an uncompromised health care system to make it effective and efficient for both rural and urban areas; one that finds ways of trimming financial and human resource waste; revamps the institutions that train health care and service providers to make the system responsive to the real health needs of the people and not just the wealthy; one that compensates physicians just as civil servants; and aligns the educational system with targeted and expected measurable health outcomes.","Azevedo, Mario J.","Historical Perspectives on the State of Health and Health Systems in Africa, Volume II",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123888/,276

In this chapter, we classify acute respiratory failure in two main types, based on their primary physiologic abnormality: Disorders of the airways, where increase of airway resistance to gas flow determines pharmacologic treatment and ventilatory strategies. These disorders are mainly asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Disorders of the alveoli, where a decrease of lung compliance mandates the use of higher ventilatory pressures that can recruit but also damage the lung. These disorders include the acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and influenza. Additional types of acute respiratory failure are described elsewhere in this book: disorders that result from neuromuscular disease in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-19668-8_19 and pulmonary disorders of the circulation, including pulmonary thromboembolism, in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-19668-8_27.

It was developed for use at both the 52nd (H52) and 120th (H120) vaccine levels and, because of it ability to provide heterologous cross-protection against a number of IB viruses of different serotypes, has proved to be one of the most enduring live attenuated IB vaccines. In fact, the H120 vaccine is possibly the most widely used live attenuated IB vaccine globally to this day. The use of H52 has, however, declined with the introduction of safe and highly efficacious inactivated IB vaccines. This review documents the original studies to isolate and attenuate the H strain by serial embryo passage, and describes the early studies to demonstrate its efficacy in laboratory studies and under field conditions.

30213,Safety in the Dive Tourism Industry of Australia,2009-11-16,"The discovery of viruses heralded an exciting new era for research in the medical and biological sciences. It has been realized that the cellular receptor guiding a virus to a target cell cannot be the sole determinant of a virus's pathogenic potential. Comparative analyses of the structures of genomes and their products have placed the picornaviruses into a large “picorna-like” virus family, in which they occupy a prominent place. Most human picornavirus infections are self-limiting, yet the enormously high rate of picornavirus infections in the human population can lead to a significant incidence of disease complications that may be permanently debilitating or even fatal. Picornaviruses employ one of the simplest imaginable genetic systems: they consist of single-stranded RNA that encodes only a single multidomain polypeptide, the polyprotein. The RNA is packaged into a small, rigid, naked, and icosahedral virion whose proteins are unmodified except for a myristate at the N-termini of VP4. The RNA itself does not contain modified bases. The key to ultimately understanding picornaviruses may be to rationalize the huge amount of information about these viruses from the perspective of evolution. It is possible that the replicative apparatus of picornaviruses originated in the precellular world and was subsequently refined in the course of thousands of generations in a slowly evolving environment. Picornaviruses cultivated the art of adaptation, which has allowed them to “jump” into new niches offered in the biological world.","Gromeier, Matthias; Wimmer, Eckard; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.",Origin and Evolution of Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155501/,276

Ideally, vectors for gene transfer into human cells should be capable of transgene expression without replication or detrimental expression of viral genes. Infection of human cell lines with intact xenogenic adenoviruses established the principle that these viruses are replication defective at the inputs tested, although the molecular basis for defective replication is not understood. Most work with xenogenic vectors is still firmly based in the laboratory and while this is appropriate to demonstrate the utility of a vector the amount of work required for eventual exploitation of a vector in the clinic should not be underestimated.

Studies show that having information about the opponent improves the outcome of negotiation in general. However, unless there is prior knowledge, learning the opponent type in the limited amount of time or number of rounds in a negotiation is a difficult task. In this paper, we use a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) based modeling to perform better modeling of the opponent personality type. In particular, we focus on modeling the opponent into four different types to showcase that a better understanding of personality type can improve the outcome of automated negotiation.

Previous experimental negotiation research mainly focused on the power of BATNA and the influence of the context on the negotiation outcome, raising the question as to whether BATNA is indeed the only relevant power lever in negotiations. Especially game theorists have shown that time-related costs have a decisive influence on negotiation outcomes. The study proposes a framework to actually measure and compare the relevance and force of different power levers in a simulated distributive buyer-seller negotiation. The results suggest that time pressure can be as influential as an alternative; however, students and professionals seem to react differently to power manipulations. Whereas the student sample was significantly influenced by time pressure but not by alternatives, the opposite could be observed in the professional group. The findings question the common belief that alternatives are the key driver of power in negotiations.","Dahlen, Niklas; Eichstädt, Tilman",Group Decision and Negotiation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215183/,276

We report a very rare case of hiatal hernia with transverse colon rupture in the mediastinum after esophagectomy in a 65-year-old woman. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy for clinical stage IIA esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and salvage esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction through a posterior mediastinum route for residual carcinoma. Three years after the initial surgery, two metastatic nodules in the lateral and posterior segments of the liver were detected on follow-up CT and were treated with oral anticancer drugs. After 6 months, the patient was readmitted for anorexia. Upon admission, computed tomography revealed an ileus caused by a hiatal hernia. Emergent operative repair was performed; an incarcerated herniation of the transverse colon was perforated in the mediastinum, and partial transverse colon resection and colostomy were performed. Intensive care was required to control septic shock after surgery, and the patient was discharged on the 53rd postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS: Cases of hiatal hernia with digestive tract prolapsing into the mediastinum after esophagectomy with reconstruction through posterior mediastinum are rare but potentially life-threatening complications.","Konno-Kumagai, Takuro; Sakurai, Tadashi; Taniyama, Yusuke; Sato, Chiaki; Takaya, Kai; Ito, Ken; Kamei, Takashi",Surg Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7247284/,276

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one of the most influential financial indices, and due to its importance, it is adopted as a test bed for this study. The paper explores an alternative strategy to the standard time analysis, by joining the multidimensional scaling (MDS) computational tool and the concepts of distance, entropy, fractal dimension, and fractional calculus. First, several distances are considered to measure the similarities between objects under study and to yield proper input information to the MDS. Then, the MDS constructs a representation based on the similarity of the objects, where time can be viewed as a parametric variable. The resulting plots show a complex structure that is further analyzed with the Shannon entropy and fractal dimension. In a final step, a deeper and more detailed assessment is achieved by associating the concepts of fractional calculus and entropy. Indeed, the fractional-order entropy highlights the results obtained by the other tools, namely that the DJIA fractal nature is visible at different time scales with a fractional order memory that permeates the time series.","Machado, José A.

We review basic pharmacological and clinical researches of HET and discuss the effects of HET against the pandemic COVID‐19. METHODS: We reviewed pharmacological studies from 1996 to 30 April 2020 that used experimental animals orally treated with HET and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 2000 to 30 April 2020. RESULTS: Altogether, 64 pharmacological studies reported immuno‐stimulatory effects against infection and cancer, immuno‐modulative effects against allergy and some inflammatory diseases, and ameliorating effects against exhaustion and frailty. Nine RCTs showed improvement of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex disease on chest X‐ray; improved systemic inflammation, nutrition, and quality of life of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a decrease in the number getting common cold and exacerbations; reduction of soluble interleukin‐2 receptor and the serum cortisol concentration of postoperative patients; a reduction of the incidence of inflammatory complications and C‐reactive protein elevation after cerebrovascular disease; a reduction of the volume of steroid and tacrolimus during the treatment of atopic dermatitis; a healing effect for intractable chronic wounds; improvement of the physical status of elderly weak patients; and improvement of the fatigue level of cancer patients. CONCLUSION: CODIV‐19 is characterized by high risk for the aged and people with other disease complications, cytokine hyperactivity in the severe stage, and sequelae in the recovery stage. Considering the immune‐stimulative/modulative effects of HET on inflammatory conditions and against exhaustion and frailty, it may be useful for prevention, treatment, and recovery from COVID‐19.","Takayama, Shin; Kikuchi, Akiko; Makino, Toshiaki; Kainuma, Mosaburo; Namiki, Takao; Ito, Takashi",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753421/,276

Among them, non-idempotent intersection types provide precise quantitative information about the evaluation of terms and programs. However, unlike simple or second-order types, intersection types cannot be considered as a logical system because the application rule (or the intersection rule, depending on the presentation of the system) involves a condition stipulating that the proofs of premises must have the same structure.

In this paper we show how inductive datatypes may be added to the quantum programming language QPL. We construct a sound categorical model for the language and by doing so we provide the first detailed semantic treatment of user-defined inductive datatypes in quantum programming. We also show our denotational interpretation is invariant with respect to big-step reduction, thereby establishing another novel result for quantum programming. Compared to classical programming, this property is considerably more difficult to prove and we demonstrate its usefulness by showing how it immediately implies computational adequacy at all types. To further cement our results, our semantics is entirely based on a physically natural model of von Neumann algebras, which are mathematical structures used by physicists to study quantum mechanics.","Péchoux, Romain; Perdrix, Simon; Rennela, Mathys; Zamdzhiev, Vladimir",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7788615/,276

While the extent and duration of these changes are not certain, they have already had a great impact on travel patterns. This is also the case in Sweden, despite its relatively liberal approach to restrictions, which relies on voluntary measures such as social distancing and self-monitoring for symptoms. METHODOLOGY: Due to the pandemic, a shift to telework and virtual meetings is being tested in what can be seen as a large-scale experiment, and the knowledge and experience from that experiment may have lasting effects on everyday life. This study seeks to analyse the effects of government and public agencies’ recommendations on meeting and travel behaviour on employees at five public agencies in Sweden. RESULTS: The results indicate that the public authorities surveyed were well prepared and had a ‘backup collaboration solution’, at least technically, to make a rapid behavioural shift when travel was not an option. Though the Swedish government’s and Public Health Authority’s strong recommendations have led to the most dramatic reductions in work-related travel in modern times, the operations in Swedish agencies continue to function, along with the employees’ communications and collaborations. These results indicate that there is great potential for digital tools to influence if and how we commute and make business trips. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that such tools can make the impossible possible.","Hiselius, Lena Winslott; Arnfalk, Peter",Eur,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7895733/,276

The objective is to build a real-time schedule that minimizes the total tardiness subject to the technical constraints of the charging station. We consider preemptive as well as non-preemptive EV charging. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated for the offline problem. To solve the online problem, we propose heuristics based on the priority rule. Further, a local search is implemented to improve the objective value of the preemptive EV charging. Simulation results show that the proposed solving approaches outperform the existing heuristics developed in the literature.

The issue concerns poor bus feeder service to rail stations and/or congested Park&Ride facilities at respective intermodal hubs. Shared mobility in the form of carpooling is a viable alternative in connection to urban rail, especially when appropriate incentives and ridematching tools are effectuated. A multi-modal ride-matching app combining flexible (carpooling) and scheduled (rail and bus public transport) mobility is stipulated by the Horizon 2020 Ride2Rail project. Two intermodal hubs of urban rail along the 20 km-long corridor connecting the Athens basin with the Athens airport in Eastern Attica, Greece, are selected as a case study. The paper envisages the behavioural underpinning of combined rail-rideshare travel companion platform in the first/last mile context through the design of a SP experiment, as mode choice is concerned. All main access and egress modes of intermodal hubs are considered in the mode choice experiment, namely driving alone, using bus feeder, carpool driving and carpool riding. Tested parameters pertain particularly to incentive mechanisms increasing ridesharing to intermodal hubs, contextual preferences related to the trip purpose and perceived barriers of shared mobility.","Deloukas, Alexandros; Georgiadis, Georgios; Papaioannou, Panagiotis",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978539/,276
48971,Online Teaching as an Act of Design,2020-09-11,"Static analysis frameworks, such as Soot and Wala, are used by researchers to prototype and compare program analyses. These frameworks vary on heap abstraction, modeling library classes, and underlying intermediate program representation (IR). Often, these variations pose a threat to the validity of the results as the implications of comparing the same analysis implementation in different frameworks are still unexplored. Earlier studies have focused on the precision, soundness, and recall of the algorithms implemented in these frameworks; however, little to no work has been done to evaluate the effects of program representation. In this work, we fill this gap and study the impact of program representation on pointer analysis. Unfortunately, existing metrics are insufficient for such a comparison due to their inability to isolate each aspect of the program representation. Therefore, we define two novel metrics that measure these analyses’ precision after isolating the influence of class-hierarchy and intermediate representation. Our results establish that the minor differences in the class hierarchy and IR do not impact program analysis significantly. Besides, they reveal the sources of unsoundness that aid researchers in developing program analysis.","Prakash, Jyoti; Tiwari, Abhishek; Hammer, Christian",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978870/,276

We examine how supply chains with European semiconductor players—particularly Britain’s Arm Holdings and Dutch ASML—stand to be disrupted. We find that the US-China trade war poses more opportunities and risks than done-deal Brexit in the immediate term. Furthermore, thus far, the Taiwanese semiconductor industry appears to be a beneficiary of the US-China trade dispute, as Taiwan’s leading firms, notably TSMC, are pleasing the USA and China. Yet in doing so, these firms risk their non-alignment strategy backfiring, and having one of the world tech giants reprimanding them, or worse, cutting them off. For now, though, Taiwanese firms, especially TSMC, are such essential providers for both China and the USA, that the foundries continue to expand their relationships with both sides. Longer term, the political uncertainties risk an erosion of access to talent and availability of cross-border supply chains, which puts downward pressure on Taiwan in the globally organized semiconductor industry.","Klingler-Vidra, Robyn; Kuo, Yu Ching",A New Beginning or More of the Same?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979955/,276

It foresaw the creation of a new state institution for the search of the missing, a central registry of all names and a special fund for families. While only some of these promises materialized, the adoption was unprecedented. This chapter discusses the role of missing persons’ families and the process of their state recognition. It presents a case of ‘Optimal Route’ scenario when victim capital can be described as consisting of high salience, authority and resources. It argues that families of Bosnians who went missing during the war were exposed to high levels of external attention because this group included victims whose suffering came to define Bosnian post-war transitional justice: Srebrenica survivors. The Srebrenica genocide of July 1995 not only conferred superior international salience and moral authority upon families of the missing among Bosniaks but Srebrenica victim associations have enhanced their two sources of leverage by huge personal investments in their mobilization resources too.

Tarin, a taro lectin, is considered responsible for the immunomodulatory effects of taro. In the present study, in order to investigate the effects of tarin on bone marrow hematopoietic population, murine cells were stimulated with tarin combined with a highly enriched conditioned medium containing either IL-3 or GM-CSF. Cells challenged with tarin proliferated in a dose-dependent manner, evidenced by the increase in cell density and number of clusters and colonies. Tarin exhibited a cytokine-mimetic effect similar to IL-3 and GM-CSF, increasing granulocytic cell lineage percentages, demonstrated by an increase in the relative percentage of Gr-1+ cells. Tarin does not increase lymphocytic lineages, but phenotyping revealed that the relative percentage of CD3+ cells was increased with a concomitant decrease in CD19+ and IL-7Rα+ cells.

This issue of the American Behavioral Scientist brings together scholarship examining the various ways in which many vulnerable populations are bearing a disproportionate share of the costs of COVID-19. As the articles bring to light, the unequal effects of the pandemic are reverberating along preexisting fault lines and creating new ones. In the economic realm, the rental market emerges during the pandemic as an economic arena of heightened socio-spatial and racial/ethnic disparities. Financial markets are another domain where market mechanisms mask the exploitative relationships between the economically vulnerable and powerful actors. Turning to gender inequalities, across national contexts, women represent an increasingly vulnerable segment of the labor market as the pandemic piles on new burdens of remote schooling and caregiving despite a variety of policy initiatives. Moving from the economic to the digital domain, we see how people with disabilities employ social media to mitigate increased vulnerability stemming from COVID-19. Finally, the key effects of digital vulnerability are heightened because the digitally disadvantaged experience not only informational inequalities but also aggravated bodily manifestations of stress or anxiety related to the pandemic. Each article contributes to our understanding of the larger mosaic of inequality that is being exacerbated by the pandemic. By drawing connections between these different aspects of the social world and the effects of COVID-19, this issue of American Behavioral Scientist advances our understanding of the far-reaching ramifications of the pandemic on vulnerable members of society.","Robinson, Laura; Schulz, Jeremy; Ragnedda, Massimo; Pait, Heloisa; Kwon, K.

54091,The crisis of citizenship in our time,2021-06-10,"Explorative business process management (BPM) is attracting increasing interest in the literature and professional practice. Organizations have recognized that a focus on operational efficiency is no longer sufficient when disruptive forces can make the value proposition of entire processes obsolete. So far, however, research on how to create entirely new processes has remained largely conceptual, leaving it open how explorative BPM can be put into practice. Following the design science research paradigm and situational method engineering, we address this research gap by proposing a method called the Five Diamond Method. This method guides explorative BPM activities by supporting organizations in identifying opportunities from business and technology trends and integrating them into business processes with novel value propositions. The method is evaluated against literature-backed design objectives and competing artifacts, qualitative data gathered from BPM practitioners, as well as a pilot study and two real-world applications. This research provides two contributions. First, the Five Diamond Method broadens the scope of BPM by integrating prescriptive knowledge from innovation management. Second, the method supports capturing emerging opportunities arising from changing customer needs and digital technologies.

However, the chemical structure of this group of drugs poses a hurdle to their delivery, caused by the negative charge, membrane impermeability and instability. For example, siRNA to reduce tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) secretion to reduce inflammatory signals has been successfully delivered by inhalation. In order to increase the effect of the treatment, a co-transport of another anti-inflammatory ingredient was applied. Combining curcumin-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles in nanostructured cylindrical microparticles stabilized by the layer-by-layer technique using polyanionic siRNA against TNF-α was used for demonstration. This system showed aerodynamic properties suited for lung deposition (mass median aerodynamic diameter of 2.85 ± 0.44 µm). Furthermore, these inhalable carriers showed no acute in vitro toxicity tested in both alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages up to 48 h incubation. Ultimately, TNF-α release was significantly reduced by the particles, showing an improved activity co-delivering both drugs using such a drug-delivery system for specific inhibition of TNF-α in the lungs.","Fischer, Thorben; Winter, Inga; Drumm, Robert; Schneider, Marc",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8230201/,276

We also cultured ITP and control peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with recombinant leptin to assess its direct effect on pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine gene expression. A significant increase in leptin was observed in children with active disease compared to controls. A significant inverse correlation of leptin with platelet count was also observed in children with acute ITP. Leptin remained high after treatment with IVIg, whereas steroid treatment lowered leptin below control levels. In remission, leptin was in the control range. Cytokine gene expression was significantly increased in children with acute ITP compared with controls, with highest expression for IFN-γ and IL-10. IVIg/steroid treatment significantly decreased IFN-γ and IL-10 expression. In remission, IFN-γ and IL-10 expression remained low. Addition of leptin to PBMCs isolated from patients in remission resulted in a significant increase in IL-10 gene expression compared to controls. Further experiments with purified T-cells and monocytes identified monocytes as the source of leptin-induced IL-10. We suggest that leptin acts as an active anti-inflammatory agent in childhood ITP by promoting IL-10 secretion by monocytes.","Thomas, Iason; Panagoulias, Ioannis; Aggeletopoulou, Ioanna; Varvarigou, Anastasia; Spiliotis, Bessie E.; Mouzaki, Athanasia",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8306583/,276
56454,Tourism Experience and Construction of Personalized Smart Tourism Program Under Tourist Psychology,2021-07-22,"BACKGROUND: Workplace violence is a common issue worldwide that strikes all professions, and healthcare is one of the most susceptible ones. Verbal and nonverbal miscommunications between healthcare workers and patients are major inducers for violent attacks. AIM: To study the potential impact of verbal and nonverbal miscommunications between the patients and healthcare workers upon workplace violence from the patients' perspectives. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed from November to December 2020. Patients and previously hospitalized patients were asked to complete a self-reported questionnaire that involved items of verbal and nonverbal miscommunication. With the use of a suitable available sample composed of 550 participants, 505 had completed the questionnaire and were included in the study. The data were analyzed by using SPSS version 22 software. RESULTS: 7.2% of the study population reported participating in nonverbal violence and 19.6% participated in verbal violence against healthcare workers. The nonverbal and verbal violence was characteristically displayed by the patients who are male, younger than 30 years old, and bachelor's degree holders. The results of the study demonstrated that the verbal and nonverbal miscommunications between the patients and healthcare workers were the major factors in provoking violent responses from patients. Factors, such as age, gender, and level of education, were significant indicators of the type of patients who were more likely to respond with violence. CONCLUSION: Workplace violence, either verbal or nonverbal, in the health sector is a public health concern in Palestine. The verbal and nonverbal communication skills of healthcare workers should be developed well enough to overcome the effect of miscommunication provoking violent acts from patients and their relatives as well.","Saeedi, Munther; Al-Othman, Nihad; Rabayaa, Maha",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8324345/,276

This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practices of healthcare workers at the Federal Medical Centre, Owo towards LF. METHODS: this was a cross-sectional study among 451 healthcare workers who were enrolled using a simple random sampling technique. Data were collected using a semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaire and analyzed with SPSS version 23. Adequate knowledge, positive attitude, and good practice of LF infection, prevention, and control were determined by the proportion of respondents who scored >80% in each category. Descriptive statistics were done. Associations were explored using Chi-square tests. RESULTS: the mean age of respondents was 37.95±8.43 years, and 169 (37.5%) were doctors. The mean overall knowledge score was 18.33±2.14, and 236 (52.3%) had appropriate knowledge, 109 (24.2%) had a positive attitude, while 351 (77.8%) demonstrated adequate preventive practices towards LFIPC. Laboratory scientists had five times the odds of appropriate knowledge of LF IPC (OR=4.886; 95%CI: 1.580-15.107). Pharmacists had ten times odds of positive attitude towards LF IPC (OR=10.093; 95%CI= 1.055-95.516). Pharmacists had nine times odds of good LF IPC practices (OR=8.755; 95%CI=1.028-74.531). CONCLUSION: disparities in knowledge, attitude, and practices of LF IPC exist among healthcare workers. To strengthen IPC, intervention strategies like training to address such gaps are needed.","Ukwenya, Victor Okoliko; Fuwape, Temiloluwa Adeola; Fadahunsi, Tokunbo Ibukun; Ilesanmi, Olayinka Stephen",Pan Afr Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8308862/,276

57746,Addressing the Challenges to Sustainable Initiatives in Value Chain Flexibility: Implications for Sustainable Development Goals,2021-09-14,"Evidence suggests a large proportion of profitable U.S. firms have low effective tax rates (i.e., an ETR between 0 and 10%). Despite widespread interest in how firms avoid paying taxes, we do not know how most firms attain low ETRs and whether they are primarily benefiting from benign or aggressive tax positions. Using a research design that explicitly examines low ETR firms, we predict and find that the majority are primarily benefiting from a benign tax position: large net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). We also find that large NOLs allow firms to persistently retain low ETRs year after year. In contrast, we find that multinationals and tax haven firms, which should have more opportunities for aggressive tax planning, have a lower probability of attaining a low ETR (relative to domestic and non-tax haven firms). Collectively, these findings suggest that the typical low ETR firm does not incur significant tax risk. Consistent with this, we find that low ETR firms accrue unrecognized tax benefits at a similar rate as firms that pay the statutory tax rate and do not experience higher future tax rate volatility. Overall, the results shed light on the profile of the average low ETR firm and provide evidence that the majority are utilizing large NOLs rather than aggressive tax planning.

These nanoscaffolds have previously been shown to be biocompatible in vitro; in the present study, we wished to evaluate its biocompatibility in an in vivo spinal cord injury model. METHODS Graphene nanoscaffolds were prepared by the mild chemical reduction of graphene oxide. Twenty Wistar rats (19 male and 1 female) underwent hemispinal cord transection at approximately the T2 level. To bridge the lesion, graphene nanoscaffolds with a hydrogel were implanted immediately after spinal cord transection. Control animals were treated with hydrogel matrix alone. Histologic evaluation was performed 3 months after the spinal cord transection to assess in vivo biocompatibility of graphene and to measure the ingrowth of tissue elements adjacent to the graphene nanoscaffold. RESULTS The graphene nanoscaffolds adhered well to the spinal cord tissue. There was no area of pseudocyst around the scaffolds suggestive of cytotoxicity. Instead, histological evaluation showed an ingrowth of connective tissue elements, blood vessels, neurofilaments, and Schwann cells around the graphene nanoscaffolds. CONCLUSIONS Graphene is a nanomaterial that is biocompatible with neurons and may have significant biomedical application. It may provide a scaffold for the ingrowth of regenerating axons after spinal cord injury.","Palejwala, Ali H; Fridley, Jared S; Mata, Javier A; Samuel, Errol L G; Luerssen, Thomas G; Perlaky, Laszlo; Kent, Thomas A; Tour, James M; Jea, Andrew",Surgical neurology international,https://doi.org/10.4103/2152-7806.188905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27625885/,276

Regardless of various efforts, efficient topical ophthalmic drug delivery remains unsolved and, thus, it is extremely necessary to advance the contemporary treatments of ocular disorders affecting the anterior and posterior cavities. Nowadays, the advent of nanotechnology-based multicomponent nanoemulsions for ophthalmic drug delivery has gained popularity due to the enhancement of ocular penetrability, improve bioavailability, increase solubility, and stability of lipophilic drugs. Nanoemulsions are offered the sustained/controlled drug release and increase residence time which depends on the viscosity, compositions, and stabilization process, etc., hence, decrease the instillation frequency and improve patient compliance. Further, due to the nanosized of nanoemulsions, the sterilization process is easy as conventional solutions and cause no blur vision. The review aims to summarizes the various ocular barriers, manufacturing techniques, possible mechanisms to the retention and deep penetration into the eye, and appropriate excipients with their under-lying selection principles to prevent destabilization of nanoemulsions. This review also discusses the characterization parameters of ocular drug delivery to spike the interest of those contemplating a foray in this field.

OBJECTIVE To develop a clinical instrument for evaluating symptoms of COVID-19 mild-to-moderate forms. METHODS COVID-19 patients were recruited from EpiCURA Hospital (Belgium). They completed the COVID-19 Symptom Index (CSI) twice to assess the test-retest reliability. The internal consistency was evaluated with Cronbach's alpha. CSI was completed by healthy subjects to assess the internal validity. Patients completed CSI 6 weeks after the COVID-19 resolution to evaluate the responsiveness to change. RESULTS Ninety-four COVID-19 patients and 55 healthy individuals completed the evaluations. Symptoms associated with the higher severity score were fatigue, headache and myalgia. The Cronbach's alpha value was 0.801, indicating high internal consistency. The test-retest reliability was adequate (rs = 0.535, p = .001). The correlation between CSI total score and SNOT-22 was high (rs = 0.782; p < .001), supporting a high external validity. COVID-19 patients reported significant higher CSI score than healthy individuals, suggesting an adequate internal validity. The mean CSI significantly decreased after the COVID-19 resolution, supporting a high responsiveness to change property.

In these cases, the EZ-Blocker (EZB) may serve as an alternative. The aim of our analysis was to report on the clinical applications and our experience with the EZB for one-lung ventilation in 100 patients undergoing thoracic surgery. METHODS All anesthetic records from patients older than 18 years of age undergoing general anesthesia in the department of thoracic surgery with intraoperative use of an EZB for OLV at the University Hospital of Erlangen in four consecutive years were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Most frequently, EZB was used in difficult airway (27%) and for surgical procedures with high risk for left recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (21%), followed by application in intubated (12%) or tracheostomized (11%) patients. 11% of the patients had an increased risk of gastric regurgitation. Almost all EZBs were placed free of complications (99%). Clinically sufficient lung collapse was achieved in all patients. No serious airway injuries or immediate complications were documented. CONCLUSIONS The EZB is an efficient, easy-to-use and safe airway device and enables OLV in several clinical situations, when conventional DLTs are not feasible or less favorable. Three major applications were depicted from the data: expected difficult airway, surgical procedures with necessity of intraoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring and already intubated or tracheostomized patients.","Moritz, Andreas; Irouschek, Andrea; Birkholz, Torsten; Prottengeier, Johannes; Sirbu, Horia; Schmidt, Joachim",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13019-018-0767-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29940993/,276

However, permanent occlusion goes along with a high fatality. To overcome this drawback we designed a new filament carrying a bowling pin-shaped tip (BP-tip) and compared this with three conventionally tipped filaments. Follow-up periods were 24 h (all groups) and 72 and 120 h in BP-tip group. Ischemic damage and swelling were quantified using silver nitrate staining. Collateral flow via the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) was assessed using selective dye perfusion of the internal carotid artery. Despite a comparable decrease of brain perfusion in all groups, ischemic damage was significantly smaller in BP-tips (p < 0.05). Moreover, BP-tip significantly reduced mortality from 60% to 12.5% and widely spared the occipital region and hypothalamus from ischemic damage. Conventional but not BP-tip filaments induced vascular distortion, measured as gross displacement of the MCA origin, which correlated with occipital infarction size. Accordingly, BP-tip occluded rats showed a significantly better collateral filling of the PCA territory. Ischemic volume significantly increased in BP-tip occlusion at 72 h follow-up. BP-tip filaments offer superior survival in permanent MCA occlusion, while mimicking the course of a malignant stroke in patients.","Shanbhag, Nagesh C; Henning, Robert H; Schilling, Lothar",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep28401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27329690/,276

We propose a new matrix for stem cell-based chondrogenesis using dense fibrin microbeads (FMBs) combined with grounded dehydrothermally crosslinked collagen sponges (micronized collagen). METHODS In this study, MSCs were isolated from bone marrow of transgenic green fluorescent protein C57/Bl mice by FMBs in high yield. After 48 h in slowly rotating suspension culture, micronized collagen was added. RESULTS The cells on the FMBs migrated to the collagen pieces and formed aggregates that developed into cartilage-like structures. Following chondrogenic differentiation, alcian blue staining and collagen type II immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of chondrocytes in the 3D structures. PCR for the expression of aggrecan and collagen type II genes supported these findings. The in vitro structures that formed were used for ectopic subdermal implantation in wild-type C57/Bl mice. However, the chondrogenic markers faded relative to the pre-implant in vitro structures. CONCLUSION We propose that FMBs with micronized collagen could serve as a simple technology for MSC isolation and chondrogenesis as a basis for implantation.","Shainer, Reut; Gaberman, Elena; Levdansky, Lilia; Gorodetsky, Raphael",Regenerative medicine,https://doi.org/10.2217/rme.09.90; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20210585/,276

82316,Beneath the Surface: An Investigation of General Chemistry Students' Study Skills to Predict Course Outcomes.,2021-02-09,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global health issue. This study aimed to explore the clinical characteristics and CT imaging features of patients with COVID-19 on admission. METHODS Consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively recruited to this study from January 2020 to March 2020. According to the disease severity status on admission, patients were divided into two groups, the common group and the severe group. RESULTS Forty-four patients (F/M 20/24) confirmed with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. The most common onset symptom was fever (90.9%), followed by cough (43.2%). As for the laboratory tests, common findings included increased C reactive protein (47.7%) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (43.2%), and decreased lymphocyte (34.1%). Frequency of decreased lymphocyte count and increased lactate dehydrogenase were higher in the severe group (n=14) than in the common group (n=30). About 86% patients showed typical imaging findings of COVID-19 infection including ground-glass opacity with ill-defined margins, air bronchogram, interlobular septal thickening, and consolidation. Lesions mainly located peripherally and subpleurally with diffuse distribution and multiple lung lobes affected. CONCLUSION Fever and cough are the most common onset symptoms of COVID-19. Increased C reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were the most common laboratory findings. Typical signs of chest CT imaging of COVID-19 included ground-glass opacity with ill-defined margins, air bronchogram, interlobular septal thickening, and consolidation.","Liu, Changchun; Cai, Jianping; Zhang, Mengmeng; Li, Huizhen; Liu, Chunyan; Dong, Jian; Dong, Jinghui",Current medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573405617666210218093549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33602105/,276
84133,A Pandemic Crash Course: Learning to Teach Equitably in Synchronous Online Classes.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND It is a tacit assumption that clinically based expertise in laparoscopic tissue manipulation entails skilfulness in angled laparoscope navigation. The main objective of this study was to investigate the relation between these skills. To this end, face and construct validity had to be established for the place arrow (PA) and camera navigation (CN) tasks on the SimSurgery SEP. METHODS Thirty-three novices (no laparoscopy experience) and 33 experienced participants (>50 laparoscopic procedures and familiar with angled laparoscopy) performed both tasks twice, on one of two hardware platforms (SimSurgery SimPack or Xitact/Mentice IHP), and rated the realism and didactic value of SimSurgery SEP on five-point scales. RESULTS Both tasks were rated by the experienced participants as realistic (CN: 3.7; PA: 4.1) and SimSurgery SEP as a user-friendly environment to train basic skills (4.1). Both tasks were performed in less time by the experienced group, with shorter tip trajectories. For both groups jointly, the time to accomplish each task correlated with the tip trajectory and also with the time and tip trajectories of the opposite task (Spearman's correlation, p <or= 0.05). Within the groups however, the performances on both tasks did not always correlate. CONCLUSIONS A correlation was not always found between the performances on the two tasks, which suggests that clinically based expertise in tissue manipulation does not automatically entail skilfulness in angled laparoscope navigation, and vice versa. Training and assessment of basic laparoscopic skills should focus on these tasks independently. More research is needed to better identify the skills and required proficiency levels for different laparoscopic tasks.","Buzink, Sonja N; Botden, Sanne M B I; Heemskerk, Jeroen; Goossens, Richard H M; de Ridder, Huib; Jakimowicz, Jack J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-008-0057-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18626705/,276
88911,Evaluation of the 2020 EAN Virtual Congress: transition from a face-to-face to a virtual meeting.,2020-12-28,"BACKGROUND Tunneled catheters are becoming increasingly used as a permanent dialysis access. Easy way of insertion and good long-term patency make them competitive to fistulas in some groups of patients. METHODS Late complications and survival of 180 tunneled catheters inserted from June 2010 to December 2013 in 171 unselected hemodialysis patients were analyzed. RESULTS The cumulative time of observation was 2103.5 patient-months and median observation was 9 months (range of 0.5-45 months). Only 19 out of 180 catheters were removed due to complications (12 for infections, 4 due to malfunction and 3 because of mechanical damage). Majority of catheters were removed electively: 27 after maturation of arterio-venous fistula (AVF), 4 after kidney transplant, 5 after transfer to peritoneal dialysis and 3 due to the recovery of renal function. At the end of the observation, 58 catheters were still in use and 64 patients had died with functioning catheter. When censored for elective catheter removal and patient death, 88.2% of catheters survived for 1 year. Catheter survival was significantly better in older patients (over 65 years, in comparison to patients < 65 years, p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS Nearly 90% of all inserted catheters gave reliable dialysis access as long as it was needed. Among them, over 30% of the inserted catheters were in use at the end of the observation period, and over 30% of patients had died with a functioning catheter. The results of tunneled catheters survival are encouraging and they should be taken into consideration during decision-making on vascular access, especially in the older patients.","Weber, Ewa; Liberek, Tomasz; Wołyniec, Wojciech; Gruszecki, Marcin; Rutkowski, Bolesław",Acta biochimica Polonica,https://doi.org/10.18388/abp.2015_1111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26836500/,276

105828,Fast Outcome Categorization of the Upper Limb After Stroke.,2021-10-04,"INTRODUCTION Rubella virus (RV) was eliminated in the United States in 2004, although a small portion of the population fails to develop long-term immunity against RV even after two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. We hypothesized that inherent biological differences in cytokine and chemokine signaling likely govern an individual's response to a third dose of the vaccine. METHODS Healthy young women (n = 97) were selected as study participants if they had either low or high extremes of RV-specific antibody titer after two previous doses of MMR vaccine. We measured cytokine and chemokine secretion from RV-stimulated PBMCs before and 28 days after they received a third dose of MMR vaccine and assessed correlations with humoral immune response outcomes. RESULTS High and low antibody vaccine responders exhibited a strong pro-inflammatory cellular response, with an underlying Th1-associated signature (IL-2, IFN-γ, MIP-1β, IP-10) and suppressed production of most Th2-associated cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13). IL-10 and IL-4 exhibited significant negative associations with neutralizing antibody titers and memory B cell ELISpot responses among low vaccine responders. CONCLUSION IL-4 and IL-10 signaling pathways may be potential targets for understanding and improving the immune response to rubella vaccination or for designing new vaccines that induce more durable immunity.","Crooke, Stephen N; Ovsyannikova, Inna G; Kennedy, Richard B; Warner, Nathaniel D; Poland, Gregory A",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.10.071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33158591/,276

Methods We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent MAT using Penumbra 4 or 5 MAX reperfusion catheters for the treatment of acute MCA occlusion between January 2012 and December 2015. A migrated thrombus was defined as distal migration greater than ≥1 cm on initial cerebral angiography compared with preprocedural angiographic findings. We evaluated immediate angiographic results and clinical outcomes through a review of electronic medical records and compared clinical outcomes between migrated and non-migrated MCA occlusions. Results During this period, 98 patients underwent MAT using Penumbra catheters for treatment of acute MCA occlusions. Of these, 19 (19.4%) had a migrated MCA thrombus on initial cerebral angiography compared with preprocedural angiographic findings. The overall rate of successful recanalization (TICI grade ≥ 2b) was 90.8%. The rate of successful recanalization in the migrated thrombus group was 94.7% (18/19). Overall procedure time for recanalization in the migrated thrombus group was significantly shorter than that in the non-migrated thrombus group ( p = 0.001). Although the difference was not significant, there was a trend toward more favorable clinical outcomes in the migrated thrombus group compared to the non-migrated thrombus groups (78.9% versus 60.8%, p = 0.231). Conclusion MAT appears to be safe and can achieve a high rate of successful recanalization and favorable clinical outcomes with short procedure time and without serious complications in patients with acute migrated MCA occlusion.","Baik, Sung Hyun; Kwak, Hyo Sung; Hwang, Seung Bae; Chung, Gyung Ho","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019916686735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28304203/,276

120795,Integrating online learning management systems to dental simulation clinics - An example of blended learning in pediatric dentistry.,2020-08-12,"Six poliovirus-neutralizing Fabs were recovered from a combinatorial Fab phage display library constructed from bone marrow-derived lymphocytes of immunized chimpanzees. The chimeric chimpanzee-human full-length IgGs (hereinafter called monoclonal antibodies [MAbs]) were generated by combining a chimpanzee IgG light chain and a variable domain of heavy chain with a human constant Fc region. The six MAbs neutralized vaccine strains and virulent strains of poliovirus. Five MAbs were serotype specific, while one MAb cross-neutralized serotypes 1 and 2. Epitope mapping performed by selecting and sequencing antibody-resistant viral variants indicated that the cross-neutralizing MAb bound between antigenic sites 1 and 2, thereby covering the canyon region containing the receptor-binding site. Another serotype 1-specific MAb recognized a region located between antigenic sites 2 and 3 that included parts of capsid proteins VP1 and VP3. Both serotype 2-specific antibodies recognized antigenic site 1. No escape mutants to serotype 3-specific MAbs could be generated. The administration of a serotype 1-specific MAb to transgenic mice susceptible to poliovirus at a dose of 5 μg/mouse completely protected them from paralysis after challenge with a lethal dose of wild-type poliovirus. Moreover, MAb injection 6 or 12 h after virus infection provided significant protection. The MAbs described here could be tested in clinical trials to determine whether they might be useful for treatment of immunocompromised chronic virus excretors and for emergency protection of contacts of a paralytic poliomyelitis case.","Chen, Zhaochun; Chumakov, Konstantin; Dragunsky, Eugenia; Kouiavskaia, Diana; Makiya, Michelle; Neverov, Alexander; Rezapkin, Gennady; Sebrell, Andrew; Purcell, Robert",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02553-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21345966/,276

Our study describes the neuropathology and the diagnostic features of 26 cases of FIP in domestic cats. The average age of affected individuals was 11.8 mo, and there was no sex or breed predisposition. Clinical neurologic signs were noted in 22 cases, and rabies was clinically suspected in 11 cases. Twenty cats had lesions in multiple organs, and 6 cats had lesions only in the brain. Gross neuropathologic changes occurred in 15 cases and consisted of hydrocephalus (10 cases), cerebellar herniation through the foramen magnum (6 cases), cerebral swelling with flattening of gyri (2 cases), and accumulation of fibrin within ventricles (2 cases) or leptomeninges (1 case). Histologically, 3 main distinct distributions of neuropathologic changes were observed, namely periventricular encephalitis (12 cases), rhombencephalitis (8 cases), and diffuse leptomeningitis with superficial encephalitis (6 cases). Fresh tissue samples were submitted for fluorescent antibody testing (FAT) after autopsy in 17 cases, and positive results were found in only 7 cases. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for feline coronavirus confirmed the diagnosis in all 26 cases. IHC appears to be a more sensitive and reliable test for confirmation of FIP than is FAT.","Rissi, Daniel R","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638718755833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29411701/,276

To investigate feasibility of multiport and laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) nonischemic laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (NI-LPN) utilizing bipolar radiofrequency coagulator. Methods. Multicenter retrospective review of 60 patients (46 multiport/14 LESS) undergoing NI-LPN between 4/2006 and 9/2009. Multiport and LESS NI-LPN utilized Habib 4X bipolar radiofrequency coagulator to form a hemostatic zone followed by nonischemic tumor excision and renorrhaphy. Demographics, tumor/perioperative characteristics, and outcomes were analyzed. Results. 59/60 (98.3%) successfully underwent NI-LPN. Mean tumor size was 2.35 cm. Mean operative time was 160.0 minutes. Mean estimated blood loss was 131.4 mL. Preoperative/postoperative creatinine (mg/dL) was 1.02/1.07 (P = .471). All had negative margins. 12 (20%) patients developed complications. 3 (5%) developed urine leaks. No differences between multiport and LESS-PN were noted as regards demographics, tumor size, outcomes, and complications. Conclusion.

Investigating the Adoption Intention of COVID-19 Contact-Tracing Technology Using an Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Model.,2020-10-05,"BACKGROUND High-resolution, multiphase, computed tomography (CT) is a standard preoperative test prior to pancreatectomy, yet the clinical significance of routinely reported findings remains unknown. METHODS We identified patients who underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy for a periampullary adenocarcinoma (PA) over the previous 5 years and had a pancreas protocol CT at our institution. Clinicopathologic implications of reported CT findings were evaluated. RESULTS There were 155 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) and 47 non-pancreatic PAs. No mass was visualized on CT in 6 % of PDAs and 23 % of non-pancreatic PA. A size discrepancy of ≥1 cm between radiographic and pathologic tumor diameters was observed in 40 % of PAs, with CT underestimating the size in most instances (75 %). Radiographically enlarged lymph nodes were not associated with true lymph node metastases in PDAs (70 % lymph node positive cases were enlarged on CT vs 74 % lymph node negative, p = 0.5), but were associated with a preoperatively placed biliary endoprosthesis (63 % with endoprosthesis were enlarged vs 37 % no endoprosthesis, p = 0.013). Major visceral vessel involvement on CT was not associated with a vascular resection (3 % with CT vessel involvement vs 2 % without, p = 0.8) or a positive uncinate resection margin (24 vs 20 %, respectively, p = 0.6). DISCUSSION While dedicated pancreas protocol CT provides unprecedented detail, the test may lead to overinterpretation of the extent of disease in some instances. A radiographic suggestion of enlarged lymph nodes and vascular involvement does not necessarily preclude exploration with curative intent. CTs with local disease should be reported in an objective template and carefully reviewed by a multidisciplinary group of surgeons, radiologists, and oncologists to avoid missing an opportunity for neoadjuvant therapy or cure by resection.","Fong, Zhi Ven; Tan, Wei Phin; Lavu, Harish; Kennedy, Eugene P; Mitchell, Donald G; Koniaris, Leonidas G; Sauter, Patricia K; Rosato, Ernest L; Yeo, Charles J; Winter, Jordan M",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-013-2181-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23553385/,276

Whether propofol has amelioration property for NP and neuroinflammation remains unexplored. The present study was arranged to probe the role of propofol in the mitigation of NP and neuroinflammation in rats and underlying mechanisms. METHODS Rats were randomly classified into the following groups: Model, Sham, Control, Propofol, GW9662, and Saline groups. The radiant heat stimulation was used to measure paw withdrawal latency (PWL), and mechanical stimulation was employed to detect paw withdrawal threshold (PWT). Subsequently, the expression of GFAP was assessed by immunofluorescence to reflect the activation of astrocyte. qRT-PCR and Western blot were utilized for the performance of mRNA and protein expression levels of PPAR γ as well as inflammation factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). RESULTS Pentobarbital sodium anesthesia significantly shortened the PWL and PWT, suppressed PPAR γ expression in rats in addition to elevating astrocyte activation and inflammation response. Propofol treatment attenuated the NP of rats as evidenced by restrained astrocyte activation level and inflammation factor levels. Rats treated with propofol had markedly heightened PPAR γ expression. PPAR γ exposure ameliorated NP and inflammation degree, which demonstrated by elevated astrocyte activation and inflammation levels as well as suppressed PWL and PWT in rats injected with PPAR γ inhibitor. Besides, PPAR γ decreased the expression level of β-catenin. CONCLUSION Propofol ameliorates NP and neuroinflammation of rats by up-regulating PPAR γ expression to block the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.","Jiang, Peng; Jiang, Qun; Yan, Yan; Hou, Zhiqi; Luo, Dexing",Neurological research,https://doi.org/10.1080/01616412.2020.1823107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985377/,276

METHODS A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted between April and May 2020. An on-line questionnaire was used to collect the data. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to evaluate the depression levels of nursing students. RESULTS Seven hundred and eighty-seven nursing students participated in the study out of which 83.9% were of female gender, 92.9% single and 94.7% lived with others. One third of the nursing student population experienced mild depression, with higher depression levels noted for Spanish students (59.1%) followed by Albanian (34.5%) and Greek (21.8%) students. Multivariate linear regression analysis identified that Spanish students experienced more depression than Greek and Albanian (p < 0.001). Also, decreased age was associated with increased depression.

Patients may have an increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). Our objective was to analyze clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of patients with ischemic CVA during the pandemic peak in our region, in order to identify atypical presentations. METHODS We performed a cross-sectional analysis of patients admitted under code-stroke protocol to our center with a final diagnosis of ischemic brain infarction. We analyzed the main imaging and demographic characteristics and reviewed neuroimaging for atypical presentations. RESULTS One-hundred patients with confirmed ischemic CVA were included. Nineteen had positive polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. These patients had a lower prevalence of proximal arterial occlusion on imaging, higher in-hospital mortality, and worse baseline disability. No differences were identified in affected vascular territory, volume of infarction, initial CT stroke score, prevalence of hemorrhagic transformation, gender, age, cardiovascular risk factors, time to admission, symptom severity on entry, or decision to treat with thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. Prevalence of COVID-19 in our code-stroke sample was higher than that for our province during this time period. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 group had more in-hospital mortality, less proximal arterial occlusion on CT or MR angiography, and lower baseline modified Rankin Scale score. We suggest a possibly higher proportion of microangiopathic involvement or undetected distal large-vessel occlusion in the COVID-19 stroke group. Excess mortality was explained by severe respiratory failure. Otherwise, stroke patients with COVID-19 did not differ demographically or clinically from those without the illness.","Naval-Baudin, Pablo; Rodriguez Caamaño, Isabel; Rubio-Maicas, Cecilia; Pons-Escoda, Albert; Fernández Viñas, Maria Montserrat; Nuñez, Ana; Cardona, Pere; Majos, Carles; Cos, Monica; Calvo, Nahum",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,https://doi.org/10.1111/jon.12790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32986907/,276

160376,Platelet glycoprotein Ib alpha chain as a putative therapeutic target for juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a Mendelian randomization study.,2020-10-20,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) can occur despite use of tidal volume (VT) limited to 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight, especially in patients with a smaller aerated compartment (i.e. the baby lung) in which, indeed, tidal ventilation takes place. Because respiratory system static compliance (CRS) is mostly affected by the volume of the baby lung, the ratio VT/CRS (i.e. the driving pressure, ΔP) may potentially help tailoring interventions on VT setting. RECENT FINDINGS Driving pressure is the ventilatory variable most strongly associated with changes in survival and has been shown to be the key mediator of the effects of mechanical ventilation on outcome in the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Observational data suggest an increased risk of death for patients with ΔP more than 14 cmH2O, but a well tolerated threshold for this parameter has yet to be identified. Prone position along with simple ventilatory adjustments to facilitate CO2 clearance may help reduce ΔP in isocapnic conditions. The safety and feasibility of low-flow extracorporeal CO2 removal in enhancing further reduction in VT and ΔP are currently being investigated. SUMMARY Driving pressure is a bedside available parameter that may help identify patients prone to develop VILI and at increased risk of death. No study had prospectively evaluated whether interventions on ΔP may provide a relevant clinical benefit, but it appears physiologically sound to try titrating VT to minimize ΔP, especially when it is higher than 14 cmH2O and when it has minimal costs in terms of CO2 clearance.","Grieco, Domenico L; Chen, Lu; Dres, Martin; Brochard, Laurent",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27875410/,276

METHODS Retrospective review of patients with solid organ transplant with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result from nasopharyngeal specimens admitted to the hospital between 3/13/2020 and 5/15/2020. RESULTS Twenty-one percent of solid organ transplant recipients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR detected ≥ 20 days after symptom onset (or after first positive test among asymptomatic individuals) had a low cycle threshold (i.e. high viral load). The majority of these patients were asymptomatic or symptomatically improved. CONCLUSIONS Solid organ transplant recipients may have prolonged high viral burden of SARS-CoV-2. Further data are needed to understand whether cycle threshold data can help inform strategies for prevention of healthcare-associated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and for appropriate discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions.,"Theodore, Deborah A; Greendyke, William G; Miko, Benjamin; Whittier, Susan; Green, Daniel A; Shoucri, Sherif; Verna, Elizabeth C; Zucker, Jason; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E; Aaron, Justin G; Scully, Brian E; Saiman, Lisa; Pereira, Marcus; Furuya, E Yoko",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606483/,276

The main challenges to the system come from trade wars that could lead to a crisis in the international system of trade regulation, a decrease in the effectiveness of public policy instruments, and a deterioration in the dynamics of global economic growth. An important factor leading to a slowdown in the global economy in 2020 will also be the coronavirus pandemic, although it is difficult, in the first half of 2020, to assess its final impact. The combination of these negative factors, coupled with the unresolved problems of the 2008 global financial crisis, significantly increases the likelihood of a new global economic crisis which could surpass the Great Depression of the 1930s. This study systematizes the main forecasts by international organizations and analytical agencies for the growth of the world economy and considers various theoretical concepts to identify the symptoms of the impending crisis. Ultimately, this article offers options for reducing the negative impact of the crisis on Russia.

Social distancing measures imposed the interruption of face-to-face activities besides the implementation of remote work and online classes. For safe and gradual return, the monitoring of individuals, quick detection of infection, contact tracing, and isolation of those infected became essential. In this sense, we developed strategies to face the pandemic at the Federal University of Lavras (UFLA) - Brazil. A Telemedicine Program (TeleCovid) and the assemblage of a laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis (LabCovid) were essential measures for monitoring, preventing, and controlling outbreaks at the university. TeleCovid works with a team of students who guide and answer questions regarding COVID-19 and, when necessary, make the referral for online consultation with medical professionals. In the suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the doctor refers the patient for testing at LabCovid. LabCovid performs the sample collection using nasal swabs, followed by processing samples by the RT-qPCR method. We have placed all positive patients in isolation and tested their contacts.

The gap in the employment rate between Australians with and without disability is likely to widen, given the entrenched disadvantage of people with disability in the job market. For many, it will compound existing health and economic vulnerabilities. This scenario is troubling from both a human rights and an economic perspective. In this paper, we examine the interface of two policy instruments intended to improve the prospects of people with disability finding and keeping employment in Australia – Disability Employment Services and the National Disability Insurance Scheme – in the lead up to and in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from three studies conducted between 2018 and 2020 reveal these instruments are not mutually reinforcing. With a 10-year National Disability Employment Strategy (NDES) in development under federal government oversight, we argue that more concerted and targeted effort from these services and broader public policies and programs is needed to ensure Australians with disability are not sidelined in the labour market in the wake of the pandemic. © 2021 Institute of Public Administration Australia","Olney, S.; Devine, A.; Karanikolas, P.; Dimov, S.; Malbon, J.; Katsikis, G.",Australian Journal of Public Administration,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8500.12500,276

One key difficulty in managing the outbreak at the national level is that due to the US’ diversity, geographic spread, and economic inequality, the COVID-19 pandemic in the US acts more as a series of diverse regional outbreaks rather than a synchronized homogeneous one. Method: In order to determine how to assess regional risk related to COVID-19, a two-phase modeling approach is developed while considering demographic and economic criteria. First, an unsupervised clustering technique, specifically [Formula Omitted]-means, is employed to group US counties based on demographic and economic similarities. Then, time series forecasting of each cluster of counties is developed to assess the short-run viral transmissibility risk. Results: To this end, we test ARIMA and Seasonal Trend Random Walk forecasts to determine which is more appropriate for modeling the spread and lethality of COVID-19. From our analysis, we then utilize the superior ARIMA models to forecast future COVID-19 trends in the clusters, and present the areas in the US which have the highest COVID-19 related risk heading into the winter of 2020. Conclusion: Including sub-national socioeconomic characteristics to data-driven COVID-19 infection and fatality forecasts may play a key role in assessing the risk associated with changes in infection patterns at the national level.","Lucic, MichaelC Hakim Ghazzai Lipizzi Carlo Massoud Yehia",IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology,https://doi.org/10.1109/ojemb.2021.3096135,276

The most consistently mentioned unhelpful narratives hinge on an understanding of the pandemic as an act of God. Although there are several possible contextual explanations for this resistance to understand the pandemic as divine action, an analysis of the data shows that it is grounded in a desire to maintain (1) a space for the pandemic, the suffering, and the virus that caused it to be understood as part of creation and (2) focus on human agency and responsibility as the appropriate response to the pandemic. I argue that the strong resistance among the bishops interviewed to a narrative of divine punishment in particular is ultimately grounded in a desire to disable the blunt but effective tool of making moral judgments in the name of divine authority that regularly follow in the wake of global disasters.","Kamwendo, Zara Thokozani",Zygon®,https://doi.org/10.1111/zygo.12732,276

It belongs to the Coronaviridae family and has been plagued the world since the end of 2019. Viral infection to the lungs causes fluid filling and breathing difficulties, which leads to pneumonia. Pneumonia progresses to ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), in which fluid fills the air sac and seeps from the pulmonary veins. In the current scenario, several vaccines have been used to control the pandemic worldwide. Even though vaccines are available and their effectiveness is short, it may be helpful to curb the pandemic, but long-term protection is inevitable when we look for other options. Plants have diversified components such as primary and secondary metabolites. These molecules show several activities such as anti-microbial, anti-cancer, anti-helminthic. In addition, these molecules have good binding ability to the SARS-CoV-2 virus proteins such as RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), Mpro (Main Protease), etc. Therefore, these herbal molecules could probably be used to control the COVID-19. However, pre-requisite tests, such as cytotoxicity, in vivo, and human experimental studies, are required before plant molecules can be used as potent drugs. Plant metabolites such as alkaloids, isoquinoline ß-carboline, and quinoline alkaloids such as skimmianine, quinine, cinchonine, and dictamine are present in plants and used in a traditional medicinal system.

165539,An educational proposal for students' experimentation in a distance learning environment,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the internal modification and the 3′ tail. Functional investigation of the unknown ORFs and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Highlights We provide a high-resolution map of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome using nanopore direct RNA sequencing and DNA nanoball sequencing.

Even prior to the pandemic, the Indian economy was marked by a slowdown of economic growth and record increases in unemployment and poverty. Thus, India's capacity to deal with a new crisis was weak when the pandemic hit in March 2020. The economic crisis after March 2020 affected all the sectors of the Indian economy. In agriculture, farmers were faced with broken supply chains, lack of market outlets, poor demand and falling output prices. In industry, micro and small enterprises were the most acutely affected. The crisis led to a loss of employment to the tune of at least 15 million. Using an Input-Output (I-O) framework, we create four scenarios of losses to the Indian economy. We estimate that India's gdp growth rate in 2020-2021 may range from -4.3% to -15%. The government's economic response till October 2020 was seriously deficient on demand side interventions. The government was hesitant to expand budgetary spending because it feared a rise in fiscal deficit. Given this fiscal stance of policy, the chances of an early revival in the Indian economy appear dismal.","Ramakumar, R.; Kanitkar, T.",Investigacion Economica,https://doi.org/10.22201/fe.01851667p.2021.315.76845,276

165774,Assuring long-term operational resilience in a pandemic: Lessons learned from COVID-19,2021,"The aviation industry has grown rapidly worldwide and is struggling against intense competition. Especially in Thailand, the compound annual growth rate of passengers traveling by air has increased continuously over the past decade. Unfortunately, during the past two years, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe economic crises for nearly all businesses and industries, including the aviation industry and especially for passenger airlines whose number of customers has decreased astoundingly due to travel restriction. To maintain business stability, therefore, airlines must build customer loyalty to survive in times of crisis. This study thus examines critical factors’ impact on airline loyalty by using a Bayesian network (BN) derived from a structural equation modeling (SEM). The study integrates the SEM and BN to refine causal relationships between critical factors, identified as critical pathways. Findings reveal that customer satisfaction and customer trust, followed by perceived value, dramatically influence customer loyalty and so are considered priorities for building airlines’ customer loyalty. This study also recommends practical strategies and policies to improve customer loyalty amid the competitive airline business during and after the COVID-19 era. © 2021 by the authors.

This is important for prediction and understanding of disease causing mutations, and for protein stabilization and design. Using yeast surface display of a saturation mutagenesis library of the bacterial toxin CcdB, we probe the relationship between ligand binding and expression level of displayed protein, with in vivo solubility in E.coli and in vitro thermal stability. We find that both the stability and solubility correlate well with the total amount of active protein on the yeast cell surface but not with total amount of expressed protein. We coupled FACS and deep sequencing to reconstruct the binding and expression mean fluorescent intensity of each mutant. The reconstructed mean fluorescence intensity (MFIseq) was used to differentiate between buried site, exposed non active-site and exposed active-site positions with high accuracy. The MFIseq was also used as a criterion to identify destabilized as well as stabilized mutants in the library, and to predict the melting temperatures of destabilized mutants. These predictions were experimentally validated and were more accurate than those of various computational predictors. The approach was extended to successfully identify buried and active-site residues in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting it has general applicability.","Ahmed, Shahbaz; Manjunath, Kavyashree; Varadarajan, Raghavan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.31.446445,276
166507,Industry Leaders’ Perceptions of Residential Wood Pellet Technology Diffusion in the Northeastern U.S,2021,"Natural infections and vaccination with a pathogen typically stimulates the production of potent antibodies specific for the pathogen through a Darwinian evolutionary process known as affinity maturation. Such antibodies provide protection against reinfection by the same strain of a pathogen. A highly mutable virus, like HIV or influenza, evades recognition by these strain-specific antibodies via the emergence of new mutant strains. A vaccine that elicits antibodies that can bind to many diverse strains of the virus – known as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) – could protect against highly mutable pathogens. Despite much work, the mechanisms by which bnAbs emerge remain uncertain. Using a computational model of affinity maturation, we studied a wide variety of vaccination strategies. Our results suggest that an effective strategy to maximize bnAb evolution is through a sequential immunization protocol, wherein each new immunization optimally increases the pressure on the immune system to target conserved antigenic sites, thus conferring breadth. We describe the mechanisms underlying why sequentially driving the immune system increasingly further from equilibrium, in an optimal fashion, is effective. The optimal protocol allows many evolving B cells to become bnAbs via diverse evolutionary paths. Significance Statement The global health burden could be substantially alleviated by the creation of universal vaccines against highly mutable pathogens like HIV and influenza. Broadly-neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are encouraging targets for such vaccines, because they can bind to diverse strains of highly mutable pathogens. BnAbs typically develop only rarely upon natural infection, after the immune system has been exposed to many mutated versions of a pathogen. Thus, sequentially administering multiple different pathogen-like proteins (antigens) is a promising strategy to elicit bnAbs through vaccination. However, it remains unclear how best to design and administer these antigens. We explore this matter using physics-based simulations, and provide new mechanistic insights into antibody evolution that could guide the creation of universal vaccines against highly mutable pathogens.","Sprenger, Kayla G.; Louveau, Joy E.; Chakraborty, Arup K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.04.894857,276
166535,Identifying Covid-19 Impact on Peruvian Mental Health During Lockdown Using Social Network,2021,"The control of epidemic spreading is essential to avoid potential fatal consequences and also, to lessen unforeseen socio-economic impact. The need for effective control is exemplified during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, which has inflicted near to a thousand deaths as well as bankruptcies of airlines and related businesses. In this article, we examine the efficacy of control strategies on the propagation of infectious diseases based on removing connections within real world airline network with the associated economic and social costs taken into account through defining appropriate quantitative measures. We uncover the surprising results that removing less busy connections can be far more effective in hindering the spread of the disease than removing the more popular connections. Since disconnecting the less popular routes tend to incur less socio-economic cost, our finding suggests the possibility of trading minimal reduction in connectivity of an important hub with efficiencies in epidemic control. In particular, we demonstrate the performance of various local epidemic control strategies, and show how our approach can predict their cost effectiveness through the spreading control characteristics.","Chung, N.

166869,Filipino generation z on mobile legends during covid-19: A determination of playtime and satisfaction,2021,"The aims of nursing training include not only mastering skills but also fostering the competence to make decisions for problem solving. In prenatal education, cultivating nurses' knowledge and competence of vaccine administration is a crucial issue for protecting pregnant women and newborns from infection. Therefore, obstetric vaccination knowledge has become a basic and essential training program for nursing students. However, most of these training programs are given via the lecture-based teaching approach with skills practice, providing students with few opportunities to think deeply about the relevant issues owing to the lack of interaction and context. This could have a negative impact on their learning effectiveness and clinical judgment. To address this problem, a mobile chatbot-based learning approach is proposed in this study to enable students to learn and think deeply in the contexts of handling obstetric vaccine cases via interacting with the chatbot. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was implemented. Two classes of 36 students from a university in northern Taiwan were recruited as participants. One class was the experimental group learning with the proposed approach, while the other class was the control group learning with the conventional approach (ie, giving lectures to explain the instructional content and training cases). The results indicate that applying a mobile chatbot for learning can enhance nursing students' learning achievement and self-efficacy. In addition, based on the analysis of the interview results, students generally believed that learning through the mobile chatbot was able to promote their self-efficacy as well as their learning engagement and performance.

Among the various AI systems, the potential of chatbots has been highlighted by researchers owing to the user-friendly interface developed using the natural language processing (NLP) technology. Few studies using AI chatbots in professional training have been conducted. What this paper adds In this study, a mobile chatbot was used in a nursing training program to enhance students' learning achievement and self-efficacy for handling vaccine cases. The mobile chatbot significantly improved the students' learning achievement and self-efficacy in comparison with the conventional learning approach in the vaccine training program. From the interview results, it was found that the students generally believed that the mobile chatbot was able to promote their self-efficacy as well as learning engagement and performances in the vaccine training program. Implications for practice and/or policy Mobile chatbots have great potential for professional training owing to their convenient and user-friendly features. It would be worth applying mobile chatbots as well as other NLP-based applications to other professional training programs in the future. © 2021 British Educational Research Association.","Chang, C.

167295,The implementation of physics learning through online mode during pandemic covid-19 using metacognitive knowledge-based materials,2021,"Abstract Sustainability has been a major concern of today’s manufacturing industries. Various efforts have been made to improve the productivity and performance of machining. It is always aimed to reduce the heat generated during machining by various cooling and lubrication approaches. In the present work, efforts have been made to assess the effectiveness of minimum quantity lubrication and solid lubricants in machining. Experiments have been performed under MQL and MQSL environment with selected flow rate (300 ml/hr), 20 wt% of calcium fluoride (CaF2) and 10µm particle size of solid lubricant and results are compared with dry and flood cooling environment. The process performance is observed by measuring surface roughness produced, tool flank wear, the microhardness of machined workpiece, and forms of the chip produced. Results revealed the superiority of lubricant mixture applied in form of MQSL due to enhanced lubricating properties imparted by solid lubricant added with MQL.","Makhesana, Mayurkumar A.; Patel, K.

During the lockdown period, the Department of Health carried out a massive information dissemination campaign about COVID-19. Thus, the researchers want to determine the knowledge, attitude and practices of the students about the COVID-19 during the Luzon lockdown. A descriptive research design and purposive sampling were used. A questionnaire was utilized to collect data composed of the profile, questions regarding their knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19 and their source of knowledge. Permission to conduct and informed consent was obtained. Data were analyzed using various statistical tools. The majority of the respondents had well to very good knowledge of COVID-19 and their source of knowledge was mainly from television and the internet. They also had a very positive attitude and they practice the different ways to prevent COVID-19. The difference between their gender and family income to their knowledge about COVID-19 was significant. Therefore, an intensified campaign should be done to reach those individuals who have limited access to television and the internet and help them to have a positive attitude and correct practices towards COVID-19. © 2021, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

167422,The effects of COVID-19 on Andalusian tourism and aviation sector,2021,"Background The transmission role of SARS-Cov-2 infected persons who develop symptoms post testing (pre symptomatics) or not at all throughout the course of positivity (asymptomatics) is unknown. We carried out a systematic review of available evidence to determine whether they were infectious or not and if so for how long and their probable contribution to the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Methods We searched LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 databases and reference lists of included studies. Search terms were COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, transmission, asymptomatic, presymptomatic and appropriate synonyms. Searches were carried out to 31 March 2021. We included studies on people exposed to SARS CoV-2 within 2-14 days (incubation time) of close contact or suspected community or institutional exposure to index asymptomatic (at the time of observation) infected individuals, as defined in the study. We included studies with a proven or hypothesised chain of transmission with secondary case infected based on fulfilling a confirmed or probable case definition and confirmation of infectiousness and transmission outcome based either on serial PCR cycle threshold readings or viral culture or gene sequencing or any combination thereof and adequate follow up. We assessed the reliability of symptom and sign survey compatible with contemporary knowledge and extracted documentation of the likelihood of transmission, presence of replicating virus and/or documentation of phylodynamics (genetic sequence lineage) and/or adequate follow-up and reporting of symptoms and signs. We wrote to all included studies corresponding authors to request further details and assessed likelihood of transmission using adapted causality criteria. Results We included 18 studies from a variety of settings. Because of the current lack of standardized methodology and clear reporting criteria there was substantial methodological variation in transmission studies. Asymptomatic prevalence at the time of initial testing varied from 12.5% to 100% and of these 6% to 100% were pre-symptomatic cases, depending on the setting and the methods of case ascertainment and the population. Nursing/care home facilities reported high rates of presymptomatic: 50% - 100% (n=3 studies). Fifteen studies were classified as high risk and three studies at moderate risk of symptom ascertainment bias. In practice, this assessment means that high-risk studies may be less likely to distinguish between pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Six of the asymptomatic studies and four presymptomatic studies reported growing infectious virus although the data was too sparse to determine duration of infectiousness. Three studies were judged as providing possible and three of probable/likely evidence of asymptomatic transmission of SARs-CoV-2. Five studies provided evidence of possible and two of probable/likely presymptomatic transmission of SARs-CoV-2. Author response rate was 100%. Conclusions Reliable studies included here provide probable evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Single point in time estimates and binary PCR testing alone cannot provide reliable information on symptom status and information on infectivity. The number of studies and asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases eligible for inclusion was low, with more data and international standardisation of methods needed to further reduce uncertainty.","Jefferson, T.; Spencer, E.

168334,Conflicting logics for crisis management in tourism,2021,"In this paper, we present research on CoPI4P (Community of Practice & Interest for Purpose) communities that consist of knowledge and creative workers in domains such as education, environmentalism, inter-disciplinary research, engaged art, and practice F2V (face-to-virtual) processes, i.e. processes that consist of both face-toface and virtual (online) activities. Standards and methods for modeling business processes have successfully solved various crucial problems, such as providing boundary objects (or a common language) between business analysts, domain experts, process performers and business solutions developers. Performers can execute business processes with standards that support the execution of such processes. However, for CoPI4P communities, BPM standards 1) require additional domain specialization and 2) are either too imperative, or fail to provide enough guidance. This paper identifies these challenges and provides partial solutions applicable to modeling and supporting CoPI4P communities and the corresponding F2V business processes. In addition, results of focus groups interviews and surveys are provided that shed light, notably, on the way CoPI4P communities have been impacted by COVID-19 and how they have coped with digital disruptions to their working models. Our contribution to business processes management lies in researching and identifying the peculiarities of such communities and their workflows, followed by interventions in the BPM, and particularly the BPMN, domain. We then propose a toolset of BPMN extensions required to match the observed F2V workflows and thus to digitalize CoPI4P business models. In this context, we introduce the notion of sub-process palettes as a means to reduce the rigidity, and introduce personalization, of processes.","Rudan, S.; Moller-Pedersen, B.",Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development,https://doi.org/10.5220/0010349203500361,276

The implementation of the new normal itself requires more attention in terms of the readiness of a region to implement the program. Determination of these areas can be done using the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process(AHP) and fuzzy technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution(TOPSIS) methods. Fuzzy AHP is used to determine the weight of the existing criteria, while Fuzzy TOPSIS is used to determine the safest area and is ready to implement the new normal.

However, data about factors associated with vaccine hesitancy and the impact of mental health and/or substance use (MHSU) issues on vaccine uptake are currently not available. The goal of this study was to explore factors, particularly MHSU factors, that impact COVID-19 vaccination intentions in Ontario, Canada. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional survey with recruitment based on age, gender, and geographical location (to ensure a representative population of Ontario), was conducted in February 2021. Multinomial logistic regression was used to test the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination status and plans and sociodemographic background, social support, anxiety about contracting COVID-19, and MHSU concerns. Results: Of the total sample of 2528 respondents, 1932 (76.4%) were vaccine ready, 381 (15.1%) were hesitant, and 181 (7.1%) were resistant. Significant independent predictors of vaccine hesitancy compared with vaccine readiness included younger age (OR=2.11, 95%CI=1.62-2.74), female gender (OR=1.36, 95%CI=1.06-1.74), Black ethnicity (OR=2.11, 95%CI=1.19-3.75), lower education (OR=1.69, 95%CI=1.30-2.20), lower SES status (OR=.88, 95%CI=.84-.93), lower anxiety about self or someone close contracting COVID-19 (OR=2.06, 95%CI=1.50-2.82), and lower depression score (OR=.90, 95%CI=.82-.98). Significant independent predictors of vaccine resistance compared with readiness included younger age (OR=1.72, 95%CI=1.19-2.50), female gender (OR=1.57, 95%CI=1.10-2.24), being married (OR=1.50, 95%CI=1.04-2.16), lower SES (OR=.80, 95%CI=.74-.86), lower satisfaction with social support (OR=.78, 95%CI=.70-.88), lower anxiety about contracting COVID-19 (OR=7.51, 95%CI=5.18-10.91), and lower depression score (OR=.85, 95%CI=.76-.96).

However, there are limited reports on the TPD-based n-type materials, particularly small molecule non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), mainly due to the time-consuming synthetic routes. Herein, two new TPD-based NFAs named as TPD-Th1 and TPD-Th3 were successfully obtained, adopting indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the central core and rhodanine (R) or 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (RCN) as the terminal electron-withdrawing unit. Both TPD-Th1 and TPD-Th3 exhibit highly planar structure due to the intramolecular noncovalently conformational locking between the O atom on the TPD unit and H atoms of two neighboring thiophene ring. The optimized PTB7-Th:TPD-Th3 photovoltaic devices show a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.53% in comparison with PTB7-Th:TPD-Th1 (PCE = 0.62%). The latter lower PCE could be attributed to the unmatched LUMO energy levels.

170714,Towards a lifestyle experience: A phenomenological conceptualization and scale development in the hotel context,2021,"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving stressor with significant mental health consequences. We aimed to delineate distinct anxiety-response trajectories during the early stages of the pandemic and to identify baseline risk and resilience factors as predictors of anxiety responses. Methods. Using a crowdsourcing website, we enrolled 1,362 participants, primarily from the United States (n = 1064) and Israel (n = 222) over three time-points from April-September 2020. We used latent growth mixture modeling to identify anxiety trajectories over time. Group comparison and multivariate regression models were used to examine demographic and risk and resilience factors associated with class membership. Results. A four-class model provided the best fit. The resilient trajectory (stable low anxiety) was the most common (n = 961, 75.08%), followed by chronic anxiety (n = 149, 11.64%), recovery (n = 96, 7.50%) and delayed anxiety (n = 74, 5.78%). While COVID-19 stressors did not differ between trajectories, resilient participants were more likely to be older, living with another person and to report higher income, more education, fewer COVID-19 worries, better sleep quality, and more dispositional resilience factors at baseline. Multivariate analyses suggested that baseline emotion regulation capabilities and low conflictual relationships uniquely distinguished participants in distinct trajectories. Conclusions. Consistent with prior resilience research following major adversities, a majority of individuals showed stable low levels of low anxiety in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge about dispositional resilience factors may prospectively inform mental health trajectories early in the course of ongoing adversity.","Shilton, T.; Mancini, A.

However, inhalation drug delivery to the lungs is sensitive to the lung anatomy and physiology, which can be significantly altered due to the viral infection. The ensued ventilation heterogeneity will change distribution and thus dosimetry of inhaled medications, rendering previous correlations concepts? of pulmonary drug delivery in healthy lungs less reliable. In this study, we first reviewed the recent developments of inhaled therapeutics and vaccines, as well as the latest knowledge of the lung structural variations documented by CT of COVID-19 patients' lungs. We then quantified the volume ratios of the poorly aerated lungs and non-aerated lungs in eight COVID-19 patients, which ranged 2-8% and 0.5-3%, respectively. The need to consider the diseased lung physiologies in estimating pulmonary delivery was emphasized. Diseased lung geometries with varying lesion sites and complexities were reconstructed using Statistical Shape Modeling (SSM). A new segmentation method was applied that could generate patient-specific lung geometries with an increased number of branching generations. The synergy of the CT-based lung segmentation and SSM-based airway variation showed promise for developing representative COVID-infected lung morphological models and investigating inhalation therapeutics in COVID-19 patients.","Xi, JinXiang Walfield B.; Si, XiuHua Bankier A.

This digital world can be programmed so that geosciences student takes data as if it were a field trip. The VR can save money, logistical problems and avoid accessing unsafe places. Besides, students can access places that would otherwise require a veritable expedition (hydroelectric projects in the Andes, remote highways, dams, tunnels in the Himalayas, among others.). At the beginning of the project in 2019, we designed some virtual rock mechanics classes to complement the face-to-face classes: In recent years, we have seen it increasingly difficult to organize field trips. We have designed virtualscenarios where students can obtain geomechanical data from tunnels, mines and rock slopes. We have used the CoSpaces commercial platform for this purpose. Within this virtual world, we place photographs, pop-up menus, videos of field and laboratory tests and clues for the student to search the data for himself in a quasi-real scenario. With all this data from the virtual scenario (as if they were in the field trip), students interpret in the cabinet and perform complex calculations (Hoek Brown, Barton-Bandis criteria, RMR, Q index, among others). We have generated two types of virtual classes: laboratory practices and field trips. Since mid-March of this year 2020, there is no face-to-face teaching in many world faculties whererock mechanics, rock slope engineering, tunnels, and underground mining subjects need to be taught. Thanks to these Virtual Reality laboratories, we have been able to carry out our teaching successfully. Combining two means: VR and software, have allowed making classes very practical and realistic, and the students have highly valued this initiative. Besides, rock mechanics plays a very important role in the safety of underground works and excavations. The best way to learn methodologiesin risky environments is undoubtedly using simulators. In the same way that pilotsand astronauts practice stress situations in simulators, we consider it useful to use Virtual Reality and simulators to learn how to map rock mechanics and stability in mines and tunnels.

Design/methodology/approach The panel data techniques are conducted country-wise in each financial institution type: random-effect model, fixed-effect model and Hausman test. Findings The results of the first phase analysis that extends from 1 January 2020 to 30 October 2020 show that Islamic financial institutions are less exposed to the repercussions of the COVID-19 outbreak than the conventional and Islamic window financial institutions in Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE. Moreover, the Islamic financial institutions in Saudi Arabia and Oman have not been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The second phase analysis for the COVID-19 outbreak that extends from 1 November 2020 to 17 March 2021 confirms the disappearance of the negative impact of COVID-19 on Islamic financial institutions in Bahrain and Oman. Practical implications The findings present that Islamic banks are not as resilient in the COVID-19 pandemic as in the 2008 financial crisis. It can be suggested that regulatory authorities, financial institutions and other key policymakers in the GCC countries should focus on implementing regulatory reforms related to human capital, innovative products, research and development to further develop individuals, societies and institutions within the framework of Islamic ontology to be more resilient in such crises. Originality/value This paper provides a different perspective from existing literature on the pandemics and financial institutions by comparing the stock prices in Islamic and conventional financial institutions and Islamic windows in GCC countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: Our study relies on self-reported isolation data from COVID Symptom Study Sweden (n = 96,053) and national register data on COVID-19 hospitalizations, deaths, and confirmed cases. We use a regression discontinuity design to account for confounding factors, exploiting the fact that exposure to the recommendation was a discontinuous function of age. Results: By comparing individuals just above to those just below the age limit for the policy, our analyses revealed a sharp drop in the weekly number of visits to crowded places at the 70-year-threshold (-13%). Severe COVID-19 cases (hospitalizations or deaths) also dropped abruptly by 16% at the 70-year-threshold. Our data suggest that the age-specific recommendations prevented approximately 1,800 to 2,700 severe COVID-19 cases, depending on model specification.

Unfortunately, these systems are not fully effective, and cases can still go undetected as people may not know or remember all of their contacts or contacts may not be able to be traced. A large proportion of undetected cases suggests poor contact tracing and surveillance systems, which could be a potential area of improvement for a disease response. In this paper, we present a novel method for estimating the proportion of cases that are not detected during an outbreak. Our method uses next generation matrices that are parameterized by linked contact tracing and case line-lists. We use this method to investigate the proportion of undetected cases in two case studies: the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in New Zealand during 2020 and the West African Ebola outbreak in Guinea during 2014. We estimate that only 6% of SARS-CoV-2 cases were not detected in New Zealand (95% credible interval: 1.31 - 16.7%), but over 60% of Ebola cases were not detected in Guinea (95% credible interval: 15 - 90%).","Unwin, H.

Heritable variations that alter the susceptibility to diseases vary with the historical period, the virulence of the infections, and their geographical spread. In this study we built polygenic scores for heritable traits influencing the genetic adaptation in the production of cytokines and immune-mediated disorders, including infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases, and applied them to the genomes of several ancient European populations. We observed that the advent of the Neolithic was a turning point for immune-mediated traits in Europeans, favoring those alleles linked with the development of tolerance against intracellular pathogens and promoting inflammatory responses against extracellular microbes. These evolutionary patterns are also associated with an increased presence of traits related to inflammatory and auto-immune diseases.","Domínguez-Andrés, Jorge; Kuijpers, Yunus; Bakker, Olivier B.; Jaeger, Martin; Xu, Cheng-Jian; van der Meer, Jos W.M.; Jakobsson, Mattias; Bertranpetit, Jaume; Joosten, Leo A.B.; Li, Yang; Netea, Mihai G.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.14.426690,276

In this article, we show that TACSTD2/Trop2 expression is evolutionarily conserved in lungs of various vertebrates. By analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data we demonstrate that TACSTD2 level consistently increases in lungs infected with miscellaneous pathogens. Single cell and subpopulation based transcriptomic data revealed that the major source of TACSTD2 transcript are lung epithelial cells and their progenitors and that TACSTD2 is induced directly in lung epithelial cells following infection.

However, the impact of these prioritization strategies is not well understood, particularly their effect on health inequity in COVID-19 burden for historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations. Objective: To assess the impact of vaccination prioritization and operational strategies on disparities in COVID-19 burden among historically marginalized populations, and on mortality and morbidity by race and ethnicity. Design: We use an agent-based simulation model of North Carolina to project SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated deaths (mortality), hospitalizations (morbidity), and cases over 18 months (7/1/2020-12/31/2021) with vaccine distribution beginning 12/13/2020 to frontline medical and people 75+, assuming initial uptake similar to influenza vaccine. We study two-stage subsequent prioritization including essential workers (essential), adults 65+ (age), adults with high-risk health conditions, HMPs, or people in low income tracts, with eligibility for the general population in the third stage. For age-essential and essential-age strategies, we also simulated maximal uptake (100% for HMP or 100% for everyone), and we allowed for distribution to susceptible-only people. Results: Prioritizing Age then Essential had the largest impact on mortality (2.5% reduction from no prioritization); Essential then Age had the lowest morbidity and reduced infections (4.2% further than Age-Essential) without significantly impacting mortality. Under each prioritization scenario, the age-adjusted mortality burden for HMPs is higher (e.g., 33.3-34.1% higher for the Black population, 13.3%-17.0% for the Hispanic population) compared to the White population, and the gap grew under some prioritizations. In the Age-Essential strategy, the burden on HMPs decreases only when uptake is increased to 100% in HMPs. However, the Black population still had the highest mortality rate even with the Susceptible-Only distribution. Conclusions and Relevance: Simulation results show that prioritization strategies have differential impact on mortality, morbidity, and disparities overall and by race and ethnicity. If prioritization schemes were not paired with increased uptake in HMPs, disparities did not improve and could worsen. Although equity was one of the tenets of vaccine distribution, the vaccination strategies publicly outlined are insufficient to remove and may exacerbate disparities between racial and ethnic groups, thus targeted strategies are needed for the future.","Rosenstrom, E.; Mele, J.

To address this gap, this study uses Russian COVID-19 disinformation combined with network methodologies to contextualize a novel hypothetical model of this process. Specifically, we conduct a content analysis of known disinformation articles about COVID-19 (N = 65) from Russian news sources (e.g. RT, Sputnik, New Eastern Outlook). Using co-occurrence network visualizations, we map the pathways from narrative to psychological effects to provide new insights and testable models of the effects of COVID-19 disinformation. Main findings show that hostile anti-Western narratives primarily target the emotions of anger, disgust, and confusion to undermine citizens' trust in (supra-) governmental institutions and the media.

174896,Socialising tourism after COVID-19: reclaiming tourism as a social force?,2021,"Infection of the alveolar epithelium constitutes a bottleneck in the progression of COVID-19 to SARS presumably due to the paucity of viral entry receptors in alveolar epithelial type 1 and 2 cells. We have found that the male alveolar epithelial cells express twice as many ACE2 and TMPRSS2 entry receptors as the female ones. Intriguingly, IFN and TNF-α signaling are preferentially active in male alveolar cells and induce binding of the cognate transcription factors to the promoters and lung-active enhancers of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Cotreatment with IFN-I and III dramatically increases expression of the receptors and viral entry in alveolar epithelial cells. TNFα and IFN-II, typically overproduced during the cytokine storm, similarly collaborate to induce these events. Whereas JAK inhibitors suppress viral entry induced by IFN-I/III, simultaneous inhibition of IKK/NF-κB is necessary to block viral entry induced by TNFα and IFN-II. In addition to explaining the increased incidence of SARS in males, these findings indicate that SARS-Cov-2 hijacks epithelial immune signaling to promote infection of the alveolar epithelium and suggest that JAK inhibitors, singly and in combination with NF-KB inhibitors, may exhibit efficacy in preventing or treating COVID-19 SARS.","Wang, Yan; Gurrapu, Sreeharsha; Chen, Hong; Laudato, Sara; Caggiano, Emily; Jiang, Yan; Ling, Hsiang-Hsi; Giancotti, Filippo G.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453505,276

Patients undergoing anticancer treatment have 1-4% morbidity rate. Patients with hematological diseases and lung cancer are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and also have more severe symptoms and complications. In this article we discuss the effect of the tumors on the immune system and comprehend the pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease according to its impact on the immunity. Moreover, in the review we analyze available data about the influence of the different types of cancer therapy (chemotherapy, target therapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy) on the severity of the COVID-19 infection. Evidence on the effect of chemotherapy on severity and mortality from COVID-19 is contradictory. Whereas there are some authors concluding that chemotherapy treatment is not affecting the severity of COVID-19 disease, there are also some works where the connection between these facts was established. At the same time target therapy, radio-and immunotherapy most likely do not worsen the SARS-CoV-2 infection and are not associated with the development of complications.

176949,Online Education – a Reality of Our Times,2021,"Background: MyCOVIDRisk app is a free, publicly available COVID-19 risk estimation and mitigation tool. The MyCOVIDRisk app has since been accessed almost 1.3 million times since launch, demonstrating the acceptability of a free and simple web-based mobile application to estimate risk of COVID-19 transmission. Little is known about how mobile apps influence assessments of risk. User experience (“UX”) studies are a key strategy for examining usability and influence of digital technology. Study Objectives: Our primary objectives were to (1) describe how the app informs interpretation of COVID-19 risk, (2) describe motivations for use and patterns of use, (3) to inform future app design. Methods: This UX study consisted of two parts. Part 1 focused on new users’ experiences, particularly navigation of the user interface across various operating systems and devices. Part 2 focused on repeat users’ experiences, particularly how they interpreted risk, what motivated their use of the app, and whether it modified behavior. Participants were recruited remotely via social media advertisements on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. To reach existing users, Part 2 additionally included emailing MyCOVIDRisk users who previously sent unsolicited feedback on the app. Study participants were entered into raffles to win one of two $50 Amazon gift codes. For Part 1, users completed a series of tasks during a semi-structured 30-minute video interview using the app while sharing first impressions, likes, and dislikes. Live notes taken tracked common user errors, points of confusion, and other insights. Part 2 consisted of 40-minute semi-structured video interviews with repeat users. Participants shared their personal pandemic experiences, related health decisionmaking processes, and their experience with the MyCOVIDRisk app. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed to find common themes and subthemes. Results: Recruitment continued until thematic saturation was reached. Part 1 and Part 2 included 8 and 5 unique participants, respectively. Participants varied in terms of background (age range: 21-73 years), geography, prior use of the app, and goals of usage. Key use cases were as a teaching tool, source of authority and objectivity, and resource for personal decisionmaking (Fig 1). Nearly all pointed to simplicity and ease of use as key design strengths. Repeat users highlighted the interactive nature and ability to change parameters, eg, “when it [MyCOVIDRisk App] came out, I used it you know like a hundred times-like what if I do this or what if I do that? Like almost like a video game!” Challenges included difficulty in estimating number of people present and percent that would be masked, and desire for more complex activities than the prepopulated options. Users nearly unanimously suggested integration of vaccine status as an input parameter. Other common recommendations included more customization options (eg, ability to change font size), having more information when hovering over icons, and options to send inputs and risk score results to others or to print them for documentation. Conclusion: This UX testing of a COVID-19 risk assessment and mitigation app confirmed key principles for design: clear imagery, interactivity, and interpretable science.

Using chimeric viruses and antibody-selected viral mutants, we show that multiple neutralizing epitopes, within and outside the viral receptor binding domain (RBD), are variably targeted by polyclonal plasma antibodies and coincide with sequences that are enriched for diversity in natural SARS-CoV-2 populations. By combining plasma-selected spike substitutions, we generated synthetic ‘polymutant’ spike proteins that resisted polyclonal antibody neutralization to a similar degree as currently circulating variants of concern (VOC). Importantly, by aggregating VOC-associated and plasma-selected spike substitutions into a single polymutant spike protein, we show that 20 naturally occurring mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike are sufficient to confer near-complete resistance to the polyclonal neutralizing antibodies generated by convalescents and mRNA vaccine recipients. Strikingly however, plasma from individuals who had been infected and subsequently received mRNA vaccination, neutralized this highly resistant SARS-CoV-2 polymutant, and also neutralized diverse sarbecoviruses. Thus, optimally elicited human polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be resilient to substantial future SARS-CoV-2 variation and may confer protection against future sarbecovirus pandemics.","Schmidt, Fabian; Weisblum, Yiska; Rutkowska, Magdalena; Poston, Daniel; Silva, Justin Da; Zhang, Fengwen; Bednarski, Eva; Cho, Alice; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis J.; Gaebler, Christian; Caskey, Marina; Nussenzweig, Michel C.; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bieniasz, Paul D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.06.455491,276
177958,A Preliminary Study Exploring the Impact of Learner Resilience under Enforced Online Delivery during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected public transportation worldwide, and its implications need to be evaluated and study deeply on all public transportation aspects. Therefore, an analysis has been created to examine the effects of the pandemic on public transportation service quality decisions to have a better vision of the different stakeholders’ needs to keep the system functioning in a profitable way. Stakeholder participation in complex, multi-criteria decision-making often produces very different results in prioritizing the decision attributes. Rank correlation techniques generally measure the degree of agreement or non-agreement among the evaluator groups. However, the multi-criteria methodology can determine not only ordinal but also cardinal priorities. Consequently, except for the attributes’ positions, the weight values are also significant in the final decision. This paper aims to apply a more sophisticated measure of group agreement than rank correlation. First, the Fuzzy-hierarchical analytical process (FAHP) has been used to find out the aggregated weights, then the Kendall correlation values are computed to reveal stakeholder opinions. Finally, the agreement measure approach has been tested in a real-world case study: the public transport development decision of Amman, Jordan. The analysis shows that by applying the Kendall technique, Kendall could gain a more profound insight into the priority characteristics of different evaluator groups.","Alkharabsheh, Ahmad Duleba Szabolcs",Vehicles,https://doi.org/10.3390/vehicles3030020,276

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and travel restrictions for controlling COVID-19 have impacted the circulation of most respiratory viruses including RSV globally, particularly in Australia, where during 2020 the normal winter epidemics were notably absent. However, in late 2020, unprecedented widespread RSV outbreaks occurred, beginning in spring, and extending into summer across two widely separated states of Australia, Western Australia (WA) and New South Wales (NSW) including the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Genome sequencing revealed a significant reduction in RSV genetic diversity following COVID-19 emergence except for two genetically distinct RSV-A clades. These clades circulated cryptically, likely localized for several months prior to an epidemic surge in cases upon relaxation of COVID-19 control measures. The NSW/ACT clade subsequently spread to the neighbouring state of Victoria (VIC) and caused extensive outbreaks and hospitalisations in early 2021. These findings highlight the need for continued surveillance and sequencing of RSV and other respiratory viruses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic as mitigation measures introduced may result in unusual seasonality, along with larger or more severe outbreaks in the future.","Eden, J.-S.; Sikazwe, C.; Xie, R.; Deng, Y.-M.; Sullivan, S.

178572,Service-Learning in Physical Education Teacher Education: A Pedagogical Model towards Sustainable Development Goals,2021,"Background: Several recent studies reported that Covid-19 pandemic induces significant mental distress. It remains unknown, however, whether mental distress persists or undergoes extinction in response to consecutive Covid-19 waves. We here examine mental distress prior to and across the three Covid-19 waves. Methods: We measured stress and depressive symptoms prior to and across the three Covid-19 waves in a well-established population-based sample. A total of 330 participants completed e-questionnaires prior to and during the Covid-19 waves. Friedman's repeated-measures and Wilcoxon rank sum pairwise test with Bonferroni correction were used to investigate repeated-measure differences, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess the effect of behavioral and physiological parameters on mental health. Results: We found significantly increased mental distress during each of the Covid-19 waves compared with the pre-Covid-19 period. Increased mental distress was more common in women and most pronounced during the 1st and in particular, the 3rd Covid-19 wave. The stress and depressive symptoms increased during pandemic compared with the pre-Covid-19 period by a maximum of 1.58 and 3.63 times, respectively. Negative emotions and loneliness were identified as the most significant risk factors of Covid-19-induced mental distress, while resilience was found to be protective. Conclusions: Mental distress surged during all the Covid-19 waves without showing extinction. This pattern is mechanistically reminiscent of the post-traumatic stress disorder. Our results suggest that the Covid-19 pandemic underlies development of a novel chronic mental health disorder and do not exclude possible further deterioration of mental health in case of future Covid-19 waves.","Novotny, J.

178621,Using social media to support teaching and learning in higher education: an analysis of personal narratives,2020,"BackgroundGetCheckedOnline is a publicly-funded internet-based testing service for sexually-transmitted and blood borne infections (STBBI) offered in British Columbia (BC), Canada since 2014. GetCheckedOnline has remained accessible since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic response, despite many in-person sexual healthcare services having been reduced or stopped. GetCheckedOnline users complete an online risk assessment to inform STBBI test recommendations, auto-generating a lab requisition which can be used at any participating laboratory location, with results available online or by phone. Our objective was to describe GetCheckedOnline program utilization and selected risk factors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.ApproachWe used linked GetCheckedOnline program and laboratory testing data for this analysis. We compared the mean of selected monthly program measures during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 – December 2020) to the same time period the previous year, defined as pre-pandemic (March 2019 – December 2019). Descriptive statistics are presented.OutcomesThe median number of monthly test episodes completed was higher during the pandemic (median=1088;n=9470 total episodes completed), compared to pre-pandemic (median=824, n=8237 total episodes completed), despite a sharp decline and rapid recovery in March-May 2020. During the pandemic, the mean proportion of test episodes completed by those using GetCheckedOnline for the first time was 57%;an increase from pre-pandemic (51%). We observed an increase in the percent positivity during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic (6.44% vs. 5.72%), as well as in the mean proportion of those reporting symptoms (20.3% vs 19.4%) or being a contact to someone with an STBBI (11.0% vs 9.3%).Innovation and SignificanceThe increase in first time GetCheckedOnline testers, percent positivity, and those reporting symptoms or being a contact to an STBBI during the COVID-19 pandemic suggest the program has filled a gap in STBBI testing services, and remains a critical service for accessing sexual healthcare.","Pedersen, H.; Ablona, A.; Haag, D.; Change, H.; Korol, E.; Bannar-Martin, S.; Wong, J.; Grennan, T.; Gilbert, M.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.73,276

Kate Valk joined in 1978, the last representative of The Wooster Group’s foundational period, apart from LeCompte herself, who is still a key member of the company. References in this conversation are primarily to works after 2016. LeCompte briefly remarks on the importance of Since I Can Remember – one of the Group’s ongoing works in progress in 2021 – as an archival project that draws on Valk’s memory of how Nayatt School was made during her formative years. Having become, since then, a quintessential Wooster Group performer, Valk extended her artistic skills to stage direction, undertaking, most recently, The B-Side (2017). Both the initiative and idea for the piece came from performer Eric Berryman, who had brought Valk the collection of blues, songs, spirituals, and preachings on the 1965 LP made from the research of scholar folklorist Bruce Chapman. Berryman had been inspired to approach Valk because of her exclusive use of unadulterated historical recordings in Early Shaker Spirituals (2014), her directorial debut. The main work in rehearsal during 2020 and which was still locked down by the Covid-19 pandemic at the time of this conversation is The Mother, a Wooster Group variant of Brecht’s dramatized version of Gorky’s novel, directed by LeCompte. LeCompte discusses the current situation, emphasizing the increased vulnerability of independent artists and small-scale theatre, while giving a glimpse of the disadvantages for such groupings built into the North American system of project funding. The Wooster Group is a salient example of small-scale theatre that, despite continually precarious conditions, which the pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated, has achieved its creative goals and has defined its place in the exploratory avant-garde flourishing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s. This particular avant-garde, LeCompte believes, has seen various important developments over the years but might well now be counting its last days. The conversation here presented was recorded on 31 October 2020, transcribed by Kunsang Kelden, and edited by Maria Shevtsova, Editor of New Theatre Quarterly.","LeCompte, Elizabeth Valk Kate Shevtsova Maria",New Theatre Quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266464x21000129,276

This study aimed to examine the impact of this disruption on graduate students and postdoctoral fellows completing laboratory-based research in Canada. We used an anonymous online survey and semi-structured interviews to document the experiences of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows during laboratory closures and following the transition to working from home. We employed a mixed-method approach using survey and interview data to identify shared experiences, concerns, and supports. The emotions reported by respondents at different points during laboratory closures align with the Kübler-Ross model of grief following change. Respondents describe closure processes as chaotic and confusing, primarily resulting from inconsistent communication. Respondents reported increased indications of distress while working from home. Concerns about how COVID-19 might impact trainees were identified, including decreasing competitiveness of applicants while limiting future employment opportunities. Finally, we outline five types of supports that can be implemented by supervisors and administrators to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to return to the laboratory. Overall, we document shared experiences of respondents during the COVID-19 laboratory shutdown and identify areas of improvement in the event widespread laboratory closures occur in the future. © 2021 Suart et al.","Suart, C.; Suart, T.

This provided healthcare workers with a unique opportunity to access this ‘hard-to-find’ group, offer blood borne viruses screening (BBVS) and link clients testing positive into individualised treatment.ApproachA collaborative working group (HIV clinicians, HIV prevention specialists, hepatitis C outreach nurses and rough-sleepers health-engagement workers) established comprehensive risk-assessments, PPE supplies and dried blood spot procurement. Two experienced outreach workers worked along-side trusted homeless key-workers to offer BBVS (HIV, hepatitis B&C) in hotels, a hostel and student halls over 13-weeks (Jun-Sep 2020). Clients were offered £5 food-voucher for participating.Outcomes270 clients were housed during this time, 256 (95%) were offered BBVS;192 (72%) tested. 148 (77%) tested ‘mainly due to the incentive’. Of the 192 testers the median age (range) was 40y (18–69). Clients were mainly male 161 (83%);white-British 164 (85%) and heterosexual 179 (93%). 54 (28%) stated previous IVDU;39 (20%) other drug use and 92 (48%) prison as risk-factors. 70 (36%) had not previously tested. 31 (16%) were hepatitis C antibody positive;13 (7%) RNA positive. To date 4 have started treatment;5 deferred;3 did not engage with services despite being aware of the diagnosis;1 left the area. No new HIV diagnoses (two clients re-engaged with care). Most clients considered the service good or excellent, and would recommend (99%). Challenges included lab delays due to competing Covid-19 testing and engaging disenfranchised clients.Innovation and SignificanceThis project brought together a multidisciplinary collaboration, drawing on specialist knowledge to meet complex needs. Despite challenges during a pandemic, we obtained a useful snap-shot of BBV rates. Offering an incentive to a cohort sensitised to BBVS was important. New outreach testing opportunities were identified which will be progressed in 2021.","Dean, G.; Coskry, M.; Tweed, M.; O’Sullivan, M.; Vera, J.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-sti.150,276

However, in the highly uncertain post-epidemic era, determining how to attract foreign investment is the key to revitalizing the economy. What are the important factors for governments to attract investment, and how to improve them? This will be an important decision in the post-epidemic era. Therefore, this study develops a novel decision-making model to explore the key factors in attracting foreign investment. The model first uses fuzzy Delphi to explore the key factors of attracting foreign investment in the post-epidemic era, and then uses DEMATEL to construct the causal relationships among these factors. To overcome the uncertainty of various information sources and inconsistent messages from decision-makers, this study combined neutrosophic set theory to conduct quantitative analysis. The results of the study show that the model is suitable for analyzing the key factors of investment attraction in the post-epidemic period. Based on the results of the study, we also propose strategies that will help the relevant policy-making departments to understand the root causes of the problem and to formulate appropriate investment strategies in advance. In addition, the model is also used for comparative analysis, which reveals that this novel approach can integrate more incomplete information and present expert opinions in a more objective way.","Sun-Weng, Huang Liou James J.

180470,Achieving Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030 in Bangladesh: the crossroad of the governance and performance,2021,"Background Excess mortality has been used to assess the health impact of COVID-19 across countries. Democracies aim to build trust in government and enable checks and balances on decision-making, which may be useful in a pandemic. On the other hand, democratic governments have been criticised as slow to enforce restrictive policies and being overly influenced by public opinion. This study sought to understand whether the strength of democratic governance is associated with the variation in excess mortality observed across countries during the pandemic. Methods Through linking open-access datasets we constructed univariable and multivariable linear regression models investigating the association between country EIU Democracy Index (representing the strength of democratic governance on a scale of 0 to 10) and excess mortality rates, from February 2020 to May 2021. We stratified our analysis into high-income and low and middle-income country groups and adjusted for several important confounders. Results Across 78 countries, the mean EIU democracy index was 6.74 (range 1.94 to 9.81) and the mean excess mortality rate was 128 per 100,000 (range -55 to 503 per 100,000). A one-point increase in EIU Democracy Index was associated with a decrease in excess mortality of 26.3 per 100,000 (p=0.002), after accounting for COVID-19 cases, age 65+, gender, prevalence of cardiovascular disease, universal health coverage and the strength of early government restrictions. This association was particularly strong in high-income countries (b=-47.5, p<0.001) but non-significant in low and middle-income countries (b=-10.8, p=0.40). Conclusions Socio-political factors related to the way societies are governed have played an important role in mitigating the overall health impact of COVID-19. Given the omission of such considerations from outbreak risk assessment tools, and their particular significance in high-income countries rated most highly by such tools, this study strengthens the case to broaden the scope of traditional pandemic risk assessment.","Jain, V.; Clarke, J.; Beaney, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.25.21262614v1?rss=1,276

La Via Campesina's inclusion of interacting with others in their definition of food sovereignty helps sustain food autonomy through shared food practices among populations deemed to be at risk. Key to sustaining autonomy is a revision of how food sovereign voices are mediated in documentary media. Documentary media often claim to amplify the voices of the powerless, a move that rings of the same type of paternalism that often marks food insecurity discourse. Drawing from currents in rhetorical studies, film studies, and studies in food communication, as well as my own documentary work, I argue that voice inheres in that which grates against a neoliberal understanding of food systems and the representational modes that operate within that sphere. Developing a documentary approach that navigates the modalities of mainstream food systems discourse while underscoring long-standing interactions of marginalized people around food is key to mediating food sovereign voices across cultures, generations, and palates.","Khan, S.

This was compared with the data of 2019 during similar months. The impact of COVID 19 on use of preventive and curative paediatric health care service units like outpatient department, casualty, intensive care and immunization clinic were assessed. Data from 2019 to 2020 were compared using standard parametric and nonparametric tests. There was a significant decline in routine OPD (68%) attendance during the COVID 19 period as compared to pre-COVID period. Paediatric ward admissions and PICU admissions were decreased by 55% and 42% respectively. We also observed a significant 43% decline in the number of children attending immunization clinic in the year 2020. The fear of COVID 19 pandemic and the measures taken to control the pandemic has affected the health seeking behaviour of patients.

In this chapter, I draw on two years of ethnographic fieldwork (four months during the pandemic) to explore how blanket pandemic response policies interact with underlying structural inequalities. By building on a framework that describes community vulnerability, I argue that the second-order effects of such policies operate to widen spatial inequality.

181816,Real time experience of participants in higher education during the coronavirus: A case study,2021,"Abstract The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has resulted into global devastation. This study attempts to explore the positive phenomenal impact of perceived pandemic anxiety resulting in prosocial behaviour (PB) through the mechanisms of self-awareness and spiritual transformation using terror management theory (TMT). The study also examines the moderating impact of conscious state expansion (CSE) on the self-awareness and spiritual transformation relationship, and the impact of this moderation effect is further tested separately on two gender groups. The data (N = 573) for the study were collected from the Punjab state of India during the ascending phase of outbreak. The results of PLS-SEM analysis reveal the significant influence of variables under study on prosocial behavioural outcomes. Taking insights from the findings of the study it becomes clear that during dreadful situations, when people experience the possibility of loss of life, their self-awareness level increases, which in turn results in their spiritual transformation. Such mechanism is observed more in the people possessing higher spiritual consciousness. The study concludes by recognising the positive role played by spiritual transformation (ST) in the evolution of the attributes of care and compassion for others, resulting in positive social consequences. The discussion, implications, limitations, and future directions are presented and discussed.","Singla, Himanshu Mehta Minakshi Duggal Mehta Pooja",International Social Science Journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/issj.12290,276
181952,Remote Chemistry Teacher Professional Development Delivery: Enduring Lessons for Programmatic Redesign,2021,"To study the air quality changes during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown in Changchun, we analyzed the changes in pollution of six major pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, CO) and correlated them with meteorological parameters, using meteorological data and pollutants concentration data. Regional transport pathways and potential source areas of pollutants were analyzed using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF). The results showed that the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO were 30.5%–53.8% lower in the Level I period and 49.4%–65.0% lower in the Level II period than in the pre-lockdown period, respectively. Conversely, O3 increased 59.6% and 58.1% during Level I and Level II, respectively, compared to the pre-lockdown period. During the 55-day lockdown, daily average concentrations of each pollutant were lower than in previous years on 36-55 days, while O3 was higher on 35 days. The pollutants that decreased in concentration during the lockdown also showed an increase during the Level III period (up to 188.5%). The maximum daily growth rate of PM2.5 during the lockdown period in 2020 was 16.0%, which was higher than this value in the same period of previous years (21.8%, 21.4%, 17.4%). This shows that the change trend of pollutants during the lockdown period is smoother than in previous years. Temperature and O3 were positively correlated before the lockdown and during Level I and weakly negatively correlated during Level II and Level III. Despite the prevalence of northwest winds in winter, a high percentage of trajectories from other directions (up to 36.8%) was observed during the lockdown. Simultaneously, the lockdown reduced the potential source area for PM2.5 (WPSCF ≥ 0.000007), but rebounded after the lockdown was lifted. In conclusion, the lockdown only temporarily reduced the air pollution in Changchun. © 2021, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research.

182377,Improved math connection skills through online learning using math-UNWIR,2021,": The European Semester (Semester) was implemented a decade ago. Ample research has addressed the Semester’s development, including some major changes in processes and content (Verdun & Zeitlin, 2018). The Covid-19 crisis seems to mark the next stage in the evolution of the Semester. It connects the Semester with the wider Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and links its country-specific recommendations to conditional financial support. Thus, the next stage of the Semester suggests a stronger and more deliberate interlinkage of different EU tools that jointly guide national socioeconomic policies. It should support both national public investment and reforms while focusing on meeting the EU priority of moving towards a climate-neutral, digitalized, and resilient Europe (De la Porte & Dagnis Jensen, 2021). This article addresses the question of what room the new-style Semester gives to the involvement of national-level actors, such as national parliaments. Therefore, it expands existing analytical frameworks in order to assess the RRF in connection to the Semester, focusing on the degree of obligation, enforcement, and centralisation. Jointly, this outlines the room the RRF gives to the participation of national actors in the Semester. The article concludes that although the national parliaments are not mentioned in the Regulation establishing the RRF, they could claim a role both in developing national plans for accessing financial support as well as in amending and approving reforms.","Bekker, Sonja",Politics and Governance,https://doi.org/10.17645/pag.v9i3.4290,276

This paper examines the tradeoff between public health risks and financial standing that school administrators faced when deciding reopening plans. Because in-person instruction at colleges and universities had large effects on COVID-19 case rates, it is critical to understand what caused these decisions. We used binary and multinomial probit models to evaluate an original data set of publicly available data as well as data from the College Crisis Initiative. Binary and multinomial choice model estimates suggest that conditional upon the prevailing level of COVID-19 in their county, financially distressed colleges were approximately 20 percentage points more likely to opt for primarily in-person operations than less financially distressed colleges. These choices highlight an important potential tradeoff between public health and financial concerns present in the higher education sector and emphasize the need for public spending to mitigate adverse health outcomes if a similar situation occurs again.","Tobin, Jonah Hall Oliver Lazris Jacob Zimmerman David",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14080382,276

The consumption of meat primarily covers the protein requirement of the Indians, and three out of four are non-vegetarians. There is a need to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated countrywide lockdown on the meat consumption pattern of the Indian non-vegetarians. A countrywide survey was conducted among the consumers to study the impact of COVID-19 on the meat consumption pattern using a self-administered electronic questionnaire distributed through emails and online social networking platforms. A total of 416 responses were collected from the consumers belonging to different states and union territories. The data were analyzed as per the standard procedure. The meat consumption pattern of the non-vegetarians was found to be altered during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown period. The majority of the consumers could not obtain a sufficient quantity of meat and meat products during the lockdown period due to various reasons such as the increased cost and decreased availability of livestock. The myths and rumors associated with meat consumption and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 further weakened the meat trade in certain areas. Based on the findings of this survey, it is safe to confirm that the meat consumption pattern among Indian consumers was affected badly during the countrywide lockdown. © 2021, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.

Multiple factors likely have contributed to this decline in CHD deaths, including greater control of risk factors, resulting in declining incidence of CHD, and improved treatment. Greater control of risk factors and declining incidence can reduce CHD prevalence, whereas improved treatment that results in lower mortality rates and more persons living with CHD can increase prevalence. To estimate state-specific CHD prevalence and recent trends by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education, CDC analyzed data from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys for the period 2006-2010. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined that, although self-reported CHD prevalence declined overall, substantial differences in prevalence existed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and state of residence. These data can enable state and national health agencies to monitor CHD prevalence as a measure of progress toward meeting the Healthy People 2020 objective to reduce the U.S. rate of CHD deaths 20% from the 2007 baseline.",,MMWR.

The patient developed the hernia eight days after bilateral laparoscopic adnexectomy and presented small bowel obstruction signs. This hernia occurred despite correct closure of the internal oblique fascia. The patient was re-operated and exploratory laparoscopy confirmed the diagnosis. The hernia was reduced via a small extension of the previous incision, and the defect was repaired by separated stitches. This case shows that a trocar site hernia can appear despite correct closure of the fascia, which is poorly described except for obese patients. It suggests the need for careful closure of the abdominal wall including the peritoneum after a laparoscopic procedure. Trocar site hernia has to be considered in cases of post laparoscopic small bowel obstruction.

It is an old phrase that is being used for decades, but it is never been implemented cordially by our society nowadays. Covid-19 is a good lesson that reminds us to carefully prevent the spread of coronavirus which is now a pandemic worldwide. People now wash their hands more often and clean, wear a mask everywhere - everytime, do physical distancing, do healthy lifestyle such as physical activity, healthy diet, and consume multivitamins. They obey the cough and sneeze etiquette. Prevention awareness is never been such popular like todays.For internal medicine specialist, the role for prevention is very broad. Besides we still have a role in primary prevention, we can take our part in both secondary and (of course) tertiary prevention. Primary prevention can be defined as an action not allow a disease to occur, for examples vaccination (for internal medicine specialist more specific as adult vaccination), smoking cessation, physical activity (exercise) and healthy diet. Health promotion and prevention is the core of primary prevention. Secondary prevention aims to detect the disease as early as possible, in at risk population, such as mammography for breast cancer, swab test for Covid-19, colonoscopy for colon cancer in high risk patients. Last, tertiary prevention propose to hamper the progress of clinical disease and prevent more severe complications of the disease, for examples cardiac rehabilitation, or medications for prevent chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes or hypertension. It is overlapping the curative or treatment strategies as it is states ""to cure is to prevent"". In 2020, in which each underlying conditions require effective treatment and each disease should be prevented. We are now facing the era of preventive medicine.

193696,"Immunity for immunizations: tort liability, biodefense, and Bioshield II.",2007,"The E2 protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is believed to be a virion surface glycoprotein that is a candidate for inclusion in an antiviral vaccine. A truncated soluble version of E2 has recently been shown to interact with CD81, suggesting that this protein may be a component of the receptor for HCV. When expressed in eukaryotic cells, a significant proportion of E2 forms misfolded aggregates. To analyze the specificity of interaction between E2 and CD81, the aggregated and monomeric forms of a truncated E2 glycoprotein (E2(661)) were separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed for CD81 binding. Nonaggregated forms of E2 preferentially bound CD81 and a number of conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Furthermore, intracellular forms of E2(661) were found to bind CD81 with greater affinity than the extracellular forms. Intracellular and secreted forms of E2(661) were also found to differ in reactivity with MAbs and human sera, consistent with differences in antigenicity. Together, these data indicate that proper folding of E2 is important for its interaction with CD81 and that modifications of glycans can modulate this interaction. Identification of the biologically active forms of E2 will assist in the future design of vaccines to protect against HCV infection.","Flint, M; Dubuisson, J; Maidens, C; Harrop, R; Guile, G R; Borrow, P; McKeating, J A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10623732/,276

199637,A Key Action Plan for EDUCATION in a Global Crisis,2021,"CONTEXT Of children with sore throat, 15% to 36% have pharyngitis caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). Performance of a GABHS test prior to antibiotic prescribing is recommended for children with sore throat. Penicillin, amoxicillin, erythromycin, and first-generation cephalosporins are the recommended antibiotics for treatment of sore throat due to GABHS. OBJECTIVES To measure rates of antibiotic prescribing and GABHS testing and to evaluate the association between testing and antibiotic treatment for children with sore throat. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Analysis of visits by children aged 3 to 17 years with sore throat to office-based physicians, hospital outpatient departments, and emergency departments in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 1995 to 2003 (N = 4158) and of a subset of visits with GABHS testing data (n = 2797). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES National rates of antibiotic prescribing, prescribing of antibiotics recommended and not recommended for GABHS, and GABHS testing. RESULTS Physicians prescribed antibiotics in 53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49%-56%) of an estimated 7.3 million annual visits for sore throat and nonrecommended antibiotics to 27% (95% CI, 24%-31%) of children who received an antibiotic. Antibiotic prescribing decreased from 66% of visits in 1995 to 54% of visits in 2003 (P = .01 for trend). This decrease was attributable to a decrease in the prescribing of recommended antibiotics (49% to 38%; P = .002). Physicians performed a GABHS test in 53% (95% CI, 48%-57%) of visits and in 51% (95% CI, 45%-57%) of visits at which an antibiotic was prescribed. GABHS testing was not associated with a lower antibiotic prescribing rate overall (48% tested vs 51% not tested; P = .40), but testing was associated with a lower antibiotic prescribing rate for children with diagnosis codes for pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and streptococcal sore throat (57% tested vs 73% not tested; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS Physicians prescribed antibiotics to 53% of children with sore throat, in excess of the maximum expected prevalence of GABHS. Although there was a decrease in the proportion of children receiving antibiotics between 1995 and 2003, this was due to decreased prescribing of agents recommended for GABHS. Although GABHS testing was associated with a lower rate of antibiotic prescribing for children with diagnosis codes of pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and streptococcal sore throat, GABHS testing was underused.","Linder, Jeffrey A; Bates, David W; Lee, Grace M; Finkelstein, Jonathan A",JAMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16278359/,276

Updated virological and epidemiological findings from our market surveillance in southern China demonstrate that H5N1 influenza viruses continued to be panzootic in different types of poultry. Genetic and antigenic analyses revealed the emergence and predominance of a previously uncharacterized H5N1 virus sublineage (Fujian-like) in poultry since late 2005. Viruses from this sublineage gradually replaced those multiple regional distinct sublineages and caused recent human infection in China. These viruses have already transmitted to Hong Kong, Laos, Malaysia, and Thailand, resulting in a new transmission and outbreak wave in Southeast Asia. Serological studies suggest that H5N1 seroconversion in market poultry is low and that vaccination may have facilitated the selection of the Fujian-like sublineage.

To test the endemic vs. novel pathogen hypothesis, we present a unique analysis of intraspecific host-pathogen phylogenetic concordance of tiger salamanders and an emerging Ranavirus throughout Western North America. There is significant non-concordance of host and virus gene trees, suggesting pathogen novelty. However, non-concordance has likely resulted from virus introductions by human movement of infected salamanders. When human-associated viral introductions are excluded, host and virus gene trees are identical, strongly supporting coevolution and endemism. A laboratory experiment showed an introduced virus strain is significantly more virulent than endemic strains, likely due to artificial selection for high virulence. Thus, our analysis of intraspecific phylogenetic concordance revealed that human introduction of viruses is the mechanism underlying tree non-concordance and possibly disease emergence via artificial selection.","Storfer, Andrew; Alfaro, Michael E; Ridenhour, Benjamin J; Jancovich, James K; Mech, Stephen G; Parris, Matthew J; Collins, James P",Ecology letters,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17850337/,276

202861,Repurposing Best Teaching Practices for Remote Learning Environments: Chemistry in the News and Oral Examinations During COVID-19,2020,"BackgroundmRNA vaccines are a novel method of eliciting immunity, and play a significant role in the global fight against COVID-19. Anaphylactic reactions are a widespread concern driving vaccine hesitancy due to the serious and potentially fatal nature of anaphylaxis. A quantitative estimation of the risk of anaphylactic and ana-phylactoid reactions deriving from mRNA vaccines is of a significant public health importance. ObjectiveTo estimate the relative Reporting Odds Ratio of anaphylactic and ana-phylactoid reactions following mRNA vaccination vis-a-vis other vaccinations. DesignReporting case-control study. SettingPersons reporting adverse events following vaccination to VAERS whose reports were received between 01 January 2000 and 02 July 2021, inclusive. PatientsEach case of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction was matched with 2.7 unique controls on average, by gender and age rounded to the nearest integer. MeasurementsOverall and stratified Reporting Odds Ratios (ROR) were calculated. Stratified contingency tables were tested for homogeneity using the Breslow-Day procedure, and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistics were calculated to test the hypothesis of a ROR of unity. Results2,665 cases of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions and 7,125 controls of non-anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reports were compared. The ROR of an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction was 1.325 (95% CI: 1.212 - 1.448, p < 0.001). The matched set of cases and controls revealed an expected inhomogeneity by sex (with women slightly more likely to report anaphylactic presentations) and age band strata (with a bimodal distribution that reflects the common incidence of anaphylactic and allergic pathologies). No significant increase in the risk of anaphylactic adverse events was witnessed among persons who self-reported previous allergic reactions to vaccines. A slightly elevated ROR was observed with patients who reported a history of allergic reactions to NSAIDs and/or fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The precise meaning and relevance of this finding remains to be elucidated. LimitationsAs a reporting study using data from VAERS, our analysis is subject tunder- and overreporting, the extent of each of which is not known with any degree of precision. Since the Emergency Use Authorizations for both mRNA vaccines mandate reporting of all serious adverse events, reporting bias is likely in favour of non-mRNA vaccines, where such reporting is not mandatory in adults. Consequently, this analysis may exaggerate the ROR of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid events associated with mRNA vaccines, which may in reality be significantly lower. ConclusionsmRNA vaccination is not associated with a statistically significant higher risk of reporting an anaphylactic adverse event to VAERS. Anaphylaxis is a serious but very rare complication of all immunisations. No significant increase in reporting odds was found in any age group or gender, nor in most cases of previously known allergic adverse events in relation to vaccines. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence proving the safety and tolerability of mRNA vaccines.","Csefalvay, Chris von",,,276

Further subgroup analysis indicated that the association was only statistically significant in studies from Africa (OR = 1.13, p = 0.004) and the United States (OR = 1.30, p = 0.006). Conclusion: Whilst all persons ought to receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, PLWH should be prioritised to minimise the risk of death because of COVID-19. The presence of HIV should be regarded as an important risk factor for future risk stratification of COVID-19.","Hariyanto, T.

Methods: In this retrospective chart review, all consecutive cases presenting to the Retina-Uveitis service from May 2020 to January 2021 with retinal manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection or its sequelae or as a result of treatment given for COVID-19 were included. Results: : Of the 7 patients, 3 were female, and 4 were male. Four patients had onset of symptoms during the active phase of COVID-19 infection. Four had bilateral and three had unilateral involvement. The manifestations ranged from mild to vision threatening. Vision threatening manifestations included infections: endogenous endophthalmitis, candida retinitis and tubercular choroidal abscess and bilateral pre-foveal hemorrhages. Milder manifestations included paracentral acute middle maculopathy, central serous chorio-retinopathy and voriconazole induced visual symptoms. Final visual acuity was 6/36 or better in the four severe cases and 6/9 or better in the mild cases. Conclusion: This study highlights the retinal manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection and its sequelae. As these patients presented with an association with COVID-19 (either during or after recovery), ophthalmologists should be vigilant and screen for such entities in case of complaints of visual symptoms or in the presence of systemic sepsis.

Weight loss strategies that easily can be integrated into daily life are needed, but knowledge about how TRE affects daily life is lacking. This study examined how individuals having overweight or obesity at high risk of type 2 diabetes performed TRE in daily life, with a focus on how the timing of eating changed the organisation and rhythms of daily activities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants enrolled in a randomised controlled trial studying the effect of a 12-week TRE intervention focusing on a self-selected daily 10-h window between 6 AM and 8 PM. Seventeen participants from the intervention group were interviewed at baseline and end of intervention, and data were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Participants found TRE simple and appealing due to the unrestricted dietary intake. In general, participants did not change their food preferences and continued to eat three main daily meals. However, participants had to increase their awareness of the time of day, reshuffle ordinary daily activities and plan their intake more carefully. Two participants reported fully adherence every day, whereas all other participants reported one to several episodes of intake outside their window during the 12 weeks. Social evening activities and collective rhythms were largest barriers. Our findings suggest that TRE interventions would benefit from a broader perspective on daily life and an expanded view on families and friends as joint units of intervention. TRE interventions should consider individuals' daily rhythms and help them develop practical solutions to integrating new eating practices.","Bjerre, Natasja; Holm, Lotte; Quist, Jonas Salling; Færch, Kristine; Hempler, Nana Folmann",Appetite,,276
210844,Towards Societies Living with COVID-19,2021,"Studies on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on animal welfare and dairy husbandry in low-income countries are limited. We conducted a survey between February and June 2020 to evaluate the economic impact and animal health problems upon the pandemic. Participants were lead veterinarians from 14 dairy farms with herd size between 100 and 500 in Lahore. These farms were major suppliers of milk and dairy products to central Punjab, Pakistan. During the pandemic, 10 of the 14 dairy farms relied on feed mill concentrates to provide feeds to their herds. Half of the farms reported feed shortage due to lockdowns. Six (43%) dairy farms have witnessed a 7.5% shortage of dry feed intake. In seven (50%) farms, the body condition score decreased by 0.24 point. The body score reduction was significantly associated with depleted feed intake (P = 0.005). The veterinarians of 10 (71%) farms failed to gain access to essential veterinary medications, hampering the treatment of sick animals. Due to feed shortage and drug unavailability, daily milk production reduced by two litters per cow in the herd of five (35%) farms. The reduced feed intake was significantly associated with the decrease in milk production (P = 0.003), while numerous downstream milk-processing facilities were out of service during the pandemic, significantly reducing the profit of six (43%) dairy farms. Finally, our study showed that the dairy farming industry and animal welfare were critically affected by three aspects: feed shortage, inaccessibility to essential veterinary drugs, and a reduced consumer demand for dairy products.","Hussain, Sabir; Hussain, Abrar; Ho, Jeffery; Sparagano, Olivier A E; Zia, Ubaid-Ur-Rehman",Front Vet Sci,,276

Thromboelastographic investigations are useful point-of-care devices to assess coagulation and fibrinolysis. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the hypothesis that the procoagulatory state in COVID-19 patients is associated with impaired fibrinolysis system. METHODS: Altogether, 29 COVID-19 patients admitted to normal wards or to the intensive care unit (ICU) were included in this descriptive study. Whole blood samples were investigated by thromboelastography to assess coagulation and fibrinolysis. Additionally, standard routine coagulation testing and immunoassays for factors of fibrinolysis as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activity and &#945;2-antiplasmin (A2AP) were performed. RESULTS: A significantly increased lysis resistance and a significantly longer time of lysis after adding tissue plasminogen activator were observed in blood samples from ICU COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (maximal lysis: 3.25 ± 0.56 vs. 6.20 ± 0.89%, p = 0.0127; lysis time: 365.7 ± 44.6 vs. 193.2 ± 16.3 seconds, p = 0.0014). PAI-1 activity was significantly higher in plasma samples of ICU COVID-19 patients (PAI-1: 4.92 ± 0.91 vs. 1.28 ± 0.33 U/mL, p = 0.001). A positive correlation between the activity of PAI-1 and lysis time of the formed clot (r = 0.70, p = 0.0006) was observed. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with impaired fibrinolytic activity in blood, where fibrinolytic inhibitors are elevated leading to an increased resistance to clot lysis. Thromboelastography could offer a tool to investigate the contribution of the fibrinolytic status to the procoagulatory condition in COVID-19.","Hammer, Stefanie; Häberle, Helene; Schlensak, Christian; Bitzer, Michael; Malek, Nisar P; Handgretinger, Rupert; Lang, Peter; Hörber, Sebastian; Peter, Andreas; Martus, Peter; Mirakaj, Valbona; Gawaz, Meinrad; Geisler, Tobias; Althaus, Karina; Rosenberger, Peter; Bakchoul, Tamam",Thromb. haemost,,276

213668,A study of higher education students' self-perceived digital competences for learning and everyday life online participation,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists are a high-risk group for COVID-19. Although the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on physical health are well-documented, the psychological impact is frequently overlooked. AIMS: The aim of this study was to gauge the psychological impact of COVID-19 on ENT specialists in Ireland. METHODS: A national, cross-sectional, web-based survey was distributed to ENT specialists during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (21st May 2020-21st June 2020). The questionnaire collected sociodemographic and COVID-19 related data. The GAD-7 was utilized to measure symptoms of clinically significant anxiety disorder. RESULTS: Thirty-eight ENT specialists (M/F:24/12, median age, 38.7 years (23-60 years)) completed the survey. About 34% (n = 13) of participants screened positive for an anxiety disorder, of which 2 (5%) had moderate symptoms. The majority of participants (n = 32, 84%) felt ENT specialists had increased exposure to SARS-CoV-2 compared with other medical specialties. Additionally, 32% (n = 12) felt incapable of protecting themselves from infection. An encouraging proportion of ENT specialists (n = 22, 58%) were aware of psychological support available from national and institutional organizations. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term psychological sequelae of COVID-19 will be felt as the physical burden eases. As we adjust to new normalities, ENT surgeons must be conscientious of the mental health issues that arise from the working environment. Sources of anxiety emanated from a lack of control over infection risk, increased vulnerability to COVID-19 relative to other specialties and the implications this has for ENT specialists and their families. Future interventions must focus on increasing awareness of the available psychological support services for our healthcare workers.","Crotty, Thomas J; Corbett, Mel; Gary, Stephen; Davey, Matthew G; Hughes, Joseph P; Keogh, Ivan J; Patil, Nash P; Doherty, Eva",Ir. j. med. sci,,276

The recent epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has promptly become outbreaks to identify early action from suspected cases at the primary stage over the risk prediction. It is overbearing to progress a control system that will locate the coronavirus. At present, the confirmation of COVID-19 infection by the ideal standard test of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) by the extension of RNA viral, although it presents identified from deficiencies of long reversal time to generate results in 2-4 h of corona with a necessity of certified laboratories. In this proposed system, a machine learning (ML) algorithm is used to classify the textual clinical report into four classes by using the textual data mining method. The algorithm of the ensemble ML classifier has performed feature extraction using the advanced techniques of term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF/IDF) which is an effective information retrieval technique from the corona dataset. Humans get infected by coronaviruses in three ways: first, mild respiratory disease which is globally pandemic, and human coronaviruses are caused by HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-229E; second, the zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); and finally, higher case casualty rate defined as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). By using the machine learning techniques, the three-way COVID-19 stages are classified by the extraction of the feature using the data retrieval process. The TF/IDF is used to measure and evaluate statistically the text data mining of COVID-19 patient's record list for classification and prediction of the coronavirus. This study established the feasibility of techniques to analyze blood tests and machine learning as an alternative to rRT-PCR for detecting the category of COVID-19-positive patients.","Ramanathan, Shalini; Ramasundaram, Mohan",J Supercomput,,276

216295,Avoiding the dark side of digital transformation in teaching. an institutional reference framework for eLearning in higher education,2021,"Background: Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children is associated with better outcomes than in adults. The inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection in children remains poorly characterised. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the medical records of 127 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 1 month to 16 years from Wuhan and Jingzhou of Hubei Province. Patients presented between January 25th and March 24th 2020. Information on clinical features, laboratory results, plasma cytokines/chemokines and lymphocyte subsets were analysed. Findings: Children admitted to hospital with COVID-19 were more likely to be male (67.7%) and the median age was 7.3 [IQR 4.9] years. All but one patient with severe disease was aged under 2 and the majority (5/7) had significant co-morbidities. Despite 53% having viral pneumonia on computed tomography (CT) scanning only 2 patients had low lymphocyte counts and no differences were observed in the levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- &#945; , and interferon (IFN)- Î³ between patients with mild, moderate or severe disease. Interpretations: We observed that the immune responses of children to COVID-19 infection is significantly different from that seen in adults. Our evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 does not trigger a robust inflammatory response or 'cytokine storm' in children with COVID-19, and this may underlie the generally better outcomes seen in children with this disease.","Qian, Guoqing; Zhang, Yong; Xu, Yang; Hu, Weihua; Hall, Ian P; Yue, Jiang; Lu, Hongyun; Ruan, Liemin; Ye, Maoqing; Mei, Jin",EClinicalMedicine,,276
217077,Secondary school mathematics teachers' views on E-learning implementation barriers during the COVID-19 pandemic: The case of Indonesia,2020,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and program adherence to an adult outdoor group sport play program designed to maximize enjoyment that was modified to incorporate COVID-19 risk mitigation strategies. We enrolled 17 healthy, but sedentary, central Pennsylvania adults (meanage = 31.6 ± 7.3) without obesity via mail advertisements to participate in four, 60-minute sessions of instructor-led modified sport games (e.g., handball, Ultimate Frisbee, soccer) over a two-week period in October 2020. There were approximately 1000-2000 new cases of COVID-19 daily in central Pennsylvania during recruitment and the study period. The overall adherence rate was 91%, and no participants reported new or existing COVID-19 symptoms or diagnoses during the two-week study period or 10-days following the final session. Despite enforcing mandatory COVID-19 safety measures (e.g., universal masking, social distancing), the participants reported enjoying the program and feeling socially connected with one another, while perceiving the program to be safe. Additionally, all participants expressed a desire to participate again, if the program were held in the future. These results suggest that an outdoor group sport play program for adults can be feasible, acceptable, and well-adhered to despite enforcing mandatory COVID-19 safety precautions. Physical activity programs similar to the one presented here may provide an easily-adaptable approach to outdoor physical activity during the current and potential future pandemics that have viral transmission characteristics similar to COVID-19.","Ladwig, Matthew A.; Sciamanna, Christopher N.; Rutt, Kayla Blaker Joshua Kearcher Kalen Auer Brandon J.; Rovniak, Liza S.; Conroy, David E.; Gottschall, Jinger S.; Silvis, Matthew L.; Smyth, Joshua M.; Wang, Ming",Preventive Medicine Reports,,276

Nutritional strategies to protect against decrements in performance and potential injury risk may differ for these two groups. A cross sectional analysis was conducted to determine energy and macronutrient characteristics associated with performance metrics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 78 male subjects (age: 28.4 ± 6.0 years, height: 178.3 ± 6.7 cm, mass: 84.3 ± 9.4 kg, 8.5 ± 5.8 years of service) assigned to Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command completed a 1-day performance assessment. Body mass, lean body mass, fat mass (FM), aerobic capacity (VO2max), lactate inflection point (LT), anaerobic power, anaerobic capacity, knee flexion strength, knee extension strength, peak knee flexion strength, and peak knee extension strength outcome values were recorded. Dietary intake was collected using automated self-administered 24-hour dietary recall (ASA24). Performance assessment scores were compared with macronutrient intake and controlled for energy intake using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Differences in knee flexion strength, knee extension strength, peak knee flexion strength, and peak knee extension strength were significant across low (LPRO), medium (MPRO), and high (HPRO) protein intake groups (p < 0.05) with LPRO performance metrics significantly lower than both MPRO and HPRO and MPRO significantly lower than HPRO. FM was significantly higher in LPRO than MPRO or HPRO (p < 0.05). Low carbohydrate intake (LCHO) was associated with greater body mass and FM compared with high (HCHO) (p < 0.05). There was no association between fat intake and any variable. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in protein intake may have beneficial performance effects independent of total energy intake, while moderate increases in carbohydrate intake may not be sufficient to enhance physical performance in a special operations population.","Ross, Jeremy A; Thomas, D Travis; Winters, Joshua D; Royer, Scott D; Halagarda, Christopher J; Sheppard, Ryan; Abt, John; Heebner, Nicholas R",Mil. med,,276

Particularly urgent is the need for spiritual care specialists and generalists to address spiritual suffering given the degree of isolation, loneliness, and vulnerability caused by this pandemic. Although spiritual care has long been recognized as one of the domains of quality palliative care, it is often not fully integrated into practice. All disciplines are ultimately responsible for ensuring that spiritual care is prioritized to improve quality of life and the experience of patients and families facing spiritual emergencies amid the complex life-and-death scenarios inherent to coronavirus disease 2019. Although the pandemic has revealed serious fault lines in many health care domains, it has also underscored the need to recommit to spiritual care as an essential component of whole-person palliative care.","Ferrell, Betty R; Handzo, George; Picchi, Tina; Puchalski, Christina; Rosa, William E",J Pain Symptom Manage,,276

219155,Using Critical Analysis of Scientific Literature to Maintain an Interactive Learning Environment for In-Person and Online Course Modalities,2021,"Despite the increasing personalization of medicine, surprisingly ~37.0°C (98.6°F) continues as the estimate of normal temperature. We investigated between-subject and within-subject thermal variability, whether a significant percentage of individuals have a low mean oral temperature, and whether these differ by sex, age, time of day, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), or menstrual phase. Oral temperature was measured by Life Brand® Fast-Read Digital Oral Thermometers and sampled 14 times over two weeks, seven morning and seven evening readings. The volunteer sample consisted of 96 adults (42 men, 54 women; 27 couples, 42 singletons), ages 18-67 years. We found sizeable individual differences in body temperature and that the normal temperature of many individuals is considerably lower than 37.0°C (98.6°F). Mean temperatures ranged from 35.2°C (95.4°F) to 37.4°C (99.3°F). The mean temperature across all participants was 36.1°C (97.0°F)-lower than most studies have reported, consistent with recent evidence of temperature declining over decades. 77% had mean temperatures at least 0.55°C (1°F) lower than 37.0°C (98.6°F). Mean temperature did not differ by age, but women had higher temperatures than men, even within a couple with room temperature and warmth of clothing equated. Although oral temperature varied widely across individuals, it showed marked stability within individuals over days. Variability of temperature over days did not differ by sex, but was larger among younger adults. Using 37.0°C (98.6°F) as the assumed normal temperature for everyone can result in healthcare professionals failing to detect a serious fever in individuals with a low normal temperature or obtaining false negatives for those individuals when using temperature to screen for COVID-19, mistaking their elevated temperature as normal. Some have called for lowering the estimate of normal temperature slightly (e.g., 0.2°C [0.36°F]). That still seems an overly high estimate. More important, using any standardized ""normal"" temperature will lead to errors for many people. Individual differences are simply too great. Personalizing body temperature is needed. Temperature could be measured at yearly doctor visits, as blood pressure is now. That would be simple to implement. Since our results show marked thermal stability within an individual, sampling temperature only once yearly could provide an accurate indication of a person's normal temperature at that time of day. Such records over time would also provide a more accurate understanding of how temperature changes over the lifespan.","Diamond, Adele; Lye, Carolyn T; Prasad, Deepali; Abbott, David",PLoS One,,276

Safety outcomes were compared between patients with an estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) < 30 mL/min and an eCrCl &#8805; 30 mL/min. The primary endpoint was acute kidney injury (AKI) at the end of treatment (EOT).Results: Of 359 patients who received remdesivir, 347 met inclusion criteria. Patients with an eCrCl < 30 mL/min were older [median, 80 years (IQR, 63.8-89) versus 62 (IQR, 54-74); P<0.001], were more likely to be on vasopressors on the day of remdesivir administration (30% versus 12.7%; P=0.003), and were more likely to be mechanically ventilated during remdesivir therapy (27.5% versus 12.4%; P=0.01) compared to those with an eCrCl &#8805; 30 mL/min. Despite these confounders, there was no significant difference in the frequency of EOT AKI (5% versus 2.3%; P=0.283) or early discontinuation due to abnormal LFTs (0% versus 3.9%; P=0.374). Of the 5% of patients who developed EOT AKI on remdesivir with an eCrCl <30mL/min, no cases were attributable to remdesivir administration per the treating physician. Comparable safety outcomes were observed when 1:1 nearest neighbor matching was applied to account for baseline confounders.Conclusion: Remdesivir administration was not significantly associated with increased EOT AKI in patients with an eCrCl < 30mL/min compared to patients with an eCrCl &#8805; 30mL/min.","Ackley, Tyler W; Mcmanus, Dayna; Topal, Jeffrey E; Cicali, Brian; Shah, Sunish",,,276

Increasingly, volunteer translators have been using social media platforms to self-organize and carry out urgent translation tasks that effectively complement official disaster relief efforts. However, the role of crowdsourced translations and the capacity of volunteer translators in reducing the impact of disasters remain underestimated and therefore understudied. Based on semi-structured interviews with five volunteer translators and online observation of their translation practices, this study investigates the role of a volunteer-driven crowdsourced translation effort in facilitating the donation and procurement of medical supplies between Wuhan and the world. By addressing the real challenges of urgent crisis communication in Wuhan in the early stages of the pandemic, this study draws attention to the need to integrate information and communication technologies with multilingual resources for disaster relief.

The therapeutic management of AML requires understanding the mechanisms involved in the fragility and immune dysfunction of AML T lymphocytes. METHODS: In this study, T lymphocytes from healthy donors (HD) and AML patients were used. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from leukemic cells were screened for their microRNA content and impact on T lymphocytes. Flow cytometry, transcriptomic as well as lentiviral transduction techniques were used to carry out the research. RESULTS: We observed increased cell death of T lymphocytes from AML patients. EVs from leukemia myeloid cell lines harbored several miRNAs, including miR-21, and were able to induce T lymphocyte death. Compared to that in HD, miR-21 was overexpressed in both the bone marrow fluid and infiltrating T lymphocytes of AML patients. MiR-21 induces T lymphocyte cell death by upregulating proapoptotic gene expression. It also increases the immunosuppressive profile of T lymphocytes by upregulating the IL13, IL4, IL10, and FoxP3 genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that miR-21 plays a significant role in AML T lymphocyte dysfunction and apoptosis. Targeting miR-21 may be a novel approach to restore the efficacy of the immune response against AML.","Moussa Agha, Douâa; Rouas, Redouane; Najar, Mehdi; Bouhtit, Fatima; Fayyad-Kazan, Hussein; Lagneaux, Laurence; Bron, Dominique; Meuleman, Nathalie; Lewalle, Philippe; Merimi, Makram",,,276

223170,Non-interaction and identity change in Covid-19 tourism,2021,"The current revival of the American economy is being predicated on social distancing, specifically the Six-Foot Rule, a guideline that offers little protection from pathogen-bearing aerosol droplets sufficiently small to be continuously mixed through an indoor space. The importance of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized. While tools for risk assessment have recently been developed, no safety guideline has been proposed to protect against it. We here build on models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive an indoor safety guideline that would impose an upper bound on the ""cumulative exposure time,"" the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space. We demonstrate how this bound depends on the rates of ventilation and air filtration, dimensions of the room, breathing rate, respiratory activity and face mask use of its occupants, and infectiousness of the respiratory aerosols. By synthesizing available data from the best-characterized indoor spreading events with respiratory drop size distributions, we estimate an infectious dose on the order of 10 aerosol-borne virions. The new virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) is thus inferred to be an order of magnitude more infectious than its forerunner (SARS-CoV), consistent with the pandemic status achieved by COVID-19. Case studies are presented for classrooms and nursing homes, and a spreadsheet and online app are provided to facilitate use of our guideline. Implications for contact tracing and quarantining are considered, and appropriate caveats enumerated. Particular consideration is given to respiratory jets, which may substantially elevate risk when face masks are not worn.","Bazant, Martin Z; Bush, John W M",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A,,276

Compared with non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks or African Americans were more likely [adjusted PD, 7.8 percentage points (95% CI: 5.7 to 10.0)] and non-Hispanic Asians were less likely [adjusted PD, -13.7 percentage points (95% CI: -22.3 to -5.0)] to have &#8805;1 diagnosed comorbidity after adjusting for age differences. There were no meaningful differences between non-Hispanic Whites and adults in other racial/ethnic groups. Those with low income were more likely to have &#8805;1 diagnosed comorbidity [PD, 7.3 percentage points (95% CI: 5.1 to 9.4)]. CONCLUSIONS: Among adults receiving HIV care, non-Hispanic Blacks and those with low income were more likely to have &#8805;1 diagnosed comorbidity associated with severe COVID-19. Building health equity among people with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic may require reducing the impact of comorbidities in heavily affected communities.","Weiser, John K; Tie, Yunfeng; Beer, Linda; Neblett Fanfair, Robyn; Shouse, Roy Luke",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,,276
223728,Why MAC clauses are no Covid-19 silver bullet,2020,"Abstract This article explores people?s preferences for different containment strategies and policy programmes for managing COVID-19 risks. Using a survey experiment administered to an online sample of 1?562 Italian respondents in April 2020, we test whether and to what extent individual preferences are influenced by different framings of equivalent scenarios on gains and losses attached to alternative policy measures aimed at containing the health and economic costs of the pandemic. We find that subjects tend to be more risk-averse or risk-seeking depending on whether they are confronted with a positive (gain) or a negative (loss) description of the consequences of the proposed policy initiatives. The results yield relevant implications for our understanding of citizens? support for national and EU-wide responses to the coronavirus pandemic and the role of framing in contexts of crisis.","Olmastroni, Francesco Guidi Mattia Martini Sergio Isernia Pierangelo",Swiss Political Science Review,,276
223737,Moving a Large-Lecture Organic POGIL Classroom to an Online Setting,2020,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, limited data exist on patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. To describe the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and short-term outcomes of patients diagnosed with VTE during hospitalization for COVID-19. This is a prospective multinational study of patients with incident VTE during the course of hospitalization for COVID-19. Data were obtained from the Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad TromboEmbólica (RIETE) registry. All-cause mortality, VTE recurrences, and major bleeding during the first 10 days were separately investigated for patients in hospital wards versus those in intensive care units (ICUs). As of May 03, 2020, a total number of 455 patients were diagnosed with VTE (83% pulmonary embolism, 17% isolated deep vein thrombosis) during their hospital stay; 71% were male, the median age was 65 (interquartile range, 55-74) years. Most patients (68%) were hospitalized in medical wards, and 145 in ICUs. Three hundred and seventeen (88%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 84-91%) patients were receiving thromboprophylaxis at the time of VTE diagnosis. Most patients (88%) received therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin, and 15 (3.6%) received reperfusion therapies. Among 420 patients with complete 10-day follow-up, 51 (12%; 95% CI: 9.3-15%) died, no patient recurred, and 12 (2.9%; 95% CI: 1.6-4.8%) experienced major bleeding. The 10-day mortality rate was 9.1% (95% CI: 6.1-13%) among patients in hospital wards and 19% (95% CI: 13-26%) among those in ICUs. This study provides characteristics and early outcomes of patients diagnosed with acute VTE during hospitalization for COVID-19. Additional studies are needed to identify the optimal strategies to prevent VTE and to mitigate adverse outcomes associated.","Fernández-Capitán, Carmen; Barba, Raquel; Díaz-Pedroche, María Del Carmen; Sigüenza, Patricia; Demelo-Rodriguez, Pablo; Siniscalchi, Carmine; Pedrajas, José María; Farfán-Sedano, Ana I; Olivera, Pavel Eduardo; Gómez-Cuervo, Covadonga; Llamas, Pilar; Villares, Paula; Sanchez, Olivier; López-Reyes, Raquel; Catella, Judith; Bikdeli, Behnood; Weinberg, Ido; Tafur, Alfonso J; Jiménez, David; Monreal, Manuel",Semin. thromb. hemost,,276

Accumulating evidence indicates a difference in chest computed tomography (CT) features and duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding between children and adults. Here, we report a family case of COVID-19 pneumonia in which two brothers (age 14 years and 2 years) had different findings. On admission, the 2-year-old had few symptoms with no sign of pneumonia, whereas the older brother had presented with pneumonia on admission. Both were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on polymerase chain reaction. They both had obvious characteristic signs of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT. However, CT findings in the younger brother were non-specific and similar to other pneumonias. The older brother required longer treatment because of a longer shedding period of SARS-CoV-2 detected in nasopharyngeal samples. Both boys were discharged without complications. This family case suggests that the clinical features of COVID-19 pneumonia might differ between younger and older children.","Ochiai, Shigeki; Kama, Yuichi; Hirai, Kota; Yano, Hidetoshi; Tada, Ayumi; Kaiga, Chinami; Sakama, Takashi; Takakura, Hiromitsu; Yamaguchi, Koichi; Mochizuki, Hiroyuki; Kato, Masahiko",Jpn. j. infect. dis,,276

We apply the method to a pulse-pumped, specially engineered fiber parametric amplifier and demonstrate temporally multiplexed multi-dimensional quantum entanglement of continuous variables in telecom wavelength. The temporal mode characterization technique can be generalized to other pulse-excited systems to find their eigen modes for multiplexing in temporal domain.","Huo, Nan; Liu, Yuhong; Li, Jiamin; Cui, Liang; Chen, Xin; Palivela, Rithwik; Xie, Tianqi; Li, Xiaoying; Ou, Z.

226891,Utility of asymptomatic inpatient testing for COVID-19 in a low-prevalence setting: A multicenter point-prevalence study,2020,"Gendered languages assign masculine and feminine grammatical gender to all nouns, including nonhuman entities. In French and Spanish, the name of the disease resulting from the virus (COVID-19) is grammatically feminine, whereas the virus that causes the disease (coronavirus) is masculine. In this research, we test whether the grammatical gender mark affects judgments. In a series of experiments with French and Spanish speakers, we show that grammatical gender affects virus-related judgments consistent with gender stereotypes: feminine- (vs. masculine-) marked terms for the virus lead individuals to assign lower stereotypical masculine characteristics to the virus, which in turn reduces their danger perceptions. The effect generalizes to precautionary consumer behavior intentions (e.g., avoiding restaurants, movies, public transportation, etc.) as well as to other diseases, and is moderated by individual differences in chronic gender stereotyping. These effects occur even though the grammatical gender assignment is semantically arbitrary.","Mecit, Alican; Shrum, L J; Lowrey, Tina M",,,276

227688,The lonely struggle with autonomy: A case study of first-year university students’ experiences during emergency online teaching,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Our departmental planning for COVID-19 was actioned a week before the lockdown (13th March 2020). We look at a 7- week lockdown activity for all scheduled outpatient clinics and urgent procedures. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 2361 outpatient clinic slots (52.6% oncology slots and 47.4% benign urology slots) were scheduled during this period. The oncology slots included 330 (26.5%) flexible cystoscopy, 555 (44.7%) prostate cancer and 357(28.8%) non-prostate cancer slots. The benign urology slots included 323 (28.8%) andrology, 193 (17.2%) stones and 603 (54%) lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) slots. Of the total oncology outpatient slots (n = 1242), 66.3% were virtual consultations, 20% were face-to-face and 13.6% were cancelled. Of the total benign outpatient slots (n = 1119), 81% were virtual consultations, 9.7% were face-to-face and 9.3% were cancelled. A total of 116 anaesthetic surgical procedures were carried out, of which 54 (46.5%) were oncological procedures, 18 (15.5%) were benign urological procedures, and 44 (38%) were diagnostic procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals and urologists can benefit from the model used by our hospital to mitigate the impact and prioritise patients most in need of urgent care. Reorganisation and flexibility of healthcare delivery is paramount in these troubled times and will allow clinical activity without compromising patient safety.","Somani, Bhaskar K; Pietropaolo, Amelia; Coulter, Primrose; Smith, Julian",Scott Med J,,276
228514,A mindful shift: an opportunity for mindfulness-driven tourism in a post-pandemic world,2020,"BACKGROUND: In order to help farmers and industries develop value-added composite and nano materials from agricultural residuals. Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were made by using a TEMPO oxidation method and celluloses were prepared by acid-base method and extracting method, which were all from corn stalk, an agricultural residual. The prepared celluloses were dissolved separately in DMAc/LiCl solvent and added CNFs of 0.0, 0.5, 1.5 and 3.0% to form all-cellulose nanocomposite, and then casted into films. Morphology, structure and properties of the nanocomposite films were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and mechanical testing. RESULTS: The all-cellulose nanocomposite films with different cellulose cellulose matrix exhibited a good optical transparency and layer structure. The all-cellulose nanocomposites films with the cellulose prepared by the extracting method (Composite E) exhibited a higher crystallinity, better thermal stability and higher mechanical strength than those of the all-cellulose nanocomposites films with the cellulose prepared by the acid-base method (Composite A). CONCLUSION: Crystal structure of the all-cellulose nanocomposite films all presented a co-existence of Cellulose I and Cellulose II. However, on the contrary to Composite A, the diffraction intensity of Cellulose I in Composite E was higher than that of Cellulose II. This was another reason that the mechanical properties of Composite E were superior to Composite A. In addition, the mechanical properties of the all-cellulose nanocomposites films were significantly different when the addition of CNF reached 3.0% in weight, as indicated by a multiple-range comparison.

228795,A ‘new (ab)normal’?: Scrutinising the work-life balance of academics under lockdown,2020,"Newly designed styrylimidazolium-based grafted anion-exchange membranes (StIm-AEMs), in which imidazolium ionic groups are attached to styrene at the far side from the graft chains, were prepared by radiation-induced graft polymerization of p-(2-imidazoliumyl) styrene onto poly(ethylene-co-tetrafluoloethylene) (ETFE) films, followed by N-alkylation and ion-exchange reactions. StIm-AEM having an ion exchange capacity (IEC) of 0.54 mmol g-1 with a grafting degree (GD) of â¼18%, possesses practical conductivity (>50 mS cm-1) even with a very low water uptake (â¼10%) and high stability over 600 h in a 1 M KOH solution at 80 °C. There exists a critical IEC (IECc) in the range of 0.7-0.8 mmol g-1 over which the membrane showed high water uptake, which resulted in pronounced susceptibility to hydrolysis. Using small-angle neutron scattering technique with a contrast variation method, we found the hydrophilic phase in StIm-AEMs with IECs lower and higher than IECc shows ""reverse-micelles"" with water domains dispersed in the polymer matrix and ""micelles"" with graft polymer aggregates dispersed in the water matrix, respectively. The further analysis of micelle structures using the hard-sphere liquid model and Porod limit analysis reveals that the interfacial structures of ionic groups are essential for the electrochemical properties and durability of StIm-AEMs. In addition, StIm-AEM with an IEC of 0.95 mmol g-1 and the maximum power density of 80 mW cm-2 in the hydrazine hydrate fuel cell test, exhibited long-term durability under constant current (8.0 mA) up to 455 h, which, thus far, is the best durability at 80 °C for platinum-free alkaline-type liquid fuel cells.","Zhao, Yue; Yoshimura, Kimio; Mahmoud, Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed; Yu, Hwan-Chul; Okushima, Shun; Hiroki, Akihiro; Kishiyama, Yoshihiro; Shishitani, Hideyuki; Yamaguchi, Susumu; Tanaka, Hirohisa; Noda, Yohei; Koizumi, Satoshi; Radulescu, Aurel; Maekawa, Yasunari",,,276

238524,Open Innovation Initiatives to Tackle COVID-19 Crises: Imposter Open Innovation and Openness in Data,2020,"BACKGROUND: The global pandemic of Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has plunged the world into both social and economic disarray, with vaccines still emerging and a continued paucity of personal protective equipment; the pandemic has also highlighted the potential for rapid emergence of aggressive respiratory pathogens and the need for preparedness. Avian immunoglobulins (IgY) have been previously shown in animal models to protect against new infection and mitigate established infection when applied intranasally. We carried out a proof-of-concept study to address the feasibility of using such antibodies as mucosally-applied prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Hens were immunized with recombinant S1 spike glycoprotein of the virus, and the resulting IgY was evaluated for binding specificity, inhibition of glycoprotein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein (the requisite binding site for the virus), and inhibition of viral replication in Vero cell culture. RESULTS: Titers of anti-S1 glycoprotein IgY were evident in yolks at 14 days post-immunization, peaking at 21 days, and at peak concentrations of 16.8 mg/ml. IgY showed strong and significant inhibition of S1/ACE2 binding interactions, and significantly inhibited viral replication at a concentration of 16.8 mg/ml. Four weeks' collection from eggs of two hens produced a total of 1.55 grams of IgY. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept study we showed that avian immunoglobulins (IgY) raised against a key virulence factor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus successfully inhibited the critical initial adhesion of viral spike glycoproteins to human ACE2 protein receptors and inhibited viral replication in vitro, in a short period using only two laying hens. We conclude that production of large amounts of IgY inhibiting viral binding and replication of SARS-CoV-2 is feasible, and that incorporation of this or similar material into an intranasal spray and/or other mucosal protecting products may be effective at reducing infection and spread of COVID-19.","Artman, Chad; Brumfield, Kyle D; Khanna, Sahil; Goepp, Julius",PLoS One,,276

240415,How to Sustain Your Organization's Culture When Everyone Is Remote,2020,"A sudden outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in Wuhan, China in December 2019 quickly grew into a global pandemic, putting at risk not only the global healthcare system, but also the world economy As the disease continues to spread rapidly, the development of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches is urgently required Although some progress has been made in understanding the viral structure and invasion mechanism of coronaviruses that may cause severe cases of the syndrome, due to the limited understanding of the immune effects caused by SARS-CoV-2, it is difficult for us to prevent patients from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF), the major complications of coronavirus infection Therefore, any potential treatments should focus not only on direct killing of coronaviruses and prevention strategies by vaccine development, but also on keeping in check the acute immune/inflammatory responses, resulting in ARDS and PF In addition, potential treatments currently under clinical trials focusing on killing coronaviruses or on developing vaccines preventing coronavirus infection largely ignore the host immune response However, taking care of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with ARDS and PF is considered to be the major difficulty Therefore, further understanding of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is extremely important for clinical resolution and saving medication cost In addition to a breif overview of the structure, infection mechanism, and possible therapeutic approaches, we summarized and compared the hematopathologic effect and immune responses to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 Also the basic molecular mechanisms of an atypical pneumonia and molecular targets SARS-CoV-2 that allows to allocate 8 basic directions of search of pharmacological agents for struggle with SARS-CoV-2 are discussed Mathematical methods of search of perspective preparations for struggle with COVID-19 are in detail discussed The pathophysiological mechanisms of an infection inducing a lymphopenia or cytokine storm that allows to allocate a special direction of search of pharmacological preparations for struggle against new coronaviruse SARS-CoV-2 are discussed Внезапная вспышка COVID-19, вызванная новым коронавирусом SARS-CoV-2, в Ухане (Китай) в декабре 2019 г быстро переросла в глобальную пандемию, поставив под угрозу не только глобальную систему здравоохранения, но и мировую экономику Поскольку болезнь продолжает быстро распространяться, срочно требуется разработка профилактических мероприятий и терапевтических стратегий поиска средств лечения Хотя был достигнут определенный прогресс в понимании структуры вируса и механизма инвазии коронавирусов SARS, которые могут вызывать тяжелые случаи пневмонии, однако, из-за ограниченного понимания иммунных эффектов, вызванных SARS-CoV-2, пока трудно предотвратить развитие у пациентов острого респираторного дистресс-синдрома (ОРДС) и легочного фиброза (ЛФ), основных осложнений коронавирусной инфекции Поэтому любые потенциальные методы лечения должны быть сосредоточены не только на прямом уничтожении коронавирусов и стратегиях профилактики путем разработки вакцин, но и на контроле за острыми иммунными/воспалительными реакциями, приводящими к ОРДС и ЛФ Кроме того, перспективные методы лечения, которые в настоящее время проходят клинические испытания с упором на уничтожение коронавирусов и на разработку вакцин, предотвращающих коронавирусную инфекцию, в значительной степени игнорируют иммунный ответ хозяина Основной трудностью считается оказание помощи больным ОРДС и ЛФ, инфицированным SARS-CоV-2 Дальнейшее понимание иммунного ответа человека на SARS-CоV-2 чрезвычайно важно для клинического разрешения и экономии затрат на лекарства В дополнение к обзору структуры коронавируса, механизма инфекции и возможных терапевтических подходов мы суммировали гемопатологические эффекты и иммунные реакции на SARS-CоV, MERS-CоV и SARS-CоV-2 Также обсуждаются основные молекулярные механизмы атипичной пневмонии и молекулярные мишени SARS-CоV-2, что позволяет выделить 8 основных направлений поиска фармакологических средств для борьбы с SARS-CоV-2 Подробно обсуждаются математические методы поиска перспективных препаратов для борьбы с COVID-19, а также патофизиологические механизмы инфекции, индуцирующие цитокиновый шторм, что позволяет выделить особое направление поиска фармакологических препаратов для борьбы с новым коронавирусом SARS-CoV-2","Vashchenko, Vladimir I.; Vilyaninov, Vladimir N.; Shabanov, Petr D.",Reviews on Clinical Pharmacology and Drug Therapy,,276

241963,Can investors benefit from corporate social responsibility and portfolio model during the covid19 pandemic?,2021,"Introduction Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) affect nearly all individuals with AD Agitation in AD (Agit-AD) is one of the most common NPS, with an estimated prevalence over 40% Agit-AD is a major cause of distress and burden for AD caregivers and may be driven by disrupted circadian rhythms and sleep In healthy individuals, the circadian clock that generates these rhythms regulates patterns in mood, wakefulness, and other physiologic processes, such as body temperature and hormone levels Individuals with Agit-AD may experience disturbance in their circadian rhythms such that aggressive and disruptive behavior is increased This project aims to examine if agitated AD subjects (AgitAD+) express delayed circadian phases and reduced rhythm strength as compared to non-agitated AD subjects (AgitAD-) and healthy controls Additionally, we seek to 1) evaluate if circadian phase and rhythm strength vary between subtypes of Agit-AD (affective dysregulation vs executive dysfunction);and to 2) compare sleep amount, sleep quality, and degree of sleep disordered breathing among AgitAD+ subjects vs AgitAD- subjects and healthy controls Methods We studied 25 subjects (Table 1): 15 AgitAD+ subjects, 8 AgitAD- subjects, and 2 age-matched healthy controls (HC) Participants completed wrist actigraphy for one week to quantify rest/activity rhythms and sleep;consumed an ingestible, disposable temperature sensor for 1-2 days to quantify core body temperature, a marker of the endogenous circadian rhythm;and completed a single night of home sleep testing (HST;Table 2) Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of AD and age 55-90 years, and exclusion criteria include seizures, significant tremors, delirium, using CPAP for sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and circadian rhythm disorders NPS were measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician Version (NPI-C), the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Neurobehavioral Rating Scale (NBRS), and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) Agit-AD was defined using criteria from the International Psychogeriatric Association AgitAD+ subjects had clinically significant agitation, defined as NPI-C Agitation or Aggression subtotals ≥ 4 Disease progression was measured using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), and subjects underwent a physical and neurological exam Cognition was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), Animal Naming (AN), and the Trail-Making Test (parts A & B) Sleep questionnaires included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) Caregivers were asked to complete a sleep diary for subjects and an agitation log over the week they completed actigraphy Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented hybrid visits with telemedicine to limit in-person interactions Results 25 subjects have completed the study to date There were no statistically significant differences observed in actigraphy-derived sleep parameters between agitated and non-agitated AD subjects (2-group t-test);see Table 1) However, significant differences between the groups have been observed in the rest/activity rhythms: compared to subjects without agitation (AgitAD-), AgitAD+ subjects had lower levels of activity in the morning and greater activity in the afternoon and evening (Figure 1) We also have performed function-on-scalar regression (FOSR) (Goldsmith et al , 2015, Biometrics 71:344-353) using subject-specific activity profiles as outcomes and age and agitation/control status as predictors Figure 2 shows functional effects of age on rest/activity rhythm (left panel) and the functional effect of agitation status (right panel);the red background shows times of day during which there were statistically significant differences, using the pointwise method of analysis (p&lt;0 05) After adjustment for age, agitation was associated with lower activity in the morning period and a trend towards greater activity in the afternoon and evening period (not statistically significant) This preliminary finding may suggest that AgitAD+ subjects express lower and delayed activity rhythms Additionally, the HST results show a trend toward less REM sleep and longer initial REM latency in the AgitAD+ group (Table 2) Updated results will be presented at AAGP (estimated 6-10 additional subjects) Conclusions The collection of multimodal noninvasive data on sleep, activity, and core body temperature is feasible in agitated AD outpatients This study could provide evidence for CRD/sleep disturbance as a driver of Agit-AD and could identify Agit-AD subtypes who are most likely to benefit from chronobiotic or sleep interventions for Agit-AD Furthermore, this study could provide evidence for the use of actigraphy as a surrogate biomarker in proof-of-concept intervention studies targeting Agit-AD Funding National Institute on

The cross-sectional data were collected using the time-lag design to avoid the common method bias as much as possible. Regression results using structural equation modeling show that the internalized stigmatization of epicenter travel experiences may have positive relationships with mental health problems (i.e., anxiety, depression, and shame), and such relationships can be moderated by social support. Specifically, the positive relationships between internalized stigmatization and mental health problems are buffered/strengthened when social support is at a high/low level. The findings of this study suggest that, in this epidemic, people who have epicenter travel experience could be affected by internalized stigmatization, no matter whether they have ever got infected.","Li, Jiannan; Liang, Wenqi; Yuan, Bocong; Zeng, Guojun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,276

Most state-of-the-art Visual Recognition systems lack the ability to perform amodal recognition. Few studies have achieved amodal recognition through passive prediction or embodied recognition approaches. However, these approaches suffer from challenges in real-world applications, such as dynamic objects. We propose SeekNet, an improved optimization method for amodal recognition through embodied visual recognition. Additionally, we implement SeekNet for social robots, where there are multiple interactions with crowded humans. Hence, we focus on occluded human detection&tracking and showcase the superiority of our algorithm over other baselines. We also experiment with SeekNet to improve the confidence of COVID-19 symptoms pre-screening algorithms using our efficient embodied recognition system.","Narayanan, Venkatraman; Manoghar, Bala Murali; RamaPrashanth, RV; Bera, Aniket",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08682v1.pdf,276

245008,"The role of Urban Control and Command Centers in the face of COVID-19: The case of COR in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Healthcare workers are often exposed to secondary traumatic stress. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak caused intense psychological pressure in various healthcare professionals, with increased risk of post-traumatic stress disorder. Objective of our study was to evaluate the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder in italian residents in Intensive Care and Emergency Departments facing COVID-19 emergency. METHODS: We developed a short, anonymous web-questionnaire to obtain data regarding sociodemographic, professional characteristics, history of psychological trauma, psychotherapy, use of psychiatric medications and the presence of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Primary outcome was the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Secondary endpoint was to identify possible risk factors associated with the development of post-traumatic stress disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. A cut-off of 33 identified a probable diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder while a cut-off of 22 identified subclinical post-traumatic stress disorder. RESULTS: 503 residents completed the questionnaire. Among residents who were directly involved in the clinical assistance of COVID-19 patients, 34.3% presented a probable diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, while 21.5% presented subclinical post-traumatic stress disorder. Female gender and history of psychological trauma were significantly associated with the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a high incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder in Italian residents working in Intensive Care Units and Emergency Departments during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. This finding supports the importance of promptly implementing any strategy that might preserve staff mental health.","Pasin, Laura; Sella, Nicolò; Correale, Christelle; Boscolo, Annalisa; Mormando, Giulia; Zordan, Maria; Landoni, Giovanni; Navalesi, Paolo",Acta Biomed,,276

Methods: We implemented the World Health Organization's First Few X cases and contacts investigation protocol for COVID-19. Trained public health professionals collected information on 381 virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases from 31 January 2020 to 9 April 2020. We actively followed up cases to identify exposure to infection, symptoms and outcomes. We also collected limited data on 752 symptomatic people testing negative for COVID-19, as a control group for analyses of the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of symptoms. Findings: Approximately half of the COVID-19 cases were imported (196 cases; 51.4%), of whom the majority had recent travel to Italy (140 cases; 71.4%). Of the 94 (24.7%) secondary cases, almost all reported close contact with a confirmed case (93 cases; 98.9%), many through household contact (37 cases; 39.8%). By age, a lower proportion of children had COVID-19. Most cases presented with cough, fever and fatigue. The sensitivity and specificity of symptoms varied by age, with nonlinear relationships with age. Although the proportion of COVID-19 cases with fever increased with age, for those with other respiratory infections the occurrence of fever decreased with age. The occurrence of shortness of breath also increased with age in a greater proportion of COVID-19 cases. Conclusion: The study has provided useful evidence for generating case definitions and has informed modelling studies of the likely burden of COVID-19.","Boddington, Nicola L; Charlett, Andre; Elgohari, Suzanne; Byers, Chloe; Coughlan, Laura; Vilaplana, Tatiana Garcia; Whillock, Rosie; Sinnathamby, Mary; Panagiotopoulos, Nikolaos; Letley, Louise; MacDonald, Pauline; Vivancos, Roberto; Edeghere, Obaghe; Shingleton, Joseph; Bennett, Emma; Cottrell, Simon; McMenamin, Jim; Zambon, Maria; Ramsay, Mary; Dabrera, Gavin; Saliba, Vanessa; Bernal, Jamie Lopez",Bull World Health Organ,,276

This paper explores the association between rare disasters, macroeconomic policy, and the exchange rate, using COVID-19 as an example. Analysis of data from 27 advanced and emerging economies reveals a strong correlation between COVID-19 and time-varying risk premiums in the foreign exchange market. Moreover, the spread of COVID-19 significantly depreciates the domestic exchange rate in emerging markets, but not in advanced countries. During the COVID-19 crisis, expansionary fiscal policies and unconventional monetary policies led to an appreciation of local currencies. However, conventional expansionary monetary policies had the opposite effect, indicating that the traditional effect of monetary policy on the exchange rate takes precedence even in the event of a rare disaster.","Zhou, Hang Yu Mei Li Jiahui Qin Qilin",Economics letters,,276

This study aims to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands, considering recovery as a competing risk. METHODS: In this observational multicenter cohort study we included adults with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection that were admitted to one of five hospitals in the Netherlands (March to May 2020). We performed a competing risk survival analysis, presenting cause-specific hazard ratios (HRCS) for the effect of preselected factors on the absolute risk of death and recovery. RESULTS: 1,006 patients were included (63.9% male; median age 69 years, IQR: 58-77). Patients were hospitalized for a median duration of 6 days (IQR: 3-13); 243 (24.6%) of them died, 689 (69.9%) recovered, and 74 (7.4%) were censored. Patients with higher age (HRCS 1.10, 95% CI 1.08-1.12), immunocompromised state (HRCS 1.46, 95% CI 1.08-1.98), who used anticoagulants or antiplatelet medication (HRCS 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.88), with higher modified early warning score (MEWS) (HRCS 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18), and higher blood LDH at time of admission (HRCS 6.68, 95% CI 1.95-22.8) had increased risk of death, whereas fever (HRCS 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.95) decreased risk of death. We found no increased mortality risk in male patients, high BMI or diabetes. CONCLUSION: Our competing risk survival analysis confirms specific risk factors for COVID-19 mortality in a the Netherlands, which can be used for prediction research, more intense in-hospital monitoring or prioritizing particular patients for new treatments or vaccination.","Nijman, Gerine; Wientjes, Maike; Ramjith, Jordache; Janssen, Nico; Hoogerwerf, Jacobien; Abbink, Evertine; Blaauw, Marc; Dofferhoff, Ton; van Apeldoorn, Marjan; Veerman, Karin; de Mast, Quirijn; Ten Oever, Jaap; Hoefsloot, Wouter; Reijers, Monique H; van Crevel, Reinout; van de Maat, Josephine S",PLoS One,,276

A better understanding of virus-host interactions may potentiate therapeutic insights toward limiting this infection. Here we investigated the dynamics of the systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters by histological analysis and transcriptional profiling. Infection resulted in consistently high levels of virus in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and sporadic occurrence in other distal tissues. A longitudinal cohort revealed a wave of inflammation, including a type I interferon (IFN-I) response, that was evident in all tissues regardless of viral presence but was insufficient to prevent disease progression. Bolstering the antiviral response with intranasal administration of recombinant IFN-I reduced viral disease, prevented transmission, and lowered inflammation in vivo. This study defines the systemic host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and supports use of intranasal IFN-I as an effective means of early treatment.","Hoagland, Daisy A; Møller, Rasmus; Uhl, Skyler A; Oishi, Kohei; Frere, Justin; Golynker, Ilona; Horiuchi, Shu; Panis, Maryline; Blanco-Melo, Daniel; Sachs, David; Arkun, Knarik; Lim, Jean K; tenOever, Benjamin R",Immunity,,276

These include the impact of specific medications on outcomes and the antibody response after COVID-19 vaccination. RECENT FINDINGS: We summarized the current literature related to COVID-19 outcomes in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, dermatology, and neurology. Overall, we found either no difference or modest differences in risk for severe COVID-19 for people with immune-mediated diseases compared with the general population. When considering disease-specific factors, glucocorticoid use and underlying immune-mediated disease activity were generally associated with worse outcomes. Specific medications varied in associations: tumor necrosis factor inhibitors generally had lower odds for severe COVID-19 outcomes, whereas rituximab use generally had higher odds for severe outcomes. We also detailed the recent reports of antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination in people with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. SUMMARY: Investigations of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases across several organ systems have offered important insight into the COVID-19 disease course. Overall, these studies have provided reassurance to patients and clinicians while also identifying groups who may be at higher risk for poor outcomes.","Sparks, Jeffrey A; Wallace, Zachary S; Robinson, Philip C",Curr Opin Rheumatol,,276

Objective: To assess clinical outcomes with convalescent plasma treatment vs placebo or standard of care in peer-reviewed and preprint publications or press releases of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Data Sources: PubMed, the Cochrane COVID-19 trial registry, and the Living Overview of Evidence platform were searched until January 29, 2021. Study Selection: The RCTs selected compared any type of convalescent plasma vs placebo or standard of care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in any treatment setting. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently extracted data on relevant clinical outcomes, trial characteristics, and patient characteristics and used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. The primary analysis included peer-reviewed publications of RCTs only, whereas the secondary analysis included all publicly available RCT data (peer-reviewed publications, preprints, and press releases). Inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses were conducted to summarize the treatment effects. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, mechanical ventilation use, and serious adverse events. Results: A total of 1060 patients from 4 peer-reviewed RCTs and 10â¯722 patients from 6 other publicly available RCTs were included. The summary risk ratio (RR) for all-cause mortality with convalescent plasma in the 4 peer-reviewed RCTs was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.38), the absolute risk difference was -1.21% (95% CI, -5.29% to 2.88%), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision. Across all 10 RCTs, the summary RR was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.12) and there was moderate certainty of the evidence due to inclusion of unpublished data. Among the peer-reviewed RCTs, the summary hazard ratio was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.07 to 20.34) for length of hospital stay, the summary RR was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.20 to 2.87) for mechanical ventilation use (the absolute risk difference for mechanical ventilation use was -2.56% [95% CI, -13.16% to 8.05%]), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision for both outcomes. Limited data on clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, and serious adverse events showed no significant differences. Conclusions and Relevance: Treatment with convalescent plasma compared with placebo or standard of care was not significantly associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality or with any benefit for other clinical outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was low to moderate for all-cause mortality and low for other outcomes.","Janiaud, Perrine; Axfors, Cathrine; Schmitt, Andreas M; Gloy, Viktoria; Ebrahimi, Fahim; Hepprich, Matthias; Smith, Emily R; Haber, Noah A; Khanna, Nina; Moher, David; Goodman, Steven N; Ioannidis, John P A; Hemkens, Lars G",JAMA,,276

In the population, but also among health care workers (HCWs), there were concerns and skepticism about vaccinations even before the corona pandemic. METHODS: An online survey on the attitude of HCWs to vaccination against SARS-CoV­2 was carried out in December (December 3rd-December 12th, 2020) before and in February (February 1st-February 10th, 2021) after the start of the vaccinations. Members of the German Society for Internal Intensive Care Medicine and Emergency Medicine (DGIIN) and the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care Medicine and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) were invited by email and on Facebook. RESULTS: In December 2305 and in February 3501 people took part. The approval rate for vaccination increased from 85.2% to 92.1% (pâ¯< 0.001). There was also an increase in willingness to vaccinate (63.8% vs. 75.9%; pâ¯< 0.001). The female gender, membership of the professional group nursing staff and age < 45 years were significantly associated with a restricted willingness to vaccinate. There was also a decrease in concerns about efficacy, side effects and long-term damage. There was clear skepticism about the vaccine from AstraZeneca (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Before and after the introduction of vaccinations against SARS-CoV­2, an increase in the willingness to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 can be shown in German HCWs. Technical experts must bring objectivity into the currently controversial debate through precise and transparent information and thus counteract vaccination skepticism, not only among HCWs.","Janssens, Uwe; Kluge, Stefan; Marx, Gernot; Hermes, Carsten; Salzberger, Bernd; Karagiannidis, Christian",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,,276

Design/methodology/approach: School closures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have affected billions of students worldwide, and have had an impact on the economy and the society. With classes being cancelled or taught remotely, the importance of parental intervention in children's education has accelerated. Findings: The authors find that more educated parents allocate more time on child education, while higher income and employment have an adverse effect. Fathers are likely to spend more time than mothers in teaching and educating their children during COVID-19. Practical implications: The findings have implications in identifying children whose education suffers the most in times of a pandemic and determining the main target group of policies designed to train children, encourage parental involvement and support children's educational development. Originality/value: This is the first paper that examines the variations in parental time with children across social and economic subgroups during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors also focus on the time parents spend educating their children rather than just supervising them. The authors additionally examine the determinants of the time children study on their own.

255169,Why capital markets should embrace blockchain,2020,"Acute demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common type of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in Europe, following several viral and bacterial infections. Data on AIDP-patients associated with SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus-2) infection are scarce. We describe the case of a 54-years-old Caucasian female patient with typical clinical and electrophysiological manifestations of AIDP, who was reported positive with PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 3 weeks prior to onset of the neurological symptoms. She did not experience a preceding fever or respiratory symptoms, but a transient loss of smell and taste. At the admission to our neurological department, a progressive proximally pronounced paraparesis, areflexia, and sensory loss with tingling of all extremities were found, which began 10 days before. The modified Erasmus Giullain-Barré Syndrome outcome score (mEGOS) was 3/9 at admission and 1/12 at day 7 of hospitalization. The electrophysiological assessment proved a segmental demyelinating polyneuropathy and cerebrospinal fluid examination showed an albuminocytologic dissociation. The neurological symptoms improved significantly during treatment with immunoglobulins. Our case draws attention to the occurrence of GBS also in patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), who did not experience respiratory or general symptoms. It emphasizes that SARS-CoV-2 induces immunological processes, regardless from the lack of prodromic symptoms. However, it is likely that there is a connection between the severity of the respiratory syndrome and further neurological consequences.","Scheidl, Erika; Canseco, Daniel Diez; Hadji-Naumov, Aleksandar; Bereznai, Benjamin",J Peripher Nerv Syst,,276

Complex political affiliations, the systematic use of explosive weapons and sexual violence, and the use of new communication technology, including social media, have created new challenges for humanitarian actors in negotiating access to affected populations and security for their own personnel. The nature of combatants has also evolved as armed, non-state actors might have varying motivations, use different forms of violence, and engage in a variety of criminal activities to generate requisite funds. New health threats, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and new capabilities, such as modern trauma care, have also created new challenges and opportunities for humanitarian health provision. In response, humanitarian policies and practices must develop negotiation and safety capabilities, informed by political and security realities on the ground, and guidance from affected communities.

258352,Teachers' Voices: Pandemic Lessons for the Future of Education,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates viral entry into cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino-acid fragment of the 1,273-amino-acid S-protein protomer. The RBD is the primary SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing epitope and a critical target of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Here, we show that this RBD conjugated to each of two carrier proteins elicited more potent neutralizing responses in immunized rodents than did a similarly conjugated proline-stabilized S-protein ectodomain. Nonetheless, the native RBD is expressed inefficiently, limiting its usefulness as a vaccine antigen. However, we show that an RBD engineered with four novel glycosylation sites (gRBD) is expressed markedly more efficiently and generates a more potent neutralizing responses as a DNA vaccine antigen than the wild-type RBD or the full-length S protein, especially when fused to multivalent carriers, such as a Helicobacter pylori ferritin 24-mer. Further, gRBD is more immunogenic than the wild-type RBD when administered as a subunit protein vaccine. Our data suggest that multivalent gRBD antigens can reduce costs and doses, and improve the immunogenicity, of all major classes of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.IMPORTANCE All available vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) express or deliver the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. We show that this antigen is not optimal, consistent with observations that the vast majority of the neutralizing response to the virus is focused on the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, this RBD is not expressed well as an independent domain, especially when expressed as a fusion protein with a multivalent scaffold. We therefore engineered a more highly expressed form of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by introducing four glycosylation sites into a face of the RBD normally occluded in the full S protein. We show that this engineered protein, gRBD, is more immunogenic than the wild-type RBD or the full-length S protein in both genetic and protein-delivered vaccines.","Guo, Yan; He, Wenhui; Mou, Huihui; Zhang, Lizhou; Chang, Jing; Peng, Shoujiao; Ojha, Amrita; Tavora, Rubens; Parcells, Mark S; Luo, Guangxiang; Li, Wenhui; Zhong, Guocai; Choe, Hyeryun; Farzan, Michael; Quinlan, Brian D",mBio (Online),,276
258466,A case of letrozole induced mania,2020,"The large and growing burden of chronic heart failure (CHF) on healthcare systems and economies is mainly caused by a high hospital admission rate for acute decompensated heart failure (HF). Several remote monitoring techniques have been developed for early detection of worsening disease, potentially limiting the number of hospitalizations. Over the last years, the scope has been shifting towards the relatively novel invasive sensors capable of measuring intracardiac filling pressures, because it is believed that hemodynamic congestion precedes clinical congestion. Monitoring intracardiac pressures may therefore enable clinicians to intervene and avert hospitalizations in a pre-symptomatic phase. Several techniques have been discussed in this review, and thus far, remote monitoring of pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) by the CardioMEMS (CardioMicroelectromechanical system) HF System is the only technique with proven safety as well as efficacy with regard to the prevention of HF-related hospital admissions. Efforts are currently aimed to further develop existing techniques and new sensors capable of measuring left atrial pressures (LAP). With the growing body of evidence and need for remote care, it is expected that remote monitoring by invasive sensors will play a larger role in HF care in the near future.","Radhoe, Sumant P; Veenis, Jesse F; Brugts, Jasper J",Sensors (Basel),,276
258983,Going Remote: How Teaching During a Crisis is Unique to Other Distance Learning Experiences,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in the human population from a zoonotic spillover event. Infection in humans results in a variety of outcomes ranging from asymptomatic cases to the disease COVID-19, which can have significant morbidity and mortality, with over two million confirmed deaths worldwide as of January 2021. Over a year into the pandemic, sequencing analysis has shown that variants of SARS-CoV-2 are being selected as the virus continues to circulate widely within the human population. The predominant drivers of genetic variation within SARS-CoV-2 are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) caused by polymerase error, potential host factor driven RNA modification, and insertion/deletions (indels) resulting from the discontinuous nature of viral RNA synthesis. While many mutations represent neutral 'genetic drift' or have quickly died out, a subset may be affecting viral traits such as transmissibility, pathogenicity, host range, and antigenicity of the virus. In this review, we summarise the current extent of genetic change in SARS-CoV-2, particularly recently emerging variants of concern, and consider the phenotypic consequences of this viral evolution that may impact the future trajectory of the pandemic.","Peacock, Thomas P; Penrice-Randal, Rebekah; Hiscox, Julian A; Barclay, Wendy S",J. gen. virol,,276

Here, we report that RNA triggers the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, N. By analyzing all 29 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, we find that only N is predicted as an LLPS protein. We further confirm the LLPS of N during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the 100,849 genome variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the GISAID database, we identify that ~37% (36,941) of the genomes contain a specific trio-nucleotide polymorphism (GGG-to-AAC) in the coding sequence of N, which leads to the amino acid substitutions, R203K/G204R. Interestingly, NR203K/G204R exhibits a higher propensity to undergo LLPS and a greater effect on IFN inhibition. By screening the chemicals known to interfere with N-RNA binding in other viruses, we find that (-)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG), a polyphenol from green tea, disrupts the LLPS of N and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, our study reveals that targeting N-RNA condensation with GCG could be a potential treatment for COVID-19.","Zhao, Ming; Yu, Yu; Sun, Li-Ming; Xing, Jia-Qing; Li, Tingting; Zhu, Yunkai; Wang, Miao; Yu, Yin; Xue, Wen; Xia, Tian; Cai, Hong; Han, Qiu-Ying; Yin, Xiaoyao; Li, Wei-Hua; Li, Ai-Ling; Cui, Jiuwei; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhang, Rong; Zhou, Tao; Zhang, Xue-Min; Li, Tao",Nat Commun,,276

268893,Opinions of primary education teachers on the advantages and disadvantages of on-line teaching,2020,"BACKGROUND: To combat social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions due to COVID-19, Canadian communities began a Facebook social media movement, #Caremongering, to support vulnerable individuals in their communities. Little research has examined the spread and use of #Caremongering to address community health and social needs. OBJECTIVES: We examined the rate at which #Caremongering grew across Canada, the main ways the groups were used, and differences in use by membership size and activity. METHODS: We searched Facebook Groups using the term ""Caremongering"" combined with the names of the largest population centres in every province and territory in Canada. We extracted available Facebook analytics on all the groups found, restricted to public groups that operated in English. We further conducted a content analysis of themes from postings in 30 groups using purposive sampling. Posted content was qualitatively analyzed to determine consistent themes across the groups and between those with smaller and larger member numbers. RESULTS: The search of Facebook groups across 185 cities yielded 130 unique groups, including groups from all 13 provinces and territories in Canada. Total membership across all groups as of May 4, 2020 was 194,879. The vast majority were formed within days of the global pandemic announcement, two months prior. There were four major themes identified: personal protective equipment, offer, need, and information. Few differences were found between how large and small groups were being used. CONCLUSIONS: The #Caremongering Facebook groups spread across the entire nation in a matter of days, engaging hundreds of thousands of Canadians. Social media appears to be a useful tool for spreading community-led solutions to address health and social needs.","Seow, Hsien; McMillan, Kayla; Civak, Margaret; Bainbridge, Daryl; van der Wal, Alison; Haanstra, Christa; Goldhar, Jodeme; Winemaker, Samantha",PLoS One,,276

METHODS: A cross-sectional study using an anonymous online questionnaire was conducted from 7 to 21 June 2020. The survey was distributed via social media and email to physicians working in Egypt through convenience sampling. RESULTS: 509 physicians participated in the study (mean age: 41.5±10.2). 138 (27.1%) participants were directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. 159 (31.2%) participants reported severe level of COVID-19-related stigma. Participants' mean overall COVID-19-related stigma score was 40.6±8.0. The mean subscale scores were: personalized stigma 26.0±5.7, disclosure concerns 9.3±2.2, negative self-image 6.9±1.6, and concern with public attitudes 24.4±4.9. In the multivariable regression analyses, the overall COVID-19-related stigma score was higher in participants with lower qualifications (ß = -0.19, 95% CI: 2.32, -0.64, p = 0.001), and in those working in a quarantine hospital (ß = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01, 7.14, p = 0.050). CONCLUSIONS: A considerable proportion of Egyptian physicians in this exploratory study experienced COVID-19-related stigmatization.

269119,Learning Postdisruption: Lessons from Students in a Fully Online Nonmajors Laboratory Course,2020,"Inflammation is an essential component of several respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is central to lung cancer, the leading cancer in terms of associated mortality that has affected millions of individuals worldwide. Inflammation and pulmonary manifestations are also the major causes of COVID-19 related deaths. Acute hyperinflammation plays an important role in the COVID-19 disease progression and severity, and development of protective immunity against the virus is greatly sought. Further, the severity of COVID-19 is greatly enhanced in lung cancer patients, probably due to the genes such as ACE2, TMPRSS2, PAI-1 and furin that are commonly involved in cancer progression as well as SAR-CoV-2 infection. The importance of inflammation in pulmonary manifestations, cancer and COVID-19 calls for a closer look at the underlying processes, particularly the associated increase in IL-6 and other cytokines, the dysregulation of immune cells and the coagulation pathway. Towards this end, several reports have identified epigenetic regulation of inflammation at different levels. Expression of several key inflammation-related cytokines, chemokines and other genes is affected by methylation and acetylation while non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs as well as long non-coding RNAs, also affect the overall inflammatory responses. Select miRNAs can regulate inflammation in COVID-19 infection, lung cancer as well as other inflammatory lung diseases, and can serve as epigenetic links that can be therapeutically targeted. Furthermore, epigenetic changes also mediate the environmental factors-induced inflammation. Therefore, a better understanding of epigenetic regulation of inflammation can potentially help develop novel strategies to prevent, diagnose and treat chronic pulmonary diseases, lung cancer and COVID-19.","Ahmad, Shama; Manzoor, Shajer; Siddiqui, Simmone; Mariappan, Nithya; Zafar, Iram; Ahmad, Aamir; Ahmad, Aftab",Semin. cancer biol,,276

The factors influencing compliance with these regulations may differ from ""classic"" predictors for medical compliance. This study attempted to assess the effect of social communication and psychological factors on intention to comply. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted on healthy adults living in Israel (n = 697). The survey assessed the intention to comply with the state COVID-19 regulations and explored possible correlations with demographic and psychosocial factors. Data were collected during May 2020 using a Qualtrics online survey. Data were analyzed to find correlations between anxiety, uncertainty, media exposure and other variables and the level of intention to comply as self-reported. Moderation and mediation effects were studied by an integrative model of influencing factors. We found that media exposure change, trust in responsible agencies and anxiety were positively correlated with compliance, while uncertainty was correlated with noncompliance. The effect of media exposure on compliance had two components. First, media exposure was positively correlated with compliance. On the other hand, media exposure was positively correlated with uncertainty, and uncertainty was negatively correlated with compliance. Interestingly, anxiety, which was positively correlated with media exposure, also moderated the negative correlation between uncertainty and compliance. Our results highlight the important role of uncertainty and anxiety as moderators between media exposure and compliance. To increase public compliance with COVID-19 regulations, efforts should be directed at decreasing uncertainty and anxiety.","Mevorach, Tomer; Cohen, Jonathan; Apter, Alan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,276

271897,Teacher perspectives of self-efficacy and remote learning due to the emergency school closings of 2020,2021,"Range aggregate queries (RAQs) are an integral part of many real-world applications, where, often, fast and approximate answers for the queries are desired. Recent work has studied answering RAQs using machine learning models, where a model of the data is learned to answer the queries. However, such modelling choices fail to utilize any query specific information. To capture such information, we observe that RAQs can be represented by query functions, which are functions that take a query instance (i.e., a specific RAQ) as an input and output its corresponding answer. Using this representation, we formulate the problem of learning to approximate the query function, and propose NeuroDB, a query specialized neural network framework, that answers RAQs efficiently. NeuroDB is query-type agnostic (i.e., it does not make any assumption about the underlying query type) and our observation that queries can be represented by functions is not specific to RAQs. Thus, we investigate whether NeuroDB can be used for other query types, by applying it to distance to nearest neighbour queries. We experimentally show that NeuroDB outperforms the state-of-the-art for this query type, often by orders of magnitude. Moreover, the same neural network architecture as for RAQs is used, bringing to light the possibility of using a generic framework to answer any query type efficiently.","Zeighami, Sepanta; Shahabi, Cyrus",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04922v1.pdf,276
271909,The Use of M-Learning: A Perspective of Learners’ Perceptions on M-Blackboard Learn,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The underestimation of the severity of COVID-19 by the South African government resulted in delayed action against the pandemic. Ever since WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic preventive action was comprehensively upgraded worldwide. This prompted South African authorities to implement physical distancing, self-isolation, closure of non-essential services, schools, travelling restrictions and recursive national lockdowns to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. This explanatory study sought to review the effects of COVID-19 in the South African health system and society. METHODS: The study applied literature research of COVID-19 reports, policies from the National Department of Health, WHO, Africa CDC, and articles from Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. RESULTS: The South African health system is affected by the lack of PPEs, increased mortality rates, mental health problems, substance abuse, resurgent of NCDs. The closure of international borders, global demand meltdown, supply disruptions, dramatic scaling down of human and industrial activities during lockdown cause socio-economic problems. The prolonged effects of lockdown on psychosocial support services resulted in the outbursts of uncertainties, acute panic, fear, depression, obsessive behaviours, social unrests, stigmatization, anxiety, increased gender-based violence cases and discrimination in the distribution of relief food aid. CONCLUSION: To slow down the spread of COVID-19, massive testing must be adopted, contact tracing, isolation, and home quarantine guidelines for asymptomatic cases which promote behavioural change and reviewing of policy on food relief.","Mbunge, Elliot",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,276

Medical experts from various countries have conducted relevant researches in their own fields and countries, and the development of an effective vaccine has been expected soon. Although some progress has been made in the development of therapeutic drugs and vaccines, interdisciplinary and cooperative studies are scarce. However, it is easy to form information islands and conduct repeated scientific research. To date, no therapeutic drug or vaccine for COVID-19 has been officially approved yet for marketing. In this article, the features of experts in cooperation networks, such as graph structure, context attribute, sequential co-occurrence probability, weight features and auxiliary features, are comprehensively analyzed. Based on this, a novel graph neural network + long short-term memory + generative adversarial network (GNN + LSTM + GAN) expert recommendation model based on link prediction is constructed to encourage cooperation among relevant experts in research social networks. Finding experts in related fields, establishing cooperative relations with them and achieving multinational and cross-field expert cooperation are significant to promote the development of therapeutic drugs and vaccines.","Wang, Hui; Le, ZiChun",Scientometrics,,276

275599,Imparting Scientific Literacy through an Online Materials Chemistry General Education Course,2021,"The clinical symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia are similar. Effective predictive markers are needed to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from CAP in the current pandemic conditions. Copeptin, a 39-aminoacid glycopeptide, is a C-terminal part of the precursor pre-provasopressin (pre-proAVP). The activation of the AVP system stimulates copeptin secretion in equimolar amounts with AVP. This study aims to determine serum copeptin levels in patients with CAP and COVID-19 pneumonia and to analyze the power of copeptin in predicting COVID-19 pneumonia. The study consists of 98 patients with COVID-19 and 44 patients with CAP. The basic demographic and clinical data of all patients were recorded, and blood samples were collected. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Serum copeptin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to CAP patients (10.2 ± 4.4 ng/ml and 7.1 ± 3.1 ng/ml; p < .001). Serum copeptin levels were positively correlated with leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet count (r = -.21, p = .012; r = -.21, p = .013; r = -.20, p = .018; respectively). The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that increased copeptin (odds ratio [OR] = 1.183, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.033-1.354; p = .015) and CK-MB (OR = 1.052, 95% CI, 1.013-1.092; p = .008) levels and decreased leukocyte count (OR = 0.829, 95% CI, 0.730-0.940; p = .004) were independent predictors of COVID-19 pneumonia. A cut-off value of 6.83 ng/ml for copeptin predicted COVID-19 with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 73% (AUC: 0.764% 95 Cl: 0.671-0.856, p < .001). Copeptin could be a promising and useful biomarker to be used to distinguish COVID-19 patients from CAP patients.","Kuluöztürk, Mutlu; In, Erdal; Telo, Selda; Karabulut, Ercan; Geçkil, Aysegül Altintop",J Med Virol,,276

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of children tested for SARS-CoV-2 at an exclusively pediatric drive-through and walk-up SARS-CoV-2 testing site from March 21, 2020, to April 28, 2020. We performed bivariable and multivariable logistic regression to measure the association of patient race and/or ethnicity and estimated median family income (based on census block group estimates) with (1) SARS-CoV-2 infection and (2) reported exposure to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Of 1000 children tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 20.7% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In comparison with non-Hispanic white children (7.3%), minority children had higher rates of infection (non-Hispanic Black: 30.0%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-4.4]; Hispanic: 46.4%, aOR 6.3 [95% CI 3.3-11.9]). In comparison with children in the highest median family income quartile (8.7%), infection rates were higher among children in quartile 3 (23.7%; aOR 2.6 [95% CI 1.4-4.9]), quartile 2 (27.1%; aOR 2.3 [95% CI 1.2-4.3]), and quartile 1 (37.7%; aOR 2.4 [95% CI 1.3-4.6]). Rates of reported exposure to SARS-CoV-2 also differed by race and/or ethnicity and socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of children tested for SARS-CoV-2 through a community-based testing site, racial and/or ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged children carry the highest burden of infection. Understanding and addressing the causes of these differences are needed to mitigate disparities and limit the spread of infection.","Goyal, Monika K; Simpson, Joelle N; Boyle, Meleah D; Badolato, Gia M; Delaney, Meghan; McCarter, Robert; Cora-Bramble, Denice",Pediatrics,,276

282820,Combating Domestic Violence during COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh: Using a Mobile Application integrated with an Effective Solution,2020,"The deployment of 5G wireless communication services requires the installation of 5G next-generation Node-B Base Stations (gNBs) over the territory and the wide adoption of 5G User Equipment (UE). In this context, the population is concerned about the potential health risks associated with the Radio Frequency (RF) emissions from 5G equipment, with several communities actively working toward stopping the 5G deployment. To face these concerns, in this work, we analyze the health risks associated with 5G exposure by adopting a new and comprehensive viewpoint, based on the communications engineering perspective. By exploiting our background, we analyze the alleged health effects of 5G exposure and critically review the latest works that are often referenced to support the health concerns from 5G. We then precisely examine the up-to-date metrics, regulations, and assessment of compliance procedures for 5G exposure, by evaluating the latest guidelines from IEEE, ICNIRP, ITU, IEC, and FCC, as well as the national regulations in more than 220 countries. We also thoroughly analyze the main health risks that are frequently associated with specific 5G features (e.g., MIMO, beamforming, cell densification, adoption of millimeter waves, and connection of millions of devices). Finally, we examine the risk mitigation techniques based on communications engineering that can be implemented to reduce the exposure from 5G gNB and UE. Overall, we argue that the widely perceived health risks that are attributed to 5G are not supported by scientific evidence from communications engineering. In addition, we explain how the solutions to minimize the health risks from 5G are already mature and ready to be implemented. Finally, future works, e.g., aimed at evaluating long-term impacts of 5G exposure, as well as innovative solutions to further reduce the RF emissions, are suggested.","Chiaraviglio, Luca; Elzanaty, Ahmed; Alouini, Mohamed-Slim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00944v2.pdf,276

In this work, the effect of MFL-association with two first-line anti-TB drugs and six fluoroquinolones was evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistant strains. MFL showed synergistic interaction with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and several fluoroquinolones, reaching fractional inhibitory concentration indexes (FICIs) ranging from 0.03 to 0.5. In order to better understand the observed results, two approaches have been explored: (i) spectroscopic responses attributed to the effect of MFL on physicochemical properties related to a liposomal membrane model composed by soybean asolectin; (ii) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data regarding MFL interaction with a membrane model based on PIM2, a lipid constituent of the mycobacterial cell wall. FTIR and NMR data showed that MFL affects expressively the region between the phosphate and the first methylene groups of soybean asolectin membranes, disordering these regions. MD simulations results detected high MFL density in the glycolipid interface and showed that the drug increases the membrane lateral diffusion, enhancing its permeability. The obtained results suggest that synergistic activities related to MFL are attributed to its effect of lipid disorder and membrane permeability enhancement.","Dos Santos, Marinalva Cardoso; Scaini, João Luís Rheingantz; Lopes, Márcio Vinicius Costa; Rodrigues, Beatriz Gonçalves; Silva, Nichole Osti; Borges, Carla Roberta Lopes; Dos Santos, Sandra Cruz; Dos Santos Machado, Karina; Werhli, Adriano Velasque; da Silva, Pedro Eduardo Almeida; Lourenço, Maria C S; da Silva, Emerson T; de Souza, Marcus V N; de Lima, Vânia Rodrigues; Gonçalves, Raoni Schroeder B",Bioorg Chem,,276
283033,Designing pisa-like mathematics task using a COVID-19 context (Pisacomat),2021,"This article concerns the Organizational Reliability Model (ORM) verification in the crisis escalation phase caused by critical conditions of organization functioning induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. ORM is constituted by three reliabilities, human resources, information technology, and management, which are mediators through which Type-1 and Type-2 reliability capabilities influence organizational reliability. Organizational reliability is a prerequisite for sustainability of contemporary organizations. The model was developed and verified for a variety of operating conditions. However, crisis induced by a Black Swan type of event creates conditions so critical that it calls for verification of known paradigms and models, as an element of crisis-state theory building. This is why this paper's aim was to verify the ORM and explain the mechanisms of shaping organizational reliability in such conditions in order to contribute to both theory (verifying the organizational reliability paradigm among organizations in crisis) and practice (proposing mechanisms, potentially helping them survive). The ORM is empirically verified based on the sample of 115 employees from Italy operating under critical conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic (research carried out in the week of 18-22 March 2020). In order to verify the hypothesis, the path analysis was executed using SPSS AMOS. The results confirmed that in the extreme critical conditions causing crisis escalation for the organizations, there is a need to redefine the existing paradigms, including ORM. The results show that the HR reliability role in the ORM has drastically changed and the mechanism of its influence on organizational reliability is significantly different in crisis influenced by critical conditions of organization functioning. They also confirmed that IT together with HR is dependent on management to change the way of working and until that, its reliability may be counterproductive for the reliability of organizational as a whole. Therefore, obtaining sustainability in the crisis escalation phase requires redefining the mechanisms for securing organizational reliability.","Bieńkowska, Agnieszka; Tworek, Katarzyna; Zabłocka-Kluczka, Anna",Sustainability,,276

Some recent TROPOMI-based estimates of changes in atmospheric NO2 concentrations have neglected the influence of weather variability between the reference and lockdown periods. Here we provide weather-normalized estimates based on a machine learning method (gradient boosting) along with an assessment of the biases that can be expected from methods that omit the influence of weather. We also compare the weather-normalized satellite-estimated NO2 column changes with weather-normalized surface NO2 concentration changes and the CAMS regional ensemble, composed of 11 models, using recently published estimates of emission reductions induced by the lockdown. All estimates show similar NO2 reductions. Locations where the lockdown measures were stricter show stronger reductions, and, conversely, locations where softer measures were implemented show milder reductions in NO2 pollution levels. Average reduction estimates based on either satellite observations (-23 %), surface stations (-43 %), or models (-32 %) are presented, showing the importance of vertical sampling but also the horizontal representativeness. Surface station estimates are significantly changed when sampled to the TROPOMI overpasses (-37 %), pointing out the importance of the variability in time of such estimates. Observation-based machine learning estimates show a stronger temporal variability than model-based estimates.","Barré, Jérôme Petetin Hervé Augustin Colette Guevara Marc Vincent-Henri Peuch Rouil Laurence Engelen Richard Inness Antje Flemming Johannes Carlos Pérez García-Pando Bowdalo Dene Meleux Frederik Geels Camilla Christensen Jesper H.; Gauss, Michael Benedictow Anna Tsyro Svetlana Friese Elmar Struzewska Joanna Kaminski Jacek W.; Douros, John Timmermans Renske Robertson Lennart Adani Mario Jorba Oriol Joly Mathieu Kouznetsov Rostislav",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,,276

With this study, we aimed to investigate the activation state and the expression of transmembrane proteins in platelets of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We investigated transmembrane proteins expression with a customized mass cytometry panel of 21 antibodies. Platelets of 8 hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring intensive care support and without pre-existing conditions were compared to platelets of healthy controls (11 donors) with and without in vitro stimulation with thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP). Mass cytometry of non-stimulated platelets detected an increased surface expression of activation markers P-Selectin (0.67 vs. 1.87 median signal intensity for controls vs. patients, p = 0.0015) and LAMP-3 (CD63, 0.37 vs. 0.81, p = 0.0004), the GPIIb/IIIa complex (4.58 vs. 5.03, p < 0.0001) and other adhesion molecules involved in platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte interactions. Upon TRAP stimulation, mass cytometry detected a higher expression of P-selectin in COVID-19 samples compared to controls (p < 0.0001). However, we observed a significantly reduced capacity of COVID-19 platelets to increase the expression of activation markers LAMP-3 and P-Selectin upon stimulation with TRAP. We detected a hyperactivated phenotype in platelets during SARS-CoV-2 infection, consisting of highly expressed platelet activation markers, which might contribute to the hypercoagulopathy observed in COVID-19. In addition, several transmembrane proteins were more highly expressed compared to healthy controls. These findings support research projects investigating antithrombotic and antiplatelet treatment regimes in COVID-19 patients, and provide new insights on the phenotypical platelet expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bongiovanni, Dario; Klug, Melissa; Lazareva, Olga; Weidlich, Simon; Biasi, Marina; Ursu, Simona; Warth, Sarah; Buske, Christian; Lukas, Marina; Spinner, Christoph D; Scheidt, Moritz von; Condorelli, Gianluigi; Baumbach, Jan; Laugwitz, Karl-Ludwig; List, Markus; Bernlochner, Isabell",Cell Death Dis,,276

To obtain better lightweight architectures, more flexible and diversified neural architectures are in demand, and more efficient methods should be designed for larger search space. Motivated by this, we propose MoARR algorithm, which utilizes the existing research results and historical information to quickly find architectures that are both lightweight and accurate. We use the discovered high-performance cells to construct network architectures. This method increases the network architecture diversity while also reduces the search space of cell structure design. In addition, we designs a novel multi-objective method to effectively analyze the historical evaluation information, so as to efficiently search for the Pareto optimal architectures with high accuracy and small parameter number. Experimental results show that our MoARR can achieve a powerful and lightweight model (with 1.9% error rate and 2.3M parameters) on CIFAR-10 in 6 GPU hours, which is better than the state-of-the-arts. The explored architecture is transferable to ImageNet and achieves 76.0% top-1 accuracy with 4.9M parameters.","Wang, Chunnan; Wang, Hongzhi; Feng, Guocheng; Geng, Fei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02749v1.pdf,276
290500,An Investigation of the Perception of Office Management and Technology Students on Virtual Teaching at Walter Sisulu University in Ibika Site,2021,"The recent worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) opened new challenges for the research community. Machine learning (ML)-guided methods can be useful for feature prediction, involved risk, and the causes of an analogous epidemic. Such predictions can be useful for managing and intercepting the outbreak of such diseases. The foremost advantages of applying ML methods are handling a wide variety of data and easy identification of trends and patterns of an undetermined nature.In this study, we propose a partial derivative regression and nonlinear machine learning (PDR-NML) method for global pandemic prediction of COVID-19. We used a Progressive Partial Derivative Linear Regression model to search for the best parameters in the dataset in a computationally efficient manner. Next, a Nonlinear Global Pandemic Machine Learning model was applied to the normalized features for making accurate predictions. The results show that the proposed ML method outperformed state-of-the-art methods in the Indian population and can also be a convenient tool for making predictions for other countries.","Kavadi, Durga Prasad; Patan, Rizwan; Ramachandran, Manikandan; Gandomi, Amir H.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,276

In this study, we used coevolutionary analysis, molecular simulations, and perturbation-based hierarchical network modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with a panel of antibodies targeting distinct epitopes to explore molecular mechanisms underlying binding-induced modulation of dynamics and allosteric signaling in the spike proteins. Through coevolutionary analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, we identified highly coevolving hotspots and functional clusters that enable a functional cross-talk between distant allosteric regions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike complexes with antibodies. Coarse-grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with mutational sensitivity mapping and perturbation-based profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) complexes with CR3022 and CB6 antibodies enabled a detailed validation of the proposed approach and an extensive quantitative comparison with the experimental structural and deep mutagenesis scanning data. By combining in silico mutational scanning, perturbation-based modeling, and network analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complexes with H014, S309, S2M11, and S2E12 antibodies, we demonstrated that antibodies can incur specific and functionally relevant changes by modulating allosteric propensities and collective dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. The results provide a novel insight into regulatory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins showing that antibody-escaping mutations can preferentially target structurally adaptable energy hotspots and allosteric effector centers that control functional movements and allosteric communication in the complexes.","Verkhivker, Gennady M; Di Paola, Luisa",J Phys Chem B,,276

STUDY DESIGN: An online survey of member orchestras of the Association of British Orchestras. METHODS: Data gathered covered geographical, financial and musical aspects, the type of healthcare settings in which the work takes place, orchestras' motivation for their involvement in the healthcare sector, the role health and well-being delivery plays in their business models, and finally, the impact of COVID-19 on orchestras' current and future plans. RESULTS: Approximately half of UK orchestras are engaged significantly in the area of health and well-being in all four UK nations and a wide range of healthcare settings. There is a strong appetite to develop this work among those orchestras not yet involved. At the same time, the extent of this work is not formally recognised or paid for by the healthcare sector. CONCLUSIONS: While there is considerable unevenness in the provision, it is clear that UK professional orchestras made a significant contribution to the health and well-being sectors in hospitals and other healthcare settings. There is scope for a greater contribution by orchestras to the healthcare sector, which will require more formal recognition of the value of this work.","Derbyshire, S; Harvey, F; Swann, M",Public Health,,276
295166,The Economy of Self-declared Kosovo,2021,"The Government of India in-network with the state governments has implemented the epidemic curtailment strategies inclusive of case-isolation, quarantine and lockdown in response to ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. In this manuscript, we attempt to estimate the impact of these steps across ten selected Indian states using crowd-sourced data. The trajectory of the outbreak was parameterized by the reproduction number (R0), doubling time, and growth rate. These parameters were estimated at two time-periods after the enforcement of the lockdown on 24th March 2020, i.e. 15 days into lockdown and 30 days into lockdown. The authors used a crowd sourced database which is available in the public domain. After preparing the data for analysis, R0 was estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) method which is based on the expectation minimum algorithm where the distribution probability of secondary cases is maximized using the serial interval discretization. The doubling time and growth rate were estimated by the natural log transformation of the exponential growth equation. The overall analysis shows decreasing trends in time-varying reproduction numbers (R(t)) and growth rate (with a few exceptions) and increasing trends in doubling time. The curtailment strategies employed by the Indian government seem to be effective in reducing the transmission parameters of the COVID-19 epidemic. The estimated R(t) are still above the threshold of 1, and the resultant absolute case numbers show an increase with time. Future curtailment and mitigation strategies thus may take into account these findings while formulating further course of action.","Mitra, Arun; Pakhare, Abhijit P; Roy, Adrija; Joshi, Ankur",PLoS One,,276

296845,Does Contact Tracing Work? Quasi-Experimental Evidence from an Excel Error in England (preprint),2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome contains nine open reading frames (ORFs) that encode for accessory proteins which, although dispensable for viral replication, are important for the modulation of the host infected cell metabolism and innate immunity evasion. Among those, the ORF8 gene encodes for the homonymous multifunctional, highly immunogenic, immunoglobulin-like protein that was recently found to inhibit presentation of viral antigens by class I major histocompatibility complex, suppress the type I interferon antiviral response and interact with host factors involved in pulmonary inflammation and fibrogenesis. Moreover, the ORF8 is a hypervariable gene rapidly evolving among SARS-related coronaviruses, with a tendency to recombine and undergo deletions that are deemed to facilitate the virus adaptation to the human host. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 variants isolated in the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic that were deleted of the ORF8 gene have been associated to milder symptoms and better disease outcome. This minireview summarizes the current knowledge on the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 protein in perspective to its potential as antiviral target and with special emphasis on the biochemical, biophysical and structural aspects of its molecular biology.","Zinzula, Luca",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,276

The debate includes claims that sheltering in place influences deaths unrelated to infection or other natural causes. Testing this claim should improve the benefit/cost accounting that informs choice on reimposing sheltering in place. We used time-series methods to compare weekly nonnatural deaths in California with those in Florida. California was the first state to begin, and among the last to end, sheltering in place, while sheltering began later and ended earlier in Florida. During weeks when California had shelter-in-place orders in effect, but Florida did not, the odds that a nonnatural death occurred in California rather than Florida were 14.4% below expected levels. Sheltering-in-place policies likely reduce mortality from mechanisms unrelated to infection or other natural causes of death.","Catalano, Ralph; Glymour, M Maria; Chen, Yea-Hung; Bibbins-Domingo, Kirsten",Am J Epidemiol,,276

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated our democratic processes. Voters and poll workers feel threatened by the potential dangers of voting in business-as-usual polling stations. Indeed, significant problems were encountered in the recent 2020 primary elections in Wisconsin, where the National Guard had to be mobilized because so few poll workers reported to work, and more than 90% of polling places had to remain closed. METHOD: We describe a number of possible user-centered solutions that would help protect voters and poll workers in times of pandemic, and also report the results of a survey that asked voters and poll workers about what kinds of systems might make them willing to vote. RESULTS: Political as well as safety considerations will need to be considered as these safer voting solutions are designed since, surprisingly, the kinds of solutions preferred depend on the political affiliation of the voters. CONCLUSION: Human factors professionals have a large role to play in realizing the safe, successful implementation of these user-centered systems. Good human factors analysis can help minimize the risk to voters and poll workers. Moreover, human factors methods can help safeguard democracy by creating safe and well-engineered environments that are conducive to voting in the age of pandemics. APPLICATION: Creating safe and effective voting solutions that protect voters and poll workers during pandemic outbreaks is crucial to the preservation of democracy.","Kortum, Philip; Stein, Robert; Acemyan, Claudia Ziegler; Wallach, Dan S; Vann, Elizabeth",Hum Factors,,276

304863,Aspects of distance education in combination with home offices,2021,"The extensive proliferation of recent coronavirus (COVID-19), all over the world, is the outcome of social interactions through massive transportation, gatherings and population growth. To disrupt the widespread of COVID-19, a mechanism for social distancing is indispensable. Also, to predict the effectiveness and quantity of social distancing for a particular social network, with a certain contagion, a generalized model is needed. In this manuscript, we propose a social distancing mediated generalized model to predict the pandemic spread of COVID-19. By considering growth rate as a temporal harmonic function damped with social distancing in generalized Richard model and by using the data of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, USA and India, we find that, with time, the cumulative spread grows more rapidly due to weak social distancing as compared to the stronger social distancing, where it is explicitly decreasing. Furthermore, we predict the possible outcomes with various social distancing scenarios by considering highest growth rate as an initial state, and illustrate that the increase in social distancing tremendously decreases growth rate, even it tends to reach zero in lockdown regimes. Our findings not only provide epidemic growth scenarios as a function of social distancing but also provide a modified growth model to predict controlled information flow in any network.","Yasir, Kashif Ammar; Liu, Wu-Ming",Nonlinear Dyn,,276

METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study evaluated 45 health professionals who were initially seen in screening tents and had a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 as confirmed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and lung involvement diagnosed by LUS. Subsequently, these individuals were admitted to the hospital, where chest CT was performed. Aeration scores were obtained for the LUS examinations based on the following findings: more than 2 B-lines, coalescent B-lines, and subpleural consolidations. A subjective assessment of the extent of lung disease on CT was performed on the basis of the percentage of lung parenchyma involvement as follows: 25% or less, 25% to 50%, and greater than 50%. RESULTS: Regarding LUS signs, more than 2 B-lines, coalescent B-lines, and subpleural consolidations were present in 73.3%, 68.2%, and 24.4% of cases, respectively. The main findings on CT were ground glass opacities, a crazy-paving pattern, and consolidations (66.7%, 20%, and 20% of cases); 17.8% of cases had examinations without abnormalities. Patients with more than 2 B-lines on LUS had more ground glass opacity areas on CT (P = .0007), whereas patients with subpleural consolidations on LUS had more consolidations on CT (P < .0001). In addition, patients with higher LUS aeration scores had more extensive disease on CT (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Lung ultrasound can detect lung injury even in the presence of normal CT results. There are associations between the abnormalities detected by both methods, and a relationship also exists between LUS aeration scores and the disease extent on CT.","Lopes, Agnaldo José; Mafort, Thiago Thomaz; da Costa, Cláudia Henrique; Rufino, Rogério; de Cássia Firmida, Mônica; Kirk, Kennedy Martins; Cobo, Carolina Gianella; da Costa, Hanna da Silva Bessa; da Cruz, Carlos Miguel Brum Queiroz; Mogami, Roberto",J. ultrasound med,,276

310094,Educational Transformation: An Evaluation of Online Learning Due to COVID-19,2021,"Enveloped viruses belong to a large class of pathogens responsible for multiple serious diseases. Their spread into new territories has been the cause of major epidemics throughout human history, including the Spanish flu in 1918 and the latest COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to their outer membrane, consisting essentially of host lipids, enveloped viruses are more resistant to enzymes, and are also less susceptible to host immune defenses than their naked counterparts. Therefore, the development of effective approaches to combat enveloped virus infections represents a major challenge for antiviral therapy in the current century. This review focuses on the characteristics of enveloped viruses, their importance in the entry phase, drugs targeting envelope membrane-mediated entry, and those specifically designed to target the envelope. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of these compounds can be attributed to their ability to affect the envelope, an essential structural feature common to several viruses. This makes this class of compounds agents of great interest when no specific drugs or vaccines are available to block viral infections.","Palombi, Nastasja; Brai, Annalaura; Gerace, Martina; Di Maria, Salvatore; Orofino, Francesco; Corelli, Federico",Curr. med. chem,,276

Thus, it is of vital importance for healthcare workers to be well informed and updated regarding possible immunological and non-immunological adverse effects regarding such treatments. In this narrative revision, the rationale use of these treatments in the SARS-CoV-2 infection is emphasized as well as their most frequently described adverse drug reactions. Drugs that are being essayed to counteract both clinical phases that are thought to take place in the severe stage of this disease are included; an initial phase where a viral infection prevails and a second phase where an inflammatory response takes over. Adverse reactions registered in the Pharmacovigilance Program of our hospital before the onset of this pandemic have also been included.","Herrera-Lasso Regás, Valeria; Dordal Culla, María Teresa; Lleonart Bellfill, Ramón",Med Clin (Barc),,276
310191,Individualized Excel-Based Exams To Prevent Students From Cheating,2020,"The glycoprotein spike (S) on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is a determinant for viral invasion and host immune response. Herein, we characterized the site-specific N-glycosylation of S protein at the level of intact glycopeptides. All 22 potential N-glycosites were identified in the S-protein protomer and were found to be preserved among the 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The glycosites exhibited glycoform heterogeneity as expected for a human cell-expressed protein subunit. We identified masses that correspond to 157 N-glycans, primarily of the complex type. In contrast, the insect cell-expressed S protein contained 38 N-glycans, completely of the high-mannose type. Our results revealed that the glycan types were highly determined by the differential processing of N-glycans among human and insect cells, regardless of the glycosites' location. Moreover, the N-glycan compositions were conserved among different sizes of subunits. Our study indicate that the S protein N-glycosylation occurs regularly at each site, albeit the occupied N-glycans were diverse and heterogenous. This N-glycosylation landscape and the differential N-glycan patterns among distinct host cells are expected to shed light on the infection mechanism and present a positive view for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.","Zhang, Yong; Zhao, Wanjun; Mao, Yonghong; Chen, Yaohui; Wang, Shisheng; Zhong, Yi; Su, Tao; Gong, Meng; Du, Dan; Lu, Xiaofeng; Cheng, Jingqiu; Yang, Hao",Mol. cell. proteomics,,276

E.g. do we go for a total lock down or keep schools open? How many people and which people should be tested? Although there are many good models from e.g. epidemiologists on the spread of the virus under certain conditions, these models do not directly translate into the interventions that can be taken by government. Neither can these models contribute to understand the economic and/or social consequences of the interventions. However, effective and sustainable solutions need to take into account this combination of factors.

317295,The “war over tourism”: challenges to sustainable tourism in the tourism academy after COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has led to implementation of wide-ranging social restriction measures with consequent impact on health care utilisation in many domains. There is little published data on the experience of palliative care services catering to a population with low case numbers of COVID-19. AIM: This study aimed to consider the impact of COVID-19 on utilisation of inpatient palliative care in the context of low community transmission, and low numbers of cases in hospital. DESIGN: A retrospective service evaluation examining differences in number of admissions, diagnoses, number of deaths and time from admission to death, across three discrete 8-week time periods spanning the early COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: All admissions (n = 194) to a metropolitan tertiary hospital inpatient palliative care unit in Melbourne during the study period. RESULTS: An initial 16.9% fall in admissions was followed by a return to baseline admission numbers, with a 46.7% increase in number of deaths compared to baseline. The number of deaths within 24 h rose from 10.8% to 37.3% (p < 0.01). The number of patients with non-malignant diagnoses increased from 32.4% to 52%, and those with non-malignant diagnoses were more likely to die rapidly (p < 0.01). There were no patients with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Increased numbers of deaths within 24 h of admission occurred on the palliative care unit despite low COVID-19 case numbers in the wider community, and in the setting of widespread social restriction measures. More research is needed examining the health-related consequences of such restrictions for individuals not infected with COVID-19.","Everitt, Rachel; Robinson, Neil; Marco, David; Weil, Jennifer; Bryan, Tamsin",Palliat Med,,276

METHODS: The present recommendations are based on the opinion of experts as well as the experience of a group of traumatologists directly involved in the organization of traumatology wards. The reassignment of the healthcare personnel, the separation of the potentially infected patients and the different levels of restriction on the trauma care are all key elements of our protocol. RESULTS: Since the first SARS-CoV2-positive case was confirmed in Hungary, our trauma surgeons were able to avoid contamination with the help of the new guidelines, without reducing the quality of trauma care. CONCLUSION: Reasonably adjusted patient care protocols in every medical field are key to contain the spread of infection and to avoid public health crisis.

More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent FcÎ³R-mediated effector systems to varying degrees. This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody-dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralize or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other Igs. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a ""scaffolding"" role for FcÎ³R which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires increased effort on the development of improved and novel mAbs. A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual FcÎ³R function and the complexity of the relationships between FcÎ³Rs and antibodies is fueling efforts to develop more potent ""next-gen"" therapeutic antibodies. Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of individual activating FcÎ³Rs or the inhibitory FcÎ³RIIb or alternatively, for the ablation of FcÎ³R interaction altogether. This review touches on recent aspects of FcÎ³R and IgG immunobiology and its relationship with the present and future actions of therapeutic mAbs.","Chenoweth, Alicia M; Wines, Bruce D; Anania, Jessica C; Mark Hogarth, P",Immunol Cell Biol,,276

324265,The Impact of COVID-19: A Need for SMEs to Understand Business Model Innovation,2021,"Physical distancing has been argued as one of the effective means to combat the spread of COVID-19 before a vaccine or therapeutic drug becomes available. How far people can be spatially separated is partly behavioral but partly constrained by population density. Most models developed to predict the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. do not include population density explicitly. This study shows that population density is an effective predictor of cumulative infection cases in the U.S. at the county level. Daily cumulative cases by counties are converted into 7-day moving averages. Treating the weekly averages as the dependent variable and the county population density levels as the explanatory variable, both in logarithmic scale, this study assesses how population density has shaped the distributions of infection cases across the U.S. from early March to late May, 2020. Additional variables reflecting the percentages of African Americans, Hispanic-Latina, and older adults in logarithmic scale are also included. Spatial regression models with a spatial error specification are also used to account for the spatial spillover effect. Population density alone accounts for 57% of the variation (R-squared) in the aspatial models and up to 76% in the spatial models. Adding the three population subgroup percentage variables raised the R-squared of the aspatial models to 72% and the spatial model to 84%. The influences of the three population subgroups were substantial, but changed over time, while the contributions of population density have been quite stable after the first several weeks, ascertaining the importance of population density in shaping the spread of infection in individual counties, and in their neighboring counties. Thus, population density and sizes of vulnerable population subgroups should be explicitly included in transmission models that predict the impacts of COVID-19, particularly at the sub-county level.","Wong, David W S; Li, Yun",PLoS One,,276

Lung transplantation (LT) as the sole therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis related to acute respiratory distress syndrome has been considered as the ultimate rescue therapy for these patients. METHODS: From February 10 to March 10, 2020, three male patients were urgently assessed and listed for transplantation. After conducting a full ethical review and after obtaining assent from the family of the patients, we performed three LT procedures for COVID-19 patients with illness durations of more than one month and extremely high sequential organ failure assessment scores. RESULTS: Two of the three recipients survived post-LT and started participating in a rehabilitation program. Pearls of the LT team collaboration and perioperative logistics were summarized and continually improved. The pathological results of the explanted lungs were concordant with the critical clinical manifestation, and provided insight towards better understanding of the disease. Government health affair systems, virology detection tools, and modern communication technology all play key roles towards the survival of the patients and their rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: LT can be performed in end-stage patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis. If confirmed positive-turned-negative virology status without organ dysfunction that could contraindicate LT, LT provided the final option for these patients to avoid certain death, with proper protection of transplant surgeons and medical staffs. By ensuring instant seamless care for both patients and medical teams, the goal of reducing the mortality rate and salvaging the lives of patients with COVID-19 can be attained.","Chen, Jing-Yu; Qiao, Kun; Liu, Feng; Wu, Bo; Xu, Xin; Jiao, Guo-Qing; Lu, Rong-Guo; Li, Hui-Xing; Zhao, Jin; Huang, Jian; Yang, Yi; Lu, Xiao-Jie; Li, Jia-Shu; Jiang, Shu-Yun; Wang, Da-Peng; Hu, Chun-Xiao; Wang, Gui-Long; Huang, Dong-Xiao; Jiao, Guo-Hui; Wei, Dong; Ye, Shu-Gao; Huang, Jian-An; Zhou, Li; Zhang, Xiao-Qin; He, Jian-Xing",Chin Med J (Engl),,276
326216,"Learning during COVID-19 pandemic: Online education community, based on discord",2020,"While the existence of many security elements can be measured (e.g., vulnerabilities, security controls, or privacy controls), it is challenging to measure their relative security impact. In the physical world we can often measure the impact of individual elements to a system. However, in cyber security we often lack ground truth (i.e., the ability to directly measure significance). In this work we propose to solve this by leveraging human expert opinion to provide ground truth. Experts are iteratively asked to compare pairs of security elements to determine their relative significance. On the back end our knowledge encoding tool performs a form of binary insertion sort on a set of security elements using each expert as an oracle for the element comparisons. The tool not only sorts the elements (note that equality may be permitted), but it also records the strength or degree of each relationship. The output is a directed acyclic `constraint' graph that provides a total ordering among the sets of equivalent elements. Multiple constraint graphs are then unified together to form a single graph that is used to generate a scoring or prioritization system. For our empirical study, we apply this domain-agnostic measurement approach to generate scoring/prioritization systems in the areas of vulnerability scoring, privacy control prioritization, and cyber security control evaluation.","Mell, Peter",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13755v1.pdf,276

We tested the presence of plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 3985 employees across 7 healthcare facilities in areas of Lombardy with different exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Subjects filled a questionnaire to self-report on COVID-19 symptoms, comorbidities, smoking, regular or remote working, and the exposure to COVID-infected individuals. We show that the number of individuals exposed to the virus depended on the geographical location of the facility, ranging between 3 and 43%, consistent with the spatial variation of COVID-19 incidence in Lombardy, and correlated with family interactions. We observed a higher prevalence of females than males positive for IgG, however the level of antibodies was similar, suggesting a comparable magnitude of the anti-spike antibody response. IgG positivity among smokers was lower (7.4% vs 13.5%) although without difference in IgG plasma levels. We observed 11.9% of IgG positive asymptomatic individuals and another 23.1% with one or two symptoms. Interestingly, among the IgG positive population, 81.2% of subjects with anosmia/dysgeusia and fever were SARS-CoV-2 infected, indicating that these symptoms are strongly associated to COVID-19. In conclusion, the frequency of IgG positivity and SARS-CoV-2 infection is dependent on the geographical exposure to the virus and primarily to family rather than hospital exposure.","Sandri, Maria Teresa; Azzolini, Elena; Torri, Valter; Carloni, Sara; Pozzi, Chiara; Salvatici, Michela; Tedeschi, Michele; Castoldi, Massimo; Mantovani, Alberto; Rescigno, Maria",Sci Rep,,276

Numerous researchers worked on forecasting the number of confirmed cases since anticipating the growth of the cases helps governments adopting knotty decisions to ease the lockdowns orders for their countries. These orders help several people who have lost their jobs and support gravely impacted businesses. Our research aims to investigate the relation between Google search trends and the spreading of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) over countries worldwide, to predict the number of cases. We perform a correlation analysis on the keywords of the related Google search trends according to the number of confirmed cases reported by the WHO. After that, we applied several machine learning techniques (Multiple Linear Regression, Non-negative Integer Regression, Deep Neural Network), to forecast the number of confirmed cases globally based on historical data as well as the hybrid data (Google search trends). Our results show that Google search trends are highly associated with the number of reported confirmed cases, where the Deep Learning approach outperforms other forecasting techniques. We believe that it is not only a promising approach for forecasting the confirmed cases of COVID-19, but also for similar forecasting problems that are associated with the related Google trends.","Nguyen, Hoang Long; Pan, Zhenhe; Abu-gellban, Hashim; Jin, Fang; Zhang, Yuanlin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03847v1.pdf,276

In the absence of targeted therapies, supportive care continues to be the mainstay of treatment. The hallmark of severe COVID-19 is a thromboinflammatory storm driven by innate immune responses. This manifests clinically as acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in some patients, widespread thrombotic microangiopathy. Neutrophils and complement are key players in the innate immune system, and their role in perpetuating fatal severe COVID-19 continues to receive increasing attention. Here, we review the interplay between neutrophils, neutrophil extracellular traps, and complement in COVID-19 immunopathology, and highlight potential therapeutic strategies to combat these pathways.","Zuo, Yu; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S; Kim, Alfred H J",Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol,,276

We have used yeast DNA polymerases Î·, Î¶ and Rev1 to study translesion synthesis (TLS) past a nitrogen mustard-based interstrand crosslink (ICL) with an 8-atom linker between the crosslinked bases. The Rev1-Pol Î¶ complex was most efficient in complete bypass synthesis, by 2-3 fold, compared to Pol Î¶ alone or Pol Î·. Rev1 protein, but not its catalytic activity, was required for efficient TLS. A dCMP residue was faithfully inserted across the ICL-G by Pol Î·, Pol Î¶, and Rev1-Pol Î¶. Rev1-Pol Î¶, and particularly Pol Î¶ alone showed a tendency to stall before the ICL, whereas Pol Î· stalled just after insertion across the ICL. The stalling of Pol Î· directly past the ICL is attributed to its autoinhibitory activity, caused by elongation of the short ICL-unhooked oligonucleotide (a six-mer in our study) by Pol Î· providing a barrier to further elongation of the correct primer. No stalling by Rev1-Pol Î¶ directly past the ICL was observed, suggesting that the proposed function of Pol Î¶ as an extender DNA polymerase is also required for ICL repair.","Bezalel-Buch, Rachel; Cheun, Young K; Roy, Upasana; Schärer, Orlando D; Burgers, Peter M",Nucleic acids res,,276

329828,Higher Education as a Determinant of the Competitiveness and Sustainable Development of an Economy,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) To support the WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks Objectives: To assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high disease transmission Search methods: An information specialist searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and updated the search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 23 June 2020 Selection criteria: Cohort studies, case-control studies, time series, interrupted time series, case series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19 We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened abstracts and titles in duplicate Two review authors then independently screened all potentially relevant full-text publications One review author extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment We used three different tools to assess risk of bias, depending on the study design: ROBINS-I for non-randomised studies of interventions, a tool provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non-randomised, non-controlled studies, and recommendations from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) for modelling studies We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and costs Main results: We included 51 studies;4 observational studies and 28 modelling studies on COVID-19, one observational and one modelling study on MERS, three observational and 11 modelling studies on SARS, and three modelling studies on SARS and other infectious diseases Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and undertook a narrative synthesis We judged risk of bias to be moderate for 2/3 non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) and serious for 1/3 NRSI We rated risk of bias moderate for 4/5 non-controlled cohort studies, and serious for 1/5 We rated modelling studies as having no concerns for 13 studies, moderate concerns for 17 studies and major concerns for 13 studies Quarantine for individuals who were in contact with a confirmed/suspected COVID-19 case in comparison to no quarantine Modelling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases may have averted 44% to 96% of incident cases and 31% to 76% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 6 modelling studies on COVID-19, 1 on SARS;mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, 1 on SARS, low-certainty evidence) Studies also indicated that there may be a reduction in the basic reproduction number ranging from 37% to 88% due to the implementation of quarantine (5 modelling studies on COVID-19, low-certainty evidence) Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings may be (2 modelling studies on SARS) Quarantine in combination with other measures to contain COVID-19 in comparison to other measures without quarantine or no measures When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, such as school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated that there may be a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than measures without quarantine or no interventions (incident cases: 9 modelling studies on COVID-19;onward transmission: 5 modelling studies on COVID-19;mortality: 5 modelling studies on COVID-19, low-certainty evidence) Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19 Quarantine for individuals travelling from a country with a declared COVID-19 outbreak compared to no quarantine Very low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths may be small for SARS, but might be larger for COVID-19 (2 observational studies on COVID-19 and 2 observational studies on SARS) Authors' conclusions: The current evidence is limited because most studies on COVID-19 are mathematical modelling studies that make different assumptions on important model parameters Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, although there is uncertainty over the magnitude of the effect Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak and the impact

330969,Note from the editor,2021,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the present cross-sectional study is to investigate the role of perceived COVID-19-related organizational demands and threats in predicting emotional exhaustion, and the role of organizational support in reducing the negative influence of perceived COVID-19 work-related stressors on burnout. Moreover, the present study aims to add to the understanding of the role of personal resources in the Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R) by examining whether personal resources-such as the professionals' orientation towards patient engagement-may also strengthen the impact of job resources and mitigate the impact of job demands. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 532 healthcare professionals working during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. It adopted the Job-Demands-Resource Model to study the determinants of professional's burnout. An integrative model describing how increasing job demands experienced by this specific population are related to burnout and in particular to emotional exhaustion symptoms was developed. RESULTS: The results of the logistic regression models provided strong support for the proposed model, as both Job Demands and Resources are significant predictors (OR = 2.359 and 0.563 respectively, with p < 0.001). Moreover, healthcare professionals' orientation towards patient engagement appears as a significant moderator of this relationship, as it reduces Demands' effect (OR = 1.188) and increases Resources' effect (OR = 0.501). CONCLUSIONS: These findings integrate previous findings on the JD-R Model and suggest the relevance of personal resources and of relational factors in affecting professionals' experience of burnout.","Barello, Serena; Caruso, Rosario; Palamenghi, Lorenzo; Nania, Tiziana; Dellafiore, Federica; Bonetti, Loris; Silenzi, Andrea; Marotta, Claudia; Graffigna, Guendalina",Int. arch. occup. environ. health,,276

This study aimed to develop a laboratory score system to identify high-risk individuals, to validate this score in a separate cohort, and to test its accuracy in the prediction of in-hospital mortality. METHODS: In this cohort study, biological data from 330 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were used to develop a risk score to predict progression toward severity. In a second stage, data from 240 additional COVID-19 patients were used to validate this score. Accuracy of the score was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: In the development cohort, a step-wise decrease in the average survival duration was noted with the increment of the risk score (pANOVA < 0.0001). A similar trend was confirmed when analyzing this association in the validation cohort (p < 0.0001). The AUC was 0.74 [0.66-0.82] and 0.90 [0.87-0.94], p < 0.0001, respectively for severity and mortality prediction. CONCLUSION: This study provides a useful risk score based on biological routine parameters assessed at the time of admission, which has proven its effectiveness in predicting both severity and short-term mortality of COVID-19. Improved predictive scores may be generated by including other clinical and radiological features.","Bennouar, Salam; Bachir Cherif, Abdelghani; Kessira, Amel; Bennouar, Djamel-Eddine; Abdi, Samia",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,,276

We trained and tested our models on the i2b2 training dataset, and qualitatively assessed their performance using EHR data collected from a local hospital. We found that 1) BiLSTM-CRF represents the best-performing encoder/decoder combination, 2) character-embeddings and CRFs tend to improve precision at the price of recall, and 3) transformers alone under-perform as context encoders. Future work focused on structuring medical text may improve the extraction of semantic and syntactic information for the purposes of EHR de-identification.","Ahmed, Abdullah; Abbasi, Adeel; Eickhoff, Carsten",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13546v1.pdf,276

Considerations on the crisis,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Globally, India has the third largest population of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and the second highest number of COVID-19 cases. Anxiety is associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence. It is crucial to understand the burden of anxiety and its sources among Asian Indian PLHIV during the COVID pandemic, but data are limited. METHODS: During the first month of government mandated lockdown, we administered an anxiety assessment via telephone among PLHIV registered for care at a publicly funded antiretroviral therapy (ART) center in Pune, India. Generalized anxiety was defined as GAD-7 score &#8805; 10. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were compared by anxiety status (GAD-7 score &#8805; 10 vs GAD-7 score < 10). Qualitative responses to an open-ended question about causes of concern were evaluated using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Among 167 PLHIV, median age was 44 years (IQR 40-50); the majority were cisgender women (60%) and had a monthly family income < 200 USD (81%). Prior history of tuberculosis and other comorbidities were observed in 38 and 27%, respectively. Overall, prevalence of generalized anxiety was 25% (n = 41). PLHIV with GAD-7 score &#8805; 10 had fewer remaining doses of ART than those with lower GAD-7 scores (p = 0.05). Thematic analysis indicated that concerns were both health related and unrelated, and stated temporally. Present concerns were often also projected as future concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of anxiety was high during COVID lockdown in our population of socioeconomically disadvantaged PLHIV in Pune and appeared to be influenced by concerns about ART availability. The burden of anxiety among PLHIV will likely increase with the worsening pandemic in India, as sources of anxiety are expected to persist. We recommend the regular use of short screening tools for anxiety to monitor and triage patients as an extension of current HIV services.","Marbaniang, Ivan; Sangle, Shashikala; Nimkar, Smita; Zarekar, Kanta; Salvi, Sonali; Chavan, Amol; Gupta, Amita; Suryavanshi, Nishi; Mave, Vidya",BMC Public Health,,276
336286,Using Drugs to Keep Learning Active During a Pandemic,2020,"The recent pandemic Coronavirus disease-19 outbreak had traumatized global countries since its origin in late December 2019. Though the virus originated in China, it has spread rapidly across the world due its firmly established community transmission. To successfully tackle the spread and further infection, there needs a clear multidimensional understanding of the molecular mechanisms. Henceforth, 942 viral genome sequences were analysed to predict the core genomes crucial in virus life cycle. Additionally, 35 small interfering RNA transcripts were predicted that can target specifically the viral core proteins and reduce pathogenesis. The crystal structure of CoViD-19 main protease-6LU7 was chosen as an attractive target due to the factors that there were fewer mutations and whose structure had significant identity to the annotated protein sequence of the core genome. Drug repurposing of both recruiting and non recruiting drugs was carried out through molecular docking procedures to recognize bitolterol as a good inhibitor of CoViD -19 protease. The study was extended further to screen antiviral phytocompounds through quantitative structure activity relationship and molecular docking to identify davidigenin, from licorice as the best novel lead with good interactions and binding energy. The docking of the best compounds in all three categories was validated with molecular dynamics simulations which implied stable binding of the drug and lead molecule.

METHODS: Responses from 50 radiology departments involved in the management of COVID-19 patients representing 33 countries across all continents were analyzed. The analysis revealed important variations in imaging practices related to COVID-19 across the world for different disease severity and various clinical scenarios. RESULTS: Imaging is usually not performed in asymptomatic patients (69% of institutions do not image) but is used at the end of confinement (in 60% of institutions). In the majority of institutions, chest imaging is used in suspected or confirmed patients with COVID-19 (89% and 94%). All imaging departments involved in this survey reported the use of imaging in COVID-19 patients showing severe symptoms or who were critically ill. However, there is a wide variation in imaging modality type used for each clinical scenario.

338493,White House OSTP Leads Effort to Increase Access to Online Education Resources,2020,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence suggests that anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of statins may reduce the risk of infections and infection-related complications. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the impact of prior statin use on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity and mortality. METHODS: In this observational multicenter study, consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were enrolled. In-hospital mortality and severity of COVID-19 assessed with National Early Warning Score (NEWS) were deemed primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to obtain balanced cohorts. RESULTS: Among 842 patients enrolled, 179 (21%) were treated with statins before admission. Statin patients showed more comorbidities and more severe COVID-19 (NEWS 4 [IQR 2-6] vs 3 [IQR 2-5], p < 0.001). Despite having similar rates of intensive care unit admission, noninvasive ventilation, and mechanical ventilation, statin users appeared to show higher mortality rates. After balancing pre-existing relevant clinical conditions that could affect COVID-19 prognosis with PS matching, statin therapy confirmed its association with a more severe disease (NEWS &#8805;5 61% vs. 48%, p = 0.025) but not with in-hospital mortality (26% vs. 28%, p = 0.185). At univariate logistic regression analysis, statin use was confirmed not to be associated with mortality (OR 0.901; 95% CI: 0.537 to 1.51; p = 0.692) and to be associated with a more severe disease (NEWS&#8805;5 OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.067-2.71; p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Our results did not confirm the supposed favorable effects of statin therapy on COVID-19 outcomes.

340356,Does tourism promote migration? Evidence from Russia,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a contraction in economic activity that is unprecedented in both its nature and speed. In doing so, it has exposed who is protected and supported by modern welfare states, and who is not. While the US has a relatively robust set of social insurance and assistance programs for older Americans and working-age Americans who become unemployed or disabled, it lacks - in contrast to many other wealthy nations - a comparably strong universal or wide-reaching mechanism to support families with children. The US emergency relief packages enacted to date will undoubtedly mitigate the economic effects of the current crisis for many families, but because this legislation relies on the existing social policy infrastructure, its intended cash relief reinforces current inequalities and underserves families with children, with a particular impact on immigrant families and families of color. To protect all families with children through the immediate crisis and beyond, existing gaps and inequities in the US social safety net must be addressed. The creation of a national US child allowance offers a concrete and evidence-based way in which to do so. This analysis outlines key shortcomings in the existing system of US public support for families with children, the ways in which these shortcomings have been exacerbated in the COVID-19 economic response package to date, and how a national child allowance can provide the immediate relief families need during the pandemic and the unfolding economic downturn, as well as lay the foundation for positive health and development for all children in the years to follow.","Curran, Megan A; Minoff, Elisa",Soc Sci Humanit Open,,276

Despite abundant data on that many COVID-19 patients also displayed kidney disease, there is limited information available about the recovery of kidney disease after discharge. METHODS: Retrospective and prospective cohort study to patients with new-onset kidney disease during the COVID-19 hospitalization, admitted between January 28 to February 26, 2020. The median follow-up was 4 months after discharge. The follow-up patients were divided into the recovery group and non-recovery group. Descriptive statistics and between-groups comparison were used. RESULTS: In total, 143 discharged patients with new-onset kidney disease during the COVID-19 hospitalization were included. Patients had a median age was 64 (IQR, 51-70) years, and 59.4% of patients were men. During 4-months median follow-up, 91% (130 of 143) patients recovered from kidney disease, and 9% (13 of 143) patients haven't recovered. The median age of patients in the non-recovery group was 72 years, which was significantly higher than the median age of 62 years in the recovery group. Discharge serum creatinine was significantly higher in the non-recovery group than in the recovery group. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the new-onset kidney diseases during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients recovered 4 months after discharge. We recommend that COVID-19 patients with new-onset kidney disease be followed after discharge to assess kidney recovery, especially elderly patients or patients with high discharge creatinine.","Zhang, Nan-Hui; Cheng, Yi-Chun; Luo, Ran; Zhang, Chun-Xiu; Ge, Shu-Wang; Xu, Gang",BMC Infect Dis,,276

This rapidly spread causes serious negative effects on education, small, medium, and large businesses, economic, health, food security, employment, traveling, environment, energy, market, even causes countries to take loans and their debt rises. The specific knowledge about COVID-19 also affects education, which is a source of human capital formation. The data obtained from an online survey, covered from June 2020 to October 2020. The methods used are descriptive statistics, correlation, and multiple regression analysis. As the results generated, we confirmed that peoples’ perception about COVID-19 pandemic increases with mandatory testing in schools. In addition, the results also revealed that the work from the home measure is an insignificant negative impact on perception. 10% increases in work from the home measure, decreases people’s perception by 0.0305%. The results also confirmed that the reopening of schools had significant negative impact on mandatory testing in schools.10% increases in the reopening of school, decrease the mandatory testing in schools by 0.071%.

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the preocular tear film raises speculation that the ocular surface can act as an initial site of infection as well as a potential source of person-to-person viral transmission. More recently, conjunctival specimens and immunohistochemical analyses have identified the presence of cellular surface factors necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection on the ocular surface. Together, these results highlight the importance of safety measures in ophthalmology practices to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As ophthalmic exams typically require close proximity between a patient's respiratory tract and the provider, clinical and surgical recommendations are aimed at reducing unnecessary patient-provider interactions. Subspecialty professional guidelines can be used to instruct ophthalmologists on the necessity of various procedures and best practice measures. Ophthalmology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic has been dramatically curtailed in an effort to reduce the risk of transmission and converse valuable personal protective equipment (PPE), and the impacts of the ongoing pandemic on ophthalmology practices will be felt for the foreseeable future.","Hoeferlin, Cory; Hosseini, Hamid",SN Compr Clin Med,,276
348489,An unprecedented social solidarity stress test,2020,"COVID-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a new emerging zoonotic corona virus of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) family. COVID-19 originated in China and spread world-wide, resulting in the pandemic of 2020. For some reason, COVID-19 shows a considerably higher mortality rate in patients with advanced chronological age. This begs the question as to whether there is a functional association between COVID-19 infection and the process of chronological aging. Two host receptors have been proposed for COVID-19. One is CD26 and the other is ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Interestingly, both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence. Similarly, two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin, both drugs with significant senolytic activity. Also, Chloroquine-related compounds inhibit the induction of the well-known senescence marker, Beta-galactosidase. Other anti-aging drugs should also be considered, such as Rapamycin and Doxycycline, as they behave as inhibitors of protein synthesis, blocking both SASP and viral replication. Therefore, we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID-19 disease should involve testing the hypothesis that senolytics and other anti-aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus, as well as aid in its treatment. Thus, we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts. As Azithromycin and Doxycycline are both commonly used antibiotics that inhibit viral replication and IL-6 production, we may want to consider this general class of antibiotics that functionally inhibits cellular protein synthesis as a side-effect, for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease.","Sargiacomo, Camillo; Sotgia, Federica; Lisanti, Michael P",Aging (Albany NY),,276

The study was planned within a national network of 21 different centers. Demographics, FMF-related clinical and genetic characteristics, and COVID-19 outcomes were obtained. A total of 822 patients with FMF (mean age of 36 years) were included in the study. Fifty-nine of them (7%) had a COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by real-time PCR test or chest CT findings. Most FMF patients with COVID-19 (58) had mild and moderate disease activity. All patients were on colchicine treatment. However, 8 of them (13.6%) were not compliant with colchicine use and 9 of them (15.3%) were colchicine resistant. Twelve FMF patients with COVID-19 were hospitalized. There were 4 patients requiring oxygen support. COVID-19 related complications were observed in 2 patients (1 thromboembolism, 1 acute respiratory distress syndrome). Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with FMF were older than non-hospitalized patients (median ages: 51 and 31 years, respectively; p: 0.002). Other FMF-related characteristics were similar between the groups. FMF-related characteristics were not found to be associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19. Thus, FMF may not be a risk factor for poor COVID-19 outcomes.","Günendi, Zafer; Yurdakul, Fatma Gül; Bodur, Hatice; Cengiz, Ahmet Kivanç; Uçar, Ülkü; Çay, Hasan Fatih; Sen, Nesrin; Keskin, Yasar; Gürer, Gülcan; Melikoglu, Meltem Alkan; Altintas, Duygu; Deveci, Hülya; Baykul, Merve; Nas, Kemal; Çevik, Remzi; Karahan, Ali Yavuz; Toprak, Murat; Ketenci, Sertaç; Nayimoglu, Mehmet; Sezer, Ilhan; Demir, Ali Nail; Ecesoy, Hilal; Duruöz, Mehmet Tuncay; Yurdakul, Ozan Volkan; Sarifakioglu, Ayse Banu; Ataman, Sebnem",Rheumatol Int,,276

The policy has been commended but it had a devastating effect on the food economy of the Igbo people of Southeastern Nigeria.

This food deficit in the region was only possible because, among the several Nigerian ethnic nationalities, the Igbo owe much of their food supplies from outside. The Coronavirus pandemic total lockdown introduced by the federal government of Nigeria between the months of March to May 2020 amplified the food supply challenge. So while the crisis of food deficiency had the effect of traumatizing the people between 1967 and 1970 on account of the federal government food blockade leading to the brutal defeat of secessionist Biafra, the pandemic completely shut down the region with high prices of food across the length and breadth of the region.

In this study, one 23-bp nucleotide sequence mutation was identified in intron 1 of RORA gene in 532 female Australian White Sheep. Moreover, the polymorphic information content (PIC) values of this locus was 0.219. The litter size of ID genotype was significantly better than II genotype and DD genotype in the second born litter size (p < 0.05). This loci was related to third born litter size and the ID is the dominant genotype (p < 0.05). The association between combined genotypes and average litter size showed that sheep with heterozygote (ID) genotypes had larger lamb than homozygous (DD and II) genotypes. To sum, this study provided theoretical references for the comprehensively research of the function of RORA gene and the breeding of Australian White Sheep. The 23-bp indel variants could be considered as molecular markers for the second and third born litter size of sheep for MAS breeding.","Yang, Yuta; Hu, Huina; Mao, Cui; Jiang, Fugui; Lu, Xiaofang; Han, Xufei; Hao, Kunjie; Lan, Xianyong; Zhang, Qingfeng; Pan, Chuanying",Anim Biotechnol,,276

Although it may yield immediate savings by diverting health care from higher-cost settings, these savings could be countered if direct-to-consumer telemedicine increases follow-up care and, therefore, episode costs. Comparing downstream care utilization data from a large, commercial payer for the period 2016-19, we found that patients with initial visits for acute respiratory infection were more likely to obtain follow-up care within seven days after direct-to-consumer telemedicine visits (10.3 percent) than after in-person visits (5.9 percent). In both settings approximately 90 percent of patients did not obtain additional care. The telemedicine cohort had fewer (0.5 percent versus 0.6 percent) emergency department visits-a small but statistically significant difference-but more subsequent office, urgent care, and telemedicine visits. Our findings suggest that potential savings from shifting initial care to a direct-to-consumer telemedicine setting should be balanced against the potential for higher spending on downstream care.","Li, Kathleen Yinran; Zhu, Ziwei; Ng, Sophia; Ellimoottil, Chad",Health Aff (Millwood),,276
355149,COVID-19 and sustainable development goals (SDGs): An appraisal of the emanating effects in nigeria,2021,"The COVID-19 outbreak spread like a forest fire in the first quarter of 2020. Until September, more than 26 million people were affected by this epidemic. It has been 9 months since the first case was seen. However, a curative treatment method or vaccine has not been developed yet. Today, the only approach that can prevent the outbreak is classical epidemic control approaches such as hygiene, case isolation, contact tracing and quarantine. Contact tracing aims to reduce the spread of the epidemic by trying to analyze the potential transmission routes of the infection at the individual level. In addition, it will be possible to prevent official measures such as the curfew taken to prevent the epidemic from spreading. However, when considering ways of communication between people, the epidemic knows no boundaries. Mobile applications and artificial intelligence can be successful in analyzing this contact chain. Even if protecting human life is the highest degree moral duty, these methods contain many ethical problems. The most violated ethical values because of these practices are privacy, confidentiality of information, civil freedom and autonomy. In this study, we will try to analyze the ethical problems that arise with contact tracing mobile applications in the context of COVID-19. © 2021, DOC Design and Informatics Co. Ltd..

356561,Coronavirus impacts on post-pandemic planned travel behaviours,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has spread through the US during the last few months exposing healthcare providers to possible infection. Here we report testing of emergency department (ED) healthcare providers (HCP) for exposure to COVID-19 through lateral flow point of care (POC) and lab-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and RTq-PCR for evidence of acute infection. 138 ED HCP were tested between May 26th (approximately one month after the peak of COVID-19 first wave of cases) and June 14th. Enrolled ED HCP represented about 70% of the total ED HCP workforce during the study period. Subjects were tested with a POC COVID-19 antibody test, and standard ELISA performed by a university-based research lab. Subjects also provided a mid-turbinate swab and a saliva specimen for RTq-PCR. All subjects provided demographic information, past medical history, information about personal protective equipment (PPE) use, COVID-19 symptoms, as well as potential COVID-19 exposures during the previous 4 weeks, both in the ED, and outside the clinical setting. None of the HCP had positive RT-PCR results; 7 HCP (5%) had positive IgG for COVID-19; there was strong agreement between the lab-based ELISA (reference test) and the POC Ab test (P &#8804; 0.0001). For the POC Ab test there were no false negatives and only one false positive among the 138 participants. There was no significant difference in demographic/ethnic variables, past medical history, hours worked in the ED, PPE use, or concerning exposures between seropositive and seronegative individuals. Moreover, there was no significant difference in reported symptoms between the two groups during the previous four weeks. The rate of COVID-19 seroconversion in our ED was 5% during the month following the pandemic's first wave. Based on questionnaire responses, differences in demographics/ethnicity, medical history, COVID-19 exposures, and PPE use were not associated with ED HCP having been infected with SARS-CoV-2. In the setting of our limited cohort of subjects the COVID-19 POC Ab test performed comparably to the ELISA lab-based standard.","Murakami, Eric; Ghatak-Roy, Aditi; Popova, Margarita; Gannon, Carin; Park, Daniel E; Villani, Jack; Liu, Cindy; Toma, Ian; Lafleur, John",Am J Emerg Med,,276
356597,The corporate responsibility paradox: A multi-national investigation of business traveller attitudes and their sustainable travel behaviour,2021,"BACKGROUND: The year 2020 was the year of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The severity of the situation has become so substantial that many or even most of the patients with mild to moderate symptoms had to self-isolate without specific medical treatments or even without being tested for COVID-19. Many patients joined internet membership groups to exchange information and support each other. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to determine the benefits and limits of using social media to understand the symptoms of patients with suspected COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms and, in particular, their symptoms of anosmia (loss of the sense of smell) and ageusia (loss of the sense of taste). The voluntary reports on an internet website of a membership group will be the platform of the analyses. METHODS: Posts and comments of members of an internet group known as COVID-19 Smell and Taste Loss, founded on March 24, 2020, to support patients with suspected COVID-19 were collected and analyzed daily. Demographic data were collected using the software mechanism called Group Insights on the membership group website. RESULTS: Membership groups on social media have become rare sources of support for patients with suspected COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms. These groups provided mental support to their members and became resources for information on COVID-19 tests and medicines or supplements. However, the membership was voluntary, and often the members leave without notification. It is hard to be precise from the free voluntary reports. The number of women in the group (6995/9227, 75.38% as of October 12, 2020) was about three times more than men (2272/9227, 24.62% as of October 12, 2020), and the peak age of members was between 20-40 years in both men and women. Patients who were asymptomatic other than the senses comprised 14.93% (53/355) of the total patients. Recovery of the senses was higher in the patients who were asymptomatic besides having anosmia and ageusia. Most (112/123, 91.06%) patients experienced other symptoms first and then lost their senses, on average, 4.2 days later. Patients without other symptoms tended to recover earlier (P=.02). Patients with anosmia and ageusia occasionally reported distorted smell and taste (parosmia and dysgeusia) as well as experiencing or perceiving the smell and taste without the sources of the smell or taste (phantosmia and phantogeusia). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the social media database of suspected COVID-19 patients' voices demonstrated that, although accurate diagnosis of patients is not always obtained with social media-based analyses, it may be a useful tool to collect a large amount of data on symptoms and the clinical course of worldwide rapidly growing infectious diseases.","Koyama, Sachiko; Ueha, Rumi; Kondo, Kenji",J Med Internet Res,,276

357986,Distance education during the pandemic: New challenges to Russian higher education,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the health care systems suspended their non-urgent activities. This included the cancellation of consultations for patients with rare diseases, such as severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), resulting in potential medication shortage and loss of follow-up. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate PH patient health status evolution, access to health care and mental health experience during the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online patient survey, available in 16 languages, between 22/05/2020 and 28/06/2020. The survey included questions corresponding to demographic, COVID-19 and PH related information. RESULTS: 1073 patients (or relatives, 27%) from 52 countries all over the world participated in the survey. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of responders reported a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension and 15% of chronic thromboembolic PH. The COVID-19 related events were few: only 1% of all responders reported a diagnosis of COVID-19. However, 8% of patients reported health deterioration possibly related to PH, and 4% hospitalization for PH. Besides, 11% of the patients reported difficulties to access their PH expert centre, and 3% interruption of treatment due to shortage of medication. Anxiety or depression was reported by 67% of the participants. CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 incidence in PH patients was low, PH related problems occurred frequently as the pandemic progressed, including difficulties to have access to specialized care. The importance of primary health care was emphasized. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of COVID-related PH care disruption.","Godinas, Laurent; Iyer, Keerthana; Meszaros, Gergely; Quarck, Rozenn; Escribano-Subias, Pilar; Vonk Noordegraaf, Anton; Jansa, Pavel; D039,; Alto, Michele; Luknar, Milan; Milutinov Ilic, Senka; Belge, Catharina; Sitbon, Olivier; Reis, Abílio; Rosenkranz, Stephan; Pepke-Zaba, Joanna; Humbert, Marc; Delcroix, Marion",Orphanet J Rare Dis,,276

ANSWER 3 Globally, the most common reason for non-disclosure is stigmatisation due to the association of TB with poverty, risk of transmission and death.2'3 In Malaysia, TB has been perceived as shameful.4 The level of awareness is low;4-6 in one study of people living in Kudat, Sabah, participants expressed that getting TB was embarrassing (41%), too sensitive to discuss (16%) and a disgrace to the family (4%).4 Overall, attitudes towards patients with TB are poor, as most people would avoid meeting them.5'6 This is not unlike the current stigmatisation of COVID-19.7 CASE CONTINUED Over the years, there was a strong history of TB involving different generations of the patient's family (ie grandfather, granduncle, parents and siblings) infected at different times. ANSWER 7 Medication adherence and treatment completion are particularly problematic among adolescents.10 Direct observation of treatment by healthcare staff or a family member, text messaging reminders and home visits can prevent non-adherence.1 Key points * Pulmonary TB in the young can present acutely without classical constitutional symptoms. * When signs and symptoms are incongruent, it is important to broaden the differential diagnosis. * Beware of non-disclosure of stigmatising diseases during an initial patient encounter.

358748,Student teachers’ agency in the transition to emergency online learning,2021,"BACKGROUND: There are no reports of a large-scale survey on the infection prevention measures against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in nephrology facilities. This study investigated the facility-level nephrology practices adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic and their associated challenges. Additionally, the treatment patterns and outcomes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with COVID-19 were reviewed. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide questionnaire survey of 704 educational facilities that were certified by the Japanese Society of Nephrology (JSN) from October 20, 2020 to November 16, 2020. The questionnaire reviewed the facility characteristics, infection prevention measures taken during routine nephrology practice, impact of COVID-19 on nephrology practice, experiences in managing CKD patients with COVID-19, and nosocomial transmission in the nephrology unit. RESULTS: Of the 347 facilities that responded, 95.1% checked outpatients' body temperatures and COVID-19 symptoms at their visits. To reduce face-to-face contact, 80% and 70% of the facilities lengthened the intervals between outpatient visits and introduced online/telephonic consultations, respectively. As a result, more than half of the hospitals experienced a decrease in the numbers of outpatients and inpatients (64% and 50%, respectively). During the study period, 347 facilities managed 479 CKD patients with COVID-19. Oxygen administration and mechanical ventilation were performed for 47.8% and 16.5% of the patients, respectively, with a 9.2% total mortality rate. CONCLUSION: This survey demonstrated that JSN-certified educational nephrology facilities adopted multiple measures to manage the COVID-19 pandemic; however, they faced several challenges. Sharing these experiences could standardize these approaches and prepare us better for the future.","Sugawara, Yuka; Iwagami, Masao; Yoshida, Yoko; Kikuchi, Kan; Ando, Ryoichi; Shinoda, Toshio; Ryuzaki, Munekazu; Nakamoto, Hidetomo; Sakai, Ken; Hanafusa, Norio; Kashihara, Naoki; Nangaku, Masaomi",Clin. exp. nephrol,,276
359509,Automatically Selecting Striking Images for Social Cards,2021-03-08,"ConspectusFuel cells are among the cutting-edge energy technologies. Their commercial development is still hindered by noble platinum (Pt) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode, which not only determine the energy conversion efficiency and service life but also are closely related to the cost and broad application of fuel cells. Given the bright and enormous future of fuel cells, ORR catalysts should possess highly efficient performance yet meet the acceptable Pt costs for large-scale application. Extensive efforts are concentrated on the optimization of Pt-based nanostructures and upgradation of functional carriers to achieve the low-cost and high-activity Pt-based catalysts. By improving the Pt utilization and accessible surface, reducing Pt consumption and catalyst costs, accelerating mass exchange and electron transfer, alleviating the corrosion and agglomeration of carriers and Pt, accompanying with the assistance of robust yet effective functional supports, the service level and life of Pt-based electrocatalysts would be significantly improved and fuel cells could get into commercial market covering broader applications.In this Account, we focus on the recent development of Pt-based catalysts to figure out the problems associated with ORR catalysts in fuel cells. Recent development of Pt-based catalysts is discussed in different stages: (1) multiscale development of Pt-based nanostructures; (2) multielement regulation over Pt-based alloy composition; (3) upgradation of carbon and noncarbon support architectures; (4) development of integrated Pt-based catalysts for fuel cells. Finally, we propose some future issues (such as reaction mechanism, dynamic evolutions, and structure-activity relationship) for Pt-based catalysts, which mainly involve the preparation strategy of Pt-integrated catalysts (combination of Pt nanostructures with nanocarbons), performance evaluation (standard measurement protocols, laboratory-level rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements, application-level membrane electrode assembly (MEA) service test), advanced interpretation techniques (spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and in situ monitoring), and cutting-edge simulation/calculations and artificial intelligence (simulation, calculations, machine learning, big data screening). This Account calls for the comprehensive development of multiscale, multicomponent, and high-entropy Pt-based alloy nanostructures, and novel and stable carriers, which provide more available options for rational design of low-cost and high-performance Pt-integrated ORR catalysts. More importantly, it will give an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism, dynamic development, and structure-performance relationship for Pt-based catalysts in fuel cells and related energy technologies.","Huang, Lei; Zaman, Shahid; Tian, Xinlong; Wang, Zhitong; Fang, Wensheng; Xia, Bao Yu",Acc. chem. res,,276

Our results revealed that none of these interventions or their combinations increased willingness to be vaccinated shortly after a vaccine becomes available. Consequently, decision makers should be cautious about introducing monetary incentives and instead focus on interventions that increase confidence in vaccine safety first, as this has shown to be an especially important factor regarding the demand for the new COVID-19 vaccines.","Sprengholz, Philipp; Eitze, Sarah; Felgendreff, Lisa; Korn, Lars; Betsch, Cornelia",J. med. ethics,,276

The purpose of our current study was to investigate the role of immune imprinting by influenza on pneumococcal vaccine effectiveness during Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in the aged murine lung. Aged adult (18 months) mice were vaccinated with the pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine Pneumovax (5 mg/mouse). Fourteen days post vaccination, mice were instilled with PBS or influenza A/PR8/34 virus (3.5 × 102PFU). Control and influenza-infected mice were instilled with PBS or S. pneumoniae (1 × 103CFU, ATCC 6303) on day 7 of infection and antibacterial immune responses were assessed in the lung. Our results illustrate that, in response to a primary influenza infection, there was diminished bacterial clearance and heightened production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL6 and IL1β. Vaccination with Pneumovax decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production by modulating NFҡB expression; however, these responses were significantly diminished after influenza infection. Taken together, the data in our current study illustrate that immune imprinting by influenza diminishes pneumococcal vaccine efficacy and, thereby, may contribute to increased susceptibility of older persons to a secondary infection with S. pneumoniae.","Jirru, Ermias; Lee, Stefi; Harris, Rebecca; Yang, Jianjun; Cho, Soo Jung; Stout-Delgado, Heather",Vaccines,,276

To date, the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), which is also known as the main protease, is considered among the most important pharmacological targets. The vast majority of investigated 3CLpro inhibitors are organic, non-covalent binders. Herein, the use of inorganic, coordinate covalent binders is proposed that can attenuate the activity of the protease. Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes were identified that demonstrate coordinate covalent enzymatic inhibition of 3CLpro. Preliminary studies indicate the selective inhibition of 3CLpro over several human proteases.

The identifier of systematic review registration was PROSPERO CRD42020220927. A total of 66 studies involving 40,614 COVID-19 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Pooled data showed that patients in high D-dimer group had poor prognosis than those in low D-dimer group [OR = 4.52, 95% CI = (3.61, 5.67), P &lt; 0.001;HR = 2.81, 95% CI = (1.85, 4.27), P &lt; 0.001]. Sensitivity analysis, pooled data based on different effect models and the Duval and Tweedie trim-and-fill method did not change the conclusions. Subgroup analyses stratified by different countries, cutoffs, sample size, study design, and analysis of OR/HR still keep consistent conclusions. D-dimer was identified as an independent predictor for COVID-19 mortality. A series of values including 0.5 mu g/ml, 1 mu g/ml, and 2 mu g/ml could be determined as cutoff of D-dimer for clinic use. Measurement and monitoring of D-dimer might assist clinicians to take immediate medical actions and predict the prognosis of COVID-19.","Li, Y. Y.; Deng, Y. H.; Ye, L.; Sun, H. Y.; Du, S.

By utilizing convalescent plasma derived exosomes (CPExo) from COVID-19 recovered persistence could accelerate the treatment strategies in the current state of affairs. Adequate literature has shown that administering the exosome to the in vivo system could be beneficial and could target the pathogens in an effective and precise manner. In this hypothesis we highlight the CPExo instead of convalescent plasma (CP), perhaps to dispense of exosomes are gratified and it's more effectively acquired immune response conferral through antibodies. COVID-19 convalescent plasma has billions of exosomes and it has aptitudes to carry molecular constituents like proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA, etc. Moreover, exosomes are capable of recognizing antigens with adequate sensitivity and specificity. Many of these derivatives could trigger an immune modulation into the cells and act as an epigenetic inheritor response to target pathogens through RNAs. COIVID-19 resistance activated plasma-derived exosomes are either responsible for the effects of plasma beyond the contained immune antibodies or could be inhibitory. The proposed hypothesis suggests that preselecting the plasma-derived antibodies and RNAs merged exosomes would be an optimized therapeutic tactic for COVID-19 patients. We suggest that, the CPExo has a multi-potential effect for treatment efficacy by acting as immunotherapeutic, drug carrier, and diagnostic target with noncoding genetic materials as a biomarker.","Anand, Krishnan; Vadivalagan, Chithravel; Joseph, Jitcy Saji; Singh, Sachin Kumar; Gulati, Monica; Shahbaaz, Mohd; Abdellattif, Magda H; Prasher, Parteek; Gupta, Gaurav; Chellappan, Dinesh Kumar; Dua, Kamal",Chem Biol Interact,,276

There is still no agreed nomenclature to refer to this condition, but perhaps the most commonly used is post-COVID syndrome. The Scientific Committee on COVID of the Madrid College of Physicians (ICOMEM) has discussed this problem with a multidisciplinary approach in which internists, infectious disease specialists, psychiatrists, pneumologists, surgeons, geriatricians, pediatricians, microbiologists, family physicians and other specialists have participated, trying to gather the existing information and discussing it in the group. The clinical manifestations are very variable and range from simple fatigue to persistent fibrosing lung lesions with objective alterations of pulmonary function. Post-COVID syndrome seems to be particularly frequent and severe in adults who have required admission to Intensive Care Units and has a peculiar behavior in a very small group of children. The post-COVID syndrome, which undoubtedly exists, is at first sight not clearly distinguishable from clinical manifestations that which occur after other acute viral diseases and after prolonged stays in ICUs due to other diseases. Therefore, it offers excellent research opportunities to clarify its pathogenesis and possibly that of other related entities. It is possible that progressively there will be an increased demand for care among the millions of people who have suffered and overcome acute COVID for which the health authorities should design mechanisms for the agile management of care that will possibly require well-coordinated multidisciplinary groups.

Among these, green building certification systems (GBCSs) should not be left behind as significant potential modifications may be required to ensure their versatility for residential buildings due to the new pandemic reality. The present study aims to evaluate the readiness of chosen GBCSs for a proper assessment of existing residential housing sustainability in a post-pandemic world. Based on a literature review of the state-of-the-art data sources and round table discussions, the present study proposes a particular set of sustainability indicators covering special sustainability requirements under pandemic conditions. Then, those indicators are used to evaluate the readiness of selected GBCSs (BREEAM, LEED, WELL, CASBEE) to meet new pandemic-resilient requirements based on their responses to the indicators. The assessment shows that none of the reviewed GBCSs are fully ready to cover all the proposed indicators. GBCSs have differing focuses on particular sustainability pillars, which also affected their responses to pandemic-resilient categories. For instance, WELL rating system successfully responded to the health and safety category, whereas LEED showed better preparedness in terms of environmental efficiency. BREEAM and CASBEE systems have a more evenly distributed attention to all three pandemic-resilient categories (Health & Safety, Environmental Resources Consumption, and Comfort) with an accent on the Comfort category. On a specific note, all GBCSs are insufficiently prepared for waste and wastewater management. In the future, GBCSs should be modified to better adapt to pandemic conditions, for which the current work may provide a basis. As an alternative, brand new standards can be created to face newly arising and evolving post-pandemic requirements.","Tleuken, Aidana Tokazhanov Galym Guney Mert Turkyilmaz Ali Karaca Ferhat",Sustainability,,276

In terms of demographic processes, mortality has risen in many countries, international migration and mobility has been widely curtailed, and rising unemployment and job insecurity is expected to lower fertility rates in the near future. This paper attempts to examine the possible effects of COVID-19 on Australia's demography over the next two decades, focusing in particular on population ageing. Several population projections were prepared for the period 2019-41. We formulated three scenarios in which the pandemic has a short-lived impact of 2-3 years, a moderate impact lasting about 5 years, or a severe impact lasting up to a decade. We also created two hypothetical scenarios, one of which illustrates Australia's demographic future in the absence of a pandemic for comparative purposes, and another which demonstrates the demographic consequences if Australia had experienced excess mortality equivalent to that recorded in the first half of 2020 in England & Wales. Our projections show that the pandemic will probably have little impact on numerical population ageing but a moderate effect on structural ageing. Had Australia experienced the high mortality observed in England & Wales there would have been 19,400 excess deaths. We caution that considerable uncertainty surrounds the future trajectory of COVID-19 and therefore the demographic responses to it. The pandemic will need to be monitored closely and projection scenarios updated accordingly.","Wilson, Tom; Temple, Jeromey; Charles-Edwards, Elin",J Popul Res (Canberra),,276

375845,Stance detection with BERT embeddings for credibility analysis of information on social media,2021,"Introduction: As further studies elucidate the extent of organ systems affected by COVID-19, extra-pulmonary involvement is emerging as an important contributor to its morbidity and lethality. Beta-islet cells in the pancreas have been shown to be affected by COVID-19 via ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors. Accordingly, diabetes mellitus (DM) has not only been described as an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19, but there is also an association between new-onset DM (NODM) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with COVID-19. This case report discusses a patient with NODM presenting with DKA precipitated by COVID-19. Case Summary: A 45-year-old male with no past medical history who emigrated from India in March 2020 presented to the emergency department with five days of dyspnea, chills, fatigue, polyuria, and polydipsia. He was COVID-19 PCR-positive while his labs were remarkable for WBC 14, sodium 126, bicarbonate 2, glucose 350, anion gap 33, pH 6.95, pCO2 26, lactate 4.4, D-dimer 479, LDH 350, Ferritin 2381, Procalcitonin 1.13, HIV negative, and significant ketonuria. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral lower lobe patchy infiltrates consistent with COVID-19. He was started on an insulin drip, therapeutic Enoxaparin, and fluid resuscitation. He did not require supplemental oxygen and was not treated with steroids or antivirals. He was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin after one day. He was discharged after an uncomplicated five-day hospital stay. Discussion: There has been an increasing number of reports describing DKA precipitated by COVID-19 in patients with NODM, though our patient presentation is unique because he had a mild COVID-19 course that precipitated severe DKA. This case indicates a more direct role of COVID-19 damaging beta-cells in the pancreas as our patient remained on insulin and no other diabetic medications at discharge and after follow-up, indicating a complete reliance on exogenous insulin and failure of the pancreas to produce insulin seen with type-1 DM. The patient's HbA1c of 13.3 indicates a chronic state of DM, though COVID-19 certainly contributed to establishing NODM and DKA likely by wiping the remaining function of the Beta-cells in the pancreas. This uncommon case presentation demonstrates that even mild COVID-19 can induce DKA, so it is imperative that further research be conducted on its mechanism and prevention in the future.","Ricker, S.; Bradley, E.

The aim of the research is to study international standards for bank capital regulation and their impact on financial stability and sustainability of domestic banking systems. The 2007-2009 Global Financial Crisis was perhaps the greatest banking and financial crisis since bank failures and the financial panic of the Great Depression in early 1930s. According to academics and professionals, there has been much debate over the last decade as to whether the 2007-2009 banking crisis was primarily a solvency crisis or a liquidity crisis. Capital adequacy of banks today is the main indicator of increasing society's confidence in banking systems. The flexible and balanced implementation of Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) recommendations on the assessment of bank capital adequacy is of particular importance in the context of the deepening economic crisis caused by COVID-19 quarantine restrictions. Regulation of bank capital is primarily settles by the ability to execute basic functions inherent in it. A number of shocks in connection with the crisis require the renewal and search for a new paradigm of regulation, which today is focused on achieving financial stability, overcoming pro-cyclicality, especially in the banking sector. One of the latest developments in the field of bank capital regulation has been the implementation of international banking supervision standards recommended by BCBS, which have been transformed from Basel I, Basel II, Basel III, Basel 3.5 to Basel IV. The new ideology suggests that in times of financial and economic crisis or in anticipation of growing uncertainty in the economy, it is necessary to abandon the idea of bank capital management and the creation of financial reserves to maintain liquidity and stability of financial institutions. These measures will not be able to protect the bank from default and bankruptcy. This ideology has become a new paradigm of effective banking regulation, which can be formulated as an accepted set of three vectors: risk;risk management;risk-oriented supervision.","Kovalenko, V.; Sheludko, S.; Radova, N.; Murshudli, F.; Gonchar, K.",Financial and Credit Activity-Problems of Theory and Practice,,276

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Clinic-demographic characteristics, laboratory values, and high-sensitivity troponin I were extracted from the electronic database. Mortality and other clinical complications, including respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and acute kidney injury were recorded. Myocardial injury was defined as having a serum troponin I value >19.8 ng/mL. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression to determine survival times and independent predictors of mortality. RESULTS: A total of 324 patients were included. Seventy-seven patients (23.8%) had acute myocardial injury. The primary outcome measure, namely death, occurred in 54.5% and 3.2% of the patients with and without myocardial injury, respectively. Notably, 75.3% of the patients with myocardial injury and 6.5% of the patients without myocardial injury developed ARDS. Overall, 50 out of 324 patients (15.4%) died during the study period. The mortality rate was 54.5% in patients with myocardial injury and 3.2% in patients without myocardial injury. Mean survival times were significantly different between the groups (15.1±0.9 days in patients with myocardial injury and 24.4±0.7 days in patients without myocardial injury, log-rank test p-value <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of chronic kidney disease and application of invasive mechanical ventilation were found to be independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.

In particular, the multisystemic and contextually sensitive nature of their resilience is under-appreciated. PURPOSE: In response we conceptualized a discussion paper. Its intention is to make a case for a contextually relevant, multisystemic understanding of the resilience of sub-Saharan children and youth with exposure to maltreatment. METHOD: This discussion paper draws on a critical analysis of pertinent peer-reviewed publications. It also draws on our lifelong residence in sub-Saharan Africa and related insight into this region's situational and cultural dynamics. RESULTS: We advance three assertions regarding the multisystemic nature of sub-Saharan young people's resilience to abuse and neglect : (i) familyâcommunities are pivotal to sub-Saharan child and youth resilience to maltreatment; (ii) institutional supports matter too, particularly when multiple systems interact to provide networks of institutional support; and (iii) the resilience-enabling potential of built and natural environments is yet to be fully harnessed. CONCLUSION: Interacting social and ecological system factors and processes matter for the resilience of sub-Saharan children and youth who experience abuse and neglect.

Universities have implemented adaptive measures to maintain educational activities and achieve the learning objectives for undergraduate and postgraduate students by shifting to online teaching and learning. Although such approaches have enabled delivering the theoretical content of courses during the pandemic, universities have faced serious difficulties in running practicals with actual research experiments and teaching hand-on skills because such activities potentially override the required safety guidelines. Here, we report an adaptive measure, implemented at Monash University, to run home-based studies in cognitive neuroscience and achieve learning objectives, which are normally delivered in face-to-face practicals. We introduce two specifically designed short-term research projects and describe how different aspects of these projects, such as tutorials, experiments, and assessments, were modified to meet the required social distancing. The results of cognitive tests were closely comparable between the laboratory-based and home-based experiments indicating that students followed the guidelines and the required procedures for a reliable data collection.

In this study we characterize the disease course and severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients with gastrointestinal manifestations in a large, diverse cohort from the Unites States. METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 between March 11 and April 28, 2020 at two affiliated hospitals in New York City. We evaluated the association between GI symptoms and death, and also explored disease duration, from symptom onset to death or discharge. RESULTS: Of 2,804 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the 1,084 (38.7%) patients with GI symptoms were younger (aOR for age&#8805;75 0.59, 95% CI 0.45-0.77) and had more co-morbidities (aOR for modified Charlson comorbidity score &#8805;2 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.48) compared to those without GI symptoms. Individuals with GI symptoms had better outcomes, with a lower likelihood of intubation (aHR 0.66, 95% CI 0.55-0.79) and death (aHR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.87), after adjusting for clinical factors. These patients had a longer median disease course from symptom onset to discharge (13.8 vs. 10.8 days, log-rank p=0.048; among 769 survivors with available symptom onset time), which was driven by longer time from symptom onset to hospitalization (7.4 vs. 5.4 days, log-rank p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Hospitalized patients with GI manifestations of COVID-19 have a reduced risk of intubation and death, but may have a longer overall disease course driven by duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization.","Laszkowska, Monika; Faye, Adam S; Kim, Judith; Truong, Han; Silver, Elisabeth R; Ingram, Myles; May, Benjamin; Ascherman, Benjamin; Bartram, Logan; Zucker, Jason; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E; Abrams, Julian A; Lebwohl, Benjamin; Freedberg, Daniel E; Hur, Chin",Clin. gastroenterol. hepatol,,276

389861,The Effect of the Covid-19 Lockdown on Air Quality in Three Italian Medium-Sized Cities,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To report the cognitive features of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) entering the postacute phase, to understand whether COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome itself could result in long-term cognitive deficits, and to determine whether neuropsychological treatment after the acute stage might represent a specific rehabilitation need. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Rehabilitation hospital. PARTICIPANTS: We assessed the general cognitive functioning through tablet-supported video calls in 9 of 12 consecutive patients (N=9) admitted to the hospital at least 30 days earlier for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19. Three patients were excluded based on the exclusion criteria. None of the patients presented cognitive symptoms before hospitalization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: General cognitive functioning, measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test. RESULTS: A general cognitive decay was observed in 3 patients (33.3%) who had a pathologic score on the MMSE, with a specific decline in attention, memory, language, and praxis abilities. The cognitive malfunctioning appears to be linearly associated with the length of stay (in d) in the intensive care unit (ICU). The longer the amount of time spent in the ICU, the lower the MMSE score, indicating a lower global cognitive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that some patients with COVID-19 might also benefit from neuropsychological rehabilitation, given their possible global cognitive decay. The link between neuropsychological functioning and the length of stay in the ICU suggests that neurocognitive rehabilitative treatments should be directed explicitly toward patients who treated in the ICU, rather than toward every patient who experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome owing to COVID-19. However, given the limitation of a case series study, those hypotheses should be tested with future studies with larger samples and a longer follow-up period.","Negrini, Francesco; Ferrario, Irene; Mazziotti, Daniele; Berchicci, Marzia; Bonazzi, Maurizio; de Sire, Alessandro; Negrini, Stefano; Zapparoli, Laura",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,,276

In this context, one of the key technological enablers is represented by the motion-planning and control system, with the aim of guaranteeing the occupants comfort and safety. In this paper, a trajectory-planning and control algorithm is developed based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach that is able to work in different road scenarios (such as urban areas and motorways). This MPC is designed considering imitation-learning from a specific dataset (from real-world overtaking maneuver data), with the aim of getting human-like behavior. The algorithm is used to generate optimal trajectories and control the vehicle dynamics. Simulations and Hardware-In-the-Loop tests are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and computation efficiency of the proposed approach.","Karimshoushtari, Milad; Novara, Carlo; Tango, Fabio",Sensors (Basel),,276

390864,Promoting individual and group regulation through social connection: strategies for remote learning,2020,"The presence of extra dimensions generically modify the spacetime geometry of a rotating black hole, by adding an additional hair, besides the mass $M$ and the angular momentum $J$, known as the `tidal charge' parameter, $\beta$. In a braneworld scenario with one extra spatial dimension, the extra dimension is expected to manifest itself through -- (a) negative values of $\beta$, and (b) modified gravitational perturbations. This in turn would affect the quasi-normal modes of rotating black holes. We numerically solve the perturbed gravitational field equations using the continued fractions method and determine the quasi-normal mode spectra for the braneworld black hole. We find that increasingly negative values of $\beta$ correspond to a diminishing imaginary part of the quasi-normal mode, or equivalently, an increasing damping time. Using the publicly available data of the properties of the remnant black hole in the gravitational wave signal GW150914, we check for consistency between the predicted values (for a given $\beta$) of the frequency and damping time of the least-damped $\ell=2,m=2$ quasi-normal mode and measurements of these quantities using other independent techniques. We find that it is highly unlikely for the tidal charge, $\beta \lesssim -0.05$, providing a conservative limit on the tidal charge parameter. Implications and future directions are discussed.","Mishra, Akash K; Ghosh, Abhirup; Chakraborty, Sumanta",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05558v1.pdf,276
390865,Promoting individual and group regulation through social connection: strategies for remote learning,2020,"Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is characterized by a heterogeneous group of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas, in which monoclonal T lymphocytes infiltrate the skin. LW-213, a derivative of wogonin, was found to induce cell apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this study, we investigated the effects of LW-213 on CTCL cells and the underlying mechanisms. We showed that LW-213 (1-25 µM) dose-dependently inhibited human CTCL cell lines (Hut-102, Hut-78, MyLa, and HH) with IC50 values of around 10 µM, meanwhile it potently inhibited primary leukemia cells derived from peripheral blood of T-cell lymphoma patients. We revealed that LW-213-induced apoptosis was accompanied by ROS formation and the release of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through IP3R-1channel. LW-213 selectively activated CHOP and induced apoptosis in Hut-102 cells via activating PERK-eIF2&#945;-ATF4 pathway. Interestingly, the degree of apoptosis and expression of ER stress-related proteins were alleviated in the presence of either N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, or 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB), an IP3R-1 inhibitor, implicating ROS/calcium-dependent ER stress in LW-213-induced apoptosis. In NOD/SCID mice bearing Hut-102 cell line xenografts, administration of LW-213 (10 mg/kg, ip, every other day for 4 weeks) markedly inhibited the growth of Hut-102 derived xenografts and prolonged survival. In conclusion, our study provides a new insight into the mechanism of LW-213-induced apoptosis, suggesting the potential of LW-213 as a promising agent against CTCL.","Yu, Xiao-Xuan; Zhu, Meng-Yuan; Wang, Jia-Rong; Li, Hui; Hu, Po; Qing, Ying-Jie; Wang, Xiang-Yuan; Wang, Hong-Zheng; Wang, Zhan-Yu; Xu, Jing-Yan; Guo, Qing-Long; Hui, Hui",Acta pharmacol.

Epidemiological data on pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases after school opening are warranted. METHODS: We analyzed data of the pediatric patients with COVID-19 collected from the press release of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Information on the school opening delay and re-opening policies were achieved from the press release of the Korean Ministry of Education. RESULTS: The school openings were delayed three times in March 2020. Online classes started from April 9, and off-line (in-person) classes started from May 20 to June 8 at four steps in different grades of students. There was no sudden increase in pediatric cases after the school opening, and the proportion of pediatric cases among total confirmed cases in the nation around 7.0%. As of July 31, 44 children from 38 schools and kindergartens were diagnosed with COVID-19 after off-line classes started. More than 13,000 students and staffs were tested; only one additional student was found to be infected in the same classroom. The proportions of pediatric patients without information on infection sources were higher in older age groups than in younger age groups (17.4% vs. 52.4%, P = 0.014). In the younger age group, 78.3% of children were infected by family members, while only 23.8% of adolescents in the older age group were infected by family members (P < 0.001).

394830,"Online Teaching Practices and Strategies for Inorganic Chemistry Using a Combined Platform Based on DingTalk, Learning@ZJU, and WeChat",2020,"Favipiravir is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. It is currently used as a possible treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Pre-clinical or clinical trials of favipiravir require robust, sensitive, and accurate bioanalytical methods for quantitation of favipiravir levels. Recently, several studies have been reported about developing a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for measuring favipiravir levels. However, these methods were validated predominantly for plasma samples, electrospray ionization was operated only in negative or positive mode, and clinical application of these methods has not been applied for patients with COVID-19. This study aimed was to develop a validated LC-MS/MS method for the measurement of favipiravir levels in positive and negative electrospray ionization mode and to perform a pilot study in patients with COVID-19 receiving favipiravir to demonstrate the applicability of this method in biological samples. Simple protein precipitation was used for the extraction of favipiravir from the desired matrix. Favipiravir levels were quantitated using MS / MS with an electrospray ionization source in positive and negative multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The chromatographic detection was performed on a reverse-phase Phenomenex C18 column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm, 100 Å) with gradient elution using 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in methanol as mobile phase. The method was linear over the concentration ranges of 0.048-50 µg/mL (in negative ionization mode) and 0.062-50 µg/mL (in positive ionization mode) with a correlation coefficient (r2) better than 0.998. The total run time was 3.5 min. The intra-assay and inter-assay %CV values were less than 7.2% and 8.0%, respectively. A simple, rapid and robust LC-MS / MS method was developed for the measurement of favipiravir and validation studies were performed. The validated method was successfully applied for drug level measurement in COVID-19 patients receiving favipiravir.","Eryavuz Onmaz, Duygu; Abusoglu, Sedat; Onmaz, Mustafa; Yerlikaya, Fatma Humeyra; Unlu, Ali",J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci,,276

On Questioning the Right Assumptions,2020,"BACKGROUND: WHO has recommended personal hygiene (respiratory hygiene, using face masks, washing hands with warm water and soap, use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, avoid touching mouth, eyes & nose, cleanliness), social distancing and careful handling of purchased products as an effective preventive measure for COVID-19 disease. The growing pandemic of COVID-19 disease requires social distancing and personal hygiene measures to protect public health. But this message is not clear and well understood among people. The aim of this study is to determine the awareness, knowledge and attitude about COVID-19 and relate the behaviour of Indian society, especially when the country is restarting all its economic activities, after the complete lockdown. METHOD: The present paper is based on an extensive survey among 21 406 adult participants of various sections of Indian society with different age groups between 18 and 80 years to introspect the level of public awareness with respect to cause, spread, prevention and treatment of disease caused by spread of COVID-19 viral outbreak, which will be automatically reflected in the societal behavioural response of rigorous precautionary measures. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to extend the knowledge base among individuals to enhance their active participation in the prevention mechanisms with respect to the spread of the pandemic. There is a need to elaborate the Indian socio-cultural aspects, so that society starts appreciating and voluntarily following social distancing. This should improve the adaptability of people with livelihood resilience to let them protect themselves not only from the present pandemic but also from all other unforeseen infections, and to provide care to patients.","Kaushik, Manish; Agarwal, Divya; Gupta, Anil K",Postgrad. med. j,,276

Understanding the history of RTX in SLE would be instructive in the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) saga in COVID-19. Three steps would be necessary and sufficient before definitively closing the debate: 1) determine the effective and safe dose of HCQ, as well as the minimum duration of treatment in COVID-19;2) define the profile of patients in whom HCQ would be more likely to be effective (especially in asymptomatic patients and/or at the onset of the first signs of the disease) and 3) conduct one or more multicentre RCT to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19 in SSA.","Lekpa, F.

The prevalence of such syndromes among community samples of children and adolescents remains less well characterized. MethodWe identified all individuals age 5-18 across 2 New England health systems who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test between 3/12/2020 and 4/18/2021 and at least 90 days of follow-up visits documented in electronic health records. We identified neuropsychiatric symptoms in intervals prior to, and following, this testing using a previously-derived set of ICD-10 codes and natural language processing terms. Primary analysis examined sociodemographic features associated with presence of at least one incident (i.e., new-onset) neuropsychiatric symptom between 90 and 150 days after an initial positive test for COVID-19. ResultsAmong 5058 children (50% female, 2.9% Asian, 6.3% Black, and 63% White; 30% Hispanic; mean age was 12.4 (IQR 8.9-15.6), 366 (7.2%) exhibited at least one new-onset neuropsychiatric symptom between 90 and 150 days following initial SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. The most common incident symptoms at 90-150 days were headache (2.4%), mood and anxiety symptoms (2.4%), cognitive symptoms (2.3%), and fatigue (1.1%). In regression models, older children, girls, those with Hispanic ethnicity, those with public versus private insurance, and those with greater overall burden of medical comorbidity were more likely to exhibit subsequent symptoms. ConclusionThe prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms between 3- and 5-months following SARS-CoV-2 test positivity is similar to that observed in the period prior to infection. Prospective controlled studies will be needed to further refine these estimates.","Castro, Victor M; Gunning, Faith M; Perlis, Roy H",,,276

Although thrombocytopaenia is considered a minor criterion for admission within an intensive care unit, a low platelet count has been observed in COVID-19 patients, including a pregnant woman, who developed severe pulmonary complications. Furthermore, thrombocytopaenia has been proposed as a potential biomarker in order to identify cases at high-risk complications. Nevertheless, thrombocytopaenia is a relatively frequent condition observed in pregnancy.

The test was engineered around a glucometer as it is quantitative, easy to use, and the most prevalent piece of diagnostic equipment globally, making the test highly scalable with an infrastructure that is already in place. Furthermore, many glucometers connect to smartphones, providing an opportunity to integrate with contact tracing apps, medical providers, and electronic health records. In clinical testing, the developed assay detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient saliva across a range of viral loads - as benchmarked by RT-qPCR - within 1 h, with 100% sensitivity (positive percent agreement) and distinguished infected specimens from off-target antigens in uninfected controls with 100% specificity (negative percent agreement).

Resting motor threshold (MT) is a measure of cortical excitability, largely driven by glutamate. Perampanel, a glutamate &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor blocker, is predicted to increase the cortical excitability threshold. This study aimed to evaluate TMS to functionally assess target engagement in a study of perampanel in ALS. METHOD: We studied the MT of ALS patients randomized to a single dose of perampanel or placebo 5:1 hourly for 4 h. Twelve patients participated at 4 mg and 7 returned for dosing and retesting at 8 mg. The study was terminated in April 2020 due to coronavirus disease 2019-related restrictions, after 7 out of 12 planned patients had received the 8 mg dose. Serum concentrations were also measured. RESULTS: Ten patients received the 4 mg dose (2 received placebo) and 5 received the 8 mg dose (2 received placebo). Motor Threshold increased at 2 h after dosing in the combined treatment group +7% of maximal stimulator output (P < .01). Change could be detected in the larger 4 mg group (P = .02), but not in the smaller 8 mg dose group (P = .1). No side effects were reported after single dose exposure. DISCUSSION: This study shows that perampanel effects the physiology of upper motor neurons. Studies aiming at gauging the effect of perampanel on ALS disease progression are already ongoing.

Resting motor threshold (MT) is a measure of cortical excitability, largely driven by glutamate. Perampanel, a glutamate &#945;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor blocker, is predicted to increase the cortical excitability threshold. This study aimed to evaluate TMS to functionally assess target engagement in a study of perampanel in ALS. METHOD: We studied the MT of ALS patients randomized to a single dose of perampanel or placebo 5:1 hourly for 4 h. Twelve patients participated at 4 mg and 7 returned for dosing and retesting at 8 mg. The study was terminated in April 2020 due to coronavirus disease 2019-related restrictions, after 7 out of 12 planned patients had received the 8 mg dose. Serum concentrations were also measured. RESULTS: Ten patients received the 4 mg dose (2 received placebo) and 5 received the 8 mg dose (2 received placebo). Motor Threshold increased at 2 h after dosing in the combined treatment group +7% of maximal stimulator output (P < .01). Change could be detected in the larger 4 mg group (P = .02), but not in the smaller 8 mg dose group (P = .1). No side effects were reported after single dose exposure. DISCUSSION: This study shows that perampanel effects the physiology of upper motor neurons. Studies aiming at gauging the effect of perampanel on ALS disease progression are already ongoing. Motor threshold may serve as a marker of biological target engagement.","Oskarsson, Björn; Mauricio, Elizabeth A; Shah, Jaimin S; Li, Zhuo; Rogawski, Michael A",Muscle Nerve,,276

416786,Women report that nature tourism provides recovery from psychological trauma,2021,"Background: In Uganda, 12% of previously treated TB cases and 1.6% of new cases have MDR-TB and require specialized treatment and care. Adherence is crucial for improving MDR-TB treatment outcomes. There is paucity of information on the extent to which these patients adhere to treatment and what the drivers of non-adherence are. Methods: We conducted a cohort study using retrospectively collected routine program data for patients treated for MDR-TB between January 2012 - May 2016 at Mulago Hospital. We extracted anonymized data on non-adherence (missing 10% or more of DOT), socio-economic, demographic, and treatment characteristics of the patients. All participants were sensitive to MDR-TB drugs after second line Drug Susceptible Testing (DST) at entry into the study. Factors associated with non-adherence to MDR-TB treatment were determined using generalized linear models for the binomial family with log link and robust standard errors. We considered a p- value less than 0.05 as statistically significant. Results: The records of 227 MDR- TB patients met the inclusion criteria, 39.4% of whom were female, 32.6% aged between 25 - 34 years, and 54.6% living with HIV/AIDS. About 11.9% of the patients were non-adherent. The main driver for non-adherence was history of previous DR-TB treatment; previously treated DR-TB patients were 3.46 (Adjusted prevalence ratio: 3.46, 95 % CI: 1.68 - 7.14) times more likely to be non-adherent. Conclusion: One in 10 MDR-TB patients treated at Mulago hospital is non-adherent to treatment. History of previous DRTB treatment was significantly associated with non-adherence in this study. MDR-TB program should strengthen adherence counselling, strengthen DST surveillance, and close monitoring for previously treated DR-TB patients.","Batte, Charles; Namusobya, Martha S; Kirabo, Racheal; Mukisa, John; Adakun, Susan; Katamba, Achilles",Afr Health Sci,,276

418444,The Views of Social Studies Teachers on Distance Education,2021,"In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic brought dramatic changes in the delivery of primary health care across the world, presumably changing the number of consultations for infectious diseases and antibiotic use. We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on infections and antibiotic prescribing in Dutch primary care. All patients included in the routine health care database of the Julius General Practitioners' Network were followed from March through May 2019 (n = 389,708) and March through May 2020 (n = 405,688). We extracted data on consultations for respiratory/ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal and skin infections using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) codes. These consultations were combined in disease episodes and linked to antibiotic prescriptions. The numbers of infectious disease episodes (total and those treated with antibiotics), complications, and antibiotic prescription rates (i.e., proportion of episodes treated with antibiotics) were calculated and compared between the study periods in 2019 and 2020. Fewer episodes were observed during the pandemic months than in the same months in 2019 for both the four infectious disease entities and complications such as pneumonia, mastoiditis and pyelonephritis. The largest decline was seen for gastrointestinal infections (relative risk (RR), 0.54; confidence interval (CI), 0.51 to 0.58) and skin infections (RR, 0.71; CI, 0.67 to 0.75). The number of episodes treated with antibiotics declined as well, with the largest decrease seen for respiratory/ear infections (RR, 0.54; CI, 0.52 to 0.58). The antibiotic prescription rate for respiratory/ear infections declined from 21% to 13% (difference -8.0% (CI, -8.8 to -7.2)), yet the prescription rates for other infectious disease entities remained similar or increased slightly. The decreases in primary care infectious disease episodes and antibiotic use were most pronounced in weeks 15-19, mid-COVID-19 wave, after an initial peak in respiratory/ear infection presentation in week 11, the first week of lock-down. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on the presentation of infectious disease episodes and antibiotic use in primary care in the Netherlands. Consequently, the number of infectious disease episodes treated with antibiotics decreased. We found no evidence of an increase in complications.","van de Pol, Alma C; Boeijen, Josi A; Venekamp, Roderick P; Platteel, Tamara; Damoiseaux, Roger A M J; Kortekaas, Marlous F; van der Velden, Alike W",,,276

420793,The Coronavirus Recession and Its Implications,2020,"Global Health sometimes faces pandemics as are currently facing COVID-19 disease. The spreading and infection factors of this disease are very high. A huge number of people from most of the countries are infected within six months from its first report of appearance and it keeps spreading. The required systems are not ready up to some stages for any pandemic; therefore, mitigation with existing capacity becomes necessary. On the other hand, modern-era largely depends on Artificial Intelligence(AI) including Data Science; and Deep Learning(DL) is one of the current flag-bearer of these techniques. It could use to mitigate COVID-19 like pandemics in terms of stop spread, diagnosis of the disease, drug & vaccine discovery, treatment, patient care, and many more. But this DL requires large datasets as well as powerful computing resources. A shortage of reliable datasets of a running pandemic is a common phenomenon. So, Deep Transfer Learning(DTL) would be effective as it learns from one task and could work on another task. In addition, Edge Devices(ED) such as IoT, Webcam, Drone, Intelligent Medical Equipment, Robot, etc. are very useful in a pandemic situation. These types of equipment make the infrastructures sophisticated and automated which helps to cope with an outbreak. But these are equipped with low computing resources, so, applying DL is also a bit challenging; therefore, DTL also would be effective there. This article scholarly studies the potentiality and challenges of these issues. It has described relevant technical backgrounds and reviews of the related recent state-of-the-art. This article also draws a pipeline of DTL over Edge Computing as a future scope to assist the mitigation of any pandemic.","Sufian, Abu; Ghosh, Anirudha; Sadiq, Ali Safaa; Smarandache, Florentin",J Syst Archit,,276

426339,Forced Out-Migration from Hill Regions and Return Migration During the Pandemic: Evidence from Uttarakhand,2020,"BACKGROUND When treating patients with comorbidities who are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome as a result of SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to offer multidisciplinary treatment that takes into consideration all of the health conditions with which they have been diagnosed. In particular, clinicians should not lose sight of the patient experience, which we can be assessed with the help of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). CASE REPORT An 84-year-old man infected with SARS-CoV-2 was already suffering from multiple health conditions, including Type 2 diabetes mellitus. He most likely was receiving cortisone therapy and had chronic pain with spondylosis with radiculopathy, bilateral gonarthrosis following total knee replacement, malaise, and fatigue. The patient received acute inpatient care in a hospital that provides complementary medical therapies. We collected clinical and patient-reported data on quality of life, physical functions, the sensation of pain, psychological well-being, and symptoms while taking into account the degree of chronicity of the conditions, the level of the patient's pain, and his hospitalization in an isolation ward. We stabilized clinical parameters related to the patient's main underlying health conditions (blood glucose and pain levels and oxygen saturation). The PROs we collected demonstrated a significant improvement on discharge. CONCLUSIONS Applying PROs can be helpful in obtaining a more comprehensive picture of a patient with COVID-19, in which ""the patient is given a voice,"" in addition to being assessed by others. The knowledge gained can then be made available to the interdisciplinary treatment team to be incorporated into the treatment plan.","Romeyke, Toabis; Noehammer, Elisabeth; Stummer, Harald",Am J Case Rep,,276
426379,Change in gap perception within current practices in assessing students learning mathematics,2021,"Objective: Recently, the influence of antihypertensive treatment on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) gained increasing attention, especially since concerns were raised regarding a potential influence of RAAS inhibitors on Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our objective was to study the effect of recently initiated antihypertensive drugs on Angiotensin (Ang) II (1-8) and Ang (1-7) as markers of the pro-inflammatory ACE/Ang II/Ang Type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis and the counteractive ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas R axis in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension. Design and method: Randomized, open-label trial investigating RAAS peptide profiles after initiation of antihypertensive treatment with either perindopril, olmesartan, amlodipine, or hydrochlorothiazide. Ang II and Ang (1-7) concentrations were measured at 8am and 12am at day of treatment initiation and after four weeks of treatment. Results: 80 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 fashion. Between the four substances, we found significant differences for the concentrations of Ang II (p&lt;0.0005 for 8 and 12am) and Ang (1-7) (p=0.019 for 8am and &lt;0.0005 for 12am) four weeks after treatment start. Ang II was decreased by perindopril (p=0.002), and increased by olmesartan (p&lt;0.0005) and amlodipine (p=0.012), and hydrochlorothiazide (p=0.001) (Figure panel A). Ang (1-7) was increased by perindopril and olmesartan (p=0.008 and 0.002), but not measurably altered by amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide (p=0.317 and 0.109) (Figure panel B). Conclusions: Initiation of antihypertensive therapy causes early and distinct alterations of equilibrium angiotensin levels. Given the additional AT1R blocking action of olmesartan, RAAS peptide shifts upon initiation of perindopril and olmesartan appear to work in favor of the anti-inflammatory axis compared to amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide.","Vischer, A.; Kuster, G.; Twerenbold, R.; Pfister, O.; Zhou, Q.; Villiger, A.; Poglitsch, M.; Krähenbühl, S.; Mayr, M.; Osswald, S.; Haschke, M.; Burkard, T.",Journal of Hypertension,,276

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused psychological distress, both in infected and uninfected individuals. The present study evaluated the validity and factor structure of the COVID-19-Related Psychological Distress Scale (CORPDS) among the general public of the Persian-speaking population. The original version of the CORPDS was translated and back-translated into Persian, followed by a pilot study. A total sample (n = 623) completed an online survey including the CORPDS, Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). The Persian CORPDS had very good internal consistency and moderate test-retest reliability after 4 weeks. Maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test construct validity (&#967;2/df = 2.39, CFI = 0.95, SRMR = 0.046, PCLOSE = 0.67 > 0.05, RMSEA = 0.047, 90% CI [0.038, 0.056]). Measurement invariance was performed across gender, including configural invariance, metric invariance, scalar invariance, and error variance invariance, and yielded further support for the two-factor structure of the CORPDS. The CORPDS correlated with the score on the K10 (r = 0.46, p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.43, 0.48]), CAS (r = 0.43, p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.37, 0.45]), FCV-19S (r = 0.29, p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.27, 0.32]), LOT-R (r = - 0.19, p < 0.01, 95% CI [- 0.15, - 0.24]) and BRS (r = - 0.56, p < 0.01, 95% CI [- 0.50, - 0.61]). Resilience was associated with lower psychological distress (ß = - 0.54, SE = 0.05, p < 0.001). The findings provide evidence that CORPDS is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing psychological distress generated by COVID-19 among a healthy Persian-speaking population.","Nazari, Nabi; Zekiy, Angelina Olegovna; Feng, Lin-Sen; Griffiths, Mark D",Int J Ment Health Addict,,276

430104,"When the Parent Becomes the Teacher -- Attitudes on Distance Learning in the Time of ""Corona-Teaching"" from Parents' Perspective",2021,"PURPOSE: Identifying buccal and oral bone as an important supporting periodontal structure for teeth provides important information for treatment planning in periodontics and orthodontics. This study aims to add evidence to the knowledge of preciseness of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) measurements of the vertical dimension of buccal and oral bone. The hypothesis is that CBCT is an accurate and reliable method to measure vertical vestibular and oral bone loss. METHODS: The amount of vertical buccal and oral bone loss (bl) of 260 sites of 10 human cadavers was investigated clinically and radiographically by CBCT. Radiographic measurements were rated by two blinded raters. Measurements and the corresponding differences between clinical and radiological findings are described by medians and quartiles (Q1-Q3). For statistical analysis, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and Bland-Altman plots were calculated. RESULTS: The CCC between the raters was 0.994 (95% confidence interval 0.992-0.995). The median bone loss (bl) distance from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the bony defect (BD) was 3.5â¯mm (range 3-5â¯mm). The median bl measured in the CBCT was 3.8â¯mm (range 3.1-4.8â¯mm). The median difference of the 2 measurements for all sites included in the study (Nâ¯= 260) was -0.2â¯mm (-0.7 to 0.3â¯mm). CONCLUSIONS: CBCT seems to be an accurate and highly reliable method to detect and describe vertical buccal and oral bone loss. It could improve planning and prediction for successful combined periodontal and orthodontic therapies.","Ruetters, M; Kim, T-S; Hagenfeld, D; Kronsteiner, D; Gehrig, H; Lux, C-J; Sen, S",J. orofac. orthop,,276
430105,When the Parent Becomes the Teacher - Attitudes on Distance Learning in the Time of Corona-Teaching from Parents’ Perspective,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric healthcare utilisation and severe disease at a national level following lockdown on 23 March 2020. DESIGN: National retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Emergency childhood primary and secondary care providers across Scotland; two national paediatric intensive care units (PICUs); statutory death records. PARTICIPANTS: 273 455 unscheduled primary care attendances; 462 437 emergency department attendances; 54 076 emergency hospital admissions; 413 PICU unplanned emergency admissions requiring invasive mechanical ventilation; and 415 deaths during the lockdown study period and equivalent dates in previous years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of emergency care consultations, attendances and admissions; clinical severity scores on presentation to PICU; rates and causes of childhood death. For all data sets, rates during the lockdown period were compared with mean or aggregated rates for the equivalent dates in 2016-2019. RESULTS: The rates of emergency presentations to primary and secondary care fell during lockdown in comparison to previous years. Emergency PICU admissions for children requiring invasive mechanical ventilation also fell as a proportion of cases for the entire population, with an OR of 0.52 for likelihood of admission during lockdown (95% CI 0.37 to 0.73), compared with the equivalent period in previous years. Clinical severity scores did not suggest children were presenting with more advanced disease. The greatest reduction in PICU admissions was for diseases of the respiratory system; those for injury, poisoning or other external causes were equivalent to previous years. Mortality during lockdown did not change significantly compared with 2016-2019. CONCLUSIONS: National lockdown led to a reduction in paediatric emergency care utilisation, without associated evidence of severe harm.","Williams, Thomas C; MacRae, Clare; Swann, Olivia V; Haseeb, Haris; Cunningham, Steve; Davies, Philip; Gibson, Neil; Lamb, Christopher; Levin, Richard; McDougall, Catherine M; McFadzean, Jillian; Piper, Ian; Turner, Alastair; Turner, Stephen W; Van Dijke, Margrethe; Urquhart, Donald S; Guthrie, Bruce; Langley, Ross J",Arch. dis. child,,276

Microbiology can be considered a language of nature. We have argued that the relevance of microbes for everyday personal decisions and collective policies requires that society attains microbiology literacy, through the introduction of child-relevant microbiology topics into school curricula. That is: children should learn the microbiology language of nature. Children can be effective transmitters of new and/or rapidly evolving knowledge within families and beyond, where there is a substantive information asymmetry (witness digital technology, social media, and new languages in foreign countries). They can thus be key disseminators of microbiology knowledge, where there will be information asymmetry for the foreseeable future, and thereby contribute to the attainment of microbiology literacy in society. The education of family and friends can be encouraged/stimulated by home assignments, family leisure projects, and school-organised microbiology-centric social-education events. Children are key stakeholders in family decisions. Their microbiology knowledge, and their dissemination of it, can help inform and increase the objectivity of such decisions.","Timmis, Kenneth; Timmis, James; Jebok, Franziska",,,276

Here, we apply a drug repurposing strategy to identify potential drug candidates that are able to block the entrance of the virus into human cells. By combining virtual screening with in vitro pseudovirus assays and antiviral assays in Human Lung Tissue (HLT) cells, we identify entrectinib as a promising antiviral drug. We found that part of the antiviral action of entrectinib is mediated by a non-specific mechanism, likely occurring at the viral membrane level. Such a profile could provide entrectinib with protection against the development of drug resistance by emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Peralta-Garcia, Alejandro; Torrens-Fontanals, Mariona; Stepniewski, Tomasz Maciej; Ayinampudi, Vikram; Waldhoer, Maria; Zimmermann, Mirjam; Selent, Jana",,,276

However the magnitude of such an effect and whether this contributes substantially to the radiative forcing due to the aviation sector remain uncertain. The very substantial, near-global reduction in air traffic in response to the COVID-19 outbreak offers an unprecedented opportunity to identify the anthropogenic contribution to the observed cirrus coverage and thickness. Here we show, using an analysis of satellite observations for the period March-May 2020, that in the 20% of the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes with the largest air traffic reduction, cirrus fraction was reduced by similar to 9 +/- 1.5% on average, and cirrus emissivity was reduced by similar to 2 +/- 5% relative to what they should have been with normal air traffic. The changes are corroborated by a consistent estimate based on linear trends over the period 2011-2019. The change in cirrus translates to a global radiative forcing of 61 +/- 39 mW m(-2). This estimate is somewhat smaller than previous assessments.","Quaas, J.; Gryspeerdt, E.; Vautard, R.; Boucher, O.",Environmental Research Letters,,276

433037,A Stochastic Frontier Approach to Assessing Total Factor Productivity Change in China’s Star-Rated Hotel Industry,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a new, rapidly emerging zoonotic infectious disease, that was reported to the World Health Organization for the first time on 31 December 2019. Currently, no effective pharmacological interventions or vaccines are available to treat or prevent COVID-19, therefore nonpharmacological public health measures are more in focus. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to assess the effects of quarantine - alone or in combination with other measures - during coronavirus outbreaks. METHODS: Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic, WHO commissioned a rapid review. To save time, the method of systematic reviews was slightly and with caution modified. This publication is a summary of the most important aspects of the rapid review, translated into German by members of the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Danube University Krems (Austria). RESULTS: Overall, 29 studies were included. Ten modeling studies focused on COVID-19, 4 observational studies and 15 modeling studies focused on SARS and MERS. The modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures. For example, the models estimated that quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 prevented between 44 and 81% of the cases that would otherwise have happened and 31 to 63% of the deaths, when compared to no such measures. In regard to costs, the earlier the quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings will be. CONCLUSION: Our confidence in the evidence is very limited. This is mainly because the COVID-19 studies based their models on the limited data that have been available in the early weeks of the pandemic and made different assumptions about the virus. The studies of SARS and MERS are not completely generalizable to COVID-19. Despite only having limited evidence, all the studies found quarantine to be important for controlling the spread of severe coronavirus diseases. Looking to the coming months, in order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must continue to constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures they implement.","Mayr, Verena; Nußbaumer-Streit, Barbara; Gartlehner, Gerald",Gesundheitswesen,,276

METHODS: This nationwide retrospective cohort study included hospital data on all people hospitalized in France for diabetes in weeks 2-43 in 2020, including the COVID-19 lockdown period, compared to same period in 2019. RESULTS: The number of hospitalizations for DFU decreased significantly in weeks 12-19 (during the lockdown) (p < 10-4 ). Hospitalization for foot osteomyelitis also decreased significantly in weeks 12-19 (p < 10-4 ). The trend was the same for lower limb amputations and revascularizations associated with DFU or amputation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The marked drop in hospitalization rates for DFU, osteomyelitis and lower limb revascularization procedures in people with DFU observed in France during the lockdown period suggests that COVID-19 was a barrier to DFU care, and may illustrate the combined deleterious effects of hospital overload and changes in health-related behaviour.","Mariet, Anne-Sophie; Benzenine, Eric; Bouillet, Benjamin; Vergès, Bruno; Quantin, Catherine; Petit, Jean-Michel",Diabet Med,,276

The insufficient available evidence has resulted in differing recommendations by health professional associations and national health authorities. We present an approach for deciding public health policy on infant feeding and mother-infant contact in the context of COVID-19, or for future emerging viruses, that balances the risks that are associated with viral infection against child survival, lifelong health, and development, and also maternal health. Using the Lives Saved Tool, we used available data to show how different public health approaches might affect infant mortality. Based on existing evidence, including population and survival estimates, the number of infant deaths in low-income and middle-income countries due to COVID-19 (2020-21) might range between 1800 and 2800. By contrast, if mothers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection are recommended to separate from their newborn babies and avoid or stop breastfeeding, additional deaths among infants would range between 188â000 and 273â000.","Rollins, Nigel; Minckas, Nicole; Jehan, Fyezah; Lodha, Rakesh; Raiten, Daniel; Thorne, Claire; Van de Perre, Philippe; Ververs, Mija; Walker, Neff; Bahl, Rajiv; Victora, Cesar G",Lancet Glob.

More important than the intensity of the disorder is its prevalence. When we compare our current knowledge of the impact of the pandemic on the development of mental disorders with the findings of research on acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) over the last 40 years, it may turn out that they are different from each other, the symptomatic spectrum of mental disorders varies and the possibilities of an effective treatment are very limited. We cannot rule out that a new diagnostic category for specific mental disorders resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may emerge in the near future. This paper presents the extent of the impact of the pandemic on the development of mental instability and current diagnostic possibilities.

Accessing food-security programs has been especially challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media can play an important role in reducing some communication barriers. We examined interest in receiving nutrition information via social media among adults participating in food-security programs in Washington, DC. METHODS: We developed and administered a 22-item survey to adults participating in food-security programs (N = 375). Participants were recruited at Martha's Table, in Washington, DC, from January through March 2020. We performed bivariate analyses and multinomial logistic regressions to examine predictors of interest in receiving nutrition information via social media. RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of participants reported using social media, and 49% expressed interest in receiving nutrition information via social media. Higher levels of self-efficacy and belief in the value of digital technology were associated with greater likelihood of interest in receiving nutrition information via social media (&#967;2 6 = 139.0; Nagelkerke R2 = 0.35; P < .001). We found no differences by sex or digital technology access in interest in receiving nutrition information via social media. CONCLUSION: Social media is a widely used and a feasible method to reach food-security program participants. Understanding program participants' interest in receiving health information via social media may help food-security programs plan effective communication strategies to improve food security, especially when in-person participation is limited, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bertrand, Adrian; Hawkins, Melissa; Cotter, Elizabeth W; Banzon, Donna; Snelling, Anastasia",Prev Chronic Dis,,276

This study aimed to understand HIV testing behaviours among men who have sex with men (MSM) and specifically how HIVST was used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) measures in China when access to facility-based testing was limited. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was conducted to recruit men who have sex with men (MSM) in China from May to June of 2020, a period when COVID-19 measures were easing. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviours and HIV testing in the three months before and during COVID-19 measures (23 January 2020) were collected. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used for analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 685 MSM were recruited from 135 cities in 30 provinces of China, whose mean age was 28.8 (SD: 6.9) years old. The majority of participants self-identified as gay (81.9%) and had disclosed their sexual orientation (66.7%). In the last three months, 69.6% ever had sex with men, nearly half of whom had multiple sexual partners (47.2%). Although the overall HIV testing rates before and during COVID-19 measures were comparable, more MSM self-tested for HIV during COVID-19 measures (52.1%) compared to before COVID-19 measures (41.6%, p = 0.038). Fewer MSM used facility-based HIV testing during COVID-19 measures (42.9%) compared to before COVID-19 measures (54.1%, p = 0.038). Among 138 facility-based testers before COVID-19 measures, 59.4% stopped facility-based testing during COVID-19 measures. Among 136 self-testers during COVID-19 measures, 58.1% had no HIV self-testing before COVID-19 measures. Multivariable logistic regression showed that having sex with other men in the last three months (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.38 to 3.03), self-identifying as gay (aOR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.31 to 3.13), ever disclosing their sexual orientation (aOR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.19 to 2.50) and tested for HIV in three months before COVID-19 measures (aOR = 4.74, 95% CI: 3.35 to 6.70) were associated with HIV testing during COVID-19 measures. CONCLUSIONS: Facility-based HIV testing decreased and HIVST increased among MSM during COVID-19 measures in China. MSM successfully accessed HIVST as substitute for facility-based testing, with no overall decrease in HIV testing rates.","Jiang, Hongbo; Xie, Yewei; Xiong, Yuan; Zhou, Yi; Lin, Kaihao; Yan, Yao; Tucker, Joseph; Ong, Jason J; Wu, Dan; Yang, Fan; Tang, Weiming",J Int AIDS Soc,,276

METHODS: This retrospective analysis was conducted based on the data of 119 cases from the Department of Fever and the Department of Infection undergoing chest high-resolution CT examinations in Sanshui District People's Hospital between January, 24 and February 10, 2020. The cases with no abnormality on chest CT were excluded. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed to have pneumonia, including 9 with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia and 14 with other types of pneumonia. We comparatively analyzed the CT signs, location of the lesions and the dandelion clock-like sign among different types of pneumonia. RESULTS: Among the 23 patients with pneumonia, 9 (39.1%) had common or severe SARS-CoV-2- associated pneumonia with a positive epidemiological history and corresponding respiratory symptoms. Seven of the SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia patients had multiple lesions in bilateral lungs, compromising mainly the lung field and the subpleural area and showing patchy, lumpy, and umbrella-shaped ground glass opacity, often accompanied by pulmonary vascular thickening and increased microvessels, interlobular septal thickening and fibrosis and lined with grid-like and small-bubble-like ""crazy-paving"" patterns. The dandelion clock-like sign was found in all the 9 patients with SARSCoV-2-associated pneumonia, with a total of 46 lesions (60.5%, 76 total lesions); 9 of the lesions presented with a ""dandelion clek-like"" sign and 37 with a ""dandelion seed sign"". These signs were not found in the 14 patients with other types of pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The dandelion clock-like sign is a common and characteristic chest CT finding in patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia, and can help to distinguish SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia from other types of pneumonia.","Fu, Xiaobin; Li, Jiesheng; Huang, Zhou; Xu, Zhiming; Yao, Weiping; Cui, Yunneng; Ouyang, Kexun; Liu, Huaizhong",Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,,276

454484,Impact of the covid-19 event on trip intensity and air quality in southern china,2020,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in renin-angiotensin system regulation and amino acid homeostasis. Human ACE2 acts as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is also widely expressed in epithelial cells of the lungs, heart, kidney, and pancreas. It is considered an important drug target for treating SARS-CoV-2 as well as pulmonary diseases, heart failure, hypertension, renal diseases, and diabetes. Despite the critical importance, the mechanism of ligand binding to the human ACE2 receptor remains unknown. Here, we have addressed this challenge through all-atom simulations using a novel ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD) method. Microsecond time scale LiGaMD simulations have unprecedentedly captured multiple times of spontaneous binding and unbinding of a potent inhibitor MLN-4760 in the ACE2 receptor. With ligand far away in the unbound state, the ACE2 receptor samples distinct Open, Partially Open, Closed, and Fully Closed conformations. Upon ligand binding to the active site, conformational ensemble of the ACE2 receptor is biased toward the Closed state as observed in the X-ray experimental structure. The LiGaMD simulations thus suggest a conformational selection mechanism for ligand recognition by the highly flexible ACE2 receptor, which is expected to facilitate rational drug design targeting human ACE2 against coronaviruses and other related human diseases.","Bhattarai, Apurba; Pawnikar, Shristi; Miao, Yinglong",J Phys Chem Lett,,276

The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has attracted the attention of numerous researchers on ACE2 receptors, where the causative viral particle, SARS-CoV-2, is established to exploit these receptors for permitting their entry into the human cells. Therefore, studies on the molecular origin and pathophysiology of the cell response in correlation to the role of ACE2 receptors to these viruses are bringing novel theories. The varying level of manifestation and importance of ACE proteins, underlying irregularities and disorders, intake of specific medications, and persistence of assured genomic variants at the ACE genes are potential questions raising nowadays while observing the marked alteration in response to the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Therefore, the present review has focused on several raised opinions associated with the role of the ACE2 receptor and its impact on COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Shirbhate, Ekta; Pandey, Jaiprakash; Patel, Vijay K; Kamal, Mehnaz; Jawaid, Talha; Gorain, Bapi; Kesharwani, Prashant; Rajak, Harish",Pharmacol. rep,,276

458036,Chatbot Implementation to Collect Data on Possible COVID-19 Cases and Release the Pressure on the Primary Health Care System,2020,"The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While this respiratory virus only causes mild symptoms in younger healthy individuals, elderly people and those with cardiovascular diseases such as systemic hypertension are susceptible to developing severe conditions that can be fatal. SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, and thromboembolism. Understanding the mechanisms of the effects of this virus on the cardiovascular system should thus help develop therapeutic strategies to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since this virus causes severe and fatal conditions in older individuals with cardiovascular comorbidities, effective therapies targeting specific populations will likely contribute to ending this pandemic. In this review article, the effects of various viruses-including other coronaviruses, influenza, dengue, and human immunodeficiency virus-on the cardiovascular system are described to help provide molecular mechanisms of pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. The goal is to provide mechanistic information from the biology of other viral infections in relation to cardiovascular pathologies for the purpose of developing improved vaccines and therapeutic agents effective in preventing and/or treating the acute and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.","Seeherman, Sarah; Suzuki, Yuichiro J",Int. j. mol. sci.

We explored subjective cognitive functioning and mental health changes and their possible interplay related to COVID-19-lockdown. We also investigated potential risk factors to identify more vulnerable groups. Across Italy, 1215 respondents completed our Qualtrics-based online-survey during the end of a seven to 10-week imposed lockdown and home confinement (from April 29 to May 17, 2020). We found subjective cognitive functioning and mental health severely changed in association with the lockdown. Under government regulations, cognitive complaints were mostly perceived in routine tasks involving attention, temporal orientation and executive functions-with no changes in language abilities. A paradoxical effect was observed for memory, with reduced forgetfulness compared to pre-lockdown. We found higher severity and prevalence of depression, anxiety disorders, abnormal sleep, appetite changes, reduced libido and health anxiety: with mild-to-severe depression and anxiety prevalence climbing to 32 and 36 percent, respectively, under restrictions. Being female, under 45 years, working from home or being underemployed were all identified as relevant risk factors for worsening cognition and mental health. Frequent consumers of COVID-19 mass media information or residents in highly infected communities reported higher depression and anxiety symptoms, particularly hypochondria in the latter. If similar restrictions are reimposed, governments must carefully consider these more vulnerable groups in their decisions, whilst developing effective global and long-term responses to the cognitive and mental health challenges of this type of pandemic; as well as implementing appropriate psychological interventions with specific guidelines: particularly regarding exposure to COVID-19 mass-media reports.","Fiorenzato, Eleonora; Zabberoni, Silvia; Costa, Alberto; Cona, Giorgia",PLoS One,,276

Several new serological methods to examine these parameters were developed, validated and applied in three patients of a family which underwent an ambulatory course of COVID-19 for six months. The virus load had almost completely disappeared after about four weeks. Serum IgA levels to the S1-RBD-protein and, to a lesser extent, to the N-protein, peaked about three weeks after clinical disease onset but declined soon thereafter. IgG levels rose continuously, reaching a plateau at approximately six weeks, and stayed elevated over the observation period. Virus-neutralizing activity reached a peak about 4 weeks after disease onset but dropped slowly. The longitudinal associations of virus neutralization and the serological immune response suggest immunity in patients even after a mild clinical course of COVID-19.","Flehmig, Bertram; Schindler, Michael; Ruetalo, Natalia; Businger, Ramona; Bayer, Manfred; Haage, Angelika; Kirchner, Thomas; Klingel, Karin; Normann, Andrea; Pridzun, Lutz; Tougianidou, Despina; Ranke, Michael B",Viruses,,276
461684,Bréve: Chloroquine OTC: danger !,2020,"BACKGROUND: At present, the severity of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a focal point. METHODS: To assess the factors associated with severity and prognosis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, we retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging and laboratory characteristics of confirmed 280 cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from 20 January to 20 February 2020. RESULTS: The median age of patients in the mild group was 37.55 years, whilst that in the severe group was 63.04 years. The proportion of patients aged over 65 years in the severe group was significantly higher than that of the mild group (59.04% vs. 10.15%, P < 0.05). 85.54% of severe patients had diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, which was significantly higher than that of the mild group (51.81% vs. 7.11%, P = 0.025; 33.73% vs. 3.05%, P = 0.042). Patients in the mild group experienced earlier initiation of antiviral treatment (1.19 ± 0.45 vs. 2.65 ± 1.06 days in the severe group, P < 0.001). Our study showed that comorbidity, time from illness onset to antiviral treatment and age >=65 were three major risk factors for COVID-19 progression, whilst comorbidity and time from illness onset to antiviral treatment were two major risk factors for COVID-19 recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The elderly and patients with underlying diseases are more likely to experience a severe progression of COVID-19. It is recommended that timely antiviral treatment should be initiated to slow the disease progression and improve the prognosis.","Wu, J; Li, W; Shi, X; Chen, Z; Jiang, B; Liu, J; Wang, D; Liu, C; Meng, Y; Cui, L; Yu, J; Cao, H; Li, L",J Intern Med,,276

METHODS: The studies were selected through combinations based on the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The MEDLINE (PubMed), LILACS, SciELO, and BIREME databases were used. The search encompassed articles published from January 2010 to May 2020, with no restriction of language or localization. RESULTS: A total of 665 retrieved articles had the potential for inclusion. Of these, two answered the research question, which was to verify the smell and taste alterations in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results found in this review demonstrated that there likely is an association between self-reported smell and taste dysfunctions and COVID-19 infection in such patients.","Gonçalves, Laura Faustino; Gonzáles, Ana Inês; Paiva, Karina Mary; Patatt, Fernanda Soares Aurélio; Stolz, Janaina Viana; Haas, Patrícia",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),,276
463623,Get flipped: Using learning technologies to engage student learning,2020,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of ancient and common viruses, posing a severe threat to the health of humans and other animals. Currently, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified. They are all animal-derived zoonotic pathogens that jump the species barrier from their natural host animals to humans in a direct or indirect manner and lead to interpersonal transmission. The receptor binding domain (RBD) on the S1 subunit of CoV spike (S) protein is one of the key factors determining the cross-species transmission and the invasion potential. This review summarized and analyzed the transmission modes of seven HCoVs and the available structures of HCoV-RBD that mediated the cross-species transmission in order to better understanding the mechanism of CoV cross-species transmission and providing valuable knowledge in response to the potential cross-species transmission of novel CoVs in the future.","Cheng, Yanwei; Cao, Xue; Qin, Lijie",Chin.

467636,Distance Learning During the Corona-Lockdown: Some Psychological and Pedagogical Aspects,2021,"The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical in controlling disease, but there is concern that waning immunity may predispose to reinfection. We analyzed the magnitude and phenotype of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response in 100 donors at 6 months following infection. T cell responses were present by ELISPOT and/or intracellular cytokine staining analysis in all donors and characterized by predominant CD4+ T cell responses with strong interleukin (IL)-2 cytokine expression. Median T cell responses were 50% higher in donors who had experienced a symptomatic infection, indicating that the severity of primary infection establishes a 'set point' for cellular immunity. T cell responses to spike and nucleoprotein/membrane proteins were correlated with peak antibody levels. Furthermore, higher levels of nucleoprotein-specific T cells were associated with preservation of nucleoprotein-specific antibody level although no such correlation was observed in relation to spike-specific responses. In conclusion, our data are reassuring that functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses are retained at 6 months following infection.","Zuo, Jianmin; Dowell, Alexander C; Pearce, Hayden; Verma, Kriti; Long, Heather M; Begum, Jusnara; Aiano, Felicity; Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin; Hoschler, Katja; Brooks, Tim; Taylor, Stephen; Hewson, Jacqueline; Hallis, Bassam; Stapley, Lorrain; Borrow, Ray; Linley, Ezra; Ahmad, Shazaad; Parker, Ben; Horsley, Alex; Amirthalingam, Gayatri; Brown, Kevin; Ramsay, Mary E; Ladhani, Shamez; Moss, Paul",Nat Immunol,,276

If this has led to changes in public attitudes towards screening and reduced intention to participate, there is a risk of long-term adverse impact on cancer outcomes. In this study, we examined previous participation and future intentions to take part in cervical and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening following the first national lockdown in the UK. Overall, 7543 adults were recruited to a cross-sectional online survey in August-September 2020. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify correlates of strong screening intentions among 2,319 participants eligible for cervical screening and 2,502 eligible for home-based CRC screening. Qualitative interviews were conducted with a sub-sample of 30 participants. Verbatim transcripts were analysed thematically. Of those eligible, 74% of survey participants intended to attend cervical screening and 84% intended to complete home-based CRC screening when next invited. Thirty percent and 19% of the cervical and CRC samples respectively said they were less likely to attend a cancer screening appointment now than before the pandemic. Previous non-participation was the strongest predictor of low intentions for cervical (aOR 26.31, 95% CI: 17.61-39.30) and CRC (aOR 67.68, 95% CI: 33.91-135.06) screening. Interview participants expressed concerns about visiting healthcare settings but were keen to participate when screening programmes resumed. Intentions to participate in future screening were high and strongly associated with previous engagement in both programmes. As screening services recover, it will be important to monitor participation and to ensure people feel safe to attend.","Wilson, Rebecca; Quinn-Scoggins, Harriet; Moriarty, Yvonne; Hughes, Jacqueline; Goddard, Mark; Cannings-John, Rebecca; Whitelock, Victoria; Whitaker, Katriina L; Grozeva, Detelina; Townson, Julia; Osborne, Kirstie; Smits, Stephanie; Robling, Michael; Hepburn, Julie; Moore, Graham; Gjini, Ardiana; Brain, Kate; Waller, Jo",,,276

SETTING: A large regional database of 28 EDs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan, with an index case of 11 March 2020 and peak in the first week of April. PARTICIPANTS: ED visits during the first 5 months of the calendar year were included and compared with the previous year. Facilities where these participants were seen were classified as urban or non-urban, with comparisons of total visits, COVID-like cases, paediatric and trauma. OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily visits to EDs of patients presenting with COVID-like symptoms, trauma, age patterns and total cases, and stratified between urban and non-urban settings. RESULTS: There were 1 732 852 visits across the 2 years, 953 407 between study and comparison periods, and 457 130 visits defined as COVID-like (median age 44 years). Total ED visits decreased to 48% of the previous year, showing a delayed-inverse relationship with COVID-19. Trauma cases dropped but returned to the pre-COVID-19 rate by the end of May in Urban centres. Paediatric cases decreased to 20% of the previous year by the end of April. The oldest age groups showed the least change in ED visits in response to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This large US Midwestern state study describes a dramatic decrease in ED visits after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan, including stratification by varying ages and trauma, demonstrating the tangible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urban and non-urban EDs.","Keyes, Daniel; Hardin, Blake; Sweeney, Brian; Shedden, Kerby",BMJ Open,,276

Their genome contains a large replicase ORF which encodes nonstructural proteins (NSPs), structural, and accessory genes. NSP15 is a nidoviral RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) with C-terminal catalytic domain. The endoribonuclease activity of NSP15 interferes with the innate immune response of the host. Here, we screened Selleckchem Natural product database of the compounds against NSP15, and we found that thymopentin and oleuropein displayed highest binding energies. The binding of these molecules was further validated by molecular dynamic simulations that revealed them as very stable complexes. These drugs might serve as effective counter molecules in the reduction of virulence of this virus; may be more effective if treated in combination with replicase inhibitors. Future validation of both these inhibitors is worth the consideration for patients being treated for COVID-19.

Qualitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies was performed in a fully-automated Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on the Cobas® e601 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). RESULTS: In total, 3,156 individuals were interviewed. Seroprevalence of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 40.4% (95%CI 35.6-45.3). Population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions was higher at the beginning of the pandemic than in the last month. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were significantly lower among mask wearers and among those who maintained social and physical distancing in the last month compared to their counterparts. Among the infected, 26.0% were asymptomatic. The infection fatality rate (IFR) was 0.14%, higher for men and older adults. The IFR based on excess deaths was 0.28%. The ratio of estimated infections to reported cases was 22.2. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 estimated in this population-based survey is one of the highest reported.

MMP-1 is involved in inflammation and tissue remodelling. There have been studies focused on anti-inflammatory effect of maternal omega use on human milk while little is known about the effect of omega use on breastmilk proteases. Leptin is an important hormone that influences MMP levels in various tissues and exerts its metabolic effects. In our study we assessed the levels of MMP-1, TIMP-1, leptin, IL-6 and FA's including PUFA in breastmilk from women who used omega-3. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study was a cross-sectional study included 67(Group 1, n = 32, omega user; Group 2 n = 35, non-user)lactating women and their infan MMP-1, TIMP-1, leptin, IL-6 and FA's were evaluated in breastmilk of both groups. MMP-1, TIMP-1, IL-6 and leptin were measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) method. Breastmilk fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography flame ionisation detector (GC-FID). RESULTS: Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) levels in breastmilk were significantly lower in breastmilk from omega users (mean ± SD, 0.455 ± 0.1) than non-users (mean ± SD, 0.677 ± 0.289) (p=.0001). MMP-1 and omega 6:3 ratio were positively correlated (r: 0.301, p=.01). MMP levels were correlated with IL-6 (Pearson's r: 0.411, p<.001). MMP-1 and leptin levels were positively correlated (r: .388, p=.001). CONCLUSION: MMP-1 levels in breastmilk, may be modified by maternal omega use in pregnancy which may help to redirect extracellular matrix remodelling and metabolic programming in early infancy.","Sahin, Ozlem Naciye; Ozpinar, Aysel; Serdar, Muhittin",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,276
477618,"Engineering student experiences of a remotely accessed, online learning environment",2020,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 infection is an aggressive viral illness with high risk of transmission during otolaryngology examination and surgery. Cholesteatoma is known for its potential to cause complications and scheduling of surgery during the pandemic must be done carefully. The majority of otological surgeries may be classified as elective and postponed at this time (e.g., stapedotomy, tympanoplasty); whereas, others are emergencies (e.g., complicated acute otitis media, complicated cholesteatoma with cerebral or Bezold's abscess, meningitis, sinus thrombosis) and require immediate intervention. What is the ideal time for the surgical management of Cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: Senior otologic surgeons from six teaching hospitals from various countries affected by the COVID-19 from around the world met remotely to make recommendations on reorganizing schedules for the treatment of cholesteatoma which has a risk of severe morbidity and mortality. The recommendations are based on their experiences and on available literature. RESULTS: Due to the high risk of infecting the surgical staff it is prudent to stop all elective ear surgeries and plan cholesteatoma surgery after careful selection of patients, based on the extent of the disease and available resources. Specific precautions including use of appropriate personal protection equipment should be followed when operating on all patients during the pandemic. To facilitate the decision-making in the management of cholesteatoma, timing for surgery can be divided into two categories with 3 and 2 sub-groups based on disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on the timing of surgery of patients with cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking. This manuscript contains practical tips on how cholesteatoma surgery can be reorganized during this pandemic.","George, Mercy; Alexander, Arun; Mathew, John; Iyer, Arunachalam; Waterval, Jerome; Simon, Christian; Marchioni, Daniele; Maire, Raphael",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,,276

We describe the identification of the virus and the clinical course, diagnosis, and treatment of the infection including her rapid clinical deterioration from the mild initial symptoms, which progressed to multilobar pneumonia requiring admission to the intensive care unit. This case highlights the importance of establishing a diagnosis based on the clinical findings and the patient's history bearing in mind the possibility of gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to respiratory ones. Besides, the presence of risk factors should be investigated; in this case, we proposed obesity as a possible risk factor. Furthermore, limitations in diagnostic tests and the possibility of co-infection with other respiratory pathogens are highlighted. We describe the imaging, laboratory findings, and treatment taking into account the limited current evidence.","Orozco-Hernández, Juan Pablo; Montoya-Martínez, Juan José; Pacheco-Gallego, Manuel Conrado; Céspedes-Roncancio, Mauricio; Porras-Hurtado, Gloria Liliana",Biomedica,,276

METHODS: Information was gathered from daily reports provided by the Ministry of Health, Singapore Statues online and a Ministerial statement given at a Parliament sitting on 4 May 2020. RESULTS: A marked escalation in the daily number of new COVID-19 cases was seen in early April 2020. The majority of cases occurred among an estimated 295 000 low-skilled migrant workers living in foreign worker dormitories. As of 6 May 2020, there were 17 758 confirmed COVID-19 cases among dormitory workers (88% of 20 198 nationally confirmed cases). One dormitory housing approximately 13 000 workers had 19.4% of residents infected. The national response included mobilising several government agencies and public volunteers. There was extensive testing of workers in dormitories, segregation of healthy and infected workers, and daily observation for fever and symptoms. Twenty-four dormitories were declared as 'isolation areas', with residents quarantined for 14 days. New housing, for example, vacant public housing flats, military camps, exhibition centres, floating hotels have been provided that will allow for appropriate social distancing. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted migrant workers as a vulnerable occupational group. Ideally, matters related to inadequate housing of vulnerable migrant workers need to be addressed before a pandemic.","Koh, David",Occup Environ Med,,276

Non-medical workers such as environmental service workers (ESW) also experience changes in regulations at work. ESW in isolation ward are included in the high exposure risk category because of their high potential for close contact with COVID-19 patients. This study aims to analyze the ESW’s perception of working at the COVID-19 referral hospital in Klaten. Methods: This is a descriptive qualitative study with a phenomenological approach. Four respondents were obtained for interviews. Results: The results show that ESW’s understanding of COVID-19 hasn’t been maximized and evenly distributed, there are obstacles and changes of habits, in the work system and service standards that create inconvenience while working, psychological impacts;both negative and positive feelings appear while working during this pandemic. However, ESW still work professionally, have a good work commitment to reduce the risk of nosocomial infections including preventing the spread of the virus. Conclusion: ESW’s perceptions related to COVID-19 hasn’t been evenly distributed. Mandatory use of personal protective equipment in the pandemic era, causes discomfort and obstacles to work. This pandemic triggered the emergence of negative emotions that are dominant over positive emotions.

A critical reading of online teaching instruments during and after the pandemic,2021,"Non-invasive strategies for monitoring post-tuberculosis (TB) tracheobronchial stenosis (PTTS) are clinically important but currently lacking. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and procollagen type I N-propeptide (PINP) have been identified as markers of fibrosis. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of serum TGF-β1 and PINP in PTTS. Serum samples were collected from 119 patients with tracheobronchial TB after the condition was treated for at least 6 months (59 patients with airway stenosis and 60 patients with no stenosis). Serum TGF-β1 and PINP levels were measured using ELISA and compared between the groups. Relationships between serum TGF-β1 and PINP levels and clinical characteristics, interventional bronchoscopy and outcomes of airway stenosis were analysed. The correlation between TGF-β1 and PINP, and their diagnostic efficacy for airway stenosis were also analysed. The TGF-β1 and PINP levels in the airway stenosis group were higher than those in the non-stenosis group. Furthermore, airway stenosis with atelectasis or mucus plugging was associated with higher TGF-β1 levels, and airway stenosis with atelectasis, mucus plugging, right main bronchus stenosis or severe airway tracheal stenosis was associated with higher PINP levels. In addition, TGF-β1 and PINP levels increased after interventional bronchoscopy therapy and airway stenosis with recurrent stenosis was associated with higher baseline levels of both markers. Finally, TGF-β1 levels were positively correlated with PINP levels in patients with airway stenosis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of TGF-β1 and PINP for distinguishing airway stenosis from non-stenosis cases was 0.824 (95% CI: 0.748-0.900) and 0.863 (95% CI: 0.796-0.930), respectively. Therefore, TGF-β1 and PINP are potential biomarkers that may be useful for diagnosing and monitoring PTTS.","Wu, Yongchang Li Yishi Bai Yang Jiang Jinyue Wang Xiaohui Chen Yi Wang Xin Huang Guichuan Gan Yiling Li You",Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine,,276

In Switzerland, during the last weeks of December 2020, we established a nationwide screening protocol across multiple laboratories, focusing first on epidemiological and microbiological definitions. In January 2021, we validated and implemented an N501Y-specific PCR to rapidly screen for VoCs, which are then confirmed using amplicon sequencing or whole genome sequencing (WGS). A total of 13,387 VoCs have been identified since the detection of the first Swiss case in October 2020, with 4194 being B.1.1.7, 172 B.1.351, and 7 P.1. The remaining 9014 cases of VoCs have been described without further lineage specification. Overall, all diagnostic centers reported a rapid increase of the percentage of detected VOCs, with a range of 6 to 46% between 25 to 31 of January 2021 increasing towards 41 to 82% between 22 to 28 of February. A total of 739 N501Y positive genomes were analysed and show a broad range of introduction events to Switzerland.

We investigate whether these funds were distributed in a way that responded fairly to COVID-19-related medical and financial need. The U.S. health care system is bifurcated into the ""haves"" and ""have nots."" The health care safety net hospitals, which were already financially weak, cared for the bulk of COVID-19 cases. In contrast, the ""have"" hospitals suffered financially because their most profitable procedures are elective and were postponed during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: To obtain relief fund data for each hospital in the U.S., we start with data from HHS posted on the CDC website. We use RAND Hospital Data to analyze how fund distributions are associated with hospital characteristics. FINDINGS: Our analysis reveals that the ""have"" hospitals with the most days of cash on hand received more funding per bed than hospitals with fewer than 50 days of cash on hand (the ""have nots""). CONCLUSIONS: Despite extreme racial inequities, which COVID-19 exposed early on in the pandemic, the federal government rewards those hospitals that cater to the most privileged in the U.S., leaving hospitals that predominantly serve low-income people of color with less.","Grogan, Colleen M; Gusmano, Michael K; Lin, Yu-An",J. health polit. policy law,,276

The aim of this global survey was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on surgical training and to develop a framework for recovery. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted. This was designed by a steering committee of medical educationalists and validated by a group of trainees before dissemination. RESULTS: A total of 608 responses were obtained from 34 countries and 15 specialties. The results demonstrated major disruption in all aspects of training. The impact was greatest for conferences (525 of 608) and hands-on courses (517 of 608), but less for inpatient care-related training (268 of 608). European trainees were significantly more likely to experience direct training disruption than trainees in Asia (odds ratio 0.15) or Australia (OR 0.10) (&#967;2 = 87.162, P < 0.001). Alternative training resources (webinars, 359 of 608; educational videos, 234 of 608) have emerged, although trainees expressed some dissatisfaction with them. The collective responses generated a four-pillar framework for training recovery that involved: guidance from training stakeholders with the involvement of trainees; prioritization of training, especially the roles of senior surgeons/trainers; provision of access to alternative/new teaching methods; and measures to address trainee anxiety. CONCLUSION: Training has been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The coordinated response by Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network (The Network) undertaken with the support of NSW Ministry of Health, in partnership with Corrective Services NSW (CSNSW), Youth Justice and private jails has ensured that the NSW correctional system has remained otherwise COVID-free. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A research study of how a range of partners which support the operations of NSW Correctional System developed an effective approach for the prevention a COVID-19 epidemic amongst its inmates. FINDINGS: Establishment of effective partnerships, early coordination of representatives from all aspects of the NSW correctional system, limited access to the correctional environment, reduced prison population and strict isolation of all new receptions have all contributed to maintaining this COVID-free status despite other NSW settings with similar risk profiles, such as aged care facilities and cruise ship arrivals, experiencing serious outbreaks. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Although Australia/New Zealand context of suppressed community infection rates for COVID-19 (which are approaching elimination in some jurisdictions) is in contrast to the situation in other parts of the world, the principles described in this paper will be useful to most other correctional systems.

The rising number of cases have overburdened healthcare systems even in the most developed countries. To ease the burden on healthcare systems a quick and efficient testing technique is needed. Currently, the RT-PCR testing is done with time consuming and laborious an alternative is a detection from Chest X-Ray images. It has been discovered in published studies that Chest X-Rays of COVID-19 patients have specific malformations that can be used to identify a positive case. Inspired by the work done on 'COVID-Net' by Linda Wang, Zhong Qiu Lin and Alexander Wong, a Deep Learning approach to detect coronavirus from Chest X-Ray images is used in this study. To surpass previous results the EfficientNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is proposed. This model not only achieves +2% accuracy, but it also attains higher sensitivity and Positive Predictive Values. The study uses the open source COVIDx dataset. It has approximately 14, 000 X-Ray images. To the best of authors' knowledge, this dataset contains the largest number of COVID-19 positive cases. The study offers a Deep Learning approach contributing to create an efficient COVID-19 detector that can be used in the real world. © 2021 IEEE.","Chaudhary, Y.; Mehta, M.; Sharma, R.; Gupta, D.; Khanna, A.; Rodrigues, J.

492029,Bridging digital inequalities in rural schools in Germany: A geographical lottery?,2021,"The role of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in dental tissue regeneration is gaining attention because DPSCs can differentiate into odontoblasts and other specialized cell types. Epigenetic modification has been found to play an important role in cell differentiation and regulation, among which histone deacetylase (HDAC) is involved in suppressing genes by removing histone acetyl groups. The use of HDAC inhibitor to control this is increasing and has been widely studied by many researchers. This study aimed to induce differentiation by causing epigenetic changes in odontoblast-related genes and the MAPK signaling pathway in human dental pulp stem cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining showed increased expression of DMP-1, ALP, DSPP, and RUNX2 compared to the control. However, activation of the MAPK signaling system was similar to but slightly different from the expression of odontoblast-related proteins. After 3 days, as shown by MTT and LDH assays, proliferation decreased overall, but cytotoxicity decreased at only a specific concentration. We confirmed that there was no change in mRNA expression of caspase 3 or 9 using real-time PCR. In addition, flow cytometry analysis confirmed that differentiation occurred due to the decrease in the expression of the CD73 and CD146. Although overall proliferation was reduced due to the G2/M inhibition of the cell cycle, the expression of BCL-2 protected the cells from cell death. Overall, cell proliferation decreased in response to MS-275, but it did not induce cytotoxicity in 5 nM and 10 nM concentration and induces differentiation into odontoblast-like cells.","Lee, Eun-Cheol; Kim, Yu-Mi; Lim, Han-Moi; Ki, Ga-Eun; Seo, Young-Kwon",,,276

Disinfectants used in dentistry and dental and maxillofacial surgery include both inorganic (hydrogen peroxide, sodium chlorite-hypochlorite) and organic compounds (ethanol, isopropanol, peracetic acid, chlorhexidine, eugenol). Various mechanisms of action of disinfectants have been reported, which include destruction of the structure of bacterial and fungal cell membranes; damage of nucleic acids; denaturation of proteins, which in turn causes inhibition of enzyme activity; loss of cell membrane integrity; and decomposition of cell components. This article discusses the most important examples of substances used as disinfectants in dentistry and presents the mechanisms of their action with particular focus on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The search was conducted in ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Scopus databases. The interest of scientists in the use of disinfectants in dental practice is constantly growing, which results in the increasing number of publications on disinfection, sterilization, and asepsis. Many disinfectants often possess several of the abovementioned mechanisms of action. In addition, disinfectant preparations used in dental practice either contain one compound or are frequently a mixture of active compounds, which increases their range and effectiveness of antimicrobial action. Currently available information on disinfectants that can be used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in dental practices was summarized.","Stawarz-Janeczek, Magdalena; Kryczyk-Poprawa, Agata; Muszynska, Bozena; Opoka, Wlodzimierz; Pytko-Polonczyk, Jolanta",European journal of dentistry,,276

In an attempt to quantify viral aerosols in the environment of infected patients, we collected 100 air samples in acute care hospital rooms hosting 22 patients over the course of nearly two months using three different air sampling protocols. Quantification by RT-qPCR (ORF1b) led to 11 positive samples from 6 patient rooms (Ct < 40). Viral cultures were negative. No correlation was observed between particular symptoms, length of hospital stay, clinical parameters, and time since symptom onset and the detection of airborne viral RNA. Low detection rates in the hospital rooms may be attributable to the appropriate application of mitigation methods according to the risk control hierarchy, such as increased ventilation to 4.85 air changes per hour to create negative pressure rooms. Our work estimates the mean emission rate of patients and potential airborne concentration in the absence of ventilation. Additional research is needed understand aerosolization events occur, contributing factors, and how best to prevent them.","Dumont-Leblond, Nathan; Veillette, Marc; Mubareka, Samira; Yip, Lily; Longtin, Yves; Jouvet, Philippe; Paquet Bolduc, Bianka; Godbout, Stéphane; Kobinger, Gary; McGeer, Allison; Mikszewski, Alex; Duchaine, Caroline",Emerg Microbes Infect,,276

The collection of population-based infection and immunity data is key to the monitoring of disease prevalence and assessing the effectiveness of interventions such as behavioural modifications and vaccination. In particular, the biological properties of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its interaction with the human host have presented several challenges towards the development of population-based immunity testing. Measuring SARS-CoV-2 immunity requires the development of antibody assays of acceptable sensitivity and specificity which are capable of accurately detecting seroprevalence and differentiating protection from non-protective responses. Now that anti-COVID-19 vaccines are becoming available there is a pressing need to measure vaccine efficacy and the development of herd immunity. The unprecedented impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK in terms of morbidity, mortality, and economic and social disruption has mobilized a national scientific effort to learn more about this virus. In this article, the challenges of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in relation to population-based immunity testing, will be considered and examples given of relevant national level studies.","Maple, Peter A.

493405,Efficient Ethical Principles for Making Fatal Choices,2021,"BACKGROUND: Mathematical modeling studies have suggested that pre-emptive school closures alone have little overall impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but reopening schools in the background of community contact reduction presents a unique scenario that has not been fully assessed. METHODS: We adapted a previously published model using contact information from Shanghai to model school reopening under various conditions. We investigated different strategies by combining the contact patterns observed between different age groups during both baseline and ""lockdown"" periods. We also tested the robustness of our strategy to the assumption of lower susceptibility to infection in children under age 15 years. RESULTS: We find that reopening schools for all children would maintain a post-intervention R0 < 1 up to a baseline R0 of approximately 3.3 provided that daily contacts among children 10-19 years are reduced to 33% of baseline. This finding was robust to various estimates of susceptibility to infection in children relative to adults (up to 50%) and to estimates of various levels of concomitant reopening in the rest of the community (up to 40%). However, full school reopening without any degree of contact reduction in the school setting returned R0 virtually back to baseline, highlighting the importance of mitigation measures. CONCLUSIONS: These results, based on contact structure data from Shanghai, suggest that schools can reopen with proper precautions during conditions of extreme contact reduction and during conditions of reasonable levels of reopening in the rest of the community.","Lee, Benjamin; Hanley, John P; Nowak, Sarah; Bates, Jason H T; Hébert-Dufresne, Laurent",BMC Public Health,,276

METHODS: We carried out a systematic review of randomised controlled trials and observational studies. Studies of adult patients with short-term NSAID use during acute lower respiratory tract infections, including bacterial and viral infections, were included. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular, renal and respiratory complications. RESULTS: In total, eight studies including two randomised controlled trials, three retrospective and three prospective observational studies enrolling 44 140 patients were included. Five of the studies were in patients with pneumonia, two in patients with influenza, and one in a patient with acute bronchitis. Meta-analysis was not possible due to significant heterogeneity. There was a trend towards a reduction in mortality and an increase in pleuro-pulmonary complications. However, all studies exhibited high risks of bias, primarily due to lack of adjustment for confounding variables. Cardiovascular outcomes were not reported by any of the included studies. CONCLUSION: In this systematic review of NSAID use during acute lower respiratory tract infections in adults, we found that the existing evidence for mortality, pleuro-pulmonary complications and rates of mechanical ventilation or organ failure is of extremely poor quality, very low certainty and should be interpreted with caution. Mechanistic and clinical studies addressing the captioned subject are urgently needed, especially in relation to COVID-19.","Vaja, Ricky; Chan, Jeffrey Shi Kai; Ferreira, Plinio; Harky, Amer; Rogers, Luke J; Gashaw, Hime H; Kirkby, Nicholas S; Mitchell, Jane A",,,276

Topological protection enables efficient and robust signal transport; mechanical topological insulators (TIs), in particular, are easy to fabricate and exhibit interfacial wave transport with minimal dissipation, even in the presence of sharp edges, defects, or disorder. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of a phononic crystal Floquet TI (FTI). Hexagonal arrays of circular piezoelectric disks bonded to a PLA substrate, shunted through negative electrical capacitance, and manipulated by external integrated circuits, provide the required spatiotemporal modulation scheme to break time-reversal symmetry and impart a synthetic angular momentum bias that can induce strong topological protection on the lattice edges. Our proposed reconfigurable FTI may find applications for robust acoustic emitters and mechanical logic circuits, with distinct advantages over electronic equivalents in harsh operating conditions.","Darabi, Amir; Ni, Xiang; Leamy, Michael; Alù, Andrea",Sci Adv,,276

This study explored the role of oxidative stress and the Nrf2 signaling pathway in mediating the reproductive toxicity of 1-BP using the ovarian carcinoma cell line OVCAR-3 as an in vitro model of the human ovary. OVCAR-3 cells were treated with 1, 5, 10 and 15 mM 1-BP. After 24 h, the cellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde concentrations significantly increased, while the superoxide dismutase activity decreased; translocation of Nrf2 from the cytosol to the nucleus as well as downstream protein expression of Nrf2-regulated genes heme oxygenase-1 and Bcl-2 was inhibited. Apoptosis was also observed, accompanied by increased caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity. The antioxidant vitamin C alleviated 1-BP-induced apoptosis by inhibiting caspase activity activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. These findings suggested that 1-BP induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in OVCAR-3 cells through inactivation of Nrf2 signaling.","Yang, Guangtao; Xiang, Yingping; Zhou, Wei; Zhong, Xiaohuan; Zhang, Yanfang; Lin, Dafeng; Huang, Xianqing",Toxicol Ind Health,,276

The questionnaire was developed on a web-based platform and invitations were sent to pharmacists nationwide to participate in the study using social media applications. Results A total of 486 pharmacists participated in this study, where females were dominant (78.6%, n = 382). Most (40.4%, n = 198) pharmacists scored 4 out of 5 in basic disease knowledge, and more than half were able to recognize common methods of spread. Risk was highly perceived among participants, and was predicted by gender, living area, and having children (p < 0,05). Frequency of watching the media and sources of information also influenced both risk perception and perceived media roles. Conclusion Disease awareness among pharmacists, as well as risk perception must be considered for effective risk communication planning. The role of media in shaping perceptions should also be carefully studied to encourage compliance with government containment measures and engagement in preventive behaviors.","Karasneh, Reema; Al-Azzam, Sayer; Muflih, Suhaib; Soudah, Ola; Hawamdeh, Sahar; Khader, Yousef",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,276

This study aimed to analyze the stress caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Health Sciences students from the University of Zaragoza (Spain) almost 1 year after the pandemic began. This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted with a sample of 252 university students who completed a self-administered online questionnaire. It evaluated the impact of perceived stress with a modified scale (PSS-10-C), and assessed anxiety and depression on the Goldberg scale. Students presented stress (13.1%), anxiety (71.4%) and depression (81%). Females (81.7%) and the third-year Occupational Therapy students (p = 0.010) reported perceived stress. Nursing students perceived less stress (OR: 0.148; 95% CI: 0.026 to 0.842). University students developed stress and anxiety due to COVID-19 almost 1 year after the pandemic began.

Presently, many ANFIS optimization techniques have been synergized and found effective at some points through trial and error procedures.In this work, we tune ANFIS using Grid partition algorithm to handle unseen data effectively with fast convergence. This model is initialized using a careful selection of effective parameters that discriminate climate conditions;minimum temperature, maximum temperature, average temperature, windspeed and relative humidity. These parameters are used as inputs for ANFIS, whereas confirmed casesof COVID-19 is chosen as dependent values for two consecutive months and first ten days of Decemberfor new COVID-19 confirmed cases according to the Department of disease control (DDC) Thailand. Theproposed ANFIS model provides outstanding achievement to predict confirmed cases of COVID-19 with $R{2} of 0.99.

508219,Perspectives from Students: How to Tame the Chaos and Harness the Power of Technology for Learning,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus. COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus not been previously identified in humans. METHODS: Two key factors, case incidence and case morbidity, were analysed for England. When taken together they give an estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. To analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources. These included population density, %age >16, at fulltime work/education, %age over 60, %BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD2019, location as latitude/longitude, and patient engagement as %self-confident in their own long-term condition management. Average case morbidity was calculated. To provide a comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP practice impact scores were compared against the median practice. RESULTS: The case incidence regression is a dynamic situation but it currently shows that Urban, %Working, and age >60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence. The local population comorbidity remains unchanged. The range of relative healthcare impact was wide with 80% of practices falling at 20%-250% of the national median. Once practice population numbers were included we found that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources. The model provides useful information about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice granularity in all parts of England. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health/social care resources across the world. This model provides a way of predicting relative local levels of disease burden based on defined criteria, thereby providing a method for targeting limited care resources to optimise national/regional/local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.","Stedman, Mike; Lunt, Mark; Davies, Mark; Gibson, Martin; Heald, Adrian",Int J Clin Pract,,276

515708,Affective forecasting and travel decision-making: An investigation in times of a pandemic,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted health care delivery in all aspects of medicine, including abortion care. For 6 months, the mifepristone Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) was temporarily blocked, allowing for the remote provision of medication abortion. Remote medication abortion may become a dominant model of care in the future, either through the formal health system or through self-sourced, self-managed abortion. Clinics already face pressure from falling abortion rates and excessive regulation and with a transition to remote abortion, may not be able to sustain services. Although remote medication abortion improves access for many, those who need or want in-clinic care such as people later in pregnancy, people for whom abortion at home is not safe or feasible, or people who are not eligible for medication abortion, will need comprehensive support to access safe and appropriate care. To understand how we may adapt to remote abortion without leaving people behind, we can look outside of the U.S. to become familiar with emerging and alternative models of abortion care.","Mark, Alice; Foster, Angel M; Perritt, Jamila",Contraception,,276

Hence, we aim to use the combination of symptoms to build a predictive model as a screening tool to identify people and areas with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to be prioritized for testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of individuals registered in ""Dados do Bem,"" a Brazilian app-based symptom tracker. We applied machine learning techniques and provided a SARS-CoV-2 infection risk map of Rio de Janeiro city. RESULTS: From April 28 to July 16, 2020, 337,435 individuals registered their symptoms through the app. Of these, 49,721 participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, being 5,888 (11.8%) positive. Among self-reported symptoms, loss of smell (OR[95%CI]: 4.6 [4.4-4.9]), fever (2.6 [2.5-2.8]), and shortness of breath (2.1 [1.6-2.7]) were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our final model obtained a competitive performance, with only 7% of false-negative users predicted as negatives (NPV = 0.93). The model was incorporated by the ""Dados do Bem"" app aiming to prioritize users for testing. We developed an external validation in the city of Rio de Janeiro. We found that the proportion of positive results increased significantly from 14.9% (before using our model) to 18.1% (after the model). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the combination of symptoms might predict SARS-Cov-2 infection and, therefore, can be used as a tool by decision-makers to refine testing and disease control strategies.","Dantas, Leila F; Peres, Igor T; Bastos, Leonardo S L; Marchesi, Janaina F; de Souza, Guilherme F G; Gelli, João Gabriel M; Baião, Fernanda A; Maçaira, Paula; Hamacher, Silvio; Bozza, Fernando A",PLoS One,,276

We created three vulnerability indices to identify areas and people who require greater support while elucidating health inequities to inform emergency response in Kenya. METHODS: Geospatial indicators were assembled to create three vulnerability indices; Social VulnerabilityIndex (SVI), Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (EVI) and a composite of the two, that is, Social Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (SEVI) resolved at 295 subcounties in Kenya. SVI included 19 indicators that affect the spread of disease; socioeconomic deprivation, access to services and population dynamics, whereas EVI comprised 5 indicators describing comorbidities associated with COVID-19 severe disease progression. The indicators were scaled to a common measurement scale, spatially overlaid via arithmetic mean and equally weighted. The indices were classified into seven classes, 1-2 denoted low vulnerability and 6-7, high vulnerability. The population within vulnerabilities classes was quantified. RESULTS: The spatial variation of each index was heterogeneous across Kenya. Forty-nine northwestern and partly eastern subcounties (6.9 million people) were highly vulnerable, whereas 58 subcounties (9.7 million people) in western and central Kenya were the least vulnerable for SVI. For EVI, 48 subcounties (7.2 million people) in central and the adjacent areas and 81 subcounties (13.2 million people) in northern Kenya were the most and least vulnerable, respectively. Overall (SEVI), 46 subcounties (7.0 million people) around central and southeastern were more vulnerable, whereas 81 subcounties (14.4 million people) were least vulnerable. CONCLUSION: The vulnerability indices created are tools relevant to the county, national government and stakeholders for prioritisation and improved planning. The heterogeneous nature of the vulnerability indices underpins the need for targeted and prioritised actions based on the needs across the subcounties.","Macharia, Peter M; Joseph, Noel K; Okiro, Emelda A",,,276

This study examines a specific cognitive skill that is of particular importance in DS, working memory, and the psychometric properties of a set of standardised measurements to assess working memory in individuals with DS. METHODS: Ninety children and adolescents ages 6 to 18 years old with DS were assessed on a selection of verbal and visuospatial working memory subtests of standardised clinical assessments at two time points to examine feasibility, distributional qualities, test-retest reliability and convergent validity against a priori criteria. Caregivers also completed an adaptive behaviour questionnaire to address working memory subtests' associations with broader developmental functioning. RESULTS: The Stanford Binet-5 Verbal Working Memory, Differential Ability Scales-2 Recognition of Pictures, Stanford Binet-5 Nonverbal Working Memory and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-5 Picture Span measures met the most psychometric criteria overall across the full age and IQ range of the study. Although Differential Ability Scales-2 Recall of Sequential Order and Differential Ability Scales-2 Recall of Digits Backward met the fewest a priori criteria, follow-up analyses suggested greater feasibility in specific age and IQ ranges. CONCLUSIONS: Several working memory measures appear to be psychometrically sound and appropriate for use in clinical trials for children with DS, especially when focusing on raw scores. However, floor effects on standard scores and feasibility of some measures were problematic. Guidelines for use of the working memory subtests with this population are provided.","Schworer, E K; Esbensen, A J; Fidler, D J; Beebe, D W; Carle, A; Wiley, S",J. intellect. dis. res,,276

Grinding of the poorly water-soluble NSAID crystallites can considerably increase their solubility and bioavailability, thereby the necessary doses can be reduced significantly. We used tablets of ibuprofen, niflumic acid and meloxicam as targets. Nanosecond laser pulses were applied at various wavelengths (KrF excimer laser, λ = 248 nm, FWHM = 18 ns and Nd:YAG laser, λ(1) = 532 nm/λ(2) = 1064 nm, FWHM = 6 ns) and at various fluences. FTIR and Raman spectra showed that the chemical compositions of the drugs had not changed during ablation at 532 nm and 1064 nm laser wavelengths. The size distribution of the ablated products was established using two types of particle size analyzers (SMPS and OPC) having complementary measuring ranges. The mean size of the drug crystallites decreased from the initial 30–80 µm to the submicron to nanometer range. For a better understanding of the ablation mechanism we made several investigations (SEM, Ellipsometry, Fast photography) and some model calculations. We have established that PLA offers a chemical-free and simple method for the size reduction of poorly water-soluble drugs and a possible new way for pharmaceutical drug preformulation for nasal administration.","Gera, Tamás; Nagy, Eszter; Smausz, Tamás; Budai, Judit; Ajtai, Tibor; Kun-Szabó, Fruzsina; Homik, Zsolt; Kopniczky, Judit; Bozóki, Zoltán; Szabó-Révész, Piroska; Ambrus, Rita; Hopp, Béla",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-72865-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978489/,276

Sera from recovered patients or convalescent plasma donors who reported laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 200), and negative control sera collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 100), were assessed in parallel. Performance was assessed by calculating EIA sensitivity and specificity with reference to microneutralisation. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 166 (83%) samples. Compared with this, the most sensitive EIAs were the Cobas Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (98%) and Vitros Immunodiagnostic Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100%), which detect total antibody targeting the N and S1 antigens, respectively. The assay with the best quantitative relationship with microneutralisation was the Euroimmun IgG. These results suggest the marker used (total Ab vs. IgG vs. IgA) and the target antigen are important determinants of assay performance. The strong correlation between microneutralisation and some commercially available assays demonstrates their potential for clinical and research use in assessing protection following infection or vaccination, and use as a surrogate test to assess donor suitability for convalescent plasma donation.","Walker, Gregory J.; Naing, Zin; Ospina Stella, Alberto; Yeang, Malinna; Caguicla, Joanna; Ramachandran, Vidiya; Isaacs, Sonia R.; Agapiou, David; Bull, Rowena A.; Stelzer-Braid, Sacha; Daly, James; Gosbell, Iain B.; Hoad, Veronica C.; Irving, David O.; Pink, Joanne M.; Turville, Stuart; Kelleher, Anthony D.; Rawlinson, William D.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33557418/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020247,276

Comment on “COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps: A Technologic Tower of Babel and the Gap for International Pandemic Control”,2021-05-26,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is in immediate need of an effective antidote. Although the Spike glycoprotein (SgP) of SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to bind to heparins, the structural features of this interaction, the role of a plausible heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptor, and the antagonism of this pathway through small molecules remain unaddressed. Using an in vitro cellular assay, we demonstrate HSPGs modified by the 3-O-sulfotransferase isoform-3, but not isoform-5, preferentially increased SgP-mediated cell-to-cell fusion in comparison to control, unmodified, wild-type HSPGs. Computational studies support preferential recognition of the receptor-binding domain of SgP by 3-O-sulfated HS sequences. Competition with either fondaparinux, a 3-O-sulfated HS-binding oligopeptide, or a synthetic, non-sugar small molecule, blocked SgP-mediated cell-to-cell fusion. Finally, the synthetic, sulfated molecule inhibited fusion of GFP-tagged pseudo SARS-CoV-2 with human 293T cells with sub-micromolar potency. Overall, overexpression of 3-O-sulfated HSPGs contribute to fusion of SARS-CoV-2, which could be effectively antagonized by a synthetic, small molecule.","Tiwari, Vaibhav; Tandon, Ritesh; Sankaranarayanan, Nehru Viji; Beer, Jacob C.; Kohlmeir, Ellen K.; Swanson-Mungerson, Michelle; Desai, Umesh R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.08.331751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052337/,276

598876,Message de la rédactrice en chef,2021,"Introduction L’âge est un facteur de risque de formes graves et de décès chez les patients atteints par la maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Cependant, les caractéristiques spécifiques de la population âgée atteinte par la COVID-19 sont mal connues. L’objectif de cette étude est de décrire les particularités cliniques et le devenir des patients de 75 ans et plus qui présentent une infection confirmée à SARS-CoV2. Matériels et méthodes Dans cette étude de cohorte observationnelle monocentrique, tous les cas confirmés d’infection à SARS-CoV2 hospitalisés ou séjournant dans un des EHPAD rattachés à l’établissement ont été inclus. Les données démographiques et cliniques au diagnostic ainsi que l’évolution intra-hospitalière ont été recueillies de manière consécutive et prospective jusqu’au 24e jour après le début des symptômes. Les symptômes ont été considérés « typiques » ou « atypiques » selon l’avis du Haut Conseil de Santé Publique du 20 avril 2020. La mortalité et le devenir à 3 mois ont été recueillis rétrospectivement pour tous les patients de 75 ans et plus. L’échelle Activities of Daily Living (ADL) a été renseignée pour les patients hospitalisés dans la filière gériatrique de l’établissement (services de médecine aiguë et de soins de suite gériatriques). Résultats Deux cent quatre-vingt-onze patients ont été inclus entre septembre et novembre 2020, dont 203 (69,8 %) étaient âgés de 75 ans et plus. Dans la population des moins de 75 ans, seuls 3 patients (3,4 %) avaient des symptômes atypiques, contre 51 (25,1 %) chez les 75 ans et plus. La durée moyenne d’hospitalisation était de 9,41 jours chez les moins de 75 ans, contre 19,4 jours pour les 75 ans et plus. La mortalité au 24e jour était plus élevée chez les patients de 75 ans et plus avec 44 décès (21,7 %) contre 3 (3,4 %) chez les moins de 75 ans. La majorité (88 %) des décès des 75 ans et plus est survenue dans les 24 premiers jours. Parmi la population âgée de 75 ans et plus, 33 % ont développé une forme grave (décès attribuable et/ou transfert en soins critiques et/ou débit en oxygène≥3L/min) mais seulement 10,3 % ont été transférés dans un secteur de soins critiques. Trois mois après le diagnostic, 24,6 % des 75 ans et plus étaient décédés, 6,5 % étaient toujours hospitalisés, 5,9 % avaient été admis en EHPAD et 63 % étaient rentrés à domicile. Chez les patients hospitalisés dans la filière gériatrique, le déclin fonctionnel entre l’entrée et la sortie d’hospitalisation correspondait à une perte moyenne de 1,07 point d’ADL. Conclusion En comparaison avec les patients plus jeunes, les cas confirmés d’infection à SARS-CoV2 âgés de 75 ans et plus développent plus de tableaux cliniques atypiques et sont hospitalisés en moyenne 10 jours supplémentaires. Dans notre étude, la mortalité à 3 mois pour cette classe d’âge atteint 25 %. Chez les patients hospitalisés dans la filière gériatrique de l’établissement, on observe un déclin fonctionnel qui témoigne de la fragilité de cette population.","Mabile, J.; Bernachon, E.; Markiewicz, A.; Hequette, R.",Infectious Diseases Now,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idnow.2021.06.136; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666991921002529; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666991921002529,276
602981,Implication of repatriating migrant workers on COVID-19 spread and transportation requirements,2020-08-03,"BACKGROUND: Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome that requires prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment. A risk-stratification model that could be used to identify high-risk pediatric patients with HLH who should be considered for second-line therapies, including salvage regimens and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), was developed. METHODS: The medical records of 88 pediatric patients (median age 1.4 years, range 0.2–15 years) with non-malignancy associated secondary HLH were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment strategies included dexamethasone, etoposide, and cyclosporine. RESULTS: Survival analysis showed HLH patients with infections other than Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and unknown causes experienced better 5-year overall survival (OS) than patients with HLH due to autoimmune disease, EBV or immunodeficiency (76% vs. 65, 33.3, 11%, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, among all patients, non-response at 8 weeks was the most powerful predictor of poor OS. When treatment response was excluded, hemoglobin < 60 g/L and albumin < 25 g/L at diagnosis were associated with poor OS. In patients with EBV-HLH, hemoglobin < 60 g/L at diagnosis was associated with poor OS. A prognostic risk score was established and weighted based on hazard ratios calculated for three parameters measured at diagnosis: hemoglobin < 60 g/L (2 points), platelets < 30 × 10(9)/L (1 point), albumin < 25 g/L (2 points). Five-year OS of low-risk (score 0–1), intermediate-risk (score 2), and poor-risk (score ≥ 3) patients were 88, 38, and 22%, respectively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that clinicians should be aware of predictive factors at diagnosis and consider 8-week treatment response to identify patients with high-risk of disease progression and the need for second-line therapy and allogeneic HCT.","Pan, Hua; Wang, Gaoyan; Guan, Enben; Song, Liang; Song, Aiqin; Liu, Xiaodan; Yi, Zhi; Sun, Li-rong",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32517812/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-020-02178-7,276
603601,Digital transformation during a lockdown,2020-07-03,"We describe the antiviral activity of plant lectins with specificity for different glycan structures against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in vitro. The SARS-CoV emerged in 2002 as an important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans, and FIPV infection causes a chronic and often fatal peritonitis in cats. A unique collection of 33 plant lectins with different specificities were evaluated. The plant lectins possessed marked antiviral properties against both coronaviruses with EC(50) values in the lower microgram/ml range (middle nanomolar range), being non-toxic (CC(50)) at 50–100 μg/ml. The strongest anti-coronavirus activity was found predominantly among the mannose-binding lectins. In addition, a number of galactose-, N-acetylgalactosamine-, glucose-, and N-acetylglucosamine-specific plant agglutinines exhibited anti-coronaviral activity. A significant correlation (with an r-value of 0.70) between the EC(50) values of the 10 mannose-specific plant lectins effective against the two coronaviruses was found. In contrast, little correlation was seen between the activity of other types of lectins. Two targets of possible antiviral intervention were identified in the replication cycle of SARS-CoV. The first target is located early in the replication cycle, most probably viral attachment, and the second target is located at the end of the infectious virus cycle.","Keyaerts, Els; Vijgen, Leen; Pannecouque, Christophe; Van Damme, Els; Peumans, Willy; Egberink, Herman; Balzarini, Jan; Van Ranst, Marc",Antiviral Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17428553/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354207002380; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354207002380,276

Vaccination provides an unprecedented opportunity to decrease morbidity & mortality, however, there is a limited data regarding cancer patients’ attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: An anonymised questionnaire was completed by volunteering cancer patients attending the ambulatory care unit of a large tertiary cancer centre (Feb to April 2021), prior to vaccination rollout in this cohort. It assessed patients’ acceptance of, and attitudes toward, COVID-19 vaccination. Statistical significance was assessed with Chi-square test (χ2). Results: There was an 80% response rate (143/179). This included 79 females (55%) with a median age range of 51–60 yrs. (n = 35/24%). Most (78%) had a good performance status (PS = 0-1) & lung was the most frequent (28%) cancer type. Eight (6%) had previous COVID-19 infection. Among respondents, 128 (90%) intended on getting vaccinated, 12 (8%) were unsure & three (2%) would refuse. Those intent on vaccination were less concerned with side effects, viewed the pandemic as serious & perceived cancer as a cause for more severe infection compared to the rest (Table). All 101 (71%) patients who received the influenza vaccine were intent on COVID vaccination. Almost 20% (n=28) reported that they were more likely to receive the flu vaccine due to the pandemic. Twelve (8%) identified attending their GP as a barrier, with 97% (n=135) willing to attend hospital for vaccination. While this service is free, 69% (n=99) were willing to pay, with nearly 40% (n=57) up to €50. [Formula presented] Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a very high acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccination among Irish cancer patients such that many would be willing to pay & attend hospital to receive it. The barriers to uptake provide an opportunity to improve education. An unexpected consequence, may be a beneficial increased uptake of the influenza vaccine.

In addition, the positive detections of MLPA and DPO were identified using two different automatic electrophoresis systems. A panel of 168 culture-positive and negative samples was tested by the molecular assays for the presence of influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses and adenovirus. One hundred and twenty-nine (77%) samples were positive as detected by at least one method. Sixty-nine (41%) samples were positive by cell culture (excluding human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses), 116 (69%) by RT-PCR, 127 (76%) by MLPA and 100 (60%) by DPO. The MLPA yielded results in one attempt for all samples included while 12 (7.2%) samples had to be repeated by the DPO assay due to inconclusive results. The MLPA assay performed well in combination with either electrophoresis system, while the performance of the DPO assay was influenced by the electrophoresis systems. Both molecular assays are comparable with real-time RT-PCR, more sensitive than viral culture and can detect dual infections easily. Results can be obtained within 1 day.","Bruijnesteijn van Coppenraet, L.E.S.; Swanink, C.M.A.; van Zwet, A.A.; Nijhuis, R.H.T.; Schirm, J.; Wallinga, J.A.; Ruijs, G.J.H.M.",J Virol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093410002740; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093410002740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20691735/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.07.032,276

Among the modulable factors, diet has been identified as a key regulator of microbiota composition in patients with metabolic syndrome and related diseases, including the metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). The altered microbiota disrupts the intestinal barrier at different levels inducing functional and structural changes at the mucus lining, the intercellular junctions on the epithelial layer, or at the recently characterized vascular barrier. Barrier disruption leads to an increased gut permeability to bacteria and derived products which challenge the immune system and promote inflammation. All these alterations contribute to the pathogenesis of MAFLD, and thus, therapeutic approaches targeting the gut-liver-axis are increasingly being explored. In addition, the specific changes induced in the intestinal flora may allow to characterize distinctive microbial signatures for non-invasive diagnosis, severity stratification and disease monitoring.","Martín-Mateos, Rosa; Albillos, Agustín",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33936094/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.660179,276

Pulse oximeters are widely used worldwide, most recently making headlines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Aoyagi passed away on April 18, 2020, aware of the significance of his invention, but still actively searching for the theory that would take his invention to new heights. METHOD: Many people who knew Dr. Aoyagi, or knew of him and his invention, agreed to participate in this tribute to his work. The authors, from Japan and around the world, represent all aspects of the development of medical devices, including scientists and engineers, clinicians, academics, business people, and clinical practitioners. RESULTS: While the idea of pulse oximetry originated in Japan, device development lagged in Japan due to a lack of business, clinical, and academic interest. Awareness of the importance of anesthesia safety in the US, due to academic foresight and media attention, in combination with excellence in technological innovation, led to widespread use of pulse oximetry around the world. CONCLUSION: Dr. Aoyagi’s final wish was to find a theory of pulse oximetry. We hope this tribute to him and his invention will inspire a new generation of scientists, clinicians, and related organizations to secure the foundation of the theory.","Miyasaka, Katsuyuki; Shelley, Kirk; Takahashi, Shosuke; Kubota, Hironami; Ito, Kazumasa; Yoshiya, Ikuto; Yamanishi, Akio; Cooper, Jeffrey B.; Steward, David J.; Nishida, Hiroshi; Kiani, Joe; Ogino, Hirokazu; Sata, Yasuhiko; Kopotic, Robert J.; Jenkin, Kitty; Hannenberg, Alex; Gawande, Atul",J Anesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34338865/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-021-02967-z,276
614122,Assessment of serological assays for identifying high titer convalescent plasma,2021-03-28,"The Covid‐19 pandemic has disrupted the habits of billions of people around the world. Lockdown at home is mandatory, forcing many families, each member with their own sleep–wake habits, to spend 24 hr a day together, continuously. Sleep is crucial for maintaining immune systems and contributes deeply to physical and psychological health. To assess sleep problems and use of sleeping pills, we conducted a cross‐sectional study of a representative sample of the general population in France. The self‐reported sleep complaint items, which covered the previous 8 days, have been used in the 2017 French Health Barometer Survey, a cross‐sectional survey on various public health issues. After 2 weeks of confinement, 74% of the participants (1,005 subjects) reported trouble sleeping compared with a prevalence rate of 49% in the last general population survey. Women reported more sleeping problems than men, with greater frequency or severity: 31% vs. 16%. Unusually, young people (aged 18–34 years) reported sleep problems slightly more frequently than elderly people (79% vs. 72% among those aged 35 or older), with 60% of the younger group reporting that these problems increased with confinement (vs. 51% of their elders). Finally, 16% of participants reported they had taken sleeping pills during the last 12 months, and 41% of them reported using these drugs since the lockdown started. These results suggest that the COVID crisis is associated with severe sleep disorders among the French population, especially young people.","Beck, Francois; Léger, Damien; Fressard, Lisa; Peretti‐Watel, Patrick; Verger, Pierre",J Sleep Res,https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596936/,276
615027,Effects of air pollution on the respiratory health of children: a study in the capital city of India,2010-07-13,"BACKGROUND: The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on postoperative recovery needs to be understood to inform clinical decision making during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reports 30-day mortality and pulmonary complication rates in patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This international, multicentre, cohort study at 235 hospitals in 24 countries included all patients undergoing surgery who had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed within 7 days before or 30 days after surgery. The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality and was assessed in all enrolled patients. The main secondary outcome measure was pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or unexpected postoperative ventilation. FINDINGS: This analysis includes 1128 patients who had surgery between Jan 1 and March 31, 2020, of whom 835 (74·0%) had emergency surgery and 280 (24·8%) had elective surgery. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed preoperatively in 294 (26·1%) patients. 30-day mortality was 23·8% (268 of 1128). Pulmonary complications occurred in 577 (51·2%) of 1128 patients; 30-day mortality in these patients was 38·0% (219 of 577), accounting for 82·6% (219 of 265) of all deaths. In adjusted analyses, 30-day mortality was associated with male sex (odds ratio 1·75 [95% CI 1·28–2·40], p<0·0001), age 70 years or older versus younger than 70 years (2·30 [1·65–3·22], p<0·0001), American Society of Anesthesiologists grades 3–5 versus grades 1–2 (2·35 [1·57–3·53], p<0·0001), malignant versus benign or obstetric diagnosis (1·55 [1·01–2·39], p=0·046), emergency versus elective surgery (1·67 [1·06–2·63], p=0·026), and major versus minor surgery (1·52 [1·01–2·31], p=0·047). INTERPRETATION: Postoperative pulmonary complications occur in half of patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with high mortality. Thresholds for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic should be higher than during normal practice, particularly in men aged 70 years and older. Consideration should be given for postponing non-urgent procedures and promoting non-operative treatment to delay or avoid the need for surgery.

617611,COVID-19: air pollution remains low as people stay at home,2020-05-21,"The spatial template over which COVID-19 infections operate is a result of nested societal decisions involving complex political and epidemiological processes at a broad range of spatial scales. It is characterized by ‘hotspots’ of high infections interspersed within regions where infections are sporadic to absent. In this work, the sparseness of COVID-19 infections and their time variations were analyzed across the US at scales ranging from 10 km (county scale) to 2600 km (continental scale). It was found that COVID-19 cases are multi-scaling with a multifractality kernel that monotonically approached that of the underlying population. The spatial correlation of infections between counties increased rapidly in March 2020; that rise continued but at a slower pace subsequently, trending towards the spatial correlation of the population agglomeration. This shows that the disease had already spread across the USA in early March such that travel restriction thereafter (starting on March 15(th) 2020) had minor impact on the subsequent spatial propagation of COVID-19. The ramifications of targeted interventions on spatial patterns of new infections were explored using the epidemiological susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model mapped onto the population agglomeration template. These revealed that re-opening rural areas would have a smaller impact on the spread and evolution of the disease than re-opening urban (dense) centers which would disturb the system for months. This study provided a novel way for interpreting the spatial spread of COVID-19, along with a practical approach (multifractals/SIR/spectral slope) that could be employed to capture the variability and intermittency at all scales while maintaining the spatial structure.","Geng, Xiaolong; Gerges, Firas; Katul, Gabriel G.; Bou-Zeid, Elie; Nassif, Hani; Boufadel, Michel C.",Chem Eng J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204214/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1385894720338249; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894720338249?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.127702,276

To profile the viruses causing ARI in children admitted to a community‐based hospital in central Taiwan, a cross‐sectional study was conducted on children under 14 years of age that were hospitalized with febrile ARI. Viral etiology was determined using conventional cell culture and a commercial respiratory virus panel fast assay (xTAG RVP), capable of detecting 19 different respiratory viruses and subtype targets. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded and analyzed. The RVP fast assay identified at least one respiratory virus in 130 of the 216 specimens examined (60.2%) and rose to 137 (63.4%) by combining the results of cell culture and RVP fast assay. In order of frequency, the etiological agents identified were, rhinovirus/enterovirus (24.6%), respiratory syncytial virus (13.8%), adenovirus (11.5%), parainfluenza virus (9.2%), influenza B (8.4%), influenza A (5.4%), human metapneumovirus (4.6%), human coronavirus (2%), and human bocavirus (2%). Co‐infection did not result in an increase in clinical severity. The RVP assay detected more positive specimens, but failed to detect 6 viruses identified by culture. The viral detection rate for the RVP assay was affected by how many days after admission the samples were taken (P = 0.03). In conclusion, Rhinovirus/enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus were prevalent in this study by adopting RVP assay. The viral detection rate is influenced by sampling time, especially if the tests are performed during the first three days of hospitalization. J. Med.

621210,Emerging principles for the allocation of academic work in universities,2021-07-29,"Sera from 38 free-ranging spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, were screened for exposure to coronavirus of antigenic group 1. An immunofluorescence assay indicated high levels of exposure to coronavirus among Serengeti hyenas: 95% when considering sera with titer levels of ≥1:10 and 74% when considering sera with titer levels of ≥1:40. Cubs had generally lower mean titer levels than adults. Exposure among Serengeti hyenas to coronavirus was also confirmed by a serum neutralisation assay and an ELISA. Application of RT-PCR to 27 fecal samples revealed viral RNA in three samples (11%). All three positive fecal samples were from the 15 juvenile animals (<24 months of age) sampled, and none from the 12 adults sampled. No viral RNA was detected in tissue samples (lymph node, intestine, lung) from 11 individuals. Sequencing of two amplified products from the S protein gene of a positive sample revealed the presence of coronavirus specific RNA with a sequence homology to canine coronavirus of 76 and 78% and to feline coronavirus type II of 80 and 84%, respectively. Estimation of the phylogenetic relationship among coronavirus isolates indicated considerable divergence of the hyena variant from those in European, American and Japanese domestic cats and dogs. From long-term observations of several hundred known individuals, the only clinical sign in hyenas consistent with those described for coronavirus infections in dogs and cats was diarrhea. There was no evidence that coronavirus infection in hyenas caused clinical signs similar to feline infectious peritonitis in domestic cats or was a direct cause of mortality in hyenas. To our knowledge, this is the first report of coronavirus infection in Hyaenidae.","East, Marion L; Moestl, Karin; Benetka, Viviane; Pitra, Christian; Höner, Oliver P; Wachter, Bettina; Hofer, Heribert",Vet Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113504001956; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113504001956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15288921/,276

Liquid chalk is a commonly used accessories in gyms and is comprised of magnesium carbonate and alcohol that quickly evaporates on the hands to leave a layer of dry chalk. We investigated whether liquid chalk is an antiseptic against highly pathogenic human viruses including, SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus and noroviruses. Chalk was applied before or after virus inoculum and recovery of infectious virus was determined to mimic the use in the gym. We observed that addition of chalk before or after virus contact lead to a significant reduction on recovery of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and influenza but had little impact on norovirus. These observations suggest that the use and application of liquid chalk can be an effective and suitable antiseptic for major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games.","McAuley, Julie L.; Deerain, Joshua M.; Hammersla, William; Aktepe, Turgut E.; Purcell, Damian J.F.; Mackenzie, Jason M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.02.364661,276

The time complexity of our online method is linear in the sample size, and it provides accurate estimates on daily or hourly summary statistics such as time spent at home and distance traveled. MATERIALS AND METHODS To preserve a smartphone's battery, GPS may be sampled only for a small portion of time, frequently <10%, which leads to a substantial missing data problem. We developed an algorithm that simulates an individual's trajectory based on observed GPS location traces using sparse online Gaussian Process to addresses the high computational complexity of the existing method. The method also retains the spherical geometry of the problem, and imputes the missing trajectory in a bidirectional fashion with multiple condition checks to improve accuracy. RESULTS We demonstrated that (1) the imputed trajectories mimic the real-world trajectories, (2) the confidence intervals of summary statistics cover the ground truth in most cases, and (3) our algorithm is much faster than existing methods if we have more than 3 months of observations; (4) we also provide guidelines on optimal sampling strategies. CONCLUSIONS Our approach outperformed existing methods and was significantly faster. It can be used in settings in which data need to be analyzed and acted on continuously, for example, to detect behavioral anomalies that might affect treatment adherence, or to learn about colocations of individuals during an epidemic.","Liu, Gang; Onnela, Jukka-Pekka",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocab069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34100950/,276

Our study demonstrated persisting diarrhea and prolonged fecal shedding, but with a lack of significant intestinal lesions in gnotobiotic (Gn) calves infected with GIII.2 BoNoV, CV186-OH/00/US strain. Nine 4 to 7-day-old Angus/Jersey crossbred Gn calves were orally inoculated with 10.0-11.9 log(10) genomic equivalents (GE)/calf of CV186-OH (n=7) or mock (n=2). Calves were euthanized at post-inoculation day (PID) 1 (n=1) when moderate to severe lethargy was observed and at PIDs 2-6 (n=4) after lethargy had subsided. Two calves were kept longer term (until PID 30) for monitoring fecal shedding patterns by TaqMan real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Most infected calves exhibited two clinical signs: i) acute but persisting diarrhea and ii) acute moderate to severe lethargy. The two infected calves, followed longer-term, had prolonged fecal viral RNA shedding [peak average titer of 11.8 (± 0.2) log(10) GE/ml] at least until PID 20. By qRT-PCR, 5 infected calves had low viral RNA titers in serum, ranging from 4.0 to 5.8 log(10) GE/ml, at PIDs 1-5, but not (<2.7 log(10) GE/ml) at PIDs 6-30. The latter observation coincided with the presence of serum IgG antibody to BoNoV at PIDs 8-30. Collectively, the GIII.2 BoNoV strain CV186-OH induced only mild enteropathogenicity, evident by the lack of significant intestinal lesions, but it led to persisting mild diarrhea and prolonged fecal virus shedding in Gn calves. The prolonged fecal shedding of GIII.2 BoNoV might partially explain how this virus is maintained as endemic infections in cattle.","Jung, Kwonil; Scheuer, Kelly A.; Zhang, Zhenwen; Wang, Qiuhong; Saif, Linda J.",Veterinary Microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.11.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24309403/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3905316?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113513005075; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113513005075,276

PED, characterized by acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, has caused serious economic losses in pig industry worldwide. Here, we demonstrate that activation of a disintergrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) induced the decrease of PEDV infection in HEK293 and IPEC-J2 cells and the downregulation of cell surface aminopeptidase N (APN) expression, an important entry factor for PEDV infection. Furthermore, overexpression of ADAM17 suppressed PEDV infection in HEK293 and IPEC-J2 cells, whereas ablation of ADAM17 expression using ADAM17 specific siRNA resulted in a corresponding increase of PEDV infection and an upregulation of cell surface APN expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that modulation of APN expression by metalloprotease ADAM17 regulates PEDV infection. Hence, the reduction in APN expression represents another component of the anti-PEDV infection response initiated by ADAM17.","Zhang, Jian; Guo, Longjun; Yang, Lijun; Xu, Jiayu; Zhang, Lu; Feng, Li; Chen, Hongyan; Wang, Yue",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.02.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29475600/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682218300382; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682218300382,276

This study investigates the interaction between influenza and COVID-19 during the latter part of the 2019-20 influenza season in England. Methods: Individuals tested for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 were extracted from national surveillance systems between 20/01/2020 and 25/04/2020. To estimate influenza infection on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, univariable and multivariable analyses on the odds of SARS-CoV-2 in those who tested positive for influenza compared to those who tested negative for influenza. To assess whether a coinfection was associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 outcome, univariable and multivariable analyses on the odds of death adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidity and coinfection status. Findings: The risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was 68% lower among influenza positive cases, suggesting possible pathogenic competition between the two viruses. Patients with a coinfection had a risk of death of 5.92 (95% CI, 3.21-10.91) times greater than among those with neither influenza nor SARS-CoV-2 suggesting possible synergistic effects in coinfected individuals. The odds of ventilator use or death and ICU admission or death was greatest among coinfection patients showing strong evidence of an interaction effect compared to SARS-CoV-2/influenza acting independently. Interpretation: Cocirculation of these viruses could have a significant impact on morbidity, mortality and health service demand. Testing for influenza alongside SARS-CoV-2 and maximising influenza vaccine uptake should be prioritised to mitigate these risks.","Stowe, J.; Tessier, E.; Zhao, H.; Guy, R.; Muller-Pebody, B.; Zambon, M.; Andrews, N.; Ramsay, M.; Lopez Bernal, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20189647v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.18.20189647,276

Developing tools to measure seroprevalence and understand protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is a priority. We aimed to develop a serological assay using plant-derived recombinant viral proteins, which represent important tools in less-resourced settings. Methods: We established an indirect ELISA using the S1 and receptor-binding domain (RBD) portions of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2, expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. We measured antibody responses in sera from South African patients (n = 77) who had tested positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were taken a median of 6 weeks after the diagnosis, and the majority of participants had mild and moderate COVID-19 disease. In addition, we tested the reactivity of pre-pandemic plasma (n = 58) and compared the performance of our in-house ELISA with a commercial assay. We also determined whether our assay could detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA in saliva. Results: We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins are readily detectable using recombinant plant-derived viral proteins, in patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Reactivity to S1 and RBD was detected in 51 (66%) and 48 (62%) of participants, respectively. Notably, we detected 100% of samples identified as having S1-specific antibodies by a validated, high sensitivity commercial ELISA, and optical density (OD) values were strongly and significantly correlated between the two assays. For the pre-pandemic plasma, 1/58 (1.7%) of samples were positive, indicating a high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in our ELISA. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG correlated significantly with IgA and IgM responses. Endpoint titers of S1- and RBD-specific immunoglobulins ranged from 1:50 to 1:3,200. S1-specific IgG and IgA were found in saliva samples from convalescent volunteers. Conclusion: We demonstrate that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in plants enable robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses. This assay can be used for seroepidemiological studies and to measure the strength and durability of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in infected patients in our setting.","Makatsa, Mohau S.; Tincho, Marius B.; Wendoh, Jerome M.; Ismail, Sherazaan D.; Nesamari, Rofhiwa; Pera, Francisco; de Beer, Scott; David, Anura; Jugwanth, Sarika; Gededzha, Maemu P.; Mampeule, Nakampe; Sanne, Ian; Stevens, Wendy; Scott, Lesley; Blackburn, Jonathan; Mayne, Elizabeth S.; Keeton, Roanne S.; Burgers, Wendy A.",Front Plant Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33868324/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.589940,276

A healthy man completed a graded cycling ergometer test prior to and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, then again after receiving an adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccine. Using whole blood SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation assays, IFN-γ ELISPOT assays, flow cytometry, ex vivo viral-specific T-cell expansion assays and deep T-cell receptor (TCR) β sequencing, we found that exercise robustly mobilized highly functional SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells to the blood compartment that recognized spike protein, membrane protein, nucleocapsid antigen and the B.1.1.7 α-variant, and consisted mostly of CD3+/CD8+ T-cells and double-negative (CD4-/CD8-) CD3+ T-cells. The magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell mobilization with exercise was intensity dependent and robust when compared to T-cells recognizing other viruses (e.g. CMV, EBV, influenza). Vaccination enhanced the number of exercise-mobilized SARS-CoV-2 T-cells recognizing spike protein and the α-variant only. Exercise-mobilized SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells proliferated more vigorously to ex vivo peptide stimulation and maintained broad TCR-β diversity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens both before and after ex vivo expansion. Neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were transiently elevated during exercise after both infection and vaccination. Finally, infection was associated with an increased metabolic demand to defined exercise workloads, which was restored to pre-infection levels after vaccination. This case study provides impetus for larger studies to determine if these immune responses to exercise can facilitate viral clearance, ameliorate symptoms of long COVID syndrome, and/or restore functional exercise capacity following SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Baker, Forrest L.; Smith, Kyle A.; Zúñiga, Tiffany M.; Batatinha, Helena; Niemiro, Grace M.; Pedlar, Charles R.; Burgess, Shane C.; Katsanis, Emmanuel; Simpson, Richard J.",Brain Behav Immun Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34514439/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666354621001460; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354621001460?v=s5,276

To date, most concentration methods were developed for non-enveloped viruses, and limited studies have directly compared the recovery efficiency of both types of viruses. In this study, the effectiveness of two different concentration methods (Concentrating Pipette Select™ (CP) method—than the adsorption-extraction (AE) method amended with MgCl2) was evaluated for untreated wastewater matrices using three different viruses (SARS-CoV-2 (seeded), human adenovirus 40/41 (HAdV 40/41), enterovirus (EV) and a wastewater-associated bacterial marker gene targeting Lachnospiraceae (Lachno3). The most effective concentration method varied by microbial analyte. For SARS-CoV-2, the estimated mean recovery efficiencies were statistically significantly greater (p < 0.05) by as much as 5.46 times, using the CP method—than the AE method amended with MgCl2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA recovery was greater for samples with higher titer seeds regardless of the method, and the estimated mean recovery efficiencies using the CP method were 25.1 ± 11% across ten WWTPs when wastewater samples were seeded with 5 × 104 gene copies (GC) of SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, the AE method significantly (p < 0.05) yielded greater concentrations of indigenous HAdV 40/41 and Lachno3 from wastewater compared to the CP eluate method. Finally, no statistically significant (p > 0.05) differences in indigenous EV concentrations were identified in comparing the AE and CP eluate methods. These data indicate that the most effective concentration method varies by microbial analyte and that the priorities of the surveillance or monitoring program should be considered when choosing the concentration method.","Ahmed, Warish; Bivins, Aaron; Simpson, Stuart L.; Smith, Wendy J.M.; Metcalfe, Suzanne; McMinn, Brian; Symonds, Erin M.; Korajkic, Asja",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34388890/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721044594?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149386; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721044594,276

Thymic atrophy occurs with age (physiological thymic atrophy) or as a result of viral, bacterial, parasitic or fungal infection (pathological thymic atrophy). Thymic atrophy directly results in loss of thymocytes and/or destruction of the thymic architecture, and indirectly leads to a decrease in naïve T cells and limited T cell receptor diversity. Thus, it is important to recognize the causes and mechanisms that induce thymic atrophy. In this review, we highlight current progress in infection-associated pathogenic thymic atrophy and discuss its possible mechanisms. In addition, we discuss whether extracellular vesicles/exosomes could be potential carriers of pathogenic substances to the thymus, and potential drugs for the treatment of thymic atrophy.

Like many other human and animal viruses, coronavirus infection of mammalian cells induces apoptosis. In this study, the global gene expression profiles are first determined in IBV-infected Vero cells at 24 hours post-infection by Affymetrix array, using avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) as a model system. It reveals an up-regulation at the transcriptional level of both pro-apoptotic Bak and pro-survival myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). These results were further confirmed both in vivo and in vitro, in IBV-infected embryonated chicken eggs, chicken fibroblast cells and mammalian cells at transcriptional and translational levels, respectively. Interestingly, the onset of apoptosis occurred earlier in IBV-infected mammalian cells silenced with short interfering RNA targeting Mcl-1 (siMcl-1), and was delayed in cells silenced with siBak. IBV progeny production and release were increased in infected Mcl-1 knockdown cells compared to similarly infected control cells, while the contrary was observed in infected Bak knockdown cells. Furthermore, IBV infection-induced up-regulation of GADD153 regulated the expression of Mcl-1. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathways by chemical inhibitors and knockdown of GADD153 by siRNA demonstrated the involvement of ER-stress response in regulation of IBV-induced Mcl-1 expression.

METHODS: We conducted a multicentre randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients with at least one of the following risk factors for worsening: need for supplemental oxygen, age ≥75 years, age between 60 - 74 years and presence of at least one comorbidity. Severely ill patients requiring oxygen therapy > 3L/min or intensive care were excluded. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 800mg hydroxychloroquine on Day 0 followed by 400mg per day for 8 days or a placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite of death or start of invasive mechanical ventilation within 14 days following randomization. Secondary endpoints included mortality and clinical evolution at Day 14 and 28, viral shedding at Day 5 and 10. RESULTS: The trial was stopped after 250 patients were included due to a slowdown of the pandemic in France. The intention-to-treat population comprised 123 and 124 patients in the placebo and hydroxychloroquine groups, respectively. The median age was 77 (interquartile range 58 – 86) years and 151/250 (60.4%) patients required oxygen therapy. The primary endpoint occurred in 9/124 (7.3%) patients in the hydroxychloroquine group and 8/123 (6.5%) patients in the placebo group (relative risk 1.12; 95% confidence interval 0.45– 2.80). The rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR at day 5 and 10 was 72.8% (75/103) and 57.1% (52/91) in the hydroxychloroquine group, versus 73.0% (73/100) and 56.6% (47/83) in the placebo group, respectively. No difference was observed between the two groups in any of the other secondary endpoints. CONCLUSION: In this underpowered trial involving mainly older patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, patients treated with hydroxychloroquine did not experience better clinical or virological outcomes than those receiving the placebo.","Dubée, Vincent; Roy, Pierre-Marie; Vielle, Bruno; Parot-Schinkel, Elsa; Blanchet, Odile; Darsonval, Astrid; Lefeuvre, Caroline; Abbara, Chadi; Boucher, Sophie; Devaud, Edouard; Robineau, Olivier; Rispal, Patrick; Guimard, Thomas; d’Anglejean, Emma; Diamantis, Sylvain; Custaud, Marc-Antoine; Pellier, Isabelle; Mercat, Alain",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813110/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X21001403; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X21001403?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2021.03.005,276

652543,Clinic in the times of COVID19,2021-02-13,"BACKGROUND: Teledermatology may be used for triage in primary care to address skin conditions, improving access and reducing time to treat the most severe or surgical cases. We aimed to evaluate the proportion of individuals who could be assessed in primary care using teledermatology, and how this affected the waiting time for an in-person dermatologist appointment. METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study, involving 30,976 individuals and 55,624 skin lesions, was performed from July 2017 to July 2018 We assessed the frequency of diagnoses and referrals to biopsy, to in-person dermatologists, or to primary care, and compared the waiting time for an in-person dermatologist appointment before and after the teledermatology implementation. FINDINGS: 53% of the patients were managed with the primary care physician, 43% were referred to in-person dermatologists and 4% directly to biopsy, leading to a reduction of 78% in the waiting time for in-person appointments when compared to the previous period. The most frequent diseases were: melanocytic nevus, seborrheic keratosis, acne, benign neoplasms, onychomycosis, atopic dermatitis, solar lentigo, melasma, xerosis, and epidermoid cyst, with significant differences according to sex, age and referrals. The most frequent treatment prescribed was emollient. INTERPRETATION: The use of teledermatology as a triage tool significantly reduced the waiting time for in-person visits, improving health care access and utilizing public resources wisely. Knowledge of sex, age, diagnoses and treatment of common skin conditions can enable public policies for the prevention and orientation of the population, as it can be used to train general physicians to address such cases.

We identify heparan sulfate as an important attachment factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we show that sialic acids present on ACE2 prevent efficient spike/ACE2-interaction. While SARS-CoV infection is substantially limited by the sialic acid-mediated restriction in both human lung epithelial cells and ex vivo human lung tissues, infection by SARS-CoV-2 is limited to a lesser extent. We further demonstrate that the furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike is required for efficient virus replication in human lung but not intestinal tissues.

With wild animals, this can be very challenging because individuals can be difficult to trap and sample, even more so since they are tested with imperfect diagnostic techniques. Multi-event capture-recapture models allow analysing longitudinal capture data of individuals whose infection status is assessed using imperfect tests. In this study, we used a two-year dataset from a longitudinal field study of peridomestic wild bird populations in the United Arab Emirates during which thousands of birds from various species were captured, sampled and tested for Newcastle disease virus exposure using a serological test. We developed a multi-event capture-recapture model to estimate important demographic and epidemiological parameters of the disease. The modelling outputs provided important insights into the understanding of Newcastle disease dynamics in peridomestics birds, which varies according to ecological and epidemiological parameters, and useful information in terms of surveillance strategies. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to model the dynamics of Newcastle disease in wild bird populations by combining longitudinal capture data and serological test results. Overall, it showcased that multi-event capture-recapture models represent a suitable method to analyse imperfect capture data and make reliable inferences on infectious disease dynamics in wild populations.","Hirschinger, Julien; Marescot, Lucile; Hingrat, Yves; Guerin, Jean Luc; Le Loc’h, Guillaume; Vergne, Timothée",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79184-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33568682/,276

Throughout the pandemic, some countries such as Italy had a monthly demand of ca. 90 million facemasks. Domestic mask manufacturers are capable of manufacturing 8 million masks each week, although the demand was 40 million per week during March 2020. This dramatic increase has contributed to a spike in the generation of facemask waste. Facemasks are often manufactured with synthetic materials that are non‐biodegradable, and their increased usage and improper disposal are raising environmental concerns. Consequently, there is a strong interest for developing biodegradable facemasks made with for example, renewable nanofibres. A range of natural polymer‐based nanofibres has been studied for their potential to be used in air filter applications.

Endothelial dysfunction is encompassed by complex pathophysiology that is based on endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling and endothelial activation following stimulation from various inflammatory mediators (molecular patterns, oxidized lipoproteins, cytokines). The downstream signaling via nuclear factor-κB leads to overexpression of adhesion molecules, selectins, and chemokines that facilitate leukocyte adhesion, rolling, and transmigration to the subendothelial space. Moreover, oscillatory shear stress leads to pro-inflammatory endothelial activation with increased monocyte adhesion and endothelial cell apoptosis, an effect that is dependent on multiple pathways and flow-sensitive microRNA regulation. Moreover, the role of neutrophil extracellular traps and NLRP3 inflammasome as inflammatory mechanisms contributing to endothelial dysfunction has recently been unveiled and is under further investigation. Consequently, and following their activation, injured endothelial cells release inflammatory mediators and enter a pro-thrombotic state through activation of coagulation pathways, downregulation of thrombomodulin, and an increase in platelet adhesion and aggregation owing to the action of von-Willebrand factor, ultimately promoting atherosclerosis progression.","Theofilis, Panagiotis; Sagris, Marios; Oikonomou, Evangelos; Antonopoulos, Alexios S.; Siasos, Gerasimos; Tsioufis, Costas; Tousoulis, Dimitris",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34356845/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9070781,276

We first determined that RSV infection activates PKR which induces the phosphorylation of eIF2α, resulting in the formation of host stress granules. We used RNA interference to decrease endogenous PKR levels. RSV replication was not altered in cells deficient for PKR expression. However, RSV-mediated stress granule formation was significantly reduced in PKR-knockdown cells. As an alternative method to block PKR activation, we used treatment with the kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine (2-AP). We observed that 2-AP treatment significantly reduced viral replication. We also treated PKR-knockdown cells with 2-AP and inoculated with RSV. Under these conditions, 2-AP treatment diminished viral replication in the absence of PKR expression. These results suggest that PKR activation has a minimal effect on RSV replication and that the antiviral effect of 2-AP during RSV infection likely occurs via a PKR-independent mechanism.","Lindquist, Michael E.; Mainou, Bernardo A.; Dermody, Terence S.; Crowe, James E.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21377708/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682211000705; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.02.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682211000705,276

The results showed rapid shifts in client and staff behavior on a daily basis, shifts in services from in-person services to telehealth, and increases in volumes, revenue, and margins. We detail regulations and provide actionable steps that clinical organizations can take pertinent to this shift now and in the future. The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic underscore the importance of maintaining robust coordination and communication across our field in order to address crises that affect our field.","Crockett, Jennifer L.; Becraft, Jessica L.; Phillips, Sharon T.; Wakeman, Marguerite; Cataldo, Michael F.",Behav Anal Pract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40617-020-00499-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33082924/,276
672470,Mobile agency and relational webs in women’s narratives of international study,2021-04-14,"IMPORTANCE: A significant proportion of COVID-19 transmission occurs silently during the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic stages of infection. Children, while being important drivers of silent transmission, are not included in COVID-19 vaccination campaigns given their exclusion from clinical trials thus far. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of a targeted approach to identifying silent infections among children as a proxy for their vaccination. DESIGN: This study used an age-structured disease transmission model to simulate the synergistic impact of interventions in reducing attack rates over the course of one year. SETTING: A synthetic population representative of the demographics of the United States (US). PARTICIPANTS: Six age groups of 0–4, 5–10, 11–18, 19–49, 50–64, 65+ years old, stratified for their population size based on US census data. EXPOSURES: Vaccination of adults, self-isolation of all symptomatic cases within 24 hours of symptom onset, and detection of silent infections. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vaccination of adults was implemented to reach a 40% coverage over the course of one year with a vaccine efficacy of 95% against symptomatic and severe COVID-19. Without vaccination of children, we determined the proportion and speed that would be required for identifying silent infections among this age group to suppress future attack rates below 5%. RESULTS: A targeted approach that identifies 20.6% and 28.6% of silent infections among children within 2 or 3 days post-infection, respectively, would be required to bring attack rates under 5% with vaccination of adults. If silent infections among children remained undetected, achieving the same attack rates would require an unrealistically high vaccination coverage (at least 82%) of this age group, in addition to the base-case 40% vaccination coverage of adults. The results were robust in sensitivity analyses with respect to vaccine efficacy against infection and reduced susceptibility of children to infection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the absence of vaccine availability for children, a targeted approach to rapid identification of silent COVID-19 infections in this age group can significantly mitigate disease burden. Without measures to interrupt transmission chains from silent infections, vaccination of adults is unlikely to contain the outbreaks in the near term.","Moghadas, Seyed M.; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C.; Shoukat, Affan; Zhang, Kevin; Galvani, Alison P.",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.06.21249349v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.06.21249349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33442702/,276
672493,Comparative effectiveness research in COVID-19 using real-world data: methodological considerations,2021-08-31,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the massive generation of biomedical waste (BMW) and plastic waste (PW). This sudden spike in BMW and PW has created challenges to the existing waste management infrastructure, especially in developing countries. Safe disposal of PW and BMW is essential; otherwise, this virus will lead to a waste pandemic. This paper reviews the generation of BMW and PW before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the regulatory framework for BMW management, policy interventions for COVID-19-based BMW (C-BMW), the capacity of BMW treatment and disposal facilities to cope with the challenges, possible management strategies, and perspectives in the Indian context. This study indicated that policy intervention helped minimize the general waste treated as C-BMW, especially during the second pandemic. Inadequacy of common BMW treatment facilities’ (CBMWTFs) capacity to cope with the BMW daily generation was observed in some states resulting in compromised treatment conditions. Suggestions for better management of BMW and PW include decontamination of used personal protective equipment (PPEs) and recycling, alternate materials for PPEs, segregation strategies, and use of BMW for co-processing in cement kilns. All upcoming CBMWTFs should be equipped with higher capacity and efficient incinerators for the sound management of BMW. Post-pandemic monitoring of environmental compartments is imperative to assess the possible impacts of pandemic waste.

C’est le livreur d’autotest Covid,2021-06-30,"The COVID-19 pandemic zoonosis has determined extensive lockdowns worldwide that provide an unprecedented opportunity to understand how large-scale shifts of human activities can impact wildlife. We addressed the impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on wildlife in Italy, the first European country that performed a countrywide lockdown, and identified potentially beneficial and negative consequences for wildlife conservation and management. We combined a qualitative analysis of social media information with field data from multiple taxa, data from citizen science projects, and questionnaires addressed to managers of protected areas. Both social media information and field data suggest that a reduction of human disturbance allowed wildlife to exploit new habitats and increase daily activity. The field data confirmed some positive effects on wildlife conservation, such as an increase in species richness in temporarily less-disturbed habitats, a higher breeding success of an aerial insectivorous bird, and reduction of road-killing of both amphibians and reptiles. Despite some positive effects, our data also highlighted several negative impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on wildlife. The lower human disturbance linked to lockdown was in fact beneficial for invasive alien species. Results from questionnaires addressed to managers of protected areas highlighted that the COVID-19 lockdown interrupted actions for the control of invasive alien species, and hampered conservation activities targeting threatened taxa. Furthermore, the reduction of enforcement could cause a surge of illegal killing of wildlife. The COVID-19 crisis, besides having deep socio-economic impacts, might profoundly affect wildlife conservation, with potentially long-lasting effects.","Manenti, Raoul; Mori, Emiliano; Di Canio, Viola; Mercurio, Silvia; Picone, Marco; Caffi, Mario; Brambilla, Mattia; Ficetola, Gentile Francesco; Rubolini, Diego",Biol Conserv,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108728; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006320720307862; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320720307862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32863391/,276
675846,Creating a Composite Index to Target Recruitment of UK Students from Areas of Low Participation in Higher Education,2021-08-17,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted adults with chronic diseases, and their health care delivery. Patterns of COVID-19–related preventive behaviors practiced by cancer survivors are unknown, including practices related to canceling doctor's appointments. We evaluated COVID-19–related preventive behaviors among cancer survivors in the United States. METHODS: We used nationally representative data of 10,760 U.S. adults from the COVID-19 Impact Survey. We defined cancer survivors as those with a self-reported diagnosis of cancer (n = 854, 7.6%). We present frequencies and χ(2) tests to evaluate COVID-19–related preventive behaviors among cancer survivors. We estimated determinants of canceling doctor's appointments among cancer survivors using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Cancer survivors were more likely to practice preventive behaviors, including social distancing (93%, χ(2) P < 0.001), wearing a face mask (93%, χ(2) P < 0.001), and avoiding crowded areas (84%, χ(2) P < 0.001) compared with adults without cancer. Cancer survivors were more likely to cancel doctor's appointments (41%, χ(2) P < 0.001), whereas they were less likely to cancel other social activities such as work (19%, χ(2) P < 0.001) and school-related (13%, χ(2) P < 0.001) activities. After adjustment for covariates, while non-Hispanic (NH)-Black cancer survivors were less likely to cancel a doctor's appointment compared with NH-White cancer survivors, cancer survivors aged 18 to 29, who were female, and who had least one comorbid condition were more likely. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors are adhering to recommended preventive behaviors. Cancer survivor's continuity of care may be impacted by COVID-19, specifically young adults, females, and those with existing comorbid conditions. IMPACT: Insights into cancer survivors whose care may be most impacted by COVID-19 will be valuable toward surveillance and survivorship of U.S. cancer survivors.","Islam, Jessica Y.; Camacho-Rivera, Marlene; Vidot, Denise C.",Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.epi-20-0801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978173/,276

678969,Effect of pandemic based online education on teaching and learning system,2021-06-08,"OBJECTIVES: This study examines the Saudi Arabian population's willingness to participate in clinical trials for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, comparing recovered cases' willingness with that of healthy volunteers. METHODS: A case–control study was conducted on the Saudi Arabian population during September 2020. The data were collected from recovered COVID-19 participants as the case group, and healthy volunteers as the control group. RESULTS: The data showed that 42.2% (n = 315) of recovered COVID-19 cases were more willing to participate in the COVID-19 vaccine trial than healthy volunteers (299; 38.1%) with a p < 0.001. The proportion of the participants who were willing to donate plasma was significantly higher among recovered participants, 84.2% (n = 112), than healthy volunteers, 76.3% (n = 87), with a p < 0.0001. The most significant factor responsible for a willingness to participate was the belief that vaccine discovery would help scientific developments (r = 0.525 and 0.465 for case and control, respectively). In comparison, significant reasons behind the unwillingness to participate were the risk of exposure to an unproven vaccine, r = 0.377 and 0.497 for case and control, respectively (p < 0.001), and a discomfort with being treated as an experimental subject (r = 0.275 and 0.374 for case and control, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The differences in readiness toward the COVID-19 vaccine trial in our study does not indicate any passive exposure of participants to an unproven clinical trial vaccine, nor does it shed light on well-informed risk-related decisions. However, certain factors can significantly influence decision-making while contributing toward clinical research.

679307,Ghosts A travel barrier to tourism recovery,2011-04-30,"SARS-CoV-2 infection of human airway epithelium activates genetic programs leading to progressive hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients. Here, we report on transcriptomes activated in primary airway cells by interferons and their suppression by Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Deciphering the regulation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is paramount for understanding the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ChIP-seq for activating histone marks and Pol II loading identified candidate enhancer elements controlling the ACE2 locus, including the intronic dACE2 promoter. Employing RNA-seq, we demonstrate that interferons activate expression of dACE2 and, to a lesser extent, the genuine ACE2 gene. Interferon-induced gene expression was mitigated by the JAK inhibitors baricitinib and ruxolitinib, used therapeutically in COVID-19 patients. Through integrating RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data we provide an in-depth understanding of genetic programs activated by interferons, and our study highlights JAK inhibitors as suitable tools to suppress these in bronchial cells.","Lee, Hye Kyung; Jung, Olive; Hennighausen, Lothar",Commun Biol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-02167-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079039/,276

METHODS: Online survey comprising a questionnaire related to the aspects of online teaching was undertaken. There were 16 questions, and responses were collected from undergraduates, postgraduates, and the teaching faculties. RESULTS: Online classes were viewed favorably by the vast majority of respondents. Out of 412 respondents 79.9% actively attended the classes. While 42% felt the timings were inappropriate as they clashed with duty hours, a set of 35% had difficulty understanding the content and most of them were undergraduates. Poor internet connection was a main hindrance identified. In total, 69.2% respondents were happy with the feasibility of the classes and believed these classes had the advantage of being economical as they offered exposure to national and international faculty from the comfort of their homes. CONCLUSION: Conducting online classes on a national scale is a herculean task for a developing country because of poor internet connectivity and deficient access to high-speed broadband services. Nevertheless, their popularity among students during the current crisis shows that it is a very pragmatic and feasible teaching option and can definitely supplement traditional classroom teaching.","Desai, Devanshi; Sen, Saswati; Desai, Sanjiv; Desai, Ranjana; Dash, Snehalata",Indian J Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_2049_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33120627/,276
680205,Multicenter Clinical Cancer Research After COVID-19: A Perspective From NRG Oncology,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND: No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao(2)) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao(2)) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio(2)) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, −5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, −17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.
