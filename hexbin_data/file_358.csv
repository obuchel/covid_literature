The mortality rate is high despite intensive supportive care. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying MODS are not entirely clear, although several have been proposed. Overwhelming inflammation, immunoparesis, occult oxygen debt and other mechanisms have been investigated, and – despite many unanswered questions – therapies targeting these mechanisms have been developed. Unfortunately, only a few interventions, usually those targeting multiple mechanisms at the same time, have appeared to be beneficial. We clearly need to understand better the mechanisms that underlie MODS. The endothelium certainly plays an active role in MODS. It functions at the intersection of several systems, including inflammation, coagulation, haemodynamics, fluid and electrolyte balance, and cell migration. An important regulator of these systems is the angiopoietin/Tie2 signalling system. In this review we describe this signalling system, giving special attention to what is known about it in critically ill patients and its potential as a target for therapy.","van Meurs, Matijs; Kümpers, Philipp; Ligtenberg, Jack JM; Meertens, John HJM; Molema, Grietje; Zijlstra, Jan G",Crit Care,358,12

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess research trend on insecticide resistance of Anopheles mosquito. In specific, number of publications, countries, institutions, and authors’ research profile, citation analysis, international collaborations, and impact of journals publishing documents on insecticide resistance will be presented. It was conducted via Scopus search engine which was used to retrieve relevant data. Keywords used were based on literature available on this topic. The duration of study was set from 1996–2015. RESULTS: A total of 616 documents, mainly as original research articles (n = 569; 92.37%) were retrieved. The average number of citations per article was 26.36. Poisson log-linear regression analysis indicated that there was a 6.00% increase in the number of publications for each extra article on pyrethroid resistance. A total of 82 different countries and 1922 authors participated in publishing retrieved articles. The United Kingdom (UK) ranked first in number of publications followed by the United States of America (USA) and France. The top ten productive countries included seven African countries. The UK had collaborations mostly with Benin (relative link strength = 46). A total of 1817 institution/ organizations participated in the publication of retrieved articles. The most active institution/ organization was Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Retrieved articles were published in 134 different scientific peer reviewed journals. The journal that published most on this topic was Malaria Journal (n = 101; 16.4%). Four of the top active authors were from South Africa and two were from the UK. Three of the top ten cited articles were published in Insect Molecular Biology journal. Six articles were about pyrethroid resistance and at least two were about DDT resistance. CONCLUSION: Publications on insecticide resistance in malaria vector has gained momentum in the past decade. International collaborations enhanced the knowledge about the situation of vector resistance in countries with endemic malaria. Molecular biology of insecticide resistance is the key issue in understanding and overcoming this emerging problems.","Sweileh, Waleed M.; Sawalha, Ansam F.; Al-Jabi, Samah W.; Zyoud, Sa’ed H.; Shraim, Naser Y.; Abu-Taha, Adham S.",Global Health,358,5

The internal granular layer of the MOB exhibited continual growth, increasing in volume by a factor of 63% over the range of ages studied. The sizes of MOB mitral cell perikarya and nuclei, expressed either as observed cross-sectional areas or as estimated mean volumes, did not change significantly as a function of age. The numbers of mitral cells exhibiting 2 nucleoli in the plane of section decreased from about 22% in the youngest animals to about 4% in the 18- and 30-month old animals and to nil in the oldest animals. These results are discussed in relation to findings of other investigators using Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rats.

Despite public health impact, the occurrence of coinfections with other viruses is a common event. Increased T cell activation and altered inflammatory response are found during DENV coinfection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) impacting HIV-pathogenesis. Even with Antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV- treated patients had chronic immune activation and lymphocyte apoptosis. However, apoptotic mechanisms have not been investigated during coinfection with DENV. Our attention was attracted to apoptotic cell markers expressions in PBMCs from DENV and DENV/HIV coinfected patients. We found CD4/CD8 ratio inversion in most coinfected patients. CD4 T and CD8 T-cell subsets from DENV and DENV/HIV groups expressed low levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Furthermore, CD8 CD95 double positive cells frequency expressing low levels of Bcl-2 were significantly higher in these patients. Additionally, the density of Bcl-2 on classical monocytes (CD14(++)CD16(−)) was significantly lower during DENV infection. Upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins were found in DENV and DENV/HIV, while catalase, an antioxidant protein, was upregulated mainly in DENV/HIV coinfection. These findings provide evidence of apoptosis triggering during DENV/HIV coinfection, which may contribute to knowledge of immunological response during DENV acute infection in HIV-patients treated with ART.","Torrentes-Carvalho, Amanda; Sánchez-Arcila, Juan Camilo; Azamor, Tamiris; Barbosa, Luciana Santos; Hottz, Eugênio Damaceno; Gandini, Mariana; Bozza, Fernando Augusto; da Cunha, Rivaldo Venâncio; de Oliveira Pinto, Luzia Maria; Damasco, Paulo Vieira; de Azeredo, Elzinandes Leal",Sci Rep,358,5

Aptamers are single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid or ribonucleic acid molecules and can selectively bind to varied targets with high affinity and specificity. Compared with antibody, aptamers have desirable advantages, such as flexible design, easy synthesis and convenient modification with different functional groups. Currently, different aptamer-based technologies have been developed to facilitate biomarker discovery, especially CELL-SELEX and SOMAScan technology. CELL-SELEX technology is mainly used to identify cell membrane surface biomarkers of various cells. SOMAScan technology is an unbiased biomarker detection method that can analyze numerous and even thousands of proteins in complex biological samples at the same time. It has now become a large-scale multi-protein biomarker discovery platform. In this review, we introduce the aptamer-based biomarker discovery technologies, and summarize and highlight the discovered emerging biomarkers recently in several diseases.","Huang, Jie; Chen, Xinxin; Fu, Xuekun; Li, Zheng; Huang, Yuhong; Liang, Chao",Front Cell Dev Biol,358,12

These allelic variants can be shared between or be specific to human populations. The current immunogenetics resources gather the germline alleles, however, lack the population specificity of the alleles which poses limitations for disease-association studies related to immune responses in different human populations. Therefore, we systematically identified germline alleles from 26 different human populations around the world, profiled by “1000 Genomes” data. We identified 409 IGHV, 179 IGKV, and 199 IGLV germline alleles supported by at least seven haplotypes. The diversity of germline alleles is the highest in Africans. Remarkably, the variants in the identified novel alleles show strikingly conserved patterns, the same as found in other IG databases, suggesting over-time evolutionary selection processes. We could relate the genetic variants to population-specific immune responses, e.g. IGHV1-69 for flu in Africans. The population matched IG (pmIG) resource will enhance our understanding of the SHM-related B-cell receptor selection processes in (infectious) diseases and vaccination within and between different human populations.","Khatri, Indu; Berkowska, Magdalena A.; van den Akker, Erik B.; Teodosio, Cristina; Reinders, Marcel J.

Several studies have been published to investigate the efficacy and safety of intravenous fluids in children. However, there is still an ongoing debate regarding the ideal solution to be used in the paediatric population. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the safety and efficacy of administering isotonic versus hypotonic intravenous maintenance fluid in hospitalised children. An extensive search was undertaken on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library on 28 December 2020. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. We used the random-effects model for all analyses. Risk ratio (RR) and mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. The quality of each study was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for RCTs. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021229067). Twenty-two RCTs with a total of 3795 participants were included. The studies encompassed surgical and medical patients admitted to intensive care unit as well as to general wards. We found that hypotonic fluid significantly increases the risk of hyponatremia at both ≤24 h (RR 0.34; 95% CI: 0.26–0.43, p < 0.00001) and >24 h (RR 0.48; 95% CI: 0.36–0.64, p < 0.00001). Isotonic fluid increases the risk of hypernatraemia at ≤24 h (RR 2.15; 95% CI: 1.24–3.73, p = 0.006). The prevalence of hyponatraemia was also higher in the hypotonic group at both ≤24 h (5.7% vs. 23.3%) and >24 h (6.0% vs. 26.3%). There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of developing adverse outcomes between the two groups. Mean serum and urine sodium as well as serum osmolality/osmolarity was lower in the hypotonic group. Isotonic solution is protective against the development of hyponatraemia while hypotonic solution increases the risk of hyponatraemia.","Hasim, Norfarahin; Bakar, Mimi Azliha Abu; Islam, Md Asiful",Children (Basel),358,5

To address this difficult scientific problem, we need to understand how transformations in social-ecological systems caused by multifaceted interactions with anthropogenic environmental changes such as urbanization, agricultural transformations, and natural habitat alterations, produce feedbacks that affect natural communities and ultimately their pathogens, animal host, and human populations. Focusing on the complex interactions among natural and human systems at diverse spatial, temporal, and organizational scales, we describe the development of a framework for analyzing social-ecological models, to understand how these systems function and the processes through which these systems interact with each other to influence disease outbreaks. To address multi-scale issues within the framework, we draw upon multiple social science theories and methods (e.g., environmental economics, geography, decision and risk science, urban and regional development, and spatial information science). We posit that the framework helps to identify potential vulnerabilities of CNH systems to disturbances, describing important elements as a starting point for the development and testing of more general CNH systems. We also posit that transformations in the elements and how they relate to each other are key in determining the robustness of CNH systems. Given the importance and difficulty of research on social-ecological systems, we recommend a carefully considered theoretical rationale and a model-guided methodological approach. We conclude that no single theory or method is sufficient to explain complex phenomena such as EID and the relationships between factors influencing disease outbreaks. Integrated approaches are arguably the best way to provide an in-depth description and analysis of a complex problem.","Finucane, Melissa L.; Fox, Jefferson; Saksena, Sumeet; Spencer, James H.",Understanding Society and Natural Resources,358,5

It is generally accepted that pancytopenia results predominantly from the increased phagocytosis and destruction of hemocytes in splenic macrophages. In addition, liver fibrosis is amplified by migrated Th2 lymphocytes and transforming growth factor beta from the spleen. There is a possibility that increase of the spleen stiffness is the primary factor of idiopathic portal hypertension. Spleen stiffness is caused by bleeding, fibrosis, and calcareous deposits after increase in red pulp pressure due to venous congestion. In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, macrophage activity in the spleen is upregulated. In addition, high levels of inflammatory cytokines are produced and T cell shows increased proliferation in the spleen. In autoimmune hepatitis model, CD4(+) T cells are differentiated into follicular helper T cells (T(FH)) in the spleen. T(FH) cells promoted hypergammaglobulinemia and antinuclear antibodies production. T(FH) cells migrate from the spleen to the liver, triggering induction of autoimmune hepatitis in this model.

Pathology is characterized by full thickness necrosis of the epithelial layer of the involved organ due to immune-mediated apoptosis of the resident keratinocytes. High suspicion for early detection and quick withdrawal of the culprit medication are the most important steps in stopping this reaction. Aggressive supportive care is often necessary as the patient recovers. Steroids, other immunosuppressants, and plasmapheresis have all been studied as treatments, but high-quality evidence supporting their contributions, either together or separately, in decreasing length of hospital stay or prolonging survival have not been consistently demonstrated.

Thus, continuous surveillance programs, including seroprevalence studies of disease in different countries, may contribute to better control of the disease. In this study, the seroprevalence of equine influenza in 850 horses from Brazil was investigated. The serodiagnosis was based on the single radial hemolysis (SRH) assay using influenza A/equine/Richmond/1/2007 (H3N8) antigen. Antibodies against A/equine/Richmond/1/07 (H3N8) were detected in 44.7% (380/850, 95% CI: 41.4–48.1%) of horses.

Although a pandemic of this nature was not unforeseeable, its arrival seems to have caught the world off guard, hurling us into a state of partly haphazard disaster mitigation. It has shed sharper light on the failure of global health in its current form to tackle acute and systemic challenges in a rapidly changing world, and the unequal patterns in society that leave us vulnerable. This commentary argues that, despite its devastating effects, the Covid-19 pandemic can be a longer-term positively transformative event for global health. However, this will require going beyond the development of more effective plans for health emergency preparedness, to confront the crisis in global health governance and leadership, and rethink the roles of key actors involved in world health. It ultimately calls us back to the very concept of 'global health': the values it should encompass, what we should expect from it and how we might envisage reshaping or 'co-creating' it for the future.","Casale, Marisa",Global public health,358,31

Venous sinus stenosis has been increasingly recognized as a treatable cause of elevated intracranial pressure in a subset of patients. In this article, we present the results of the largest meta-analysis of optic nerve sheath fenestration, CSF shunting, and dural venous sinus stenting. This is the only article that compares these procedures, to our knowledge. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a PubMed search of all peer-reviewed articles from 1988 to 2014 for patients who underwent a procedure for medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension. RESULTS Optic nerve sheath fenestration analysis included 712 patients. Postprocedure, there was improvement of vision in 59%, headache in 44%, and papilledema in 80%; 14.8% of patients required a repeat procedure with major and minor complication rates of 1.5% and 16.4%, respectively. The CSF diversion procedure analysis included 435 patients. Postprocedure, there was improvement of vision in 54%, headache in 80%, and papilledema in 70%; 43% of patients required at least 1 additional surgery. The major and minor complication rates were 7.6% and 32.9%, respectively. The dural venous sinus stenting analysis included 136 patients. After intervention, there was improvement of vision in 78%, headache in 83%, and papilledema in 97% of patients. The major and minor complication rates were 2.9% and 4.4%, respectively. Fourteen additional procedures were performed with a repeat procedure rate of 10.3%. Three patients had contralateral stent placement, while 8 had ipsilateral stent placement within or adjacent to the original stent. Only 3 patients required conversion to CSF diversion or 2.2% of patients with stents. CONCLUSIONS Patients with medically refractory idiopathic intracranial hypertension have traditionally undergone a CSF diversion procedure as the first intervention. This paradigm may need to be re-examined, given the high technical and clinical success and low complication rates with dural venous sinus stenting.","Satti, S R; Leishangthem, L; Chaudry, M I",AJNR.

Methods Patients presenting with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) due to ruptured BBAs and subsequently treated with FDs were retrospectively selected from June 2010 to January 2017. Treatment techniques, angiographic data on occlusion rates and procedural success as well as clinical outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were collated. Cross-reference of results were made with available literature. Results Thirteen patients harbouring 14 BBAs were recruited. Of the 14 aneurysms, five (35.7%) showed immediate complete occlusion after the procedure (four of these five patients had adjunctive coiling). All of the aneurysms showed complete occlusion by the six- to nine-month control diagnostic angiogram. No rebleed or retreatment was experienced. Twelve of 13 (92%) patients had an mRS score of 0-1 at the last clinical follow-up. From the pooled data of the literature review, eventual aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 48/56 patients, with five patients requiring further endovascular treatment. In the clinical follow-up period, an mRS of 0-2 was recorded for 83.3% (45/54) of patients. Conclusion Endovascular reconstruction of BBAs using FD treatment is an effective method with good final clinical outcomes. Adjunctive use of coiling achieves higher incidence of immediate complete occlusion of BBAs.","Yang, Cunli; Vadasz, Agnes; Szikora, István","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",358,28

A soluble form of EPCR (sEPCR) circulates in plasma and inhibits activated protein C (APC) activities. The clinical impact of sEPCR and its involvement in COVID-19 has not been explored. In this study, we investigated whether sEPCR levels were related to COVID-19 patients' requirement for hospitalization. METHODS Plasma sEPCR levels were measured on hospital admission in 84 COVID-19 patients, and in eleven (11) non-hospitalized SARS-CoV2-positive patients approximately 6 days after reported manifestation of their symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors for hospitalization and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess their value. RESULTS In our cohort, hospitalized patients had considerably higher sEPCR levels upon admission compared to outpatients [107.5 (76.7-156.3) vs. 44.6 (12.1-84.4) ng/ml; p < 0.0001)]. The ROC curve using hospitalization as the classification variable and sEPCR levels as the prognostic variable generated an area under the curve (AUC) at 0.845 (95% CI = 0.710-0.981, p < 0.001). Additionally, we investigated the predictive value of sEPCR combined with BMI, age, or D-dimers. CONCLUSIONS In our cohort, sEPCR levels in COVID-19 patients upon hospital admission appear considerably elevated compared to outpatients; this could lead to impaired APC activities and might contribute to the pro-coagulant phenotype reported in such patients. sEPCR measurement might be useful as a point-of-care test in SARS-CoV2 positive patients.","Vassiliou, Alice G; Keskinidou, Chrysi; Jahaj, Edison; Gallos, Parisis; Zacharis, Alexandros; Athanasiou, Nikolaos; Tsipilis, Stamatios; Mastora, Zafeiria; Dimopoulou, Ioanna; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Orfanos, Stylianos E",Shock,358,1

DESIGN A total of 194 patients who underwent unprotected carotid artery stenting (CAS) as well as diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) before and after intervention were retrospectively reviewed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three stent designs were studied: closed cell, semi-closed cell and open cell. Spearman's Rho test was performed between the stent free cell area and the number and area of ischaemic lesions found after intervention. Adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS There was no significant difference in clinical outcome between the three stent groups (Zilver, Cook Europe, Denmark; Smart, Codman, MA; and Wallstent, Stryker, MN, USA). A significant correlation was found between the stent free cell area and the number and area of new ischaemic lesions on DW-MRI (P = 0.023). There were significantly fewer new lesions with an open-cell design (Zilver; 12.76 mm(2) free cell area) than with a closed-cell design (Wallstent; 1.08 mm(2) free cell area). CONCLUSIONS Open-cell stent was related to a lower number and area of silent cerebral ischaemic lesions after unprotected CAS. However, clinical outcome, measured by incidence of adverse events and clinical neurologic assessment, was not significantly different between patients with different stent designs.","Grunwald, I Q; Reith, W; Karp, K; Papanagiotou, P; Sievert, H; Walter, S; Kühn, A L; Fassbender, K; Krick, C",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,358,1

Our objective was to evaluate the outcome of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and particularly rePTA in a failing arteriovenous fistula (AV-fistula). Are multiple redilations worthwhile? Patients and Methods. All 159 stenoses of AV fistulas that were treated with PTA, with or without stenting, during 2008 and 2009, were included. Occluded fistulas that were dilated after successful thrombolysis were also included. Median age was 68 (interquartile range 61.5-78.5) years and 75% were male. Results. Seventy-nine (50%) of the primary PTAs required no further reintervention. The primary patency was 61% at 6 months and 42% at 12 months. Eighty (50%) of the stenoses needed at least one reintervention. Primary assisted patency (defined as patency after subsequent reinterventions) was 89% at 6 months and 85% at 12 months. The durability of repeated PTAs was similar to the durability of the primary PTA. However, an early primary PTA carried a higher risk for subsequent reinterventions. Successful dialysis was achieved after 98% of treatments. Nine percent of the stenoses eventually required surgical revision and 13% of the fistulas failed permanently. Conclusion. The present study suggests that most failing AV-fistulas can be salvaged endovascularly. Repeated PTA seems similarly durable as the primary PTA.","Bountouris, Ioannis; Kristmundsson, Thorarinn; Dias, Nuno; Zdanowski, Zbigniew; Malina, Martin",International journal of vascular medicine,358,7

Recent advances in the understanding of AgN-DNA structures and optical properties have largely relied on detailed characterization of single species isolated by chromatography. Because most AgN-DNAs are unstable under chromatography, such studies do not fully capture the diversity of these clusters. As an alternative method, we use high-throughput synthesis and spectroscopy to measure steady state Stokes shifts of hundreds of AgN-DNAs. Steady state Stokes shift is of interest because its magnitude is determined by energy relaxation processes which may be sensitive to specific cluster geometry, attachment to the DNA template, and structural engagement of solvent molecules. We identify 305 AgN-DNA samples with single-peaked emission and excitation spectra, a characteristic of pure solutions and single emitters, which thus likely contain a dominant emissive AgN-DNA species. Steady state Stokes shifts of these samples vary widely, are in agreement with values reported for purified clusters, and are several times larger than for typical organic dyes. We then examine how DNA sequence selects AgN-DNA excitation energies and Stokes shifts, comment on possible mechanisms for energy relaxation processes in AgN-DNAs, and discuss how differences in AgN-DNA structure and DNA conformation may result in the wide distribution of optical properties observed here. These results may aid computational studies seeking to understand the fluorescence process in AgN-DNAs and the relations of this process to AgN-DNA structure.","Copp, Stacy M; Gonzàlez-Rosell, Anna",Nanoscale,358,1

Improving Primary Care After Stroke (IPCAS) is a novel primary care-based model of long-term stroke care involving a review of stroke-related needs, a self-management programme, a direct point of contact in general practice, enhanced communication between care services, and a directory of national and local community services, currently being evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). Informed by Medical Research Council guidance for complex interventions and the Behaviour Change Consortium fidelity framework, this protocol outlines the process evaluation of IPCAS within this RCT. The process evaluation aimed to explore how the intervention was delivered in context and how participants engaged with the intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Mixed methods will be used: (1) design: intervention content will be compared with 'usual care'; (2) training: intervention training sessions will be audio/video-recorded where feasible; (3) delivery: healthcare professional self-reports, audio recordings of intervention delivery and observations of My Life After Stroke course (10% of reviews and sessions) will be coded separately; semistructured interviews will be conducted with a purposive sample of healthcare professionals; (4) receipt and (5) enactment: where available, structured stroke review records will be analysed quantitatively; semistructured interviews will be conducted with a purposive sample of study participants.

METHODS This was a secondary analysis of prospective observational multicenter study of noncritically ill infants ≤60 days of age with temperatures ≥38°C and blood cultures (December 2008 to May 2013). The main outcome was time to positivity for bacterial pathogens and contaminants. RESULTS A total of 256 of 303 (84.49%) patients with positive blood cultures, and 73 of 88 (82.95%) with positive CSF cultures met inclusion criteria. Median time (interquartile range [IQR]) to positivity for blood cultures was 16.6 hours (IQR 12.6-21.9) for bacterial pathogens (n = 74) and 25.1 hours (IQR 19.8-33.0) for contaminants (n = 182); P < .001. Time to bacterial pathogen positivity was similar in infants 0 to 28 days of age (15.8 hours [IQR 12.6-21.0]) and 29 to 60 days of age (17.2 [IQR 12.9-24.3]; P = .328). Median time to positivity for CSF was 14.0 hours (IQR 1.5-21.0) for bacterial pathogens (n = 22) and 40.5 hours (IQR 21.2-62.6) for contaminants (n = 51); P < .001. A total of 82.4% (95% confidence interval, 71.8-90.3) and 81.8% (95% confidence interval, 59.7%-94.8%) of blood and CSF cultures showed bacterial pathogen positivity within 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS Among febrile infants ≤60 days of age, time to blood and CSF positivity was significantly shorter for bacterial pathogens than contaminants. Most blood and CSF cultures for bacterial pathogens were positive within 24 hours.

This article summarizes the results from comparative tests of combustion and gasification of two complex plastic wastes: a plastic reject (PR) from processing recycled paper and an automotive shredder residue (ASR). Calculated gasification efficiencies corresponded to about 80% and 60%, respectively. Gasification resulted in lower yields of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) compared to direct combustion. A two-stage process, including gasification followed by syngas combustion, reduced the emissions of HCl and PCDD/F in the flue gas to <1.4% and <0.2%, respectively, compared to the levels from direct combustion of the PR feedstock. Most of the PCDD/F (>99%) was captured along with particulate matter (soot) during gasification. The contribution to the toxic concentration of PCDD/F was mainly from the PCDF congeners. Fly ash particulate matter from ASR combustion contained a significant proportion of zinc, which thus constitutes a great potential for use in zinc recycling.","Weiland, Fredrik; Lundin, Lisa; Celebi, Mustafa; van der Vlist, Klaas; Moradian, Farzad",Waste management,358,9

Lewis the relationship between PNH and aplastic anaemia. When the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis Class A (PIGA) gene was identified by Taroh Kinoshita's group, jointly with him the Hammersmith group proved that PNH is caused in most patients by a single somatic mutation in the PIGA gene. At the same time, after Bruno Rotoli had spent a sabbatical at the Hammersmith, the 'immune escape model' for the pathogenesis of PNH was developed. Early this century, Peter Hillmen, formerly at the Hammersmith and now in Leeds, spearheaded the use of the complement-blocking (anti-C5) antibody eculizumab. This new medicine radically changed the management and the clinical course of patients with PNH. Recently a derivative of eculizumab with more favourable pharmacokinetics has been introduced. In view of the fact that these agents are associated with C3-dependent extravascular haemolysis, it is important that a number of inhibitors of the proximal complement pathway are now in the offing and may further improve the life of patients with PNH.","Luzzatto, Lucio; Karadimitris, Anastasios",British journal of haematology,358,30

The current research used the lens of life script theory to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze 374 first-person written accounts of accepted and rejected marriage proposals between men and women that were sampled from online forums. Rejected proposals were more likely than accepted proposals to violate the proposal script. Compared to accepted proposals, rejected proposals included fewer ritual elements and they often happened ""off-time."" Specifically, rejected proposals came earlier in the relationship, typically prior to the discussion of the topic of marriage by the couple, and rejected men sometimes proposed to ""save"" an unstable or abusive relationship that was headed toward dissolution. As with other important life transition events, audiences played an important role in many proposals. Rejected proposals were more likely to occur in public than accepted proposals, and when present, audience members often participated in the proposal by encouraging couples to follow the proposal script and by expressing dissatisfaction when the script was violated. Some audiences became hostile when the woman said ""no."" Also consistent with life script theory, couples evinced strong emotions during proposals, and confusion and anger were common emotional responses among rejected suitors. Indeed, 15% of rejected proposal accounts described intimate partner violence. Yet, about 30% of relationships continued after the rejection, sometimes for years. These and other novel results contribute to the science of close relationships, family psychology, life script theory, commitment, rejection, and social rituals.

Yet, for long time mechanical stress was not recognized as a primary stressor that perturbs protein structure and threatens proteome integrity. The identification and characterization of protein folding and degradation systems, which handle force-unfolded proteins, marks a turning point in this regard.

In 17 of ESRD patients, SrO2 was also monitored throughout hemodialysis. Finger systolic blood pressure and basic hemodialysis and laboratory data were collected. RESULTS Dialysis patients had lower brain and also hand SrO2 values at rest (51.5 ± 10.9 vs. 68 ± 7%, p<0.0001 and 55 ± 16 vs. 66 ± 8%, p = 0.03, respectively). Both values further decreased during the first 35 minutes of hemodialysis (brain SrO2 to 47 ± 8%, p<0.0001 and hand to 45 ± 14%, p<0.0001, respectively). The brain SrO2 decrease was related to the ultrafiltration rate, the hand SrO2 decrease to the finger pressure and to blood hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS Chronic dialysis patients suffer from tissue ischemia and that even worsens after the beginning of hemodialysis. This observation may contribute to the understanding of cognitive deficit etiology.","Malik, Jan; Kudlicka, Jaroslav; Lachmanova, Jana; Valerianova, Anna; Rocinova, Katarina; Bartkova, Magdalena; Tesar, Vladimir",The journal of vascular access,358,1

The radiological pattern on CT of the thorax most often allows us to make a diagnosis with varying levels of confidence, to optimize management. With a multidisciplinary team bringing the strengths of their individual domains of knowledge, clinical, radiological, histopathological and in many cases rheumatological, the level of confidence in making this diagnosis increases, often to the stage where the diagnosis is most often right, is concordant with the diagnosis achieved at histopathology and therefore obviates the need for lung biopsy which carries its own costs and risks of complications. Our study emphasizes the role of the Multidisciplinary team (MDT) in the management of DPLDs at a tertiary care referral center. MATERIALS AND METHODS Every case of DPLD presenting to our pulmonology department was discussed in an MDT meeting before subjecting them to any diagnostic intervention or therapy. A clinico-radiological diagnosis was made according to the 2002 ATS/ERS guidelines initially. Later an official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT statement on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 2013 ATS/ERS consensus for the classification and diagnosis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia was used. The concordance in our study was defined as the percentage of histopathological diagnoses that were identical to the clinico-radiological MDT diagnosis prior to the biopsy. RESULTS A total of 434 patients with DPLDs were evaluated. The MDT suggested biopsy for only 38.7% (168 / 434) patients since the pattern was very clear in 266 (61.3%) cases. As not all patients cionsented to undergo the biopsy procedure when recommended, histopathology was obtained in 102 patients. The histological diagnosis was concordant with the initial MDT diagnosis in 80.3% (82 / 102) of samples. On an individual basis CTD-ILD and sarcoidosis showed the best concordance (87%). In idiopathic NSIP cases, the histopathological diagnosis concurred in only 53.3% (8 / 15), out of which 8 were NSIP, 4 were UIP and 3 were reported as inadequate sampling on histopathology. CONCLUSION The MDT plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of DPLDs. Not every pattern requires biopsy confirmation. However, an iNSIP diagnosis by the MDT should probably be better confirmed by biopsy.","Murali Mohan, Bangalore Venkataraman; Tousheed, Syed Zulkharnain; Manjunath, Poojaramuddanahally Hanumantharayappa; Ravichandra, Malapaka Ramakrishna; Ranganatha, Ramanjaneya; Annapandian, Vellaichamy M; Kumar, M Hemanth; Chandrasekar, Sagar",The clinical respiratory journal,358,9

Sporadic associations between RV antigenemia and extraintestinal manifestations of RV infection have been observed. We examined the clinical severity of RV gastroenteritis in patients with and without RV antigenemia or RNAemia. METHODS Stool, serum and whole blood samples were collected from children seen with acute gastroenteritis in Tampere University Hospital and studied for RV using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Only exclusively RV-positive specimens were included into this study. The patients were divided into groups according to RV findings from stool, serum and blood specimens. Clinical manifestations were graded according to 20-point Vesikari scoring system. RESULTS Of 374 children, 155 (41%) had RV in their stools. Of these 155 children, 105 (67%) were found to have RV RNA in the serum; of those, 94 (90%) had also RV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antigen. Thus antigenemia occurred in 61% (94 cases) of RV-infected children all of whom had concomitant RNAemia. Neither antigenemia nor RNAemia were detected in 85 patients with non-RV gastroenteritis. Patients who had RV RNA and RV antigen in both serum and stools were more likely to have a higher level of fever and more severe vomiting than patients who had RV only in stools. G1 genogroup RV was more often associated with RNAemia and antigenemia than other genogroups combined. CONCLUSION Rotavirus antigenemia and viremia are commonly detected in children hospitalized for RV gastroenteritis and may be associated with increased severity of fever and vomiting.","Hemming, Maria; Huhti, Leena; Räsänen, Sirpa; Salminen, Marjo; Vesikari, Timo",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,358,16

Previous studies have largely focused on the ability of microtubule stabilization to inhibit the fibroblast migration and promote axon regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the effect of microtubule stabilization treatment on microcirculation reconstruction after SCI remains unclear. By using immunofluorescence, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment improved microcirculation reconstruction via increasing the number of microvessels, pericytes, and the perfused microvessels after SCI. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, rat brain microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes were subjected to glucose oxygen deprivation. By using flow cytometry and western blotting, we found that microtubule stabilization treatment inhibited apoptosis and migration of endothelial cells and pericytes but promoted proliferation and survival of endothelial cells and pericytes through upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), VEGF receptor 2, platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB), PDGF receptor β, and angiopoietin-1 after SCI. Taken together, this study provides evidence for the mechanisms underlying the promotion of microcirculation reconstruction after SCI by microtubule stabilization treatment. Importantly, this study suggests the potential of microtubule stabilization as a therapeutic target to reduce microcirculation dysfunction after SCI in the clinic.","Duan, Yang-Yang; Chai, Yong; Zhang, Nai-Li; Zhao, Dong-Mei; Yang, Cheng",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,358,17

Design: A three-wave longitudinal survey design. Methods: Australian and US residents (N = 601) completed self-report measures of social cognition constructs (attitude, subjective norm, moral norm, perceived behavioral control [PBC]), intention, habit, and physical distancing behavior on an initial occasion (T1) and on two further occasions one week (T2) and four months (T3) later. Results: A structural equation model revealed that subjective norm, moral norm, and PBC, were consistent predictors of physical distancing intention on all three occasions. Intention and habit at T1 and T2 predicted physical distancing behavior at T2 and T3, respectively. Intention at T2 mediated effects of subjective norm, moral norm, and PBC at T2 on physical distancing behavior at T3, and habit at T1 and T2 mediated effects of behavior at T1 and T2 on follow-up behavior at T2 and T3, respectively. Conclusion: Normative (subjective and moral norms) and capacity (PBC) constructs were consistent predictors of physical distancing intention, and intention and habit were consistent predictors of physical distancing behavior. Interventions promoting physical distancing should target change in normative and personal capacity beliefs, and habit.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2021.1968397 .","Hagger, Martin S; Smith, Stephanie R; Keech, Jacob J; Moyers, Susette A; Hamilton, Kyra",Psychology & health,358,1

All patients had occlusion or advanced stenosis of the superior vena cava due to cancer progression. RESULTS The technical success rate of the percutaneous translumbar CV port placement was 100%. The only complication related to port placement was bleeding in the right iliopsoas muscle seen on CT in one patient, but it stopped with conservative treatment. The mean initial device service interval was 125 days (range 6-448 days). Complications in the chronic phase occurred in two patients, one with catheter-related infection and the other with catheter breakage, for a rate of 0.44/1000 catheter days.

Epidemiological and decision models are important tools to estimate disease burden. The purpose of this study was to identify models to assess the burden of diseases attributable to SSBs consumption or the potential impact of health interventions. METHODS We carried out a systematic review and literature search up to August 2018. Pairs of reviewers independently selected, extracted, and assessed the quality of the included studies through an exhaustive description of each model's features. Discrepancies were solved by consensus. The inclusion criteria were epidemiological or decision models evaluating SSBs health interventions or policies, and descriptive SSBs studies of decision models. Studies published before 2003, cost of illness studies and economic evaluations based on individual patient data were excluded. RESULTS We identified a total of 2766 references. Out of the 40 included studies, 45% were models specifically developed to address SSBs, 82.5% were conducted in high-income countries and 57.5% considered a health system perspective. The most common model's outcomes were obesity/overweight (82.5%), diabetes (72.5%), cardiovascular disease (60%), mortality (52.5%), direct medical costs (57.35%), and healthy years -DALYs/QALYs- (40%) attributable to SSBs. 67.5% of the studies modelled the effect of SSBs on the outcomes either entirely through BMI or through BMI plus diabetes independently. Models were usually populated with inputs from national surveys -such us obesity prevalence, SSBs consumption-; and vital statistics (67.5%). Only 55% reported results by gender and 40% included children; 30% presented results by income level, and 25% by selected vulnerable groups. Most of the models evaluated at least one policy intervention to reduce SSBs consumption (92.5%), taxes being the most frequent strategy (75%). CONCLUSIONS There is a wide range of modelling approaches of different complexity and information requirements to evaluate the burden of disease attributable to SSBs. Most of them take into account the impact on obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, mortality, and economic impact. Incorporating these tools to different countries could result in useful information for decision makers and the general population to promote a deeper implementation of policies to reduce SSBs consumption.

However, due to the lack of an adaptive culture system, porcine ToV (PToV) has received less attention. In this study, we developed a novel serological detection method based on the PToV envelope spike subunit 1 (S1) protein for the first time, and compared it to an existing indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the nucleocapsid protein. By using the S1-based ELISA, we carried out the first seroepidemiological survey of PToV in China, assaying both-specific IgG and IgA responses in 1,037 serum samples collected from diarrheic pigs in eastern China. There was a relatively high incidence of seropositivity in pigs of different ages, especially one-week-old piglets and sows (78% and 43%), the former probably reflecting maternal antibodies. Furthermore, 3/20 (15%) of fecal samples collected from one PToV-seropositive swine herd in Zhejiang province tested positive by RT-PCR. The complete PToV genome was sequenced from one of these samples, and its phylogenetic relationship with other full-length PToV sequences available in GenBank was determined. Our data provide the first serological evidence for PToV infection in pigs from China, which will help elucidate the potential pathogenicity of PToV in pigs.","Qin, Pan; Yang, Yong-Le; Hu, Zhang-Min; Zhang, Yu-Qi; Mei, Xiao-Qiang; Liang, Qi-Zhang; Lu, Zongji; Wang, Bin; Chen, Ruiai; Huang, Yao-Wei",Transboundary and emerging diseases,358,31

Older adults who are dependent in ADLs and IADLs are also more likely to have poor muscle measures defined as low muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance, which further limit their ability to perform activities. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine if muscle measures are predictive of ADL and IADL in older populations. Methods A systematic search was conducted using four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and CINAHL) from date of inception to 7 June 2018. Longitudinal cohorts were included that reported baseline muscle measures defined by muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in conjunction with prospective ADL or IADL in participants aged 65 years and older at follow-up. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random effect model. Results Of the 7760 articles screened, 83 articles were included for the systematic review and involved a total of 108 428 (54.8% female) participants with a follow-up duration ranging from 11 days to 25 years. Low muscle mass was positively associated with ADL dependency in 5/9 articles and 5/5 for IADL dependency. Low muscle strength was associated with ADL dependency in 22/34 articles and IADL dependency in 8/9 articles. Low physical performance was associated with ADL dependency in 37/49 articles and with IADL dependency in 9/11 articles. Forty-five articles were pooled into the meta-analyses, 36 reported ADL, 11 reported IADL, and 2 reported ADL and IADL as a composite outcome. Low muscle mass was associated with worsening ADL (pooled odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 3.19 (1.29-7.92)) and worsening IADL (1.28 (1.02-1.61)). Low handgrip strength was associated with both worsening ADL and IADL (1.51 (1.34-1.70); 1.59 (1.04-2.31) respectively). Low scores on the short physical performance battery and gait speed were associated with worsening ADL (3.49 (2.47-4.92); 2.33 (1.58-3.44) respectively) and IADL (3.09 (1.06-8.98); 1.93 (1.69-2.21) respectively).

The screening of recombinant yeasts was followed by detection of the recombinant Cap (rCap) protein by Western blot, using sera from pigs naturally infected with PCV2. The rCap secreted protein was used without prior purification as a coating antigen in the ELISA test, with high discrimination between PCV2-positive and negative sera. These results reveal a high confidence in the specific immunoreactivity of the secreted antigen and show the antigenicity of the recombinant protein.

Recurrent aneurysms (n = 114) were significantly (P = 0.00) greater (11.12 ± 8.35 vs. 5.81 ± 3.44 mm) with a significantly (P = 0.00) greater neck (4.34 ± 2.26 vs. 2.90 ± 1.44 mm) than without recurrence. The rupture status of aneurysms significantly (P = 0.00) affected recurrence at follow-up. Significantly (P = 0.00) more aneurysms without recurrence were treated with advanced embolization techniques (81.0% vs. 62.3%) and got complete occlusion at the first embolization than those with recurrence (93.7% vs. 36.8%). In treating 43 recurrent aneurysms, stent-assisted recoiling was used in 48.8% in the first retreatment and 50% in the second and third retreatment procedures. Angiographic follow-up in 38 (88.4%) cases showed complete or near complete occlusion in 30 aneurysms, with the rest eight aneurysms experiencing a second recurrence (21.1%). Of the eight aneurysms with the second recurrence, five underwent the second endovascular retreatment, with complete aneurysm occlusion achieved in three cases (60%), near-complete occlusion in one (20%), and incomplete occlusion in one case at immediate angiography and six-month follow-up. Procedure-related complications occurred in three patients. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular retreatment of recurrent previously coiled aneurysms is safe and effective even though advanced embolization techniques are frequently involved especially for large and giant aneurysms.","Han, Yongfeng; Liu, Jian; Tian, Zhongbin; Lv, Ming; Yang, Xinjian; Wu, Zhongxue; Gao, Bu-Lang","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",358,20

METHODS This is a single center case series of patients with MM receiving the investigational drug belamaf. RESULTS All 12 patients included in this analysis who were treated with belamaf developed MECs that initially appeared in the peripheral cornea and progressed centrally with time. Cessation of therapy resulted in regression of the MECs first in the periphery then centrally. Microcyst-like epithelial changes recurred in all patients on retreatment. With prolonged therapy, eight patients developed corneal staining patterns suggestive of limbal stem cell dysfunction (LSCD).

When expressed in the infected cell, the HSV immediate-early protein ICP0 has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and interacts with the proteasome. The cell is first exposed to ICP0 during viral entry, since ICP0 is a component of the inner tegument layer of the virion. The function of tegument ICP0 is unknown. Deletion of ICP0 or mutations in the N-terminal RING finger domain of ICP0 results in the absence of ICP0 from the tegument. We show here that these mutations negatively influenced the targeting of incoming capsids to the nucleus. Inhibitors of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome the blocked entry of virions containing tegument ICP0, including ICP0 mutants that are defective in USP7 binding. However, ICP0-deficient virions were not blocked by proteasomal inhibitors and entered cells via a proteasome-independent mechanism. ICP0 appeared to play a postpenetration role in cells that supported either endocytosis or nonendosomal entry pathways for HSV. The results suggest that ICP0 mutant virions are defective upstream of viral gene expression at a pre-immediate-early step in infection. We propose that proteasome-mediated degradation of a virion or host protein is regulated by ICP0 to allow efficient delivery of entering HSV capsids to the nuclear periphery.","Delboy, Mark G; Nicola, Anthony V",Journal of virology,358,5

Bronchiectasis, the destruction and dilation of airways, is due to a variety of causes and is characterised by a self-perpetuating cycle of airway inflammation, infection and obstruction that results in substantial morbidity and mortality. Improved therapies that address these three components, and the diseases that both cause and result from bronchiectasis are required. AREAS COVERED In this review, we update our previous summary of the clinical features, pathophysiology and epidemiology of bronchiectasis among adults and children, highlighting the most recent advances in therapeutics. We discuss current treatment strategies and then identify key goals for future research on the causes and treatments of a variety of types of bronchiectasis. EXPERT OPINION Bronchiectasis remains an orphan disease with respect to the development of new therapies. There has been progress in the recognition and studies but further research is now required on the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of bronchiectasis in order to decrease its high burden. Such advances will require a concerted, global effort to coordinate studies of both the pathophysiology and potential treatments of this heterogeneous, chronic disease that affects people of all ages and demographics.","Chang, Anne B; Marsh, Robyn L; Smith-Vaughan, Heidi C; Hoffman, Lucas R",Expert opinion on emerging drugs,358,20

STUDY DESIGN Thirteen patients with cervical myoma were treated by LAVH combined with temporary endovascular balloon occlusion of the bilateral internal iliac arteries from September 2008 to October 2010. Preoperative evaluation of cervical myoma was made by ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional computerized tomographic angiography, and curative management was made by LAVH combined with temporary endovascular balloon occlusion of the bilateral internal iliac arteries. RESULTS Nine patients with extracervical myoma and 4 patients with intracervical myoma were successfully managed by LAVH combined with temporary endovascular balloon occlusion of the bilateral internal iliac arteries. For extracervical myomas, the median extirpated uterine weight was 591 g (range 360-1010 g). Median duration required for placement of balloon occlusion catheter was 60 min (range 47-69 min). Median surgical duration was 98.5 min (range 77-149 min). Median duration of endovascular balloon occlusion of the bilateral internal iliac arteries was 66 min (range 42-98 min). The median estimated blood loss was 355 mL (range 50-1950 mL). For intracervical myomas, the median extirpated uterine weight was 513 g (range 302-710 g). Median duration required for placement of balloon occlusion catheter was 63 min (range 42-76 min). Median surgical duration was 96.5 min (range 92-100 min). Median duration of endovascular balloon occlusion of the bilateral internal iliac arteries was 49 min (range 44-60 min). The median estimated blood loss was 210 mL (range 150-650 mL). Transfusion of preoperatively donated autologous blood negated the need for bank blood. There were no major interventional radiological and surgical complications in the present case series. CONCLUSIONS Temporary endovascular balloon occlusion of the bilateral internal iliac arteries is a feasible minimally invasive alternative to control hemorrhage during LAVH for cervical myoma.","Takeda, Akihiro; Koyama, Kazuyuki; Imoto, Sanae; Mori, Masahiko; Nakano, Tomoko; Nakamura, Hiromi","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",358,16

However, our understanding of COVID-19 outcomes in patients with CKD remains limited. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with and without CKD consecutively admitted with COVID-19 to three affiliated hospitals in New York City. Pre-COVID-19 CKD diagnoses were identified by billing codes and verified by manual chart review. In-hospital mortality was compared between patients with and without underlying CKD. Logistic regression was used to adjust this analysis for confounders and to identify patient characteristics associated with mortality. Results We identified 280 patients with CKD, and 4098 patients without CKD hospitalized with COVID-19. The median age of the CKD group was 75 (65-84) years, and age of the non-CKD group 62 (48-75) years. Baseline (pre-COVID-19) serum creatinine in patients with CKD was 1.5 (1.2-2.2) mg/dl. In-hospital mortality was 30% in patients with CKD versus 20% in patients without CKD (P<0.001). The risk of in-hospital death in patients with CKD remained higher than in patients without CKD after adjustment for comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), adjusted OR 1.4 (95% CI,1.1 to 1.9), P=0.01. When stratified by age, elderly patients with CKD (age >70 years) had higher mortality than their age-matched control patients without CKD. In patients with CKD, factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age (adjusted OR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.06 to 1.12]), P<0.001, baseline and admission serum phosphorus (adjusted OR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.03 to 2.1], P=0.03 and 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1 to 1.7], P=0.001), serum creatinine on admission >0.3 mg/dl above the baseline (adjusted OR 2.6 [95% CI, 1.2 to 5.4]P=0.01), and diagnosis of acute on chronic kidney injury during hospitalization (adjusted OR 4.6 [95% CI, 2.3 to 8.9], P<0.001). Conclusions CKD is an independent risk factor for COVID-19-associated in-hospital mortality in elderly patients. Acute-on-chronic kidney injury increases the odds of in-hospital mortality in patients with CKD hospitalized with COVID-19.","Akchurin, Oleh; Meza, Kelly; Biswas, Sharmi; Greenbaum, Michaela; Licona-Freudenstein, Alexandra P; Goyal, Parag; Choi, Justin J; Choi, Mary E",Kidney360,358,29

Accurate immediate assessment of therapeutic response post-ablation is critical to achieve favourable outcomes. The conventional technique of side-by-side comparison of pre- and post-ablation scans is challenging and hence there is a need for improved methods, which will accurately evaluate the immediate post-therapeutic response. Objectives and Significance This review summarizes the findings of studies investigating the feasibility and efficacy of the fusion imaging systems in the immediate post-operative assessment of the therapeutic response to thermal ablation in liver neoplasms. The findings could potentially empower the clinicians with updated knowledge of the state-of-the-art in the assessment of treatment response for unresectable liver neoplasms. Methods and Analysis A rapid review will be performed on publicly available major electronic databases to identify articles reporting the feasibility and efficacy of the fusion imaging systems in the immediate assessment of the therapeutic response to thermal ablation in liver neoplasms. The risk of bias and quality of articles will be assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool 2.0 and Newcastle Ottawa tool. Ethics and Dissemination Being a review, we do not anticipate the need for any approval from the Institutional Review Board. The outcomes of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Highlights Evaluation of the therapeutic response in liver neoplasms immediately post-ablation is critical to achieve favourable patient outcomes. We will examine the feasibility and technical efficacy of different fusion imaging systems in assessing the immediate treatment response post-ablation.

They are often of low malignant potential and rarely metastasize. While they frequently arise from the pleura, they can occur at any soft tissue site in the body. We present a case of a large (28 × 21 cm) malignant solitary fibrous tumor arising from the bladder serosa. In addition, the clinicopathologic features, differential diagnosis, cytogenetics and management of this rare disease are discussed, along with a review of the existing literature on this topic. CASE PRESENTATION An otherwise healthy 41-year-old Caucasian man presented with weight loss and progressive abdominal bloating. A subsequent computed tomography scan of his chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed a 26.8 × 21 cm intra-abdominal mass occupying most of his abdominal cavity. The inferior vena cava was compressed, and the mass extended inferiorly to his upper pelvis abutting the superior dome of his bladder. He underwent operative resection and the resected mass measured 28 × 21 × 18 cm and weighed 4.8 kg. The cut surface revealed a gray-white mass with an ill-defined whorled-like pattern, with randomly assorted tan fleshy nodules. A histologic evaluation revealed variable, alternating hypercellular and hypocellular areas, with areas of necrosis. The tumor cells varied from spindle to epithelioid within a hyalinized stroma. In the hypercellular areas, the tumor cells showed moderate atypia with high mitotic activity. The histological features combined with immunophenotyping were suggestive of a malignant solitary fibrous tumor that grossly appeared to be growing from the bladder serosa, specifically the intraperitoneal superior dome of the bladder. Our patient is currently eight months post-surgery without evidence of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Extrapleural occurrences of solitary fibrosis tumors are being increasingly observed. Malignant solitary fibrosis tumors of the urinary bladder, however, are very rare. As there are no pathognomonic features of malignancy, surgical resection is often both diagnostic and therapeutic, as was the case in our report.","Dozier, Jordan; Jameel, Zena; McCain, Donald A; Hassoun, Patrice; Bamboat, Zubin M",Journal of medical case reports,358,1

This study aimed to address the potentially important advantages of this surgical technique. METHODS Between April 2002 and February 2014, 90 patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomies, performed by a single surgeon. Of these, 45 patients underwent RPLTG and 45 patients underwent conventional laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (CLATG). Short-term outcomes were compared to evaluate the feasibility of RPLTG for gastric cancer. RESULTS There were several significant differences between the RPLTG and CLATG groups in short-term outcomes: the mean total operation durations were significantly longer in the RPLTG group (319.0 min) than in the CLATG group (259.0 min). However, the mean volume of blood loss, the degree of lymph node dissection, and the number of dissected lymph nodes did not differ between the two groups.

The aim was to evaluate the routine blood tests for diagnosis of COVID-19, determining the diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers to differentiate between patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS Clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays from adult patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (fever, cough and/or dyspnea) at hospital admission were reviewed. Patients were classified into two groups according to RT-PCR COVID-19: positive (COVID-19) or negative (NON-COVID-19). Diagnostic accuracy was determined by analyzing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the cutoff value. In order to reduce the number of false positives, the cutoff value with a specificity of 80% was considered. RESULTS Two hundred three patients (101 females, 102 males) with ages between 18 and 96 years (mean = 61.3) were studied. Ninety-four were COVID-19 and 109 were NON-COVID-19. Plasma ferritin level was the most accurate biomarker (AUC = 0.847 and 0.804 in women and men, respectively). The following diagnostic criteria for suspected COVID-19 were established with biomarker cutoff values to differentiate between COVID-19 and NON-COVID-19 patients: lymphocytes ≤ 1.0 x 109/L; eosinophils ≤ 0.02 x 109/L; ferritin > 125% of upper reference limit (URL); LDH > 125% of URL; hsCRP > 80 mg/L; and D-dimer > 1.2 mg/L. Sensitivity was 66%, 64% 62%, 46%, 43%, and 33% for ferritin, eosinophils, LDH, hsCRP, lymphocytes, and D-dimer, respectively. Of those determined to be COVID-19 patients, 91% met one or more of the diagnostic criteria with these blood biomarkers, and of the NON-COVID-19 patients, 47% did not met any diagnostic criteria. CONCLUSIONS Blood counts of lymphocytes and eosinophils, and plasma levels of D-dimer, LDH, hsCRP, and ferritin can be used to differentiate patients with and without COVID-19 and as a tool for diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 in adult patients at hospital admission.","Santotoribio, Jose D; Nuñez-Jurado, David; Lepe-Balsalobre, Esperanza",Clinical laboratory,358,16

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine during the early phase of the COVID-19 crisis. Failure of the telemedicine encounter was assessed in this study by 2 separate criteria: (1) an unplanned visit to the emergency department (ED) within 6 weeks of the telemedicine encounter and (2) a planned subsequent in-person encounter for inability to formulate a complete diagnosis virtually. The authors retrospectively identified all new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine in the orthopedic surgery department of an academic tertiary care center during the first 6 weeks of the COVID-19 response, from March 16, 2020, to April 26, 2020. The study cohort included 298 new patients treated by 41 providers. The mean age of the 298 patients was 48 years, and 59% were women. Two hundred encounters were performed with video, and 98 were performed with telephone only. Three (1%) patients presented to the ED within 6 weeks of their new patient telemedicine encounter, and 8 (3%) patients presented for a planned in-person encounter. The authors concluded that new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine were able to effectively direct patients to a variety of treatments and dispositions, with a low rate of unplanned presentation to the ED or need for supplementary in-person assessment.

This study aimed to examine stress levels and causal stressors for perceived stress and generalized anxiety in the Indian population related to the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 300 adults were invited to participate in the online study via snowball and virtual snowball sampling. They were requested to complete electronic survey forms for assessing perceived stress and anxiety, and questions related to psychosocial stressors. Frequency and percentage were used for categorical variables. One-way ANOVA test was applied to compare responses based on gender, level of education, employment, and place of residence. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result: In total, 257 out of the 300 invited, responded and completed the survey. Men accounted for 58% (n=149) of the respondents. Overall, 84% (n=217) of participants had moderate to severe levels of perceived stress and 88% (n=228) had moderate to severe levels of anxiety. Women, as well as those not employed, reported significantly higher perceived stress and anxiety, urban residents reported higher perceived stress, while level of education had no difference in terms of perceived stress as well as anxiety. Fear of contracting COVID-19 was the highest stressor followed by difficulties in executing a routine exercise schedule and worry about the future. Conclusion: The psychosocial impact of the nationwide lockdown on the Indian population has been high. Vulnerable groups for increased stress and anxiety include women, younger ages, and the unemployed. The stressors recognized include fear of contracting COVID-19, inability to execute a routine exercise schedule and worry about the future.","Wakode, Naina; Wakode, Santosh; Santoshi, John",F1000Research,358,16

Clinicians in clinical settings wherein the use of PCR for RVs is not a routine laboratory test for adult patients with acute respiratory illness (ARI) may question the clinical utility of such a national RV surveillance dataset in predicting RV outbreaks among their adult patients. We compared the KCDC data to the RV PCR data of adult patients who visited a tertiary care center. During a period of 108 weeks, a total of 6,955 (5,598 pediatric and 1,257 adult) patients underwent RV PCR tests for ARI; most of these tests were administered while the patients were admitted (n = 6,920; 99.5%). From the KCDC website, we collected the RV PCR test results of 22,540 patients. Three graphs of weekly positivity rates were made for adults, children, and the KCDC data per each RV, and these graphs were then compared with one another. Whereas RV outbreaks were coincident between the KCDC and the adult graph with respect to influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus, the same was not true for human bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus. However, a negative predictive value of the KCDC data in the prediction of the occurrence of an outbreak in the adult graph was high for the respective eight RVs (85-100%).

In aquaculture this frequently manifests in an animal welfare crisis, with fish increasingly farmed under high production, high stress conditions. These intense environments can result in fish stocks having a high susceptibility to infection, with parasites and associated disease one of the main factors limiting industry growth. Prediction of infection dynamics is key to preventative treatment and mitigation. Considering the climatic and technology driven changes facing aquaculture, an understanding of how parasites react across a spectrum of conditions is required. Here we assessed the impact of temperature, infection density and host species on the life history traits of Argulus foliaceus, a common palearctic fish louse, representative of a parasite group problematic in freshwater aquaculture and fisheries worldwide. Temperature significantly affected development, growth and survival; parasites hatched and developed faster at higher temperatures, but also experienced shorter lifespans when maintained off the host. At high temperatures, these parasites will likely experience a short generation time as their life history traits are completed more rapidly. A. foliaceus additionally grew faster on natural hosts and at lower infection densities. Ultimately such results contribute to prediction of population dynamics, aiding development of effective control to improve animal welfare and reduce industry loss.","Hunt, Rhi; Cable, Jo",Journal of thermal biology,358,27

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) Is there a BMI cutoff threshold that is associated with increased risk for PJI? (2) Is the risk of PJI increased in higher obesity classes? METHODS A retrospective study was conducted of all primary THAs and TKAs performed at one institution between 2006 and 2015. Overall 19,226 patients were eligible to be included in the study; 1053 patients were excluded as a result of incomplete data, resulting in a final cohort of 18,173 patients (8757 TKAs and 9416 THAs). PJI was defined using the International Consensus Meeting criteria. To ensure accurate followup, and because there is evidence to support the association between obesity and early infection, we identified PJI within 90 days of the index surgery. This relationship was examined separately for BMI as a continuous variable and for each BMI category as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (underweight ≤ 18.49 kg/m; normal 18.5-24.9 kg/m; overweight 25-29.9 kg/m; obese class I 30-34.9 kg/m; obese class II 35-39.9 kg/m; obese class III ≥ 40 kg/m). Analyses were performed with logistic regression, accounting for both patient and surgical risk factors. A BMI threshold was evaluated with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the Youden index. RESULTS The area under the ROC curve for BMI and risk of PJI within 90 days was only 0.58 (confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.63) suggesting such a cutoff was not much better than random chance. Among the BMI classes, patients with class III obesity (≥ 40 kg/m) were the only ones showing a higher risk for PJI within 90 days (odds ratio [OR], 3.09 [1.46-6.54]; p = 0.003). The risk of developing PJI was not greater for overweight (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.38-1.4), class I obese (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.57-2.0), or class II obese (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.52-2.2) patients. Underweight patients also demonstrated no increased risk for PJI (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 0.23-13.9). CONCLUSIONS The risk for infection increases gradually throughout the full range of BMI, but no threshold exists. Weight reduction before surgery may mitigate risk for infection for all patients with a BMI above normal. Of note, patients with a BMI > 40 kg/m carried a threefold higher risk for PJI and for these patients, the risks of surgery must be carefully weighed against its benefits.

The clinical benefit of FLT3 inhibitors in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia has been limited by rapid generation of resistance mutations, particularly in codon Asp835 (D835). We aimed to assess the highly selective oral FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS In this phase 1-2 trial, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with acute myeloid leukaemia who either were refractory to induction therapy or had relapsed after achieving remission with previous treatment. Patients were enrolled into one of seven dose-escalation or dose-expansion cohorts assigned to receive once-daily doses of oral gilteritinib (20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, or 450 mg). Cohort expansion was based on safety and tolerability, FLT3 inhibition in correlative assays, and antileukaemic activity. Although the presence of an FLT3 mutation was not an inclusion criterion, we required ten or more patients with locally confirmed FLT3 mutations (FLT3mut+) to be enrolled in expansion cohorts at each dose level. On the basis of emerging findings, we further expanded the 120 mg and 200 mg dose cohorts to include FLT3mut+ patients only. The primary endpoints were the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of gilteritinib. Safety and tolerability were assessed in the safety analysis set (all patients who received at least one dose of gilteritinib). Responses were assessed in the full analysis set (all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and who had at least one datapoint post-treatment). Pharmacokinetics were assessed in a subset of the safety analysis set for which sufficient data for concentrations of gilteritinib in plasma were available to enable derivation of one or more pharmacokinetic variables. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02014558, and is ongoing. FINDINGS Between Oct 15, 2013, and Aug 27, 2015, 252 adults with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia received oral gilteritinib once daily in one of seven dose-escalation (n=23) or dose-expansion (n=229) cohorts. Gilteritinib was well tolerated; the maximum tolerated dose was established as 300 mg/day when two of three patients enrolled in the 450 mg dose-escalation cohort had two dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 diarrhoea and grade 3 elevated aspartate aminotransferase). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events irrespective of relation to treatment were febrile neutropenia (97 [39%] of 252), anaemia (61 [24%]), thrombocytopenia (33 [13%]), sepsis (28 [11%]), and pneumonia (27 [11%]). Commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (92 [37%] of 252]), anaemia (86 [34%]), fatigue (83 [33%]), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (65 [26%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (47 [19%]). Serious adverse events occurring in 5% or more of patients were febrile neutropenia (98 [39%] of 252; five related to treatment), progressive disease (43 [17%]), sepsis (36 [14%]; two related to treatment), pneumonia (27 [11%]), acute renal failure (25 [10%]; five related to treatment), pyrexia (21 [8%]; three related to treatment), bacteraemia (14 [6%]; one related to treatment), and respiratory failure (14 [6%]). 95 people died in the safety analysis set, of which seven deaths were judged possibly or probably related to treatment (pulmonary embolism [200 mg/day], respiratory failure [120 mg/day], haemoptysis [80 mg/day], intracranial haemorrhage [20 mg/day], ventricular fibrillation [120 mg/day], septic shock [80 mg/day], and neutropenia [120 mg/day]). An exposure-related increase in inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was noted with increasing concentrations in plasma of gilteritinib. In-vivo inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation occurred at all dose levels. At least 90% of FLT3 phosphorylation inhibition was seen by day 8 in most patients receiving a daily dose of 80 mg or higher. 100 (40%) of 249 patients in the full analysis set achieved a response, with 19 (8%) achieving complete remission, ten (4%) complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery, 46 (18%) complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery, and 25 (10%) partial remission INTERPRETATION: Gilteritinib had a favourable safety profile and showed consistent FLT3 inhibition in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. These findings confirm that FLT3 is a high-value target for treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia; based on activity data, gilteritinib at 120 mg/day is being tested in phase 3 trials.

SL1 and SL2 are required for subgenomic RNA synthesis. The current study focuses on SL4, which contains two base-paired regions, SL4a and SL4b. A series of reverse genetic experiments show that SL4a is not required to be base paired. Neither the structure, the sequence, nor the putative 8-amino-acid open reading frame (ORF) in SL4b is required for viral replication. Viruses containing separate deletions of SL4a and SL4b are viable. However, deletion of SL4 is lethal, and genomes carrying this deletion are defective in directing subgenomic RNA synthesis. Deletion of (131)ACA(133) just 3' to SL4 has a profound impact on viral replication. Viruses carrying the (131)ACA(133) deletion were heterogeneous in plaque size. We isolated three viruses with second-site mutations in the 5'UTR which compensated for decreased plaque sizes, delayed growth kinetics, and lower titers associated with the (131)ACA(133) deletion. The second-site mutations are predicted to change either the spacing between SL1 and SL2 or that between SL2 and SL4 or to destabilize the proximal portion of SL4a in our model. A mutant constructed by replacing SL4 with a shorter sequence-unrelated stem-loop was viable. These results suggest that the proposed SL4 in the MHV 5'UTR functions in part as a spacer element that orients SL1, SL2, and the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS), and this spacer function may play an important role in directing subgenomic RNA synthesis.","Yang, Dong; Liu, Pinghua; Giedroc, David P; Leibowitz, Julian",Journal of virology,358,17

Interventions aimed at restoring gut microbiota have emerged as a potential therapeutic option in CKD. This review summarizes the current evidence on gut microbiota-targeted strategies in patients with CKD. RECENT FINDINGS A growing number of studies have shown that plant-based diets, low-protein diets, prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic supplementation, and constipation treatment may lead to favorable alterations in the gut microbiota. Current evidence suggests that the implementation of both plant-based and low-protein diets has potential benefits for the primary prevention of CKD, and for slowing CKD progression, with minimal risk of hyperkalemia and/or cachexia. The use of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics and laxatives may have beneficial effects on uremic toxin generation, but their evidence is limited for the prevention and treatment of CKD. Recent advances in diagnostic technologies (e.g., high-throughput sequencing and nanotechnology) could enhance rapid diagnosis, monitoring, and design of effective therapeutic strategies for mitigating gut dysbiosis in CKD. SUMMARY Plant-based and low-protein diets, prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic supplementation, and constipation treatment represent novel gut microbiota-targeted strategies in the conservative management of CKD, which could improve clinical outcomes in CKD.","Sumida, Keiichi; Lau, Wei Ling; Kovesdy, Csaba P; Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar; Kalantar-Zadeh, Kourosh",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,358,1

This study assesses the relationship between visible fractures on the top and bottom of core samples and the resulting hydraulic and mass transport properties of the core. We hypothesized that more visible fractures would indicate the presence of a well-connected fracture network, leading to greater hydraulic conductivity (K) values and earlier chemical breakthrough times. To test this hypothesis, water flow and bromide (Br-) tracer experiments were performed on ten, 16-cm diameter, 16-cm-tall samples of fractured Dows Formation till from central Iowa. Visually identifiable fractures were present on the top and bottom of every sample. Results indicate that the visual identification of fractures does not predict a connected fracture network, as some samples produced breakthrough curves showing rapid first arrival times and shapes characteristic of solute transport in a fractured medium, while others appeared similar to an unfractured medium. No correlation was found between the number of visible fractures and K (Pearson's r = 0.25), or Br- first arrival time (r = -0.33), but a strong negative correlation between K and first arrival time (r = -0.92). Results indicate that the sample volume was not large enough to reliably contain a connected fracture network. Thus, testing large volumes of till at the field scale coupled with fracture-flow modeling likely represents the best approach for estimating hydraulic and mass transport properties for fractured till.

HIV proteins such as Vif and Vpx mediate the degradation of the host proteins APOBEC3 and SAMHD1, respectively, through the proteasome pathway. However, whether deubiquitylating enzymes play an essential role in HIV-1 infection is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the deubiquitinase, USP21, potently inhibits HIV-1 production by indirectly downregulating the expression of HIV-1 trans-activator of transcription (Tat), which is essential for transcriptional elongation in HIV-1. USP21 deubiquitylates Tat via its deubiquitinase activity, but a stronger ability to reduce Tat expression compared to Ub-KO showed that other mechanisms may contribute to USP21-mediated inhibition of Tat. Further investigation showed that USP21 downregulates cyclin T1 mRNA levels by increasing methylation of histone K9 in the promoter of cyclin T1, a subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) that interacts with Tat and transactivation response element (TAR) and is required for transcription stimulation and Tat stability. Moreover, USP21 had no effect on the function of other HIV-1 accessory proteins, including Vif, Vpr, Vpx, and Vpu, indicating that USP21 was specific to Tat. These findings improve our understanding of USP21-mediated functional suppression of HIV-1 production.ImportanceUbiquitination plays an essential role in viral infection. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) reverse ubiquitination by cleaving ubiquitins from target proteins, thereby affecting viral infection. The role of the members of the USP family, that comprises the largest subfamily of DUBs, is largely unknown in HIV-1 infection. Here, we screened a series of USP members and found that USP21 inhibits HIV-1 production by specifically targeting Tat, but not the other HIV-1 accessory proteins. Further investigations revealed that USP21 reduces Tat expression in two ways. First, USP21 deubiquitinates polyubiquitinated Tat causing Tat instability, and second USP21 reduces the mRNA levels of cyclin T1 (CycT1), an important component of P-TEFb, that leads 56 to Tat downregulation. Thus, in this study, we report a novel role of the deubiquitinase, USP21, in HIV-1 viral infection. USP21 represents a potentially useful target for the development of novel anti-HIV drugs.","Gao, Wenying; Li, Guangquan; Zhao, Simin; Wang, Hong; Huan, Chen; Zheng, Baisong; Jiang, Chunlai; Zhang, Wenyan",Journal of virology,358,1

However, these symptoms can rarely be associated with internal carotid artery and vertebral artery dissections. We aimed to review five cases of postpartum cervical artery dissection and to review the clinical course of previously reported cases. METHODS Patients with postpartum dissections diagnosed at our institution since 2005 were identified through a database maintained by the senior author, and their clinical data were reviewed. Additionally, a literature search for previously reported cases was performed, and the clinical data in those reports were reviewed. RESULTS Five patients presented with cervical artery dissections within 6 weeks postpartum. Four patients had delivered vaginally and one delivered by emergent cesarean. Headache and neck pain were the primary presenting symptoms of all five patients. Four patients demonstrated neurologic symptoms, and one had development of stroke. Two patients had single internal carotid artery dissections, one patient had bilateral dissections of the vertebral artery, and two patients had dissections in the internal carotid artery and vertebral artery. All patients were treated with either anticoagulation therapy or antiplatelet therapy. Two patients required endovascular stenting. Four of five patients returned to neurologic baseline after treatment. A literature search yielded 27 previously reported cases, with similar clinical characteristics of older reproductive age, presentation days to weeks from delivery, and recovery to neurologic baseline in the majority of patients. CONCLUSION Postpartum cervical dissections are rare occurrences that require prompt diagnosis to prevent long-term neurologic deficits. Individualized management strategies include medical treatment (anticoagulation therapy, antiplatelet therapy, or anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy) and endovascular recanalization.","Kelly, Jeannie C; Safain, Mina G; Roguski, Marie; Edlow, Andrea G; Malek, Adel M",Obstetrics and gynecology,358,1

In this study, we simplified the procedure based on a surgical string fixing technique using a transorally inserted anvil (OrVil™; Covidien Ltd., Mansfield, MA, USA). METHODS From March 2012 to September 2013, 14 consecutive patients underwent simplified intracorporeal Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy using OrVil™ during laparoscopic total gastrectomy for gastric cancer at our hospital. Clinicopathologic characteristics and surgical outcomes of these patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS All of the procedures were successful completed with no complication or conversion to open surgery. The mean overall operative time was 193.8 ± 41.8 min, whereas the mean reconstruction time was 32.6 ± 4.6 min. The mean estimated blood loss was 105.7 ± 65.4 ml. The mean diameter of anastomosis measured by upper gastrointestinal contrast X-ray test at 1 month after operation was 2.3 cm.

These lesions, occasionally misdiagnosed as Leydig cell tumors (LCTs), are typically described in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited disorder of beta-oxidation with accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in various tissues, and a rare cause of primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI). TARTs have never been associated with X-ALD. CASE 1 DESCRIPTION: A 19-year old male, who had previously undergone bilateral enucleation of presumed LCTs, was referred to our unit. Follow-up scans showed persistent bilateral lesions compatible with TARTs. Biochemical exams revealed PAI but excluded CAH. A serum VLCFAs panel was consistent with X-ALD, with gene testing confirming the diagnosis. Histological revision of the previously resected testicular lesions was compatible with TARTs. Start of glucocorticoid replacement therapy was associated with a reduction of testicular masses. CASE 2 DESCRIPTION: A 26-year old X-ALD male was diagnosed with bilateral testicular lesions compatible with TARTs. These lesions increased after ACTH elevation following switch to modified-release hydrocortisone. Clinical and sonographic findings allowed for a ""watchful-waiting"" approach, avoiding unnecessary surgery. CONCLUSION These are the first cases reported of TARTs in patients with X-ALD-associated PAI. Testicular lesions in patients with an early onset of ACTH elevation, regardless of the cause, should always be thoughtfully investigated, as they may reveal themselves as TARTs. We suggest that all patients affected from chronic ACTH elevation of a young age of onset should undergo testicular ultrasound in order to evaluate the presence of these lesions. GRT in these patients might also help preserving fertility.","Tresoldi, A S; Betella, N; Hasenmajer, V; Pozza, C; Vena, W; Fiamengo, B; Negri, L; Cappa, M; Lania, A G A; Lenzi, A; Isidori, A M; Pizzocaro, A",Journal of endocrinological investigation,358,22

DESIGN Meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA) of 34 randomized controlled trials. PATIENTS A total of 3220 critically ill adults who received PPIs or H2 RAs versus placebo, control, no therapy, or enteral nutrition. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A systematic review was performed using a random effects meta-analysis with TSA according to a predefined protocol. Randomized controlled trials comparing PPIs or H2 RAs with either placebo, control, no therapy, or enteral nutrition alone were identified through a comprehensive search of the literature. Two blinded reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, risk of bias, and extracted data using Cochrane Collaborative methodology. The predefined primary outcomes were clinically important, overt, and any (clinically important plus overt) gastrointestinal bleeding. Secondary outcomes included pneumonia, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), and mortality. Subgroup analyses were conducted for the primary outcome by PPI or H2 RA use, intensive care unit (ICU) subtype, studies published after early goal-directed therapy (EGDT), the presence of risk factors for stress ulceration, and enteral nutrition use. Of the 34 trials included, 33 were judged as high risk of bias and 1 was judged as low risk. Use of SUP significantly reduced clinically important bleeding (risk ratio [RR] 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.76, p<0.001; I2 = 0%), overt bleeding (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39-0.76, p=0.0003; I2 = 53%), and any bleeding (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41-0.71, p<0.00001; I2 = 58%). TSA confirmed these findings. No significant differences in pneumonia, CDAD, or mortality were noted. Subgroup analyses revealed significant reductions in clinically important bleeding with SUP in neurosurgical patients (RR 0.37, p<0.05) but not in surgery/trauma or medical ICU patients with risk factors. SUP provided no benefit in studies published after EGDT. SUP significantly reduced clinically important bleeding regardless of the use of enteral nutrition (p<0.05). CONCLUSION This meta-analysis demonstrated that SUP use was associated with significant reductions in bleeding but not mortality.

This review aimed to identify HRH interventions to support lay and/or skilled personnel to improve SRMNH care quality along the continuum in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs). METHODS A structured search of CINAHL, Cochrane Library/trials, EMBASE, PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and HRH Global Resource Centre databases was undertaken, guided by the PRISMA framework. The inclusion criteria sought to identify papers with a focus on 1. HRH management, leadership, partnership, finance, education, and/or policy interventions; 2. HRH interventions' impact on two or more quality SRMNH care packages across the continuum from preconception to pregnancy, intrapartum and postnatal care; 3. Skilled and/or lay personnel; and 4. Reported primary research in English from LLMICs. A deductive qualitative content analysis was employed using the World Health Organization-HRH action framework. RESULTS Out of identified 2157 studies, 24 intervention studies were included in the review. Studies where ≥ 4 HRH interventions had been combined to target various healthcare system components, were more effective than those implementing ≤ 3 HRH interventions. In primary care, HRH interventions involving skilled and lay personnel were more productive than those involving either skilled or lay personnel alone. Results-based financing (RBF) and its policy improved the quality of targeted maternity services but had no impact on client satisfaction. Local budgeting, administration, and policy to deliver financial incentives to health workers and improve operational activities were more efficacious than donor-driven initiatives. Community-based recruitment, training, deployment, empowerment, supportive supervision, access to m-Health technology, and modest financial and non-financial incentives for community health workers (CHWs) improved the quality of care continuum. Skills-based, regular, short, focused, onsite, and clinical simulation, and/or mobile phone-assisted in-service training of skilled personnel were more productive than knowledge-based, irregular, and donor-funded training. Facility-based maternal and perinatal death reviews, coupled with training and certification of skilled personnel, positively affected SRMNH care quality across the continuum. Preconception care, an essential component of the SRMNH care continuum, lacks studies and services in LLMICs. CONCLUSIONS We recommend maternal and perinatal death audits in all health facilities; respectful, woman-centered care as a critical criterion of RBF initiatives; local administration of health worker allowances and incentives; and integration of CHWs into the healthcare system. There is an urgent need to include preconception care in the SRMNH care continuum and studies in LLMICs.","Negero, Melese Girmaye; Sibbritt, David; Dawson, Angela",Human resources for health,358,19

Current acute treatments for migraine in adolescents are mostly pharmacological and may have limited effectiveness, can cause side effects, and may lead to medication overuse. There is an unmet need for effective and well-tolerated treatments. Remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) is a novel acute treatment of migraine that stimulates upper arm peripheral nerves to induce conditioned pain modulation (CPM)-an endogenous analgesic mechanism. The REN device (Nerivio® , Theranica Bio-Electronics Ltd., Israel) is a FDA-authorized device for acute treatment of migraine in adults. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of REN in adolescents with migraine. DESIGN AND METHODS This was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study in adolescents (ages 12-17 years) with migraine. Participants underwent a 4-week run-in phase. Eligible participants continued to an 8-week treatment phase with the device. Pain severity, associated symptoms, and functional disability were recorded at treatment initiation, and 2 and 24 hours post-treatment. The primary endpoints of this study were related to the safety and tolerability of REN. The secondary endpoints were related to device efficacy and included the proportion of participants who achieved pain relief at 2 hours post-treatment and the proportion of participants who achieved pain freedom at 2 hours. The presented results reflect an interim analysis with subsequent stopping of the rest of the study. RESULTS Sixty participants were enrolled for the study; of these, 14 failed to meet the run-in criteria and 1 was lost to follow-up. Forty-five participants performed at least one treatment, of which 39 participants completed a test treatment with REN. One device-related adverse event (2%) was reported in which a temporary feeling of pain in the arm was felt. Pain relief and pain-free at 2 hours were achieved by 71% (28/39) and 35% (14/39) participants, respectively. At 2 hours, 69% (23/33) participants experienced improvement in functional ability. CONCLUSIONS REN may offer a safe and effective non-pharmacological alternative for acute treatment in adolescents.","Hershey, Andrew D; Lin, Tamar; Gruper, Yaron; Harris, Dagan; Ironi, Alon; Berk, Thomas; Szperka, Christina L; Berenson, Frank",Headache,358,1

Materials and Methods Biolog microbial identification system was used for determination of the pathogens which are responsible for this disease. Agar disk diffusion test and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were used to determine the antibiotic susceptibility of recovered isolates. Oxytetracycline (OTC) was used at a dose level of 100 mg/kg body weight for the treatment of diseased fish, and the OTC concentration in the serum samples was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results Fifteen Staphylococcus epidermidis and 11 Bacillus cereus isolates were recovered from the lesion of muscle, tail, eye, and heart blood. S. epidermidis isolates were sensitive to OTC, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, spiramycin, erythromycin (E), and florfenicol. B. cereus isolates were sensitive to all mentioned antibiotics except E. Based on the MIC test, all B. cereus isolates were sensitive to OTC with MIC ranging between <0.125 and 4 µg/ml and 11 S. epidermidis isolates were sensitive with MIC ranging between <0.125 and 8 µg/ml, while four isolates were resistant. Different degrees of degenerative changes were present in the hepatopancreas, posterior kidney, eye, and skin tissues of diseased fish. Conclusion Single intraperitoneal injection of long-acting OTC at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight was effective in termination of S. epidermidis and B. cereus infection in white sea bream (D. sargus) broodstock.","Ali, Nadia G M; Aboyadak, Ibrahim M; El-Sayed, Heba S",Veterinary world,358,1

Consistently, viral particles are seen inside platelets, and platelet activation markers are detected in viremic patients. In this article, we sought mechanistic insights into these virion/platelet interactions by examining how platelets endocytose, traffic, and are activated by a model virion. Approach and Results: Using fluorescently tagged HIV-1 pseudovirions, 3-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, and transgenic mouse models, we probed the interactions between platelets and virions. Mouse platelets used known endocytic machinery, that is, dynamin, VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein)-3, and Arf6 (ADP-ribosylation factor 6), to take up and traffic HIV-1 pseudovirions. Endocytosed HIV-1 pseudovirions trafficked through early (Rab4+) and late endosomes (Rab7+), and then to an LC3+ (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3) compartment. Incubation with virions induced IRAK4 (interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 4), Akt (protein kinase B), and IKK (IκB kinase) activation, granule secretion, and platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation. This activation required TLRs (Toll-like receptors) and MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88) but was less extensive and slower than activation with thrombin. In vivo, HIV-1 pseudovirions injection led to virion uptake and platelet activation, as measured by IKK activation, platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation, and mild thrombocytopenia. All were decreased in VAMP-3-/- and, megakaryocyte/platelet-specific, Arf6-/- mice. Similar platelet activation profiles (increased platelet-leukocyte aggregates, plasma platelet factor 4, and phospho-IκBα) were detected in newly diagnosed and antiretroviral therapy-controlled HIV-1+ patients. CONCLUSIONS Collectively, our data provide mechanistic insights into the cell biology of how platelets endocytose and process virions. We propose a mechanism by which platelets sample the circulation and respond to potential pathogens that they take up.","Banerjee, Meenakshi; Huang, Yunjie; Joshi, Smita; Popa, Gabriel J; Mendenhall, Michael D; Wang, Qing Jun; Garvy, Beth A; Myint, Thein; Whiteheart, Sidney W","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",358,31

The healthcare community is at the highest risk of infection and thereby prone to most distress. The aim of this study was to explore and evaluate the degree of depression, anxiety, and stress levels among medical college students during the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in February and March 2020, 3 weeks after the first reported COVID-19 infection was identified in Iran. All medical college students who entered clinical courses were eligible for the study. Depression, stress, and anxiety were evaluated in these students using the DASS-21 questionnaire. Participants were selected by using availability sampling. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1. Results The total number of participants was 207, with 143 males and 64 females. More than half of the participants (57.97%) were married. The mean duration of working experience among students with COVID-19 infection and experience in a medical ward was 3.00 ± 1.27 days and 17.40 ± 7.26 months, respectively. The majority of students had 2 or 3 days working experience with COVID-19 infection. The mean anxiety score of participants was 28.56 ± 4.68, the depression score was 29.36 ± 4.42, and the stress score was 28.99 ± 4.53. Our findings indicated that the mean scores of depression were at an ""extremely severe"" level, while stress and anxiety were at ""severe"" levels. The prevalence of ""severe"" symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety was 69.57%, 60.87%, and 99.04%, respectively. Conclusions There is a high prevalence of anxiety and depression among medical students who were exposed to COVID-19-infected patients. Our results highlight the need to establish psychological support programs, training, and self-care for medical college students in relation to mental health.

He/she is generally the first to be consulted, the one most familiar with the patients and their medical history, and is likely the first to be alerted in case of inadequate pain control or safety and tolerability issues. The family practitioner should therefore be at the center of the multidisciplinary team involved in a patient's pain management. The most frequent indications associated with chronic pain in family practice are of musculoskeletal origin, and the pain is often multimechanistic. Fixed-dose combination analgesics combine compounds with different mechanisms of action; their broader analgesic spectrum and potentially synergistic analgesic efficacy and improved benefit/risk ratio might thus be useful. A pain specialist meeting held in November 2010 agreed that the fixed-dose combination tramadol/paracetamol might be a useful pharmacological option for chronic pain management in family practice. The combination is effective in a variety of pain conditions with generally good tolerability. Particularly in elderly patients, it might be considered as an alternative to conventional analgesics such as NSAIDs, which should be used rarely with caution in this population.","Morón Merchante, Ignacio; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; van de Laar, Mart; Mellinghoff, Hans-Ulrich; Nalamachu, Srinivas; O'Brien, Joanne; Perrot, Serge; Raffa, Robert B",ISRN family medicine,358,1

Since the discovery of human stem cells, its use has revolutionised the development of in vitro models. This is because after differentiation, these cells have the potential to reflect in vivo cell phenotypes and allow for probing questions in numerous fields of the biological sciences. Moreover, the possibility to combine the advantages of stem cell-derived cell types with genome editing technologies and engineered 3D microenvironments, provides enormous potential for producing in vitro systems to investigate cellular responses to infection that are both relevant and predictive.

Yet more evidence of private insurers' profit-driven misbehaviors and of corruption among medical leaders continues to emerge. Misguided incentives and lax regulation encourages nominally nonprofit health care providers to mimic for-profits' misconduct, and rapacious investors own and control an increasing share of physicians' practices.

They can be used to identify and support nurses' contribution to high quality, safe, client care and are lacking in specialist intellectual disability nursing. In a national Nursing Quality Care-Metrics project for Irish intellectual disability services, a set of nursing quality care process metrics and associated indicators were established for intellectual disability services. METHODS A two-stage design approach was undertaken; a broad scoping review of the literature and a modified Delphi consensus process. The Delphi included a four round e-Delphi survey and a consensus meeting. Four hundred one intellectual disability nurses working in Ireland were recruited for the surveys and 20 stakeholders attended the consensus meeting. RESULTS From the review, 20 existing and 16 potential intellectual disability nursing metrics were identified for nurses to prioritise in the e-surveys. After the four survey rounds, 12 intellectual disability nursing metrics and 84 associated indicators were identified. Following the consensus meeting, these were reduced to 12 metrics and 79 indicators. CONCLUSIONS This first set of intellectual disability nursing process metrics and associated indicators has been identified for implementation in practice. These metrics while developed in Ireland have international relevance and their application and appropriateness in practice needs to be evaluated.","Doody, Owen; Murphy, Fiona; Lyons, Rosemary; Gallen, Anne; Ryan, Judy; Downey, Johanna; Sezgin, Duygu",BMC health services research,358,1

METHODS Retrospective chart review was performed on 12 patients found to have parasitic myomas between August 2000 and April 2008. The following data were systematically collected: surgery date; indications for surgery; number, dates, and types of prior surgeries; prior use of morcellation; and locations of parasitic myomas. Pathologic confirmation of all specimens was obtained. RESULTS Laparoscopic evaluation confirmed the presence of intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal myomas distinct from the uterus in 12 patients. Ten of the 12 patients had prior abdominal surgery. Eight patients had prior morcellation procedures; six performed laparoscopically, two performed by laparotomy. Three patients had multiple parasitic myomas, all of whom had a history of laparoscopic myomectomy with morcellation. The majority (14 of 15) of myomas were found in the pelvis, including two retroperitoneal myomas, one of which was embedded in the bladder. Six of 15 myomas were found along the gastrointestinal tract, and 1 of 15 was found in the upper abdomen. CONCLUSION Parasitic myomas may occur spontaneously as pedunculated subserosal myomas lose their uterine blood supply and parasitize to other organs. More parasitic myomas may be iatrogenically created after surgery, particularly surgery using morcellation techniques. With increasing rates of laparoscopic procedures, surgeons should be aware of the potential for iatrogenic parasitic myoma formation, their likely increasing frequency, and intraoperative precautions to minimize occurrence.

Chemo(immuno)therapies (CIT) have traditionally aimed to reduce tumor burden without fully understanding their effects on the immune system. As a consequence, CIT are usually associated with higher risk of infections, secondary neoplasms and autoimmune disorders. A better understanding of the biology of the disease has led to the development of therapeutic strategies which not only act against malignant B-cells but also reactivate and enhance the patient's own anti-tumor immune response. Here, we review the current understanding of the underlying interplay between the malignant cells and non-malignant immune cells that may promote tumor survival and proliferation. In addition, we review the available evidence on how different treatment options for CLL including CIT regimens, small molecular inhibitors (i.e, BTK inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors) and T-cell therapies, affect the immune system and their clinical consequences. Finally, we propose that a dual therapeutic approach, acting directly against malignant B-cells and restoring the immune function is clinically relevant and should be considered when developing future strategies to treat patients with CLL.","Moreno, Carol; Muñoz, Cecilia; Terol, María José; Hernández-Rivas, José-Ángel; Villanueva, Miguel",Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,358,1

Thus, we have developed and validated the sensor- and expert model-based laparoscopic training system, the iSurgeon. MATERIALS Participants of different experience levels (novice, intermediate, expert) performed four standardized laparoscopic knots. Instruments and surgeons' joint motions were tracked with an NDI Polaris camera and Microsoft Kinect v1. With frame-by-frame image analysis, the key steps of suturing and knot tying were identified and registered with motion data. Construct validity, concurrent validity, and test-retest reliability were analyzed. The Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) was used as the gold standard for concurrent validity. RESULTS The system showed construct validity by discrimination between experience levels by parameters such as time (novice = 442.9 ± 238.5 s; intermediate = 190.1 ± 50.3 s; expert = 115.1 ± 29.1 s; p < 0.001), total path length (novice = 18,817 ± 10318 mm; intermediate = 9995 ± 3286 mm; expert = 7265 ± 2232 mm; p < 0.001), average speed (novice = 42.9 ± 8.3 mm/s; intermediate = 52.7 ± 11.2 mm/s; expert = 63.6 ± 12.9 mm/s; p < 0.001), angular path (novice = 20,573 ± 12,611°; intermediate = 8652 ± 2692°; expert = 5654 ± 1746°; p < 0.001), number of movements (novice = 2197 ± 1405; intermediate = 987 ± 367; expert = 743 ± 238; p < 0.001), number of movements per second (novice = 5.0 ± 1.4; intermediate = 5.2 ± 1.5; expert = 6.6 ± 1.6; p = 0.025), and joint angle range (for different axes and joints all p < 0.001). Concurrent validity of OSATS and iSurgeon parameters was established. Test-retest reliability was given for 7 out of 8 parameters. The key steps ""wrapping the thread around the instrument"" and ""needle positioning"" were most difficult to learn. CONCLUSION Validity and reliability of the self-developed sensor-and expert model-based laparoscopic training system ""iSurgeon"" were established. Using multiple parameters proved more reliable than single metric parameters. Wrapping of the needle around the thread and needle positioning were identified as difficult key steps for laparoscopic suturing and knot tying. The iSurgeon could generate automated real-time feedback based on expert models which may result in shorter learning curves for laparoscopic tasks. Our next steps will be the implementation and evaluation of full procedural training in an experimental model.","Kowalewski, Karl-Friedrich; Hendrie, Jonathan D; Schmidt, Mona W; Garrow, Carly R; Bruckner, Thomas; Proctor, Tanja; Paul, Sai; Adigüzel, Davud; Bodenstedt, Sebastian; Erben, Andreas; Kenngott, Hannes; Erben, Young; Speidel, Stefanie; Müller-Stich, Beat P; Nickel, Felix",Surgical endoscopy,358,12

RECENT FINDINGS GBS is an acute inflammatory neuropathic illness with striking clinical manifestations and significant morbidity. A substantial proportion of patients with GBS do not respond to current immunomodulatory therapies (ie, plasma exchange and IV immunoglobulin [IVIg]), highlighting the need for new therapies. Prognostic models that can accurately predict functional recovery and the need for artificial ventilation have emerged. These models are practical, and online calculators are available for clinical use, facilitating early recognition of patients with poor outcome and the opportunity to personalize management decisions. Clinical and experimental studies have identified innate immune effectors (complement, macrophage lineage cells, and activating Fcγ receptors) as important mediators of inflammatory nerve injury. Two complement inhibitors are undergoing clinical testing for efficacy in GBS. SUMMARY GBS is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis in the United States and worldwide. New treatments for GBS have not emerged since the 1990s. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder has progressed, particularly over the past decade; as a result, new therapeutic agents targeting different components of the complement cascade are at advanced stages of clinical development.","Sheikh, Kazim A",Continuum,358,1

Amongst various plausible factors, impairment in immune functions is emerging as a critical regulator of known age-associated accumulation of SC. Immune cells dysfunctions with age are multi-faceted and are uniquely attributed to the independent processes of immunosenescence and cellular senescence which may collectively impair immune system mediated clearance of SC. Moreover, being functionally and phenotypically heterogenic, immune cells are also liable to be affected by senescence microenvironment in other tissues. Therefore, strategies aimed at improving immunosenescence and cellular senescence in immune cells can have pleiotropic effects on ageing physiology including the accumulation of SC. In this regard, nutraceutical's immunomodulatory attributes are well documented which may have implications in developing nutrition-oriented immunotherapeutic approaches against SC. In particular, the three diverse sources of bioactive ingredients, viz., phytochemicals, probiotic bacteria and omega-3-fatty acids have shown promising anti-immunosenescence and anti-cellular senescence potential in immune cells influencing aging and immunity in ways beyond modest stimulation of immune responses. The present narrative review describes the preventive and therapeutic attributes of phytochemicals such as polyphenols, probiotic microbes and omega-3-fatty acids in influencing the emerging nexus of immunosenescence, cellular senescence and SC during aging. Outstanding questions and nutraceuticals-based pro-longevity and niche research areas have been deliberated. Further research using integrative approaches is recommended for developing nutrition-based holistic immunotherapeutic strategies for 'healthy ageing'.","Sharma, Rohit; Padwad, Yogendra",Ageing research reviews,358,31

Keywords used in this review were as follows: 'emergency', 'disaster', 'disaster preparedness', 'disaster competencies', 'disaster nursing', 'disaster role' and 'nurse'. Seventeen (17) articles were selected for this review. FINDINGS Factors that increase preparedness for disaster response include previous disaster response experience and disaster-related training. However, it is widely reported that nurses are insufficiently prepared and do not feel confident responding effectively to disasters. CONCLUSION The findings of this review contribute to a growing body of knowledge regarding disaster preparedness in nurses and have implications for academia, hospital administration and nursing educators. The findings of this review provide evidence that could be used by nurse educators and nurse administrators to better prepare nurses for disaster response. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY The findings from this review place an emphasis on hospitals to implement policies to address lack of preparedness among their employees. Furthermore, this review highlights the benefit of further research and provision of well-grounded disaster exercises that mimic actual events to enhance the preparedness of the nursing workforce.","Labrague, L J; Hammad, K; Gloe, D S; McEnroe-Petitte, D M; Fronda, D C; Obeidat, A A; Leocadio, M C; Cayaban, A R; Mirafuentes, E C",International nursing review,358,1

Caval-aortic access refers to percutaneous entry into the abdominal aorta from the femoral vein through the adjoining inferior vena cava. BACKGROUND TAVR is attractive in high-risk or inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis. Available transcatheter valves require large introducer sheaths, which are a risk for major vascular complications or preclude TAVR altogether. Caval-aortic access has been successful in animals. METHODS We performed a single-center retrospective review of procedural and 30-day outcomes of prohibitive-risk patients who underwent TAVR via caval-aortic access. RESULTS Between July 2013 and January 2014, 19 patients underwent TAVR via caval-aortic access; 79% were women. Caval-aortic access and tract closure were successful in all 19 patients; TAVR was successful in 17 patients. Six patients experienced modified VARC-2 major vascular complications, 2 (11%) of whom required intervention. Most (79%) required blood transfusion. There were no deaths attributable to caval-aortic access. Throughout the 111 (range 39 to 229) days of follow up, there were no post-discharge complications related to tract creation or closure. All patients had persistent aorto-caval flow immediately post-procedure. Of the 16 patients who underwent repeat imaging after the first week, 15 (94%) had complete closure of the residual aorto-caval tract. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous transcaval venous access to the aorta allows TAVR in otherwise ineligible patients, and may offer a new access strategy for other applications requiring large transcatheter implants.","Greenbaum, Adam B; O'Neill, William W; Paone, Gaetano; Guerrero, Mayra E; Wyman, Janet F; Cooper, R Lebron; Lederman, Robert J",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,358,33

However, these studies were limited by underrepresentation of obese subjects. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between BMI and lipid profiles in a population of patients with a broad spectrum of BMI values. A case-control study was performed involving patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic Florida. Cases (BMI >30 kg/m(2)) were obtained from the obesity surgery database between August 31, 2000, and April 4, 2002. Controls (BMI ≤ 30 kg/m(2)) were obtained from a database of primary care physicians between May 1, 2004, and November 18, 2004. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between BMI and lipid fractions. Multiple linear regression was performed to assess the independent effect of BMI on lipid levels while adjusting for potential confounders and propensity scores. Six hundred thirty-seven patients were analyzed (females, n = 362, 57%). There was no association between higher BMI and LDL (r = 0.19 p = 0.07), a negative association with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL; r = 0.45, p < 0.001), and a positive association with the log transformation of triglycerides (r = 0.32, p = 0.005).Higher BMI was inversely associated with HDL and directly associated with TG. BMI showed no significant association with LDL. Although the association between BMI and both HDL and TG may be explained by insulin resistance, the lack of a significant association between BMI and LDL remains an unexpected finding that requires further investigation.","Shamai, Lior; Lurix, Einar; Shen, Michael; Novaro, Gian M; Szomstein, Samuel; Rosenthal, Raul; Hernandez, Adrian V; Asher, Craig R",Obesity surgery,358,11

With flexible endoscopy readily available in this setting, we sought to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of a transgastric natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) peritoneoscopy vs. laparoscopic exploration in the identification of intra-abdominal pathology in a porcine model. METHODS In this acute study, 15 pigs were randomized to demonstrate 0 to 4 pathologic lesions: small bowel ischemia (SBI), small bowel perforation (SBP), colon perforation (CP), and gangrenous cholecystitis (GC). Two blinded surgical endoscopists were allowed 60 min to perform NOTES or laparoscopy (LAP) to correctly identify or exclude each lesion. A prototype endoscope (R-scope, Olympus, Inc), which enables independent instrument mobility, was used in the NOTES arm. RESULTS When considering all lesions, LAP was more sensitive diagnostically than NOTES (77.4% vs. 61.3%) overall. LAP also displayed a slightly higher NPV compared with NOTES (79.4% vs. 70.7%). However, NOTES was 100% specific with 100% positive predictive value (PPV) compared with 93.1% and 92.3% with LAP, respectively. Individually, NOTES was found most sensitive with CP identification (87.5%) and least sensitive with SBP (37.5%). The sensitivity of NOTES for SBI and GC was 62.5% and 57.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The utilization of NOTES as a diagnostic tool may have an important role in the critically ill patient when operative intervention is highly morbid. Although it may be overall inferior diagnostically compared with laparoscopy, a positive identification was highly specific with a strong predictive value. Further investigation addressing an improved small bowel evaluation technique would be beneficial. A human trial of NOTES in the ICU utilizing the current technology would still initially mandate laparoscopic or open surgical confirmation and treatment.","Trunzo, Joseph A; Poulose, Benjamin K; McGee, Michael F; Nikfarjam, Mehrdad; Schomisch, Steve J; Onders, Raymond P; Jin, Judy; Chak, Amitabh; Ponsky, Jeffrey L; Marks, Jeffrey M",Surgical endoscopy,358,1

However, these data could help answer important questions in cancer surveillance and epidemiology research. Artificial intelligence (AI) data processing methods are capable of evaluating large volumes of data, yet current literature on their use in this context of pharmacy informatics is not well characterized. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate relevant publications within four domains (cancer, pharmacy, AI methods, population science) across PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library and included all publications indexed between July 17, 2008, and December 31, 2018. The search returned 3,271 publications, which were evaluated for inclusion. RESULTS There were 36 studies that met criteria for full-text abstraction. Of those, only 45% specifically identified the pharmacy data source, and 55% specified drug agents or drug classes. Multiple AI methods were used; 25% used machine learning (ML), 67% used natural language processing (NLP), and 8% combined ML and NLP. CONCLUSION This review demonstrates that the application of AI data methods for pharmacy informatics and cancer epidemiology research is expanding. However, the data sources and representations are often missing, challenging study replicability. In addition, there is no consistent format for reporting results, and one of the preferred metrics, F-score, is often missing. There is a resultant need for greater transparency of original data sources and performance of AI methods with pharmacy data to improve the translation of these results into meaningful outcomes.","Grothen, Andrew E; Tennant, Bethany; Wang, Catherine; Torres, Andrea; Bloodgood Sheppard, Bonny; Abastillas, Glenn; Matatova, Marina; Warner, Jeremy L; Rivera, Donna R",JCO clinical cancer informatics,358,26

We encountered a case in which direct stress on the aneurysm wall caused by residual blood flow at the inflow zone near the neck during the process of thrombosis after FD placement appeared associated with aneurysm rupture. The patient was a 67-year-old woman with progressive optic nerve compression symptoms caused by a large intracranial paraclinoid internal carotid aneurysm. The patient had undergone treatment with a Pipeline embolization device (PED) with satisfactory adherence between the PED and vessel wall. Surgery was completed without complications, and optic nerve compression symptoms improved immediately after treatment. Postoperative clinical course was satisfactory, but the patient suddenly died 34 days postoperatively. Autopsy confirmed the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by rupture of the internal carotid aneurysm that had been treated with PED. Although the majority of the aneurysm lumen including the outflow zone was thrombosed, a non-thrombosed area was observed at the inflow zone. Perforation was evident in the aneurysm wall at the inflow zone near the neck, and this particular area of aneurysm wall was not covered in thrombus. Macrophage infiltration was not seen on immunohistochemical studies of the aneurysm wall near the perforation. A hemodynamically unstable period during the process of complete thrombosis of the aneurysm lumen after FD placement may be suggested, and blood pressure management and appropriate management with antiplatelet therapy may be important.","Ikeda, Hiroyuki; Ishii, Akira; Kikuchi, Takayuki; Ando, Mitsushige; Chihara, Hideo; Arai, Daisuke; Hattori, Etsuko; Miyamoto, Susumu","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",358,31

STUDY DESIGN Historical cohort study. ANIMALS 333 client-owned dogs. METHODS Medical records from 1 private referral hospital were searched for dogs that underwent gastrointestinal surgery between November 1999 and October 2015. Cases were included if skin staplers were used to close linear gastrointestinal incisions. Information regarding preoperative, surgical, and postoperative factors was collected. RESULTS Complications were diagnosed in 8 of 245 (3.27%) dogs, including 3 of 245 (1.22%) dogs that died or were euthanized, 3 of 245 (1.22%) dogs with incisional dehiscence, and 2 of 245 (0.81%) dogs with attachment of a linear foreign body to the staples at the intestinal lumen. Dehiscence was noted at the enterotomy sites in 3 dogs at a mean time of 44 hours after surgery (SD ± 6.93). Two dogs presented with another linear foreign body that was attached to the staples in the intestinal lumen at postoperative days 24 and 42. The risk factors associated with incisional dehiscence included multiple gastrointestinal incisions performed in 1 surgery (χ2 , P < .001) and the presence of a linear foreign body (χ2 , P = .02253). No associations were detected between dogs' age, sex, weight, surgery time, indication for surgical intervention, surgery location in the gastrointestinal tract, or surgeon experience and incisional dehiscence. CONCLUSION Skin staplers provide safe and effective closure of gastrotomies, enterotomies, and colonotomies in dogs.

Eight Canadian landfills of various sizes and shapes in different climatic conditions are studied to quantify the spatial extent of their bio-thermal zone. Land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are examined with respect to different Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classes. Within 1500 m of the sites, LST ranged from 18.3 °C to 29.5 °C and 21.3 °C-29.7 °C for forest land and agricultural land, respectively. Linear regression shows a decreasing LST trend in forest land for five out of seven landfills. A similar trend, however, is not observed for agricultural land. Both the magnitude and the variability of LST are higher in agricultural land. The size of the bio-thermal zone is sensitive to the respective LULC class. The approximate bio-thermal zones for forest class and agricultural classes are about 170 ± 90 m and 180 ± 90 m from the landfill perimeter, respectively. For the forest class, NDVI was negatively correlated with LST at six out of seven Canadian landfills, and stronger relationships are observed in the agricultural class. NDVI data has a considerably larger spread and is less consistent than LST. LST data appears more appropriate for identifying landfill bio-thermal zones. A subtle difference in LST is observed among six LULC classes, averaging from 23.9 °C to 27.4 °C. Geometric shape makes no observable difference in LST in this study; however, larger landfill footprint appears to have higher LST.","Karimi, Nima; Ng, Kelvin Tsun Wai; Richter, Amy; Williams, Jason; Ibrahim, Hussameldin",Journal of environmental management,358,19

DESIGN A cross sectional study using electrocardiographic, prescribing, and clinical data from electronic health records to explore the relation between antidepressant dose and QTc. Methadone, an opioid known to prolong QT, was included to demonstrate assay sensitivity. SETTING A large New England healthcare system comprising two academic medical centres and outpatient clinics. PARTICIPANTS 38,397 adult patients with an electrocardiogram recorded after prescription of antidepressant or methadone between February 1990 and August 2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Relation between antidepressant dose and QTc interval in linear regression, adjusting for potential clinical and demographic confounding variables. For a subset of patients, change in QTc after drug dose was also examined. RESULTS Dose-response association with QTc prolongation was identified for citalopram (adjusted beta 0.10 (SE 0.04), P<0.01), escitalopram (adjusted beta 0.58 (0.15), P<0.001), and amitriptyline (adjusted beta 0.11 (0.03), P<0.001), but not for other antidepressants examined.

BACKGROUND COVID-19 has been especially devastating in aged residential care (ARC) facilities. In March 2020, when the threat became realised in New Zealand, one residential dementia care facility implemented a unique response to the imminent threat of COVID-19. Eight staff members made the decision to live on site during the lockdown, ensuring residents' risk of contracting the virus was significantly reduced as carers would not go outside of the facility. DESIGN A qualitative descriptive inquiry. METHODS Seven staff who chose to live-in, and the facility manager, participated in semi-structured, face-to-face interviews at the ARC. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic analysis approach. COREQ guidelines were adhered to in the reporting of this study. RESULTS An overarching motif which emerged from the findings was the articulation of an 'all in this together' attitude which fostered feelings of camaraderie and collaboration which enhanced the experience for staff individually, and as a group. Themes identified were as follows: (a) A 'safe' but challenging choice, (b) Benefits for the staff and (c) Positive outcomes for the residents. CONCLUSION This crisis inadvertently brought about an enhanced 'dementia-friendly', person-centred communal environment. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE This study identified themes that deepen our understanding of caring for vulnerable populations during a pandemic and beyond. Given the success of this 'live-in' innovation, consideration must be given to applying these findings more generally when planning care models for best outcomes for residents receiving rest home level dementia care.

METHODS A virus suspension of known concentration (with or without a soil load) was deposited onto stainless steel discs under wet or dry load conditions and exposed to defined concentrations of the disinfectant/cleaning agent for 1-, 5-, or 10-minute contact time using the quantitative carrier test (QCT-2) method. Virus inactivation was determined by plaque assay. RESULTS At an exposure time of 1 minute, sodium hypochlorite at 2,700 ppm was able to inactivate MNV-1 and FCV with a >5 log10 reduction. After 10 minutes, MNV-1 was inactivated by AHP at 35,000 ppm, whereas FCV was inactivated at 3,500 ppm. MNV-1 was not inactivated by QUAT at 2,800 ppm. A QUAT-alcohol formulation containing 2,000 ppm QUAT and 70% ethanol was effective in inactivating MNV-1 after 5 minutes, but resulted in only a <3 log10 reduction of FCV after 10 minutes.

Whether c-MET is also expressed in benign mesothelial reactions is unclear from the literature. To determine whether c-MET immunohistochemistry can separate benign from malignant mesothelial processes, we stained 2 tissue microarrays containing 33 reactive epithelioid mesothelial proliferations (E-RMP), 23 reactive spindle cell mesothelial proliferations (S-RMP), 45 epithelioid malignant mesotheliomas (EMM), and 26 sarcomatoid/desmoplastic mesotheliomas (SMM) for c-MET, and compared the results to immunohistochemistry for two established markers, BAP1 and methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP). Membrane staining for c-MET was evaluated using a 12 point H-score classified as negative (score 0), trace (score 1-3), moderate (score 4-6), and strong (score 8-12).

The H-score was >3 (moderate or strong) in 24/45 (53%) EMM. Addition of BAP1 staining to the c-MET negative/trace EMM increased sensitivity to 32/42 (76%), while similar addition of MTAP staining increased sensitivity to 33/43 (77%). No benign spindle cell proliferations showed staining compared to 10/26 (38%) positive SMM mesotheliomas, but only 4 (15%) SMM were classified as moderate or strong. We conclude that moderate/strong c-MET staining can be used to support a diagnosis of epithelioid malignant mesothelioma vs an epithelial reactive proliferation. c-MET is too insensitive to use for detecting SMM.","Ren, He Zhen; Cheung, Simon; Churg, Andrew",Human pathology,358,27

Respiratory viral infection`s frequency and clinical outcome in symptomatic children with cancer: A single center experience from a middle-income country. Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 653-659. In developing countries, acute respiratory tract infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children, particularly in pediatric cancer patients. A majority of these illnesses are precipitated by viral infections. In our country, studies were conducted on the single respiratory viral infection in a pediatric hematology-oncology unit; however, the analysis of respiratory viral infections in children with cancer is lacking. The present study aimed to provide analysis of multiple respiratory viral infections and clinical outcome in children with cancer who receive chemotherapy and show signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infections. During January, 2014 and January, 2015 children with cancer under treatment who presented with respiratory tract infections were assessed for viruses by using multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Specimens were collected by nasal swabbing at in-patient and out-patient clinics. Overall, 72 samples of respiratory tract infection episodes, collected from children with cancer were evaluated with the simultaneous detection of 20 respiratory viruses. A respiratory viral pathogen was obtained in 56.9% samples. Rhinovirus (24.3%) and co-infection with two viruses (19.5%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens. There were four (9.6%) samples of severe pneumonia. Patients with febrile neutropenic episodes and pneumonia were hospitalized and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other non-neutropenic and mild respiratory tract infections were treated with supportive care as outpatient procedures. There were no deaths. Because there are no effective antiviral agents for certain respiratory viruses, infection control and early diagnosis are crucial in preventing the spread of infection. Clinical findings and serological results of viral respiratory tract infections help us to accurately determine the treatment approach and avoid the unnecessary use of antibiotics.","Büyükkapu-Bay, Sema; Kebudi, Rejin; Görgün, Ömer; Meşe, Sevim; Zülfikar, Bülent; Badur, Selim",The Turkish journal of pediatrics,358,33

As of August 11, 2016, the virus has infected 1,791 patients, with a mortality rate of 35.6%. Although MERS-CoV generally causes subclinical or mild disease, infection can result in serious outcomes, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure in patients with comorbidities. The virus is endemic in camels in the Arabian Peninsula and Africa and thus poses a consistent threat of frequent reintroduction into human populations. Disease prevalence will increase substantially if the virus mutates to increase human-to-human transmissibility. No therapeutics or vaccines are approved for MERS; thus, development of novel therapies is needed. Further, since many MERS cases are acquired in healthcare settings, public health measures and scrupulous attention to infection control are required to prevent additional MERS outbreaks.","Fehr, Anthony R; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Perlman, Stanley",Annual review of medicine,358,31

However, little is known about this in the working-age population in Nigeria. AIMS To examine differences in mental health indicators (successful coping, stress and lowered self-esteem) among individuals within the working age of 18-65 years in Nigeria based on their age and self-perceived vulnerability to COVID-19. METHODS In a snowball sampling method, 345 participants (219 males and 126 females) of age between 18 to 65 years (mean age = 34.79, SD = 11.18) were recruited from 16 April through 1 May 2020, via online survey containing demographics and studied variables. RESULTS Age and self-perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 have significant separate influence on coping, stress and self-esteem. Younger individuals scored lower in coping and self-esteem; and higher in stress. However, individuals who scored low in self-perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 were higher in coping and self-esteem; and lower in stress. CONCLUSIONS Age and self-perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 are vital in determining levels of coping, stress and self-esteem among working-age population in Nigeria during COVID-19 pandemic.

Using the example of remdesivir, one of the most promising COVID-19 treatments, this paper traces back public contributions to different stages of the innovation process. Applying the Risk-Reward Nexus framework to the R&D of remdesivir, we analyse the role of the public in risk-taking and reward and address inequities in the biomedical innovation system. We discuss the collective, cumulative and uncertain characteristics of innovation, highlighting the lack of transparency in the biomedical R&D system, the need for public investment in the innovation process, and the ""time-lag"" between risk-taking and reward. Despite the significant public transnational contributions to the R&D of remdesivir, the rewards are extracted by few actors and the return to the public in the form of equitable access and affordable pricing is limited. Beyond the necessity to treat remdesivir as a global public good, we argue that biomedical innovation needs to be viewed in the broader concept of public value to prevent the same equity issues currently seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. This requires the state to take a market-shaping rather than market-fixing role, thereby steering innovation, ensuring that patents do not hinder global equitable access and affordable pricing and safeguarding a global medicines supply.","Wimmer, Sabrina; Keestra, Sarai M",International journal of health policy and management,358,19

Our primary objective was to determine success rates of tibial bone graft (TBG) in achieving mandibular union. Secondary objectives include determining factors that contribute to failure of TBG. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective Chart Review. METHODS Retrospective chart review between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2018. Patients who underwent a mandibulotomy or mandibulectomy with osteocutaneous free flap reconstruction were identified. Patients who were pursuing dental rehabilitation, subsequently diagnosed with mandibular nonunion and received a cancellous TBG were assessed. RESULTS The 15 patients meeting inclusion criteria were mostly male (67%), white (87%), and nonsmokers (67%) with a median age of 64 (IQR = 60-73). Successful union occurred in 13 of 18 (72%) TBGs and the majority (63%) had a partial union documented at the time of surgery. Five patients (83%) who initially had a mandibulotomy achieved union compared to 78% of those with osteocutaneous reconstruction (P = 1.0). Postoperative radiation did not affect rates of union: 80% for both (P = 1.0). Patients with osteoradionecrosis (ORN) achieved union in 67% of cases compared to 75% of cases who did not have ORN (P = .86). There were similar rates of union for those who required perioperative antibiotics for infection and those without infection (67% vs. 75%, P = .86). Dental rehabilitation was achieved in 55% of patients, most commonly dentures. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that TBG can be used to achieve union for patients with malunion after head and neck cancer reconstruction.

Healthcare workers are a vulnerable cohort for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to frequent and close contact to patients with COVID-19. Study design Serum samples from 316 healthcare workers of the University Hospital Essen, Germany were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and clinical data. Healthcare workers were grouped depending on the frequency of contact to COVID-19 patients in high-risk-group (n = 244) with daily contact to known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, intermediated-risk-group (n = 37) with daily contact to patients without known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission and low-risk-group (n = 35) without patient contact. Results In 5 of 316 (1.6%) healthcare workers SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies could be detected. The seroprevalence was higher in the intermediate-risk-group vs. high-risk-group vs. 2/37 (5.4%) vs. (3/244 (1.2%), p = 0.13). Four of the five subject were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR. One (20%) subject was not tested via PCR since he was asymptomatic. Conclusion The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers of a tertiary hospital in Germany is low (1.6%).

Brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA synthesis occurs in ≈70 nm, negatively curved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane invaginations induced by multifunctional BMV protein 1a. We show that BMV RNA replication is inhibited 80-90% by deleting the reticulon homology proteins (RHPs), a family of membrane-shaping proteins that normally induce and stabilize positively curved peripheral ER membrane tubules. In RHP-depleted cells, 1a localized normally to perinuclear ER membranes and recruited the BMV 2a(pol) polymerase. However, 1a failed to induce ER replication compartments or to recruit viral RNA templates. Partial RHP depletion allowed formation of functional replication vesicles but reduced their diameter by 30-50%. RHPs coimmunoprecipitated with 1a and 1a expression redirected >50% of RHPs from peripheral ER tubules to the interior of BMV-induced RNA replication compartments on perinuclear ER. Moreover, RHP-GFP fusions retained 1a interaction but shifted 1a-induced membrane rearrangements from normal vesicles to double membrane layers, a phenotype also induced by excess 1a-interacting 2a(pol). Thus, RHPs interact with 1a, are incorporated into RNA replication compartments, and are required for multiple 1a functions in replication compartment formation and function. The results suggest possible RHP roles in the bodies and necks of replication vesicles.","Diaz, Arturo; Wang, Xiaofeng; Ahlquist, Paul",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,358,7

Therefore, estimating their vaccine confidence levels and gauging their intention to vaccinate ahead of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out was imperative. Methods An online survey was conducted among current staff and students of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of Stellenbosch University in South Africa using a succinct questionnaire. Sentiments about vaccines were estimated using five validated statements. The intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was also investigated. Results The response rate was 21.8%, giving a sample size of 1015. Females were 70.0% in the source population and 74.7% in the study sample. The proportion of participants who agreed that vaccines are important for children and for self was 97.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96.1% to 98.3%) and 95.4% (95% CI 93.9 to 96.6) respectively. In addition, 95.4% (95% CI 93.8 to 96.6) agreed that vaccines are safe, 97.4% (95% CI 96.15 to 98.28) that vaccines are effective, and 96.1% (95% CI 94.6 to 97.2) that vaccines are compatible with their religious beliefs. The proportion of participants who were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was 89.5% (95% CI 87.2 to 91.4). Log binomial regression revealed statistically significant positive associations between the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and the belief that vaccines are safe (relative risk [RR] =32.2, CI 4.67 to 221.89); effective (RR=21.4, CI 3.16 to 145.82); important for children (RR=3.5, CI 1.78 to 6.99); important for self (RR=18.5, CI 4.78 to 71.12) or compatible with their religious beliefs (RR=2.2, CI 1.46 to 3.78). Conclusion Vaccine confidence levels of the study respondents were highly positive. Nevertheless, this could be further enhanced by targeted interventions.","Oduwole, E.

PTX3 was recently described as one of the most reliable serological predictors of clinical deterioration and short-term mortality. The present study was designed to evaluate a correlation between serological biomarkers of inflammation and lung injury measured by QCT. Methods This retrospective monocentric study analysed a cohort of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted because of respiratory failure, or significant radiological involvement on chest CT scan. All patients, males and non-pregnant females older than 18 years, underwent chest CT scan and laboratory testing at admission. Exclusion criteria were defined by concurrent acute pathological processes and ongoing specific treatments which could interfere with immune activity. The cohort was stratified based on severity in mild and severe forms. Compromised lung at QCT was then correlated to serological biomarkers representative of Sars-CoV-2. We further developed a multivariable logistic model to predict CT data and clinical deterioration based on a specific molecular signature. Internal cross-validation led to evaluate discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility of the tool that was provided by a score to simplify its application. Findings 592 patients were recruited between March 19th and December 1st, 2020. Applying exclusion criteria which consider confounders, the cohort resulted in 366 individuals characterized by 177 mild and 189 severe forms. In our predictive model, blood levels of PTX3, CRP and LDH were found to correlate with QCT values in mild COVID-19 disease. A signature of these three biomarkers had a high predictive accuracy in detecting compromised lungs as assessed by QCT. The score was elaborated and resulted representative of lung CT damage leading to clinical deterioration and oxygen need in mild disease. Interpretation The LDH, PTX3, CRP blood signature can serve as a strong correlate of compromised lung in COVID-19, possibly integrating cellular damage, systemic inflammation, myeloid and endothelial cell activation.","Folci, M.; Brunetta, E.; Lanza, E.; Bottazzi, B.; Protti, A.; Messana, G.; Lisi, C.; Leone, R.; Sironi, M.; Generali, E.; Rodolfi, S.; Sagasta, M.; Voza, A.; Ciccarelli, M.; Garlanda, C.; Balzarini, L.; Mantovani, A.; Cecconi, M.; Force, Humanitas COVID-19 Task",,358,5

Also, it differs from one sensor to another. Hence, it is essential to evaluate HR detection algorithms across several datasets and under different experimental setups. In this paper, we studied the potential of three HR detection algorithms across four independent BCG datasets. The three algorithms are as follows: the multiresolution analysis of the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT-MRA), continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and template matching (TM). The four datasets were obtained using a microbend fiber optic sensor, a fiber Bragg grating sensor, electromechanical films, and load cells, respectively. The datasets were gathered from: a) 10 patients during a polysomnography study, b) 50 subjects in a sitting position, c) 10 subjects in a sleeping position, and d) 40 subjects in a sleeping position. Overall, CWT with derivative of Gaussian provided superior results compared with the MODWT-MRA, CWT (frequency B-spline), and CWT (Shannon). That said, a BCG template was constructed from DataSet1. Then, it was used for HR detection in the other datasets. The TM method achieved satisfactory results for DataSet2 and DataSet3, but it did not detect the HR of two subjects in DataSet4. The proposed methods were implemented on a Raspberry Pi. As a result, the average time required to analyze a 30-second BCG signal was less than one second for all methods. Yet, the MODWT-MRA had the highest performance with an average time of 0.04 seconds.","Sadek, Ibrahim; Abdulrazak, Bessam",,358,11

The model successfully fits 86% of BATSE GRB pulses bright enough for structure properties to be measured. Surprisingly, a GRB pulse's light curve morphology can be accurately predicted by the pulse asymmetry and the stretching/compression needed to align the structural components preceding the temporal mirror with the time-reversed components following it. Such a prediction is only possible because GRB pulses exhibit temporal symmetry. Time-asymmetric pulses include FREDs, rollercoaster pulses, and asymmetric u-pulses, while time-symmetric pulses include u-pulses and crowns. Each morphological type is characterized by specific asymmetries, stretching parameters, durations, and alignments between the smooth and structured components, and a delineation in the asymmetry/stretching distribution suggests that symmetric pulses and asymmetric pulses may belong to separate populations. Furthermore, pulses belonging to the short GRB class exhibit similar morphologies to the long GRB class, but appear to simply occur on shorter timescales.","Hakkila, Jon",,358,7

Here we present an integrated approach of single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM), computational modeling, and site-specific mass-spectrometry (MS) to probe glycan shield structure and behavior at multiple levels. We found that dynamics lead to an extensive network of inter-glycan interactions that drive the formation of higher-order structure within the glycan shield. This structure defines diffuse boundaries between buried and exposed protein surface and creates a mapping of potentially immunogenic sites on Env. Analysis of Env expressed in different cell lines revealed how cryo-EM can detect subtle changes in glycan occupancy, composition, and dynamics that impact glycan shield structure and epitope accessibility. Importantly, this identified unforeseen changes in the glycan shield of Env obtained from expression in the same CHO cell line used for GMP production. Finally, by capturing the enzymatic deglycosylation of Env in a time-resolved manner we found that highly connected glycan clusters are resistant to digestion and help stabilize the pre-fusion trimer, suggesting the glycan shield may function beyond immune evasion. Significance Statement The HIV-1 Env “glycan shield” masks the surface of the protein from immune recognition, yet intrinsic heterogeneity defies a typical structure-function description. Using a complementary approach of cryo-EM, computational modeling, and mass-spectrometry we show how heterogeneity and dynamics affect glycan shield structure across scales. Our combined approach facilitated the development of new cryo-EM data analysis methods and allowed for validation of models against experiment. Comparison of Env across a range of glycosylation states revealed how subtle differences in composition impact glycan shield structure and affect the accessibility of epitopes on the surface. Finally, time-resolved cryo-EM experiments uncovered how highly connected glycan clusters help stabilize the pre-fusion trimer, suggesting the glycan shield may function beyond immune evasion.","Berndsen, Zachary T.; Chakraborty, Srirupa; Wang, Xiaoning; Cottrell, Christopher A.; Torres, Jonathan L.; Diedrich, Jolene K.; López, Cesar A.; Yates, John R.; van Gils, Marit J.; Paulson, James C.; Gnanakaran, S; Ward, Andrew B.",bioRxiv,358,16

One of the possible solutions to these problems is to introduce biophilic design. Among the elements of this design, green walls are often favored due to their spatial efficiency. This study investigated the effectiveness of green walls in relieving stress indoors. First, the stress level of the occupants of an indoor space that has green walls was measured. Then their psychological and physiological responses to the green walls were analyzed. To this end, using virtual reality, an experimental condition was set up in which a green wall was installed, and the stress level of the subjects was analyzed based on their state-trait anxiety (STAI), heart rate variability, electrodermal activity (EDA), and electroencephalogram (EEG). Twenty-seven subjects were recruited and the changes in their psychological and physiological responses when their environment changed from a non-green wall condition to a small to large green wall condition were measured. The results showed statistically significant differences in STAI, EDA, the relative alpha power in the parietal and occipital lobes, mental stress, and mental fatigue. Ultimately, the small green wall had a more significant relaxing effect. On the other hand, in the indoor space with a large green wall, the stress level of the residents increased. Thus, when installing a green wall in an indoor space, a small green wall is proposed.","Yeom, Seungkeun Kim Hakpyeong Hong Taehoon",Building and Environment,358,16

Schools engagement programmes in science from universities, like independent research projects, which could try and tackle these problems are, however, often inequitable. We evaluate these concerns applied to one such programme, `Physics Research in School Environments' (PRiSE), which features projects in space science, astronomy, and particle physics. Comparing the schools involved with PRiSE to those of other similar schemes and UK national statistics, we find that PRiSE has engaged a much more diverse set of schools with significantly more disadvantaged groups than is typical. While drop-off occurs within the protracted programme, we find no evidence of systematic biases present. The majority of schools that complete projects return for multiple years of the programme, with this repeated buy-in from schools again being unpatterned by typical societal inequalities. Therefore, schools' ability to succeed at independent research projects appears independent of background within the PRiSE framework. Qualitative feedback from teachers show that the diversity and equity of the programme, which they attribute to the level of support offered through PRiSE's framework, is valued and they have highlighted further ways of making the projects potentially even more accessible. Researcher-involvement, uncommon in many other programmes, along with teacher engagement and communication are found to be key elements to success in independent research projects overall.","Archer, Martin O.",,358,33

This study aimed at exploring the impact of digital social stories in improving social skills of two students with ASD in the UAE. Design/methodology/approach An experimental AB single-subject study was conducted to investigate the impact of digital social stories on nonverbal communication, targeting two specific behaviors: raising hands before leaving one's seat (TB1) and playing and sharing toys with peers (TB2). Two digital social stories (DSS1 and DSS2) were developed for the purpose of this study and transformed using a digital platform to be displayed on an iPad (tablet). Findings This study involved two male participants with ASD (10 and 11 years old). Participant one demonstrated improvement in TB1 (mean of 1.11) because of DSS1 in the intervention phase. Participant two demonstrated improvement of 18% in TB2 ( mean of 0.18) as a result of DSS2 in the intervention phase.

The aim of this study was to quantify the degree to which COVID-19 impacted ED visits for adult and pediatric dermatologic conditions. A descriptive study was performed using TriNetX, a national federated real time database of 69 million records. Common dermatologic conditions were identified a priori via ICD-10 codes. The prevalence of adult and pediatric ED encounters (EDE) with each skin condition was assessed from 3/20/2020 to 3/19/2021 and compared to the preceding year. The number of EDE for any dermatological condition (ICD10: L00-L99) decreased 23% overall from 19,705 to 15,218 per 100,000 of all healthcare encounters (HCE). All dermatological disease categories assessed in both adult and pediatric patients showed a significant decrease in total EDE compared to the prior year. Diagnoses assessed included cellulitis (-38% and -53% for adult and pediatrics, respectively), other skin infections (-38%, -56%), bullous skin disorders (-46%, -53%), dermatitis/eczema (-40%, -61%), papulosquamous disorders (-35%, -64%), urticaria/erythema (-46%, -64%), radiation-related skin disorders (-44%, -38%), skin appendages disorders (-43%, -54%), and other skin disorders (-39%, -53%). Adult and pediatric ED visits for dermatological conditions significantly decreased during the pandemic compared to the prior year with decreases in pediatric ED visits being more notable. Further studies are necessary to determine if these patients received care in other settings (i.e. outpatient offices, telehealth), and associated outcomes. Future studies are also needed to examine the degree to which ED visits for dermatologic conditions resume and if COVID-19 has lasting impacts on the setting in which skin care is sought.","Pakhchanian, H.; Raiker, R.; Russomanno, K.; Deng, M.",Journal of Investigative Dermatology,358,28

This review highlights the salient points of the 2002-2003 outbreak to help clinicians with early recognition, treatment, disease control, and prevention. RECENT FINDINGS Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus. The disease was first recognized in Asia in February 2003 and, over the next several months, spread to more than two dozen countries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. The disease is characterized by fever with symptomatic and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. SUMMARY Because diagnosis cannot be established by clinical findings alone, epidemiologic findings (including history of travel to affected areas, close contact with other case patients, or linkage to clusters of unexplained pneumonia) play a critical role in the diagnostic evaluation. Infection control procedures (including droplet and airborne precautions) are critical for preventing transmission.","Keeler, Natalie; Lingappa, Jairam",Current opinion in pediatrics,358,1

It was shown, by in vitro translation experiments and protein sequencing, that the papain-like protease 1, PL1(pro), but not a mutant derivative containing a substitution of the presumed active-site nucleophile, Cys(1093), cleaves the nsp2|nsp3 site at (879)Gly|Gly(880). By using an antiserum raised against the pp1a/pp1ab residues 526-713, the upstream processing product, nsp2, was identified as an 85 kDa protein in TGEV-infected cells. Furthermore, PL1(pro) was confirmed to be flanked at its C terminus by a domain (called X) that mediates ADP-ribose 1''-phosphatase activity.

METHODS Totally 100 patients hospitalized in Beijing Ditan Hospital since March to June 2003 with clinical diagnosis of SARS were involved in this study. These patients courses of disease were over 3 weeks. These patients were divided into two groups, SARS group and common atypical pneumonia group (non-SARS group). The counts of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte of two groups were systematically recorded and analyzed. RESULTS Sixty-five of the patients were confirmed to have common type of SARS, including 26 males and 39 females, 50 cases received methylprednisolone treatment. Thirty-five cases had common atypical pneumonia (non-SARS), 21 were males while 14 were females, 20 cases received methylprednisolone treatment. All the cases of two groups were cured in the end. The SARS patients T-lymphocyte counts decreased first and then increased. Before 15 days of disease course, mean CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T-lymphocyte counts of SARS patients were decreased apparently (694+/-568/microl, 441+/-356/microl, 309+/-462/microl). After 15th day of disease course, the counts gradually returned to normal CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T-lymphocyte counts of non-SARS patients were normal. Compared with patients of the same group who were not treated with glucocorticoids, T-lymphocyte counts of non-SARS patients treated with glucocorticoids had no obvious difference. But glucocorticoids had some effect on SARS patients recovery of cellular immune function, i.e., it delayed the recovery by about 6 days. CONCLUSION With or without treatment with glucocorticoids,the lowered CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T-lymphocyte counts in the early stage are of very important significance in differential diagnosis between severe acute respiratory syndrome and common atypical pneumonia.","Li, Ming-hui; Li, Xing-hong; Li, Xing-wang; Ma, Lie; Yi, Wei; Jiang, Yu-yong; Dong, Jian-ping; Li, Wei-li",Zhonghua shi yan he lin chuang bing du xue za zhi = Zhonghua shiyan he linchuang bingduxue zazhi = Chinese journal of experimental and clinical virology,358,33

HCC monomer consists of a core with a five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (beta region) wrapped around a central helix. The connectivity of these secondary structures is: (N)-beta1-alpha-beta2-L1-beta3-AS-beta4-L2-beta5-(C). In this study, various molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate the conformational changes of the monomeric HCC at different temperatures (300 and 500 K) and pH levels (2, 4, and 7) to gain insight into the domain swapping mechanism. The results show that high temperature (500 K) and low pH (pH 2) will trigger the domain swapping process of HCC. We further proposed that the domain swapping mechanism of HCC follows four steps: (1) the alpha-helix moves away from the beta region; (2) the contacts between beta2 and beta3-AS disappear; (3) the beta2-L1-beta3 hairpin unfolds following the so-called ""zip-up"" mechanism; and finally (4) the HCC dimer is formed. Our study shows that high temperature can accelerate the unfolding of HCC and the departure of the alpha-helix from the beta-region, especially at low pH value. This is attributed to the fact that that low pH results in the protonation of the side chains of Asp, Glu, and His residues, which further disrupts the following four salt-bridge interactions stabilizing the alpha-beta interface of the native structure: Asp15-Arg53 (beta1-beta2), Glu21/20-Lys54 (helix-beta2), Asp40-Arg70 (helix-AS), and His43-Asp81 (beta2-AS).","Lin, Yuan-Min; Liu, Hsuan-Liang; Zhao, Jian-Hua; Huang, Chi-Hung; Fang, Hsu-Wei; Ho, Yih; Chen, Wen-Yih",Biotechnology progress,358,8

RSV vaccine development has been hampered by results of clinical trials in the 1960s, when formalin-inactivated whole-RSV preparations adjuvated with alum (FI-RSV) were found to predispose infants for enhanced disease following subsequent natural RSV infection. We have reproduced this apparently immunopathological phenomenon in infant cynomolgus macaques and identified immunological and pathological correlates. Vaccination with FI-RSV induced specific virus-neutralizing antibody responses accompanied by strong lymphoproliferative responses. The vaccine-induced RSV-specific T cells predominantly produced the Th2 cytokines interleukin-13 (IL-13) and IL-5. Intratracheal challenge with a macaque-adapted wild-type RSV 3 months after the third vaccination elicited a hypersensitivity response associated with lung eosinophilia. The challenge resulted in a rapid boosting of IL-13-producing T cells in the FI-RSV-vaccinated animals but not in the FI-measles virus-vaccinated control animals. Two out of seven FI-RSV-vaccinated animals died 12 days after RSV challenge with pulmonary hyperinflation. Surprisingly, the lungs of these two animals did not show overt inflammatory lesions. However, upon vaccination the animals had shown the strongest lymphoproliferative responses associated with the most pronounced Th2 phenotype within their group. We hypothesize that an IL-13-associated asthma-like mechanism resulted in airway hyperreactivity in these animals.

Herein, we report a plant virus exploiting an IRES and its 3'-untranslated region (UTR) to express its internal genes, notably the 3'-proximal viral coat protein gene. Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (HCRSV), a positive-strand non-polyadenylated RNA virus, was demonstrated to harbor a unique 100-nucleotide (nt) IRES, located 124 nt upstream of the coat protein gene, that could function in wheat germ extract, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and mammalian cells. In comparison with other known IRESs of picornaviruses and eukaryotic mRNAs, this 100-nt IRES is distinctively short and simple. The IRES activity was tested in homologous and heterologous bicistronic constructs, and the expression of the 3'-proximal gene was enhanced when the 3'-UTR was present. When the IRES element was bisected, each half still possessed IRES activity and could initiate internal translation on its own. Site-directed mutagenesis and deletion analyses revealed that the primary sequence within the 5' half was crucial for IRES activity, whereas the primary sequence of the second half and a GNRA motif were non-essential. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a mechanism whereby an IRES, located in the 3' portion of the virus genome, co-operates with the 3'-UTR to enhance gene expression differentially.","Koh, Dora Chin-Yen; Wong, Sek-Man; Liu, Ding Xiang",The Journal of biological chemistry,358,9

Infections of two lines of chickens previously documented as genetically resistant and sensitive to infection were compared in order to ascertain early differences in the response to infection that might provide clues to the mechanism of differential genetic resistance. In addition to major changes that could be explained by previously described changes in infected tissue, some differences in gene expression on infection, and differences between the two chicken lines, were observed that led to a model for resistance in which a more rapid inflammatory response and more-extensive p53-related induction of apoptosis in the target B cells might limit viral replication and consequent pathology. Ironically, the effect in the asymptomatic neonatal infection is that more-severe B-cell depletion is seen in the more genetically resistant chicken. Changes of expression of many chicken genes of unknown function, indicating possible roles in the response to infection, may aid in the functional annotation of these genes.","Ruby, Thomas; Whittaker, Catherine; Withers, David R; Chelbi-Alix, Mounira K; Morin, Veronique; Oudin, Anne; Young, John R; Zoorob, Rima",Journal of virology,358,17

The difficulties associated with making large recombinant vaccines that contain numerous antigens has led to the development of alphabeta CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte polyepitope or polytope vaccine approach, where multiple (usually 8-10 amino acids long) alphabeta CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes, derived from several antigens are conjoined into single artificial constructs. Such polytope constructs can be delivered using a number of different vaccine vector modalities with each epitope in the construct emerging as individually immunogenic.","Suhrbier, Andreas",Expert review of vaccines,358,19

To increase the range of CO2 concentrations, we adjusted the outdoor air supply rates every 3 months. Generalized additive models demonstrated an association between the probability of detecting airborne rhinovirus and a weekly average CO2 concentration greater than approximately 100 ppm, after controlling for covariates. In addition, one rhinovirus from a nasal lavage contained an identical nucleic acid sequence similar to that in the building air collected during the same week. These results suggest that occupants in buildings with low outdoor air supply may have an increased risk of exposure to infectious droplet nuclei emanating from a fellow building occupant.","Myatt, Theodore A; Johnston, Sebastian L; Zuo, Zhengfa; Wand, Matthew; Kebadze, Tatiana; Rudnick, Stephen; Milton, Donald K",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,358,9

Immunocompetent Arabian foals and Arabian foals with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which lack functional B and T lymphocytes, were experimentally infected with EIAV. Levels of viremia and a number of clinical and hematologic parameters were examined prior to and following infection. Thrombocytopenia was not dependent on the immune response: SCID foals were affected as severely as immunocompetent foals. Production of platelets, measured by metabolic incorporation of radioactive label, was significantly reduced. The decrease ranged from 35 to 89% in three SCID and two immunocompetent foals examined. Platelet survival, measured by 51Cr labeling, also declined following infection in both SCID and immunocompetent foals: 51 and 68%, respectively, relative to the preinfection life spans. The difference between immunocompetent and immunodeficient foals was not statistically significant. The number of megakaryocytes (MK) per square millimeter of bone marrow, determined by digitizing morphometry, was not significantly altered in either SCID or immunocompetent thrombocytopenic foals. Numbers of denuded MK nuclei per unit area increased, but the elevation was not statistically significant. No evidence for viral replication in MK was found. Three different parameters of intravascular coagulation (activated prothombin time, fibrin degradation products, and one-step prothombin time) remained normal until after platelet numbers had declined significantly, arguing against an important role for disseminated intravascular coagulation. The findings indicate that EIAV induces thrombocytopenia principally through an indirect, noncytocidal suppressive effect on platelet production, the mechanism of which is unknown. A shortening of platelet life span apparently contributes moderately to the platelet deficit as well. The shortening of platelet life span is multifactorial in origin, including both mechanisms that depend on an active immune response and those that do not.","Crawford, T B; Wardrop, K J; Tornquist, S J; Reilich, E; Meyers, K M; McGuire, T C",Journal of virology,358,18

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, chiropractic programs in every region around the world had to make rapid changes to the delivery of manual therapy technique education, however what those changes looked like was unknown. AIMS: The aims of this study were to describe the immediate actions made by chiropractic programs to deliver education for manual therapy techniques and to summarise the experience of academics who teach manual therapy techniques during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive approach was used to describe the immediate actions made by chiropractic programs to deliver manual therapy technique education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chiropractic programs were identified from the webpages of the Councils on Chiropractic Education International and the Council on Chiropractic Education - USA. Between May and June 2020, a convenience sample of academics who lead or teach in manual therapy technique in those programs were invited via email to participate in an online survey with open-ended questions. Responses were entered into the NVivo software program and analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis by a qualitative researcher independent to the data collection. RESULTS: Data from 16 academics in 13 separate chiropractic programs revealed five, interconnected themes: Immediate response; Move to online delivery; Impact on learning and teaching; Additional challenges faced by educators; and Ongoing challenges post lockdown. CONCLUSION: This study used a qualitative descriptive approach to describe how some chiropractic programs immediately responded to the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in their teaching of manual therapy techniques. Chiropractic programs around the world provided their students with rapid, innovative learning strategies, in an attempt to maintain high standards of chiropractic education; however, challenges included maintaining student engagement in an online teaching environment, psychomotor skills acquisition and staff workload.","de Luca, Katie; McDonald, Marcus; Montgomery, Laura; Sharp, Stephen; Young, Anika; Vella, Simon; Holmes, Michelle M; Aspinall, Sasha; Brousseau, Danica; Burrell, Chris; Byfield, David; Dane, Dawn; Dewhurst, Philip; Downie, Aron; Engel, Roger; Gleberzon, Brian; Hollandsworth, Dana; Nielsen, Anne Molgaard; O039,; Connor, Laura; Starmer, David; Tunning, Michael; Wanlass, Paul; D French, Simon",Chiropr Man Therap,358,0

Notwithstanding, the Heptad Repeat 1 (HR1) domain on the glycosylated spike (S) protein is the region with less mutability and then the most encouraging target for new inhibitors drugs.The novelty of the proposed approach, compared to others, lies in a precise training of a deep neural network toward the 2019-nCoV virus. Where a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) has been trained to distingue the whole 2019-nCoV protein sequence amongst two different viruses family such as HIV-1 and Ebola. In this way, the present deep learning system has precise knowledge of peptide linkage among 2019-nCoV protein structure and differently, of other works, is not trivially trained on public datasets that have not been provided any ligand-peptide information for 2019-nCoV.

Methods: Altogether 742 discharged COVID-19 patients were analyzed retrospectively and were divided into re-infected patients (n=60) and non-re-infected patients (n=682) according to whether they became nucleic acid positive again after discharge. The time form leaving the hospital to re-infection and the time form the first nucleic acid negative test results to being re-infected were recorded. The clinical characteristics of the two groups were compared when they were admitted to the hospital. Logistic regression analysis was carried out on disease indicators with statistical differences between the two groups. Results: Compared with non-re-infected patients, there were statistical differences in age, contact history, fatigue, chills, nasal congestion and runny nose, lung CT observations, clinical classification and lymphocyte count of re-infected patients (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that nasal congestion and a runny nose, a lymphocyte count less than 0.93×109 cells/L, and age ≥65 years were the risk factors of being re-infected. The ROC curve showed that the cut-off value of lymphocyte count was 0.847×109 cells/L, and the AUC of predicted re-infection was 0.867. Conclusion: The symptoms of nasal congestion and runny nose, lymphocyte count less than 0.93×109 cells/L and, aged more than 65 years are the risk factors for the recurrent positive rates for COVID-19 patients, and lymphocyte count has certain clinical value in predicting recurrent patients.","Dong, Y.; Huang, H.; Yang, J.; Yang, L.",American Journal of Translational Research,358,1

More specifically, we question the standard assumption in the literature on epidemiological models, where the incidence rate dictating propagation of infections is taken to be proportional to the product between the infected and susceptible sub-populations; a model that relies on strong mixing between the two groups and widespread contact between members of the groups. We contend, that contact between infected and susceptible individuals, especially during the early phases of an epidemic, takes place over a (possibly diffused) boundary between the respective sub-populations. As a result, the rate of transmission depends on the product of fractional powers instead. The intuition relies on the fact that infection grows in geographically concentrated cells, in contrast to the standard product model that relies on complete mixing of the susceptible to infected sub-populations. We validate the hypothesis of fractional exponents (1) by numerical simulation for disease propagation in graphs imposing a local structure to allowed disease transmissions and (2) by fitting the model to the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data for the period Jan-22-20 to April-30-20, for the countries of Italy, Germany, France, and Spain.","Taghvaei, Amirhossein; Georgiou, Tryphon T; Norton, Larry; Tannenbaum, Allen",Sci Rep,358,1

This is the result of efforts to physically distance society, to try to slow the spread of the pathogen. Health care facilities were mainly restricted to urgent cases, while most physiotherapy treatments, mainly for patients with chronic conditions, were suspended. Some countries have seen a reduction in acute stroke hospital admissions of from 50% to 80%. One solution to the above problem is the use of telerehabilitation in the home environment as an alternative to inpatient rehabilitation. (2) Aim of the study: The purpose of this review is to analyse the benefits and limitations of teletherapy in relation to the functional condition of post-stroke patients. (3) Methods: Selected publications from 2019 to 2021 on the telerehabilitation of stroke patients were reviewed. The review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. (4) Results: Studies have proven that teletherapy significantly improves the functional condition of post-stroke patients, resulting in improved quality of life and faster return to independence (while maintaining maximum possible precautions related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic). (5) Conclusions: Analysis of the study results showed comparable effectiveness of rehabilitation in the tele system to inpatient therapy. However, it should be emphasised that patients undergoing telerehabilitation must meet strict conditions to be eligible for this type of treatment program.

We conducted two nationwide surveys in the United States (n = 2931) and China (n = 2793) assessing volunteers' and health workers' levels of mental distress and happiness. In spite of data being collected at different phases of the COVID-19 outbreak and across two different cultures, the results converged. Volunteers and health workers reported higher mental distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, somatization) than the comparison group. However, volunteers and health workers also reported more happiness than the comparison group. More importantly, in a follow-up in China (n = 1914) one month later, health workers still reported heightened happiness but were no longer more distressed than the comparison group. The changes in distress were partially mediated by happiness at the first time point, pointing to the potential role of happiness in coping with distress. In sum, the emotional landscape of volunteers and health workers was complicated-they experienced higher distress but also higher happiness than comparison groups. Future research would do well to include longer follow-up periods to examine how experiencing happiness during highly stressful situations predicts mental health over time.

METHODS: Tweets posted in English before and after the COVID-19 pandemic were included in the study. Popular tweets in 2019 were searched using the keywords ""tooth removal"", ""tooth extraction"", ""dental pain"", ""wisdom tooth"", ""wisdom teeth"", ""oral surgery"", ""oral surgeon"", and ""OMFS"". In 2020, another search was conducted by adding the words ""COVID"" and ""corona"" to the abovementioned keywords. Emotions underlying the tweets were analyzed using CrystalFeel - Multidimensional Emotion Analysis. In this analysis, we focused on four emotions: fear, anger, sadness, and joy. RESULTS: A total of 1240 tweets, which were posted before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, were analyzed. There was a statistically significant difference between the emotions' distribution before and after the pandemic (p &lt; 0.001). While the sense of joy decreased after the pandemic, anger and fear increased. There was a statistically significant difference between the emotional valence distributions before and after the pandemic (p &lt; 0.001). While a negative emotion intensity was noted in 52.9% of the messages before the pandemic, it was observed in 74.3% of the messages after the pandemic. A positive emotional intensity was observed in 29.8% of the messages before the pandemic, but was seen in 10.7% of the messages after the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may lead to mental, emotional, and behavioral changes in people. Unpredictability, uncertainty, disease severity, misinformation, and social isolation may further increase dental anxiety and fear among people.","Altan, A.",J Dent Anesth Pain Med,358,10

The results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 aerosolized from infected patients and deposited on surfaces could remain infectious outdoors for considerable time during the winter in many temperate-zone cities, with continued risk for re-aerosolization and human infection. Conversely, the presented data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 should be inactivated relatively fast (faster than influenza A) during summer in many populous cities of the world, indicating that sunlight should have a role in the occurrence, spread rate and duration of coronavirus pandemics.","Sagripanti, Jose-Luis; Lytle, C David",Photochem Photobiol,358,20

Accurate diagnoses of cases is key in managing the pandemic by identification, isolation and treatment of patients and defining the epidemiology of the virus. By mid-January 2020, a scientist from China published the full genome of the virus, which facilitated the development of accurate molecular diagnostic assays. By the end of January 2020, the WHO, in collaboration with laboratories in Asia, Europe and the USA, published several real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rtRT-PCR) protocols that allowed identification of cases and development of commercial assays. Clinical investigations facilitated development of accurate case definition and guidance for laboratories on the optimum specimens and procedures for diagnoses. Currently, laboratory-based rtRT-PCR is the recommended test for diagnoses of acute cases to ensure patients can be identified and isolated and to facilitate the public health response. However, due to delays in diagnoses, severe shortage of tests and laboratory capacity, point-of-care molecular or antigen tests are becoming more attractive. Although serological tests are not suitable for diagnoses of acute cases, they are important to define epidemiological questions, including attack rate in the population, and to identify immune individuals. This review aimed to summarise the current available information for diagnoses of cases and to aid laboratories and healthcare workers to select the best assays and procedures.","Venter, Marietjie; Richter, Karin",J Clin Pathol,358,5

METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, in partnership with a central laboratory that receives samples from approximately 1300 dialysis facilities across the USA, we tested the remainder plasma of 28â503 randomly selected adult patients receiving dialysis in July, 2020, using a spike protein receptor binding domain total antibody chemiluminescence assay (100% sensitivity, 99·8% specificity). We extracted data on age, sex, race and ethnicity, and residence and facility ZIP codes from the anonymised electronic health records, linking patient-level residence data with cumulative and daily cases and deaths per 100â000 population and with nasal swab test positivity rates. We standardised prevalence estimates according to the overall US dialysis and adult population, and present estimates for four prespecified strata (age, sex, region, and race and ethnicity). FINDINGS: The sampled population had similar age, sex, and race and ethnicity distribution to the US dialysis population, with a higher proportion of older people, men, and people living in majority Black and Hispanic neighbourhoods than in the US adult population. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8·0% (95% CI 7·7-8·4) in the sample, 8·3% (8·0-8·6) when standardised to the US dialysis population, and 9·3% (8·8-9·9) when standardised to the US adult population. When standardised to the US dialysis population, seroprevalence ranged from 3·5% (3·1-3·9) in the west to 27·2% (25·9-28·5) in the northeast. Comparing seroprevalent and case counts per 100â000 population, we found that 9·2% (8·7-9·8) of seropositive patients were diagnosed. When compared with other measures of SARS-CoV-2 spread, seroprevalence correlated best with deaths per 100â000 population (Spearman's &#961;=0·77). Residents of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic neighbourhoods experienced higher odds of seropositivity (odds ratio 3·9 [95% CI 3·4-4·6] and 2·3 [1·9-2·6], respectively) compared with residents of predominantly non-Hispanic white neighbourhoods. Residents of neighbourhoods in the highest population density quintile experienced increased odds of seropositivity (10·3 [8·7-12·2]) compared with residents of the lowest density quintile. County mobility restrictions that reduced workplace visits by at least 5% in early March, 2020, were associated with lower odds of seropositivity in July, 2020 (0·4 [0·3-0·5]) when compared with a reduction of less than 5%. INTERPRETATION: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer than 10% of the US adult population formed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and fewer than 10% of those with antibodies were diagnosed. Public health efforts to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread need to especially target racial and ethnic minority and densely populated communities.

We compared the microbial isolations found in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) with those in a non-COVID-19 ICU from 22 February to 30 April 2020 and in the same period of 2019. We considered blood, urine or respiratory specimens obtained with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or bronchial aspirate (BASP), collected from all patients admitted in ICUs with or without COVID-19 infection. We found a higher frequency of infections due to methicillin-resistant (MR) staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida parapsilosis in COVID-19-positive patients admitted in ICUs compared to those who were COVID-19 negative. Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently isolated from patients admitted in non-COVID-19 ICUs. Several conditions favor the increased frequency of these infections by antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Among all, the severity of the respiratory tracts was definitely decisive, which required assisted ventilation with invasive procedures. The turnover in the ICU of a large number of patients in a very short time requiring urgent invasive interventions has favored the not always suitable execution of assistance procedures. No less important is the increased exposure to infectious risk from bacteria and fungi in patients with severe impairment due to ventilation. The highest costs for antifungal drugs were shown in the ICU-COVID group.","Cultrera, Rosario; Barozzi, Agostino; Libanore, Marco; Marangoni, Elisabetta; Pora, Roberto; Quarta, Brunella; Spadaro, Savino; Ragazzi, Riccardo; Marra, Anna; Segala, Daniela; Volta, Carlo Alberto",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),358,5

The two theoretical models of cyberchondria involve reassurance seeking and specific metacognitive beliefs. Cyberchondria has relationships with health anxiety, problematic Internet use and symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, with public health implications pertaining to functional impairment and altered healthcare utilization. Suggestions about prevention and management of cyberchondria have been put forward, but not tested yet. Research interest in cyberchondria has steadily increased.

Although the clinical spectrum of Covid-19 is variable, acute respiratory failure and systemic coagulopathy are common in severe Covid-19 patients. Lung is an important target of the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing eventually acute respiratory distress syndrome associated to a thromboinflammatory state. The cytokinic storm, thromboinflammation and pulmonary tropism are the bedrock of tissue lesions responsible for acute respiratory failure and for prolonged infection that may lead to multiple organ failure and death. The thrombogenicity of this infectious disease is illustrated by the high frequency of thromboembolic events observed even in Covid-19 patients treated with anticoagulation. Increased D-Dimers, a biomarker reflecting activation of hemostasis and fibrinolysis, and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) are associated with higher mortality in Covid-19 patients. In this review, we will summarize our current knowledge on the thromboembolic manifestations, the disturbed hemostatic parameters, and the thromboinflammatory conditions associated to Covid-19 and we will discuss the modalities of anticoagulant treatment or other potential antithrombotic options.","Ribes, Agnès; Vardon-Bounes, Fanny; Mémier, Vincent; Poette, Michael; Au-Duong, Jonathan; Garcia, Cédric; Minville, Vincent; Sié, Pierre; Bura-Rivière, Alessandra; Voisin, Sophie; Payrastre, Bernard",Adv Biol Regul,358,9

In this study, we focused on daughters of older women and examined the intergenerational relationships as a correlate of daughters' anxiety, depressive symptoms, and psychosomatic complaints.Method: Data were collected from 456 daughters of older mothers (M(age) = 40.82) during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, when a relatively strict lockdown was enforced, separating mothers and daughters.Results: Findings suggest that while mothers' objective risk factors (age and morbidity) were mostly not associated with their daughters' distress, the daughters' concern about their mothers, and their perceived ambivalence in the relationship with the mother, as well as structural and affectual solidarity, were.Conclusion: We conclude that the mother-daughter relationship is an important correlate of daughters' reactions to this health crisis. Practically, it suggests that some daughters to aging mothers could be at a greater risk for emotional distress following the COVID-19 outbreak.","Segel-Karpas, Dikla; Ayalon, Liat",Aging Ment Health,358,7

Due to the COVID Pandemia, this problem becomes more urgent, and many new solutions are required for helping them. In this context, Home Care Systems (HCS) can proactively help people in preventing problems, e.g., supporting them in critical situations, such as loss of consciousness or physical disabilities. HCSs consist of services for health-cares and relatives, in a trustful and friendly way, combining both software and hardware technologies. They also should provide a valid approach that reduces the probability of false-positive or false-negative alarms. In this work, we propose drivers that should be taken for the designing of such a system. For that reason, we design an architecture that combines both computer vision algorithms and signal analysis, in order to detect home accidents and abnormal situations. One of the main issues is that integrated sensors should be easily handled and maintained, so we carry out a usability and technological study, detecting which features are necessary for these kinds of solutions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","D‘Amato, J.

However, the superior properties of their cognate exosomes as a cell-free product make them preferable in the clinic. Herein, we discuss the current clinical status of these novel therapeutic strategies in COVID-19 treatment. We then delve into the potential of interfering RNAs incorporation as COVID-19 gene therapy and introduce targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Further, we present miRNAs and siRNAs candidates with promising results in targeting the mentioned targets. CONCLUSION: Finally, we present a therapeutic platform of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes equipped with exogenous iRNAs, that can be employed as a novel therapeutic modality in COVID-19 management aiming to prevent further viral spread within the lung, hinder the virus life cycle and pathogenesis such as immune suppression, and ultimately, enhance the antiviral immune response.","Jamalkhah, Monire; Asaadi, Yasaman; Azangou-Khyavy, Mohammadreza; Khanali, Javad; Soleimani, Masoud; Kiani, Jafar; Arefian, Ehsan",J Transl Med,358,24

By comparing the growth rates in daily hospitalizations or confirmed cases under different interventions, we provide evidence that school closures contribute to a reduction in the growth rate approximately 7 days after implementation. Limited school attendance, such as older students sitting exams or the partial return of younger year groups, does not appear to significantly affect community transmission. In countries where community transmission is generally low, such as Denmark or Norway, a large-scale reopening of schools while controlling or suppressing the epidemic appears feasible. However, school reopening can contribute to statistically significant increases in the growth rate in countries like Germany, where community transmission is relatively high. In all regions, a combination of low classroom occupancy and robust test-and-trace measures were in place. Our findings underscore the need for a cautious evaluation of reopening strategies.

Since early March, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID­19), characterized by an acute and often severe form of pneumonia, has been declared a pandemic. This has led to a boom in biomedical research studies at all stages of the pipeline, from the in vitro to the clinical phase. In line with this global effort, known drugs, currently used for the treatment of other pathologies, including antivirals, immunomodulating compounds and antibodies, are currently used off­label for the treatment of COVID­19, in association with the supportive standard care. Yet, no effective treatments have been identified. A new hope stems from medical oncology and relies on the use of immune­checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In particular, amongst the ICIs, antibodies able to block the programmed death­1 (PD­1)/PD ligand-1 (PD­L1) pathway have revealed a hidden potential. In fact, patients with severe and critical COVID­19, even prior to the appearance of acute respiratory distress syndrome, exhibit lymphocytopenia and suffer from T­cell exhaustion, which may lead to viral sepsis and an increased mortality rate. It has been observed that cancer patients, who usually are immunocompromised, may restore their anti­tumoral immune response when treated with ICIs. Moreover, viral-infected mice and humans, exhibit a T­cell exhaustion, which is also observed following SARS­CoV­2 infection. Importantly, when treated with anti­PD­1 and anti­PD­L1 antibodies, they restore their T­cell competence and efficiently counteract the viral infection. Based on these observations, four clinical trials are currently open, to examine the efficacy of anti­PD­1 antibody administration to both cancer and non­cancer individuals affected by COVID­19. The results may prove the hypothesis that restoring exhausted T­cells may be a winning strategy to beat SARS­CoV­2 infection.","Vivarelli, Silvia; Falzone, Luca; Torino, Francesco; Scandurra, Giuseppa; Russo, Giulia; Bordonaro, Roberto; Pappalardo, Francesco; Spandidos, Demetrios A; Raciti, Giuseppina; Libra, Massimo",Int J Oncol,358,20

In this work, we argue that the assumptions traditionally made are not always based on solid arguments and sometimes they can be hardly justified. In light of this, we propose a modification of the Dixon and Coles (1997) model by relaxing the assumption of Poisson-distributed marginal variables and by introducing an innovative dependence structure. Specifically, we define the joint distribution of the number of goals scored during a match by means of thoroughly chosen marginal (Mar-) and conditional distributions (-Co). The resulting Mar-Co model is able to balance flexibility and conceptual simplicity. A real data application involving five European leagues suggests that the introduction of the novel dependence structure allows to capture and interpret fundamental league-specific dynamics. In terms of betting performance, the newly introduced Mar-Co model does not perform worse than the Dixon and Coles one in a traditional framework (i.e. 1-X-2 bet) and it outperforms the competing model when a more comprehensive dependence structure is needed (i.e. Under/Over 2.5 bet).","Petretta, Marco; Schiavon, Lorenzo; Diquigiovanni, Jacopo",,358,16

If those changes are fitted in the Trans-Theoretical Model, Indian people have passed through the ""Pre-Contemplation"" to ""Action"" stage of behavior changes during different phases of this pandemic. Frequent hand hygiene, maintaining physical distancing, use of face mask, cough etiquettes, avoid greetings through physical contacts, fear in spitting and urination at public places, refrain from gatherings and avoiding outside food are some of the examples of those appropriate behaviors which were enforced or learnt during the COVID pandemic. The continuous lockdown made people understand the difference between ""want"" and ""need"", the importance of local production, and the significance of social media and technology in routine life. The work-from-home strategy gave a chance to appreciate the work--life balance in a more applied way. The first-ever lifetime experience of unbelievable rejuvenating nature because of lack of human play taught people to appreciate nature.

Sustaining these appropriate behaviors is also important considering the bimodal distribution of the COVID-19 and possibility of advent of the second wave of COVID-19 in near future.","Gupta, M.

The association of eviction with newborns' health remains to be examined. Objective: To determine the association of eviction actions during pregnancy with birth outcomes. Design: This case-control study compared birth outcomes of infants whose mothers were evicted during gestation with those whose mothers were evicted at other times. Participants included infants born to mothers who were evicted in Georgia from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from March 1 to October 4, 2020. Exposures: Eviction actions occurring during gestation. Main Outcomes and Measures: Five metrics of neonatal health included birth weight (in grams), gestational age (in weeks), and dichotomized outcomes for low birth weight (LBW) (<2500 g), prematurity (gestational age <37.0 weeks), and infant death. Results: A total of 88 862 births to 45 122 mothers (mean [SD] age, 26.26 [5.76] years) who experienced 99 517 evictions were identified during the study period, including 10â¯135 births to women who had an eviction action during pregnancy and 78â¯727 births to mothers who had experienced an eviction action when not pregnant. Compared with mothers who experienced eviction actions at other times, eviction during pregnancy was associated with lower infant birth weight (difference, -26.88 [95% CI, -39.53 to 14.24] g) and gestational age (difference, -0.09 [95% CI, -0.16 to -0.03] weeks), increased rates of LBW (0.88 [95% CI, 0.23-1.54] percentage points) and prematurity (1.14 [95% CI, 0.21-2.06] percentage points), and a nonsignificant increase in mortality (1.85 [95% CI, -0.19 to 3.89] per 1000 births). The association of eviction with birth weight was strongest in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, with birth weight reductions of 34.74 (95% CI, -57.51 to -11.97) and 35.80 (95% CI, -52.91 to -18.69) g, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that eviction actions during pregnancy are associated with adverse birth outcomes, which have been shown to have lifelong and multigenerational consequences. Ensuring housing, social, and medical assistance to pregnant women at risk for eviction may improve infant health.","Himmelstein, Gracie; Desmond, Matthew",JAMA Pediatr,358,16

This study aimed to assess the combined effect of EN and supplemental PN enriched with omega-3 PUFA on blood oxygenation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: Single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind, phase III trial conducted from 10/2013 to 11/2017. A total of 100 ICU patients (18-85 years, APACHE II score > 15) requiring mechanical ventilation were randomly assigned to received combined EN and PN either with omega-3 PUFA (omega-3 group) or without (control group) for up to 28 days. Primary endpoint: 'change of PaO2/FiO2 from day (D) 1 to D4'. Secondary endpoints: lung function parameters, ICU complications, length of hospital stay, days free of ICU care/ventilation/sedation/catecholamine treatment, mortality, erythrocyte fatty acid composition, inflammatory parameters. Safety parameters: standard laboratory assessment, vital signs, physical examination, SOFA score, adverse events. RESULTS: Combined EN and PN covered energy requirements to more than 80%. Blood oxygenation (&#916;PaO2/FiO2 from D1 to D4: -1.3 ± 83.7, n = 42, and 13.3 ± 86.1, n = 39, in omega-3 and control group, respectively, p = 0.7795) and other lung function parameters did not differ between groups but days free of catecholamine treatment were significantly higher in the omega-3 group (~4 days, p = 0.0481). On D6, significantly more patients in the omega-3 group tolerated EN alone (51.0% vs. 29.8%, p = 0.0342). Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content in erythrocytes was significantly increased in the omega-3 group at last observation compared with the control group (&#916;EPA: 0.928 ± 0.808% vs. -0.024 ± 0.190%, p < 0.0001). No further significant group differences were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral and supplemental PN both enriched with omega-3 PUFA did not improve lung function but allowed earlier weaning from catecholamine treatment and PN.

The current research seeks to understand and document discrimination toward Asians in the US specifically linked to the global pandemic (study 1). The authors test hypotheses based in social categorization and intergroup contact theories, demonstrating perceived pandemic blame is a mechanism for discrimination (study 2). Design/methodology/approach: In study 1, the authors survey Asians living in the US regarding experiences and perceptions of COVID-19-related discrimination. In study 2, a two-time point survey examined whether participant perceptions of pandemic blame toward China predict discriminatory behavior toward Asians. Findings: Study 1 demonstrated that 22.5% of US-residing Asians report personally encountering pandemic-related discrimination. Study 2 indicated that COVID-19 blame attributions toward China predicted anticipated hiring bias and increased physical distancing of Asians at work, associated with higher levels of US identification. Research limitations/implications: The findings have theoretical implications for research on blame and stigmatization, as well as practical implications regarding bias mitigation. Originality/value: The present studies advance understanding of event-based blame as a driver of prejudice and discrimination at work and suggest organizations attend to bias mitigation in conjunction with uncertainty reduction communications in challenging times. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Gardner, D.

Studies have reported that the traditional Chinese medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza possesses remarkable antiviral properties; however, the anti-coronaviral activity of its main components, salvianolic acid A (SAA), salvianolic acid B (SAB), and salvianolic acid C (SAC) is still debated. In this study, we used Cell Counting Kit-8 staining and flow cytometry to evaluate the toxicity of SAA, SAB, and SAC on ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) high-expressing HEK293T cells (ACE2h cells). We found that SAA, SAB, and SAC had a minor effect on the viability of ACE2h cells at concentrations below 100 µM. We further evaluated the binding capacity of SAA, SAB, and SAC to ACE2 and the spike protein of 2019-nCoV using molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance. They could bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the 2019-nCoV with a binding constant (KD ) of (3.82 ± 0.43) e-6 M, (5.15 ± 0.64)e-7 M, and (2.19 ± 0.14)e-6 M; and bind to ACE2 with KD (4.08 ± 0.61)e-7 M, (2.95 ± 0.78)e-7 M, and (7.32 ± 0.42)e-7 M, respectively. As a result, SAA, SAB, and SAC were determined to inhibit the entry of 2019-nCoV Spike pseudovirus with an EC50 of 11.31, 6.22, and 10.14 µM on ACE2h cells, respectively. In conclusion, our study revealed that three Salvianolic acids can inhibit the entry of 2019-nCoV spike pseudovirus into ACE2h cells by binding to the RBD of the 2019-nCoV spike protein and ACE2 protein.","Hu, Shiling; Wang, Jue; Zhang, Yongjing; Bai, Haoyun; Wang, Cheng; Wang, Nan; He, Langchong",J Med Virol,358,1

The kinetics of the degradation of the parent substances was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. As a result, first-order degradation kinetics could be confirmed for all substances. The irradiance had no linear influence on the degradation of the compounds. Hydrogen peroxides were added to the wastewater to be treated, as electron acceptors and boosters, and alone had no great oxidative effect on the parent substances. The combination of photocatalysis with the addition of hydrogen peroxide as an electron acceptor had great synergetic effects which can reduce the required energy of the process through a short retention time.

In recent years, the incidence of mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) infection rate has been increasing, which cause respiratory tract infection. This study sought to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of M. pneumoniae hospitalized children with RTIs to provide a theoretical basis for clinical diagnosis and treatments in Chengdu, China. Methods: The data of 22,882 cases of children who had been hospitalized for RTIs were collected. M. pneumoniae immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody was detected using the indirect immunofluorescence method and passive agglutination method. The demographic features of patients, clinical diagnoses and laboratory data were also analyzed. Results: A total of 4,213 children tested positive for M. pneumoniae. The total positive rate was 18.41% (18.30% for males and 22.72% for females). Female children had statistically significant higher positive rates than male children (chi2=198.078, P&lt;0.01). The positive rates of M. pneumoniae differed significantly among children of different ages (F=162.7532, P&lt;0.01). The incidence rate of M. pneumoniae in 2017 and 2019 was significantly higher than the average (F=538.95, P&lt;0.01). There were higher M. pneumoniae positive rates from April to May, and September to October (P&lt;0.05) in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. There was no correlation between M. pneumoniae infection and temperature and humidity (P&gt;0.05). There was negative correlation with PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; (particulate matter in the air &lt;2.5 microm) (R=-0.293, P&lt;0.01) and PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (particulate matter in the air &lt;10 microm). (R=-0.285, P&lt;0.01). There were significant differences in the constituent ratios of cases of M. pneumoniae infection between in 2020 and other years (F=159.35, P&lt;0.01). Bronchopneumonia accounted for the highest proportion of cases, followed by acute bronchitis and the exacerbation of asthma in 2020. Conclusions: The epidemiological distribution of M. pneumoniae in children with RTIs in Chengdu was found to be related to gender, age, year and month;however, no relationship was found to temperature and humidity. There was a higher M. pneumoniae positive rate in children with bronchial pneumonia and asthma in cases. The prevention measures used to control Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) also effectively controlled the M. pneumoniae infection rate.","Zhang, L.; Lai, M.; Ai, T.; Liao, H.; Huang, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Liu, Y.; Wang, L.; Hu, J.",Translational Pediatrics,358,21

METHODS: This cohort study from the Cerner Real World Database (87 US health systems) from December 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020 included PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who self-identified as non-Hispanic Black (Black), Hispanic White (Hispanic), or non-Hispanic White (White). The main outcome was hospitalization among ED patients. Secondary outcomes included mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit care, and in-hospital mortality. Descriptive statistics and Poisson regression compared sociodemographics, comorbidities, receipt of remdesivir, receipt of dexamethasone, and outcomes by racial/ethnic groups and geographic region. RESULTS: 94,683 COVID-19 patients presented to the ED. Blacks comprised 26.7% and Hispanics 33.6%. Nearly half (45.1%) of ED patients presented to hospitals in the South. 31.4% (n=29,687) were hospitalized. Lower proportions of Blacks were prescribed dexamethasone (29.4%; n=7,426) compared to Hispanics (40.9%; n=13,021) and Whites (37.5%; n=14,088). Hospitalization risks, compared to Whites, were similar in Blacks (Risk Ratio (RR)=0.94; 95% CI:0.82, 1.08; p=0.4)) and Hispanics RR=0.99 (95% CI:0.81, 1.21; p=0.91), but risk of in-hospital mortality was higher in Blacks, RR=1.18 (95% CI:1.06, 1.31; p=0.002) and Hispanics, RR=1.28 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.44; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Minority patients were overrepresented among COVID-19 ED patients, and while they had similar risks of hospitalization as Whites, in-hospital mortality risk was higher.

The accumulation of debris in the endotracheal tube can progress to severe endotracheal tube obstruction ( ETO) necessitating high peak driving pressures with eventual loss of satisfactory ventilator volume delivery. Emergency endotracheal tube exchange under these circumstances can be an extremely high-risk undertaking both for the patient and caregivers. Method-Thirty mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients deemed at high risk for ETO or who had already had a prior episodes of ETO were selected as candidates for bedside percutaneous tracheostomy. Those patients requiring high ventilator settings high ventilator ( i.e. FIO2 &gt; 50 and PEEP more than 10 ) were also included in the study group. A disposable bronchoscope was utilized for direct visualization of appropriate tracheal puncture, guidewire passage, and final positioning of the tracheal tube. Results-All patients, including those individuals on high ventilator support attained the primary outcome of successful percutaneous tracheostomy without serous adverse events. Minor adverse events, such as brief periods of oxygen desaturation, were observed in 3 patients. Conclusion-Bedside percutaneous tracheostomy is a safe therapeutic option for patients with high risk for ETO due to trachea-bronchial mucosal and submucosal slough.

This study aimed to develop an efficient deep-learning artificial intelligence algorithm to identify top clinical variable predictors and derive a risk stratification score system to help clinicians triage COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective study consisted of 181 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from January 29, 2020 to March 21, 2020 from a major hospital in Wuhan, China. The primary outcome was mortality. Demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests were collected at initial presentation, totaling 78 clinical variables. A deep-learning algorithm and a risk stratification score system were developed to predict mortality. Data were split into 85% training and 15% testing. Prediction performance were compared with those using COVID-19 severity score, CURB-65 score and pneumonia severity index (PSI). Results: Of the 181 COVID-19 patients, 39 expired and 142 survived. Five top predictors of mortality were D-dimer, O2 Index, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. The top 5 predictors and the resultant risk score yielded, respectively, an area under curve (AUC) of 0.968 ([95% CI:0.87-1.0]) and 0.954 ([95% CI:0.80-0.99]) for the testing dataset. Our models outperformed COVID-19 severity score (AUC = 0.756), CURB-65 score (AUC = 0.671), and PSI (AUC = 0.838). The mortality rates for our risk stratification scores (0-5) were 0, 0, 6.7, 18.2, 67.7, and 83.3%, respectively. Conclusions and relevance: Deep-learning prediction model and the resultant risk stratification score may prove useful in clinical decision-making under time-sensitive and resource-constrained environment.This article is protected by copyright.

While struggling with the unknown nature of this novel coronavirus, many researchers and groups attempted to project the progress of the pandemic using empirical or mechanistic models, each one having its drawbacks. The first confirmed cases were announced early in March, and since then, serious containment measures have taken place in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we present a different approach, a Bayesian negative binomial multilevel model with mixed effects, for the projection of the COVID-19 pandemic and apply this model to the Turkish case. The model source code is available at https://github.com/kansil/covid-19. We predicted confirmed daily cases and cumulative numbers for June 6th to June 26th with 80%, 95% and 99% prediction intervals (PI). RESULTS: Our projections showed that if we continued to comply with measures and no drastic changes are seen in diagnosis or management protocols, the epidemic curve would tend to decrease in this time interval. Also, the predictive validity analysis suggests that proposed model projections should be in the 95% PI band for the first 12 days of the projections. CONCLUSION: We expect that drastic changes in the course of the COVID-19 in Turkey will cause the model to suffer in predictive validity, and this can be used to monitor the epidemic. We hope that the discussion on these projections and the limitations of the epidemiological forecasting will be beneficial to the medical community, and policy-makers.","Acar, Aybar Can; Er, Ahmet Görkem; Burduroglu, Hüseyin Cahit; Sülkü, Seher Nur; Aydin Son, Yesim; Akin, Levent; Ünal, Serhat",,358,2

Our aim was to analyse whether amove to virtual care is beneficial and sustainable in a rheumatologyoutpatient setting.MethodsData on volume of unscheduled access to an outpatient rheumatologyservice and questionnaire feedback responses from patients andrheumatology clinicians on virtual consultations, was analysed. ResultsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic period of March - July 2020, ourdepartment saw a majority of face to face outpatient rheumatologyclinic appointments transferred to virtual (telephone/video) with asignificant reduction in the number of scheduled clinics. In addition, the volume of telephone appointments booked online by patients sawa 27.2% rise (n = 2248) compared to March - July 2019 (n = 1767), witha 23.7% increase in telephone helpline calls in the 2020 period(n = 3246) compared to 2019 (n = 2624) and over a 300% increase inemail helpline activity. Questionnaire responses were obtained from382 patients (Table 1). 86% of patients felt they got a lot out of a virtualappointment, but 13% would prefer not to use it again. Of the 16healthcare providers that responded, 12 (75%) were satisfied with thevirtual clinic set up, but only 2/16 (13%) felt the same could beachieved for patients in a virtual setting compared to a face-to-facevisit. The lack of clinical examination was a major limitation forclinicians 12/16 (75%) and was similarly identified amongst patientfeedback (42/260) (16%).ConclusionVirtual care with the provision for patient-led care allows conveniencefor the patient with high patient satisfaction, however this is notnecessarily an approach that suits all. Clinicians must beware the noncomplaining patient, and careful selection of those suitable for virtualcare may be needed. Our model of patient led care using telephoneappointments booked online by patients coupled with telephone/emailhelplines is a potential strategy for other centers to develop.

DEEPCOVID works well with sparse data and can handle noisy heterogeneous data signals by propagating the uncertainty from the data in a principled manner resulting in meaningful uncertainties in the forecast. The deployed framework also consists of modules for both real-time and retrospective exploratory analysis to enable interpretation of the forecasts. Results from real-time predictions (featured on the CDC website and FiveThirtyEight.com) since April 2020 indicates that our approach is competitive among the methods in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub, especially for short-term predictions.","Rodriguez, A.; Tabassum, A.; Cui, J.

DESIGN: Tissue samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antigen using immunofluorescence and for viral RNA by in situ hybridisation. A set of 387 oropharyngeal swabs that had been submitted for routine respiratory pathogen testing was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Lung tissue collected post-mortem from cat 1 tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen and RNA. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in an oropharyngeal swab collected from cat 2 that presented with rhinitis and conjunctivitis. High throughput sequencing of the viral genome revealed five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the nearest UK human SARS-CoV-2 sequence, and this human virus contained eight SNPs compared to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence. An analysis of the viral genome of cat 2 together with nine other feline-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences from around the world revealed no shared cat-specific mutations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that human-to-cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, with the infected cats developing mild or severe respiratory disease. Given the ability of the new coronavirus to infect different species, it will be important to monitor for human-to-cat, cat-to-cat and cat-to-human transmission.","Hosie, Margaret J; Epifano, Ilaria; Herder, Vanessa; Orton, Richard J; Stevenson, Andrew; Johnson, Natasha; MacDonald, Emma; Dunbar, Dawn; McDonald, Michael; Howie, Fiona; Tennant, Bryn; Herrity, Darcy; Da Silva Filipe, Ana; Streicker, Daniel G; Willett, Brian J; Murcia, Pablo R; Jarrett, Ruth F; Robertson, David L; Weir, William",Vet Rec,358,1

The aim of this research was to determine the proportion of self-reported psychological distress, loneliness and degrees of resilient coping, and to also investigate the relationship of loneliness, coping and other variables with psychological distress among apparently healthy Indians during nation-wide lockdown period. METHODS: A cross-sectional, region-stratified survey using pre-designed pre-tested Google form disseminated via different social media platforms was conducted. A total of 1249 responses were analysed all over India. The form enquired about Socio-demographic profile, awareness on COVID pandemic and cases in the surroundings. UCLA Loneliness scale, Brief resilience and coping scale (BRCS) and Psychological distress scale (K6) assessed self-reported loneliness, coping and psychological distress, respectively. Special regressor technique adjusting for endogeneity and heteroskedasticity was used to extract the average marginal effects. RESULTS: Majority of the respondents were 18-35 years old, male, single and urban residents. News media, social media mostly acted as sources of information regarding COVID related news. Overall, 54.47% (95% CI: 51.39-57.53%) and 38.39% (95% CI: 35.57-41.29%) were reported to be lonely and had low resilient coping ability respectively. Around 44.68% had high risk of developing psychological distress. Being a student (average marginal effect coefficient (AMECoef).: -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.12, -0.01]) and perceiving lockdown as an effective measure (AMECoef: -0.11, 95% CI: [-0.19, -0.03]) were protective against psychological distress. Psychological distress was associated with male respondents (AMECoef 0.07, 95% CI: [0.02, 0.11]), low or medium resilient copers (AMECoef 0.89, 95% CI: [0.17, 1.61]), and perceiving a serious impact of social distancing measures (AMECoef 0.17, 95% CI: [0.09, 0.26]). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress among Indian population during lockdown was prevalent. Poor coping ability and perceiving social distancing to have a serious impact was found to be significantly contributing to psychological distress. Appropriate measures to address these issues would be beneficial for the community mental health.","Lahiri, Arista; Jha, Sweety Suman; Acharya, Rudraprasad; Dey, Abhijit; Chakraborty, Arup",PLoS One,358,20

A Study of Public Quarantine Willingness in COVID-19,18.97607,1.3239771,2020,"Remdesivir (RDV) has generated much anticipation for its moderate effect in treating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, the unsatisfactory survival rates of hospitalized patients limit its application to the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, improvement of antiviral efficacy of RDV is urgently needed. As a typical nucleotide analog, the activation of RDV to bioactive triphosphate will affect the biosynthesis of endogenous ribonucleotides (RNs) and deoxyribonucleotides (dRNs), which are essential to RNA and DNA replication in host cells. The imbalance of RN pools will inhibit virus replication as well. In order to investigate the effects of RDV on cellular nucleotide pools and on RNA transcription and DNA replication, cellular RNs and dRNs concentrations were measured by the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method, and the synthesis of RNA and DNA was monitored using click chemistry. The results showed that the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values for BEAS-2B cells at exposure durations of 48 and 72 h were 25.3 +/- 2.6 and 9.6 +/- 0.7 muM, respectively. Ten (10) muM RDV caused BEAS-2B arrest at S-phase and significant suppression of RNA and DNA synthesis after treatment for 24 h. In addition, a general increase in the abundance of nucleotides and an increase of specific nucleotides more than 2 folds were observed. However, the variation of pyrimidine ribonucleotides was relatively slight or even absent, resulting in an obvious imbalance between purine and pyrimidine ribonucleotides. Interestingly, the very marked disequilibrium between cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and cytidine monophosphate might result from the inhibition of CTP synthase. Due to nucleotides which are also precursors for the synthesis of viral nucleic acids, the perturbation of nucleotide pools would block viral RNA replication. Considering the metabolic vulnerability of endogenous nucleotides, exacerbating the imbalance of nucleotide pools imparts great promise to enhance the efficacy of RDV, which possibly has special implications for treatment of COVID-19.","Li, Y.; Zhang, H.

With the release of randomised controlled trial (RCT) results, we are beginning to see possible treatment options for COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial showed an absolute risk reduction in mortality by 2.8% with dexamethasone, and the ACTT-1 trial showed that treatment with remdesivir reduced the time to recovery by 4 days. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and lopinavir/ritonavir did not show any mortality benefit in either the RECOVERY or World Health Organization (WHO) Solidarity trials. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Brazilian HCQ trials did not show any benefit for HCQ based on the seven-point ordinal scale outcomes. The randomisation methodologies utilised in these controlled trials and the quality of published data were reviewed to examine their adaptability to treat patients. We found that the randomisation methodologies of these trials were suboptimal for matching the studied groups based on disease severity among critically-ill hospitalised COVID-19 patients with high mortality rates. The published literature is very limited regarding the disease severity metrics among the compared groups and failed to show that the data are without fatal sampling errors and sampling biases. We also found that there is a definite need for the validation of data in these trials along with additional important disease severity metrics to ensure that the trials' conclusions are accurate. We also propose proper randomisation methodologies for the design of RCTs for COVID-19 as well as guidance for the publication of COVID-19 trial results.","Emani, Venkata R; Goswami, Sanjeev; Nandanoor, Dheeraj; Emani, Shaila R; Reddy, Nidhi K; Reddy, Raghunath",Int J Antimicrob Agents,358,16

Personal protective equipment was essential to prevent transmission. Owing to shortage of face masks, Taiwan government began to implement quasi rationing on February 6, 2020, by allowing each resident to purchase two masks in seven days. Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration offered online data with real-time updates on face mask availability in all contracted pharmacies and selected local health centers. Based on the open data, numerous software applications quickly emerged to assist the public in finding sales locations efficiently. METHODS: Up until March 15, 2020, the Public Digital Innovation Space of Taiwan government had recorded 134 software applications of face mask availability, and 24 software applications were excluded due to defect, duplicate, and unavailability. These applications were analyzed according to platform, developer type, and display mode. RESULTS: Of the 110 valid software applications, 67 (60.9%) applications were deployed on websites, followed by 21 (19.1%) on social networking sites, 19 (17.3%) as mobile applications, and 3 (2.7%) in other modes. Nearly two thirds (n = 70) of applications were developed by individuals, one third (n = 37) by commercial companies, only two applications by central and local governments, and one by a nongovernmental organization.

They were randomly assigned either to Control group, receiving general lifestyle advice (n = 28) or the CDSS group (n = 27), to whom the CDSS provided personalised dietary plans based on the Mediterranean diet (MD) together with physical activity guidelines. Food data, anthropometry, blood markers and quality of life were evaluated. At 3 months, higher adherence to MD was recorded in the CDSS group, accompanied by lower body weight (kg) and body fat mass percentage compared to control (p < 0.001). In the CDSS arm, global health/quality of life was significantly improved at the trial endpoint (p < 0.05). Fasting blood glucose and lipid levels (i.e., cholesterol, LDL, triacylglycerols) of the CDSS arm remained unchanged (p > 0.05) but were elevated in the control arm at 3 months (p < 0.05). In conclusion, CDSS could be a promising tool to assist BC patients with lifestyle modifications during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Papandreou, Panos; Gioxari, Aristea; Nimee, Frantzeska; Skouroliakou, Maria",Nutrients,358,15

In Scotland, a public health mass-media campaign was launched on March 24, 2014, called Take it Right Outside (TiRO), with a focus on reducing the exposure of children to domestic second-hand smoke. In this study, our aim was to establish whether the TiRO campaign was followed by a decrease in hospital admissions for childhood asthma and other respiratory conditions related to second-hand smoke exposure across Scotland. METHODS: For an interrupted time-series analysis, data were obtained on all hospital admissions in Scotland between 2000 and 2018 for children aged younger than 16 years. We studied changes in the monthly incidence of admissions for conditions potentially related to second-hand smoke exposure (asthma, lower respiratory tract infection, bronchiolitis, croup, and acute otitis media) per 1000 children following the 2014 TiRO campaign, while considering national legislation banning smoking in public spaces from 2006. We considered asthma to be the primary condition related to second-hand smoke exposure, with monthly asthma admissions as the primary outcome. Gastroenteritis was included as a control condition. The analysis of asthma admissions considered subgroups stratified by age and area quintile of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivations (SIMD). FINDINGS: 740â055 hospital admissions were recorded for children. 138â931 (18·8%) admissions were for respiratory conditions potentially related to second-hand smoke exposure, of which 32â342 (23·3%) were for asthma. After TiRO in 2014, we identified a decrease relative to the underlying trend in the slope of admissions for asthma (-0·48% [-0·85 to -0·12], p=0·0096) in younger children (age <5 years), but not in older children (age 5-15 years). Asthma admissions did not change after TiRO among children 0-15 years of age when data were analysed according to area deprivation quintile. Following the 2006 legislation, independent of TiRO, asthma admissions decreased in both younger children (-0·36% [-0·67 to -0·05], p=0·021) and older children (-0·68% [-1·00 to -0·36], p<0·0001), and in children from the most deprived (SIMD 1; -0·49% [-0·87 to -0·11], p=0·011) and intermediate deprived (SIMD 3; -0·70% [-1·17 to -0·23], p=0·0043) area quintiles, but not in those from the least deprived (SIMD 5) area quintile. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that smoke-free home interventions could be an important tool to reduce asthma admissions in young children, and that smoke-free public space legislation might improve child health for many years, especially in the most deprived communities.

In this work, we designed a series of DNA logic gates by taking full advantage of the diversity and programmability of G-quadruplex (G4) structure. More importantly, by further utilizing the high affinity and specific endocytosis of cells to aptamer G4, we have achieved in realizing an INHIBIT logic gate whose operational site is precisely restricted in specific live cells.

SIGNIFICANCE: Our study focused on the problem associated with poor water-soluble drugs which have significant biological activity in vivo. METHODS: Different niosomal formulations of simvastatin were prepared and characterized in terms of morphology, size, encapsulation efficiency (EE), and release kinetic. Antiproliferative activity and the mechanism were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Moreover, confocal microscopy was employed to analyze the cell uptake of simvastatin loaded niosomes to the cancerous cells. RESULTS: Size, polydispersity index (PDI), and EE of the best formulation were obtained as 164.8 nm, 0.232, and 97%, respectively. The formulated simvastatin had a spherical shape and showed a slow release profile of the drug after 72 h. Stability data elucidated an increase in mean diameter and PDI which was lower for 4 °C than 25 °C. Confocal microscopy showed the localization of drug loaded niosomes in the cancer cells. The MTT assay revealed both free drug and drug loaded niosomes exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 cells). Flow cytometry and qPCR analysis revealed drug loaded niosomes exert their cytotoxicity on cancerous cells via regulation of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes. CONCLUSION: The prepared niosomal simvastatin showed good physicochemical and biological properties than free drug. Our study suggests that niosomal delivery could be considered as a promising strategy for the delivery of poor water-soluble drugs to cancer cells.","Akbarzadeh, Iman; Saremi Poor, Anita; Yaghmaei, Soheila; Norouzian, Dariush; Noorbazargan, Hassan; Saffar, Samaneh; Ahangari Cohan, Reza; Bakhshandeh, Haleh",Drug Dev Ind Pharm,358,15

Söz konusu virüs doğrudan doğruya insan sağlığını tehdit ettiğinden, küresel çapta insan yaşamıyla ilgili olarak kurulan bütün sosyal ve ekonomik süreçlerin durmasına ve hem üretim hem de tüketim sistemlerinin çökmesine neden olmuştur. Bu durumun örgütsel sağlığı ve örgütsel performansı etkilememesi mümkün değildir. Bu bağlamda, örgütlerin, ellerindeki çeşitli enstrümanlarla müdahale ve önlemleri söz konusu olmaktadır. &Iacute;şletmelerin tepe yönetimlerinin sahip olduğu kriz yönetimi anlayışı bu kapsamda yer almaktadır. Tepe yönetimlerinin müdahale ve önlemlerinin en net görülebildiği alanlardan biri de e-ticaret süreçlerine yönelik olarak yapılan örgütsel dönüşüm çabalarıdır. Kriz koşullarının neden olduğu makro değişiklikler bir yandan örgütün yapısında ve diğer yanda da iş yapma biçimlerinde önemli değişiklikler yapılmasını gerektirebilmektedir. Günümüzde ulaşılan teknolojik seviye ile iletişimin artık bir etkileşim olarak farklı bir formata geçiş yaptığı görülmektedir. Sadece örgütlerde değil, aynı zamanda devletler bazında, bireylerde ve dünyadaki tüm süreçlerde internete dayalı dönüşüm yaşanmaktadır. Bu teknolojinin ve yeni anlayışların, yeni yaşam tarzlarının dikkate alınarak örgütsel faaliyetlerin güncellenmesi bir zorunluluktur. Bu bağlamda e-ticaret tüm örgütler için bir yenilik, bir fırsat ve bir güncelleme anlamına gelmektedir. Bununla birlikte, örgütlerin kendi geleneksel süreçlerini terk ederek e-ticarete doğru yoğunlaşmaları ya da geleneksel faaliyetlerin yanına e-ticaret süreçlerini entegre etmeleri örgüt içinde çeşitli problemleri de beraberinde getirme riskini taşımaktadır. Eski ve geleneksel süreçlerin terk edilmesi kıdemli personelde bir tedirginlik ve hoşnutsuzluk kaynağına dönüşebilmektedir. Yeni iş akışlarının ortaya çıkması ile yeni vasıfların gerekliliği gündeme gelmektedir. Bununla birlikte örgüt daha nitelikli personel istihdamına yönelebilmektedir. Eski/kıdemli çalışanlara örgüt içi eğitimler verilse bile söz konusu çalışanların yeni vasıfları elde edememe riski önemli bir risk durumundadır. Bunlara ek olarak bazı departmanların ve pozisyonların kalıcı olarak ortadan kalkma ihtimali örgüt kamuoyu tarafından algılanabilmektedir. Bu çerçevede, örgütün geleneksel faaliyetlerden e-ticarete geçiş yapması, e-ticarete yönelik istekliliği ve yoğunlaşma düzeyi, çalışanlar arasında “yenilik ve belirsizlikten kaynaklı” huzursuzluk yaratma potansiyeli taşımaktadır. Söz konusu huzursuzluğun örgüt boyunca yayılması durumunda ise kurumsal huzursuzluk olgusundan söz etmek mümkün olacaktır. Bu durumda örgütsel bağlılığın azalması, örgütsel yapıya ve kurumsal markaya yönelik muhtemel hasarlar önemli bir risk olarak ortaya çıkmaktadır. Problemli alanlara üst yönetim tarafından yapılacak müdahalelerin etkili olmaması durumunda ise iç faktörler kaynaklı örgüt-içi kriz ortamı oluşması söz konusu olabilecektir. Bu çalışmanın temel amacı, örgütlerin tepe yönetiminin sahip olduğu kriz yönetimi anlayışının örgütsel süreçlerde ve özellikle de bir nihai hedef olan örgütsel güçlenme üzerinde etkili olup olmadığını analiz etmektir. Bu bağlamda, araştırma kapsamındaki başlıca bağımsız değişken olan “tepe yönetimin kriz yönetimi anlayışı” ile bağımlı değişken olarak belirlenen “örgütsel güçlenme” arasındaki ilişkiler incelenmektedir.

Franchise zincirinin Türkiye Merkez ofisi “tepe yönetim” ola ak ele alınmış ve franchise mağazalar da örgüt-içi birimler şeklinde düşünülmüştür. Araştırma modeline dayalı olarak çeşitli hipotezler test edilmiştir. Yapılan analizlerin sonucunda, tepe yönetimin kriz yönetimi anlayışının boyutları ile örgütsel güçlenme arasında anlamlı ve pozitif yönlü ilişkiler ortaya çıkmıştır. Diğer bir ifade ile, tepe yönetimin sahip olduğu kriz yönetimi anlayışının uzantısı olan yönetsel düzenlemeler ve uygulamalar örgütsel güçlenme üzerinde belirleyici olmaktadır.","Talak, Kezban",AJIT-e,358,13

The model itself is a compartmental model in which each compartment is divided into a number of age-groups. The parameters of the model are estimated using an optimisation scheme and some known results from the theory of monotone systems such that the model output agrees with some collected data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To highlight the strengths of this framework, a few case studies are presented in which different populations are subjected to different containment strategies. They include cases in which the containment policies switch between scenarios with different levels of severity. Then a case study on herd immunity due to vaccination is presented. And then it is shown how we can use this framework to optimally distribute a limited number of vaccine units in a given population to maximise their impact and reduce the total number of infectious individuals.","Bokharaie, Vahid S",PLoS One,358,30

This study explored adherence to SAH orders by young adults with hazardous drinking, and the role of alcohol consumption with in-person contacts on adherence. METHODS: Analyses included young adults with hazardous drinking (i.e., AUDIT-C score &#8805;3/4 for women/men; n = 50; ages 18-25) participating in a randomized trial in Pittsburgh, PA. Participants provided experience sampling reports on drinking twice per week from the week before SAH orders started on April 1, 2020 through 6 weeks during the SAH period. We examined how in-person contact with non-household friends changed over time and event-level relationships between alcohol consumption and in-person contacts. RESULTS: The percentage of participants with any in-person contact in the week before SAH was 44% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30%-59%), which decreased to 29% (95% CI 15%-43%) in the first SAH week and increased to 65% (95% CI 46%-85%) by SAH week 6. Controlling for average levels of alcohol consumption, on days when young adults drank, participants reported more in-person contacts compared to nondrinking days. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data indicate that, among young adults with hazardous drinking, adherence to public policies like SAH orders is suboptimal, declines over time, and is associated with drinking events. Interventions aimed at enhancing young adults' adherence to social distancing policies are urgently needed.","Suffoletto, Brian; Ram, Nilam; Chung, Tammy",J Adolesc Health,358,17

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence and pattern of mental health issues and substance use in the migrant population and highlight the association with the reverse migration of migrant workers. METHODOLOGY: The field staff visited the shelter homes for migrant population in four cities of Northern India (Chandigarh (UT), Bhatinda (Punjab), Panchkula (Haryana) and Jaipur (Rajasthan). After maintaining the social distance and wearing masks by the staff and migrants, written informed consent was taken for participation in the study. The socio-demographic details of reverse migrants were noted down and Hindi version of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for mental health problems and screening tool for pattern of substance abuse was administered. Geographically matched undisplaced were also administered these tools. RESULTS: A total of 275 reverse migrants and 276 undisplaced were included in the study. The prevalence of ever use for all the substances among reverse migrants was 44.4% (122/275) and among undisplaced, it was 45.3%. The prevalence of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis was higher than the general population. The prevalence of at least one diagnosis on PHQ-9 is 13.45% (reverse migrants 19.3% and undisplaced 7.6) and the prevalence of other depressive disorder is significantly higher in reverse migrants (17.1%) than undisplaced (4.0%).

In this study, we consider a multivariate discrete-time Markov model to analyze the propagation of COVID-19 across 33 provincial regions in China. This approach enables us to evaluate the effect of mobility restriction policies on the spread of the disease. We use data on daily human mobility across regions and apply the Bayesian framework to estimate the proposed model. The results show that the spread of the disease in China was predominately driven by community transmission within regions and the lockdown policy introduced by local governments curbed the spread of the pandemic. Further, we document that Hubei was only the epicenter of the early epidemic stage. Secondary epicenters, such as Beijing and Guangdong, had already become established by late January 2020, and the disease spread out to connected regions. The transmission from these epicenters substantially declined following the introduction of human mobility restrictions across regions.","Oka, Tatsushi; Wei, Wei; Zhu, Dan",,358,27

To investigate the pathophysiology, rodent models developed by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) have been utilized. However, mice lack posterior communicating arteries in the circle of Willis and cannot endure the brain ischemia induced by the bilateral occlusion. A mouse model to better reflect the localized ischemic stress in the retina without affecting the brain is still needed. Here, we established a mouse model of ischemic injury by permanent unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAO). Adult male mice were subjected to UCCAO, and changes in the ipsilateral retina were examined in comparison with the contralateral retina. Delayed perfusion was observed in the ipsilateral retina right after the occlusion and was not recovered later on. Common features of retinal ischemia were observed: Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilization; upregulation of hypoxia-responsive genes; altered levels of cytokines and chemokines. Activation of astrocytes and Müller cells in the inner retina was detected at day 2, and thinning of the inner retinal layer became significant at week 10. Together, our model can simulate retinal ischemia with morphological and molecular changes. It can be utilized to investigate pathophysiology of ischemic retinopathies.","Lee, Deokho; Kang, Heekyoung; Yoon, Ki Young; Chang, Yuan Yi; Song, Hyun Beom",Exp Eye Res,358,3

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a multi-viral microbiological POCT for suspected respiratory tract infections (RTIs). METHODS: In this observational, mixed-methods feasibility study practices were provided with a POCT machine for any patient aged &#8805;3 months with suspected RTI. Dual throat/nose swabs tested for 17 respiratory viruses and three atypical bacteria, 65 minutes per sample. RESULTS: Twenty clinicians recruited 93 patients (estimated 1:3 of all RTI cases). Patient's median age was 29, 57% female, and 44% with co-morbidities. Pre-test diagnoses: upper RTI (48%); lower RTI (30%); viral/influenza-like illness (18%); other (4%). Median set-up time was 2.72 minutes, with 72% swabs processed <4 hours, 90% <24 hours. Tests detected &#8805;1 virus in 58%, no pathogen 37% and atypical bacteria 2% (3% inconclusive). Antibiotics were prescribed pre-test to 35% of patients with no pathogen detected and 25% with a virus. Post-test diagnoses changed in 20%, and diagnostic certainty increased (P = 0.02), more so when the test was positive rather than negative (P < 0.001). Clinicians predicted decreased antibiotic benefit post-test (P = 0.02). Interviews revealed the POCT has clear potential, was easy to use and well-liked, but limited by time-to-result and the absence of testing for typical respiratory bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This POCT was acceptable and appeared to influence clinical reasoning. Clinicians wanted faster time-to-results and more information about bacteria.

METHODS: One hundred and ninety-eight patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, colorectal surgery and hernia repair were randomized to either AirSeal® (group A) or standard pressure CO2 insufflator (group S). The primary endpoints were operative time and level of postoperative shoulder tip pain (Visual Analog Scale). Secondary outcomes included Clavien-Dindo grade complications, surgical side effect and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Patients were randomized to either group A (n = 101) or group S (n = 97) and were analyzed by intention-to-treat. There was no significant difference in mean operative time between the groups (median [IQR]; 71 min [56-94] in group A vs. 69 min [52-93] in group S; p = 0.434).

We have termed the lung-restricted vascular immunopathology associated with COVID-19 as diffuse pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, which in its early stages is distinct from disseminated intravascular coagulation. Increased circulating D-dimer concentrations (reflecting pulmonary vascular bed thrombosis with fibrinolysis) and elevated cardiac enzyme concentrations (reflecting emergent ventricular stress induced by pulmonary hypertension) in the face of normal fibrinogen and platelet levels are key early features of severe pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy related to COVID-19. Extensive immunothrombosis over a wide pulmonary vascular territory without confirmation of COVID-19 viraemia in early disease best explains the adverse impact of male sex, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. The immune mechanism underlying diffuse alveolar and pulmonary interstitial inflammation in COVID-19 involves a MAS-like state that triggers extensive immunothrombosis, which might unmask subclinical cardiovascular disease and is distinct from the MAS and disseminated intravascular coagulation that is more familiar to rheumatologists.","McGonagle, Dennis; O039,; Donnell, James S; Sharif, Kassem; Emery, Paul; Bridgewood, Charles",Lancet Rheumat.,358,21

As of mid-January 2021, there are over 90 million confirmed cases and more than 2 million reported deaths due to COVID-19. Currently, there are very limited therapeutics for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. For this reason, it is important to find drug targets that will lead to the development of safe and effective therapeutics against the disease. The main protease (Mpro) of the virus is an attractive target for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics because it is required for proteolytic cleavage of viral polyproteins. Furthermore, the Mpro has no human homologues, so drugs designed to bind to this target directly have less risk for off-target effects. Recently, several high-resolution crystallographic structures of the Mpro in complex with inhibitors have been determined-to guide drug development and to spur efforts in structure-based drug design. One of the primary objectives of modern structure-based drug design is the accurate prediction of receptor-ligand binding affinities for rational drug design and discovery. Here, we perform rigorous alchemical absolute binding free energy calculations and QM/MM calculations to give insight into the total binding energy of two recently crystallized inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, namely, N3 and &#945;-ketoamide 13b. The total binding energy consists of both covalent and non-covalent binding components since both compounds are covalent inhibitors of the Mpro. Our results indicate that the covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions of both inhibitors to the Mpro target differ significantly. The N3 inhibitor has more favourable non-covalent interactions, particularly hydrogen bonding, in the binding site of the Mpro than the &#945;-ketoamide inhibitor. Also, the Gibbs energy of reaction for the Mpro-N3 covalent adduct is greater than the Gibbs reaction energy for the Mpro-&#945;-ketoamide covalent adduct. These differences in the covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions for both inhibitors could be a plausible explanation for their in vitro differences in antiviral activity. Our findings are consistent with the reversible and irreversible character of both inhibitors as reported by experiment and highlight the importance of both covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions to the absolute binding affinity of a covalent inhibitor towards its target. This information could prove useful in the rational design, discovery, and evaluation of potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors for targeted antiviral therapy.","Awoonor-Williams, Ernest; Abu-Saleh, Abd Al-Aziz A",Phys Chem Chem Phys,358,15

Setting and Patients. This study was conducted on patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure hospitalized in a tertiary Intensive Care Unit at Surrey Memorial Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Measurements and Results. We did not find prior reports of PEPP following prolonged intubation in the literature. Four patients underwent a total of 13 PEPP sessions following liberation from prolonged mechanical ventilation. Each patient underwent a median of 3 prone sessions (IQR: 2, 4.25) lasting a median of 1.5 hours (IQR: 1.2, 2.1). PEPP sessions were associated with a reduction in median oxygen requirements, patient respiratory rate, and reintubation rate. The sessions were well tolerated by patients, nursing, and the allied health team. Conclusions: The novel practice of PEPP after liberation from prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure is feasible and well tolerated, and may be associated with favourable clinical outcomes including improvement in oxygenation and respiratory rate and a low rate of reintubation.

In this paper, we employ process modeling for analyzing scientific software development in ocean science to advance the state in engineering of ocean system models and to better understand how ocean system models are developed and maintained in ocean science. We interviewed domain experts in semi-structured interviews, analyzed the results via thematic analysis, and modeled the results via the business process modeling notation BPMN. The processes modeled as a result describe an aspired state of software development in the domain, which are often not (yet) implemented.

The spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) present on the surface of the virion mediates the virus entry into the host cells and therefore is targeted by several scientific groups as a novel drug target site. The spike glycoprotein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) cell surface receptor abundantly expressed in lung tissues, and this binding phenomenon is a primary determinant of cell tropism and pathogenesis. The binding and internalization of the virus is the primary and most crucial step in the process of infection, and therefore the molecules targeting the inhibition of this process certainly hold a significant therapeutic value. Thus, we systematically applied the computational techniques to identify the plausible inhibitor from a chosen set of well characterized diaryl pyrimidine analogues which may disrupt interfacial interaction of spike glycoprotein (S) at the surface of hACE2. Using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and binding free energy calculation, we have identified AP-NP (2-(2-amino-5-(naphthalen-2-yl)pyrimidin-4-yl)phenol), AP-3-OMe-Ph (2-(2-amino-5-(3-methoxyphenyl)pyrimidin-4-yl)phenol) and AP-4-Me-Ph (2-(2-amino-5-(p-tolyl) pyrimidin-4-yl)phenol) from a group of diaryl pyrimidine derivatives which appears to bind at the interface of the hACE2-S complex with low binding free energy. Thus, pyrimidine derivative AP-NP may be explored as an effective inhibitor for hACE2-S complex. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies will strengthen the use of these inhibitors as suitable drug candidates against SARS-COV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

It provides a structure for individual reflection, collaborative staff discussion, and decision-making by those responsible for teams, departments and other groups of healthcare staff. Overall the framework guides the decision maker to characterise the degree of risk to staff, articulate feasible options for staff protection in that specific setting and identify the option that ensures any decrease in patient care is proportionate to the increase in staff well-being. It applies specifically to issues of PPE in COVID-19, and also has potential to assist decision makers in other situations involving protection of healthcare staff.","McDougall, Rosalind J.; Gillam, Lynn Ko Danielle Holmes Isabella Delany Clare",Journal of Medical Ethics,358,13

Due to the scientific community's efforts, there is an increasing body of published studies describing the virus' biology, its transmission and diagnosis, its clinical features, its radiological findings, and the development of candidate therapeutics and vaccines. Despite the decline in postmortem examination rate, autopsy remains the gold standard to determine why and how death happens. Defining the pathophysiology of death is not only limited to forensic considerations; it may also provide useful clinical and epidemiologic insights. Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures. In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities. Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality. Death can teach us not only about the disease, it might also help with its prevention and, above all, treatment.","Pomara, Cristoforo; Li Volti, Giovanni; Cappello, Francesco",,358,30

The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to healthcare staff during AGPs is well documented, and negative-pressure rooms are often unavailable. Innovative techniques to decrease risk to healthcare providers during AGPs are necessary. Our objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) performed using a novel prefabricated low-cost negative-pressure tent (AerosolVE). METHODS: Retrospective review of consecutive PDT procedures performed by neurointensivists on intubated adult patients with COVID-19 using the AerosolVE tent during the pandemic under an innovative clinical care protocol. The AerosolVE negative-pressure tent consists of a clear plastic canopy with slits for hand access attached to a U-shaped base with air vents. Air within the tent is drawn through a high-efficiency particulate air filter and released outside. Preliminary testing during simulated AGPs demonstrated negligible escape of particulate matter beyond the tent. The main outcome measure was successful completion of PDT and bronchoscopy within the AerosolVE tent, without complications. RESULTS: The patients were a 53-year-old man with multifocal ischemic stroke and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 53-year-old woman with cerebellar hemorrhage and ARDS, and a 69-year-old man with ARDS. Pre-procedure FiO2 requirement was 40-50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8-12 cm H2O. The tent was successfully positioned around the patient and PDT completed with real-time ultrasound guidance in all 3 patients. Bronchoscopy was performed to confirm tube position and perform pulmonary toilet. No complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to perform PDT on intubated COVID-19 patients using the AerosolVE negative-pressure tent. This is a promising low-cost device to decrease risk to healthcare providers during AGPs.","Rajajee, Venkatakrishna; Williamson, Craig A",Neurocrit Care,358,22

Although studies analyzing humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 were available rather early during the pandemic, cellular immunity came into focus of investigations just recently. For the present work, we have adapted a protocol designed for the detection of rare neoantigen-specific memory T cells in cancer patients for studying cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected after 6 d of in vitro expansion using overlapping peptide libraries representing the whole viral protein. The assay readout was an intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometric analysis detecting four functional markers simultaneously (CD154, TNF, IL-2, and IFN-Î³). We were able to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in 10 of 10 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. All patients had reactive T cells against at least 1 of 12 analyzed viral Ags, and all patients had Spike-specific T cells. Although some Ags were detected by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, VME1 was mainly recognized by CD4+ T cells. Strikingly, we were not able to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in 18 unexposed healthy individuals. When we stimulated the same samples overnight, we measured significant numbers of cytokine-producing cells even in unexposed individuals. Our comparison showed that the stimulation conditions can profoundly impact the activation readout in unexposed individuals. We are presenting a highly specific diagnostic tool for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells.","Zelba, Henning; Worbs, David; Harter, Johannes; Pieper, Natalia; Kyzirakos-Feger, Christina; Kayser, Simone; Seibold, Marcel; Bartsch, Oliver; Ködding, Jiri; Biskup, Saskia",,358,22

OBJECTIVES: To narratively summarize the available literature on the management of COVID-19 in order to combine current evidence and frontline opinions and to provide balanced answers to pressing clinical questions. SOURCES: Inductive PubMed search for publications relevant to the topic. CONTENT: The available literature and the authors' frontline-based opinion are summarized in brief narrative answers to selected clinical questions, with a conclusive statement provided for each answer. IMPLICATIONS: Many off-label antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs are currently being administered to patients with COVID-19. Physicians must be aware that, as they are not supported by high-level evidence, these treatments may often be ethically justifiable only in those worsening patients unlikely to improve only with supportive care, and who cannot be enrolled onto randomized clinical trials.

Genomic analyses show SARS-CoV-2 likely to be chimeric, most of its sequence closest to bat CoV RaTG13, whereas its receptor binding domain (RBD) is almost identical to that of a pangolin CoV. Chimeric viruses can arise via natural recombination or human intervention. The furin cleavage site in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 confers to the virus the ability to cross species and tissue barriers, but was previously unseen in other SARS-like CoVs. Might genetic manipulations have been performed in order to evaluate pangolins as possible intermediate hosts for bat-derived CoVs that were originally unable to bind to human receptors? Both cleavage site and specific RBD could result from site-directed mutagenesis, a procedure that does not leave a trace.

However, clinical research on its neurological manifestations is thus far limited. In this study, we aimed to systematically collect and investigate the clinical manifestations and evidence of neurological involvement in COVID-19. METHODS: Three medical (Medline, Embase, and Scopus) and two preprints (BioRxiv and MedRxiv) databases were systematically searched for all published articles on neurological involvement in COVID-19 since the outbreak. All included studies were systematically reviewed, and selected clinical data were collected for meta-analysis via random-effects. RESULTS: A total of 41 articles were eligible and included in this review, showing a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations in COVID-19. The meta-analysis for unspecific neurological symptoms revealed that the most common manifestations were fatigue (33.2% [23.1-43.3]), anorexia (30.0% [23.2-36.9]), dyspnea/shortness of breath (26.9% [19.2-34.6]), and malaise (26.7% [13.3-40.1]). The common specific neurological symptoms included olfactory (35.7-85.6%) and gustatory (33.3-88.8%) disorders, especially in mild cases. Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, and meninges were repeatedly reported after COVID-19. Laboratory, electrophysiological, radiological, and pathological evidence supported neurologic involvement of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations are various and prevalent in COVID-19. Emerging clinical evidence suggests neurological involvement is an important aspect of the disease. The underlying mechanisms can include both direct invasion and maladaptive inflammatory responses. More studies should be conducted to explore the role of neurological manifestations in COVID-19 progression and to verify their underlying mechanisms.","Wang, Lei; Shen, Yin; Li, Man; Chuang, Haoyu; Ye, Youfan; Zhao, Hongyang; Wang, Haijun",J Neurol,358,1

To establish this impact, we use the notion of Granger causality between two time-series. We show that there is a unidirectional Granger causality, from the median percentage of time spent daily at home to the daily number of COVID-19-related deaths with a lag of 2 weeks. We further analyze the mobility patterns at the census block level to identify which parts of the population might encounter difficulties in adhering and complying with social distancing measures.

However, it has been assumed by the design that the OS developers, smartphone vendors, or governments will not violate people's privacy. We propose a privacy-preserving exposure notification under situations where none of the middle entities can be trusted. We believe that it can be achieved with small changes to the existing mechanism: random numbers are generated on the application side instead of the OS, and the positive test results are reported to a public ledger (e.g. blockchain) rather than to a government server, with endorsements from the medical institutes with blind signatures. We also discuss how to incentivize the peer-to-peer maintenance of the public ledger if it should be newly built. We show that the level of verifiability is much higher with our proposed design if a consumer group were to verify the privacy protections of the deployed systems. We believe that this will allow for safer contact tracing, and contribute to healthier lifestyles for citizens who may want to or have to go out under pandemic situations.","Saito, Kenji; Iwamura, Mitsuru",,358,16

The impact of changes in practice on prognosis over time has not been evaluated. METHODS: Single center, retrospective study in adults hospitalized in a medicine ward for COVID-19 from March 5th to April 25th 2020. Patient characteristics were compared between two periods (before/after March 19th) considering French guidelines. The aim of the study was to evaluate how medical care impacted unfavorable outcome, namely admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and/or death. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients were admitted: mean age 59.0±16.3 years; mean C-reactive protein (CRP) level 84.0±71.1 mg/L; 46% had a lymphocyte count <1000/mm3. Prescribed anti-infective agents were lopinavir-ritonavir (n=12), azithromycin (AZI) (n=28) and AZI combined with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (n=52). There was a significant decrease in ICU admission, from 43% to 12%, between the two periods (P<0.0001). Delays until transfer to ICU were similar between periods (P=0.86). Pulmonary computerized tomography (CT)-scans were performed significantly more often with time (from 50% to 90%, P<0.0001), and oxygen-dependency (53% vs 80%, P=0.001) and prescription of AZI±HCQ (from 25% to 76%, P<0.0001) were also greater over time. Multivariate analyses showed a reduction of unfavorable outcome in patients receiving AZI±HCQ (hazard ratio [HR]=0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI: 0.21-0.97], P=0.04), particularly among an identified category of individuals (lymphocyte &#8805;1000/mm3 or CRP &#8805;100 mg/L). CONCLUSION: The present study showed a significant decrease in admission to ICU over time, which was probably related to multiple factors, including a better indication of pulmonary CT-scan, oxygen therapy, and a suitable prescription of anti-infective agents.","Davido, Benjamin; Boussaid, Ghilas; Vaugier, Isabelle; Lansaman, Thibaud; Bouchand, Frédérique; Lawrence, Christine; Alvarez, Jean-Claude; Moine, Pierre; Perronne, Véronique; Barbot, Frédéric; Saleh-Mghir, Azzam; Perronne, Christian; Annane, Djillali; De Truchis, Pierre",Int J Antimicrob Agents,358,16

Secondary distribution of home-based HIV self-test kits by AGYW to male partners (MP) is a novel prevention strategy that complements pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a female-controlled prevention intervention. The objective of this analysis was to qualitatively operationalize two HIV prevention cascades through the lens of relationship dynamics for secondary distribution of HIV self-tests to MP and PrEP for AGYW. METHODS: From April 2018 to December 2018, 2200 HIV-negative AGYW aged 16-24 years were enrolled into an HIV prevention intervention which involved secondary distribution of self-tests to MP and PrEP for AGYW; of these women, 91 participants or MP were sampled for in-depth interviews based on their degree of completion of the two HIV prevention cascades. A grounded theory approach was used to characterize participants' relationship profiles, which were mapped to participants' engagement with the interventions. RESULTS: In cases where AGYW had a MP with multiple partners, AGYW perceived both interventions as inviting distrust into the relationship and insinuating non-monogamy. Many chose not to accept either intervention, while others accepted and attempted to deliver the self-test kit but received a negative reaction from their MP. In the few cases where AGYW held multiple partnerships, both interventions were viewed as mechanisms for protecting one's health, and these AGYW exhibited confidence in accepting and delivering the self-test kits and initiating PrEP. Women who indicated intimate partner violence experiences chose not to accept either intervention because they feared it would elicit a violent reaction from their MP. For AGYW in relationships described as committed and emotionally open, self-test kit delivery was completed with ease, but PrEP was viewed as unnecessary. MP experience with the cascade corroborated AGYW perspectives and demonstrated how men can perceive female-initiated HIV prevention options as beneficial for AGYW and a threat to MP masculinity. CONCLUSIONS: Screening to identify AGYW relationship dynamics can support tailoring prevention services to relationship-driven barriers and facilitators. HIV prevention counseling for AGYW should address relationship goals or partner's influence, and engage with MP around female-controlled prevention interventions.","Holmes, Leah E; Kaufman, Michelle R; Casella, Albert; Mudavanhu, Mutsa; Mutunga, Lillian; Polzer, Tara; Bassett, Jean; Van Rie, Annelies; Schwartz, Sheree",J Int AIDS Soc,358,22

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This qualitative study used Charmaz's constructivist grounded theory methods to collect and analyze data. Using theoretical sampling, 21 individuals suffering from chronic illness and who had used CAM treatment participated in face-to-face in-depth interviews conducted in Miami/USA. RESULTS: Seven overarching themes emerged from the data to describe how and why people with chronic illness choose CAM treatments. These themes included 1) influences, 2) desperation, 3) being averse to allopathic medicine and allopathic medical practice, 4) curiosity and chance, 5) ease of access, 6) institutional help, and 7) trial and error. CONCLUSION: In selecting treatment options that include CAM, individuals draw on their social, economic, and biographical situations.

To combat the devastating spread of SARS-CoV-2, extraordinary efforts from numerous laboratories have focused on the development of effective and safe vaccines. Traditional live-attenuated or inactivated viral vaccines are not recommended for immunocompromised patients as the attenuated virus can still cause disease via phenotypic or genotypic reversion. Subunit vaccines require repeated dosing and adjuvant use to be effective, and DNA vaccines exhibit lower immune responses. mRNA vaccines can be highly unstable under physiological conditions. On the contrary, naturally antigenic viral vectors with well-characterized structure and safety profile serve as among the most effective gene carriers to provoke immune response via heterologous gene transfer. Viral vector-based vaccines induce both an effective cellular immune response and a humoral immune response owing to their natural adjuvant properties via transduction of immune cells. Consequently, viral vectored vaccines carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have recently been generated and successfully used to activate cytotoxic T cells and develop a neutralizing antibody response. Recent progress in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, with an emphasis on gene therapy viral vector-based vaccine development, is discussed in this review.","Bisgin, Atil; Sanlioglu, Ahter D; Eksi, Yunus Emre; Griffith, Thomas S; Sanlioglu, Salih",Hum. gene ther,358,16

Methods: A cohort of 10,741 patients with COVID-19 in the Case Mix Program national clinical audit from February 1 to July 31, 2020, was used. Analyses were stratified by time period (prepeak, peak, and postpeak periods) and geographical region. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted differences in 28-day in-hospital mortality between periods. Measurements and Main Results: Admissions to ICUs peaked almost simultaneously across regions but varied 4.6-fold in magnitude. Compared with patients admitted in the prepeak period, patients admitted in the postpeak period were slightly younger but with higher degrees of dependency and comorbidity on admission to ICUs and more deranged first-24-hours physiology. Despite this, receipt of invasive ventilation and renal replacement therapy decreased, and adjusted 28-day in-hospital mortality was reduced by 11.8% (95% confidence interval, 8.7%–15.0%). Many variables exhibited u-shaped or n-shaped curves during the peak. Conclusions: The population of patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICUs, and the processes of care in ICUs, changed over the first wave of the epidemic. After adjustment for important risk factors, there was a substantial improvement in patient outcomes.","Doidge, James C.; Gould, Doug W.; Ferrando-Vivas, Paloma; Mouncey, Paul R.; Thomas, Karen; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Harrison, David A.; Rowan, Kathryn M.",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,358,5

Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to attempt to quantify the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (nAb) that develop after dose 2 vaccinations and also identify any factors that might affect the timing and degree of nAb production. Methods: A fluorescence immunoassay analyzer was used to quantify the percent of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies capable of blocking the spike protein at its receptor binding domain (RBD) for attachment to ACE-2 receptors. Seventy residents and staff of an assisted living facility ranging in age from 23 to 100 years were enrolled. Fingerstick blood samples were measured at seven days and 21 days following the 2nd dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine. Based on prior research, nAb measurements <30% were considered to be inadequate protection and therefore delineated as nAb negative. Results: Except for a 58 year old (yo) man taking daily prednisone for asthma and another 55 yo man with hypothyroidism (treated with levothyroxine), 100% of the 34 persons <70 were positive for neutralizing Ab (assays with >30% nAb) on day 7 after the 2 nd vaccine dose. However, among the 37 patients older than 70 years, the percent of persons positive for nAb (>30%) on Day 7 diminished with age. Only half of those 71-80 yo, 33% of those 81-90 yo and 11% of those >90 yo were positive for nAb. Two weeks later, however, the percentages among those tested had increased to 83%, 71%, and 50% for those respective age groups. Also, one week after the second vaccine dose, the average neutralizing Ab% measurement (%nAb) among the various age groups under the age of 50 years ranged from 95 to 100% while age group averages were borderline or inadequate for those older than 70 years. Nevertheless, 21 days after the second dose, the average %nAb measurement had become 91% for those 61 to 70 years of age, 75% for those 71-80, and 55% for those 81-90. For the eight persons over 90 years of age, the average %nAb was 35% and half of those persons (n=4) had no detectable nAb, either at day 7 or day 21. No persons had significant declines in the %nAb measurements and the majority sustained or improved their %nAb between Day 7 and Day 21. Conclusions: Escalating age and immunomodulating medications and conditions can impact the timing and degree of neutralizing Ab produced following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Most persons under the age of 90 years were considered to be “positive” for protective levels of nAb within three weeks following the 2nd dose of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. On-going investigations involve evaluations of the duration and sustained degree of positive nAb findings, as well as external validation of the tool used in this current research.","Pepe, P.

Moreover, current research has helped to elucidate different communication pathways between the gut microbiota and neural tissues (e.g., the vagus nerve, tryptophan production, extrinsic enteric-associated neurons, and short chain fatty acids). On the other hand, altering the composition of gut microbiota promotes a state known as dysbiosis, where the balance between helpful and pathogenic bacteria is disrupted, usually stimulating the last ones. Herein, we summarize selected findings of the recent literature concerning the gut microbiome on the onset and progression of neurodevelopmental and degenerative disorders, and the strategies to modulate its composition in the search for therapeutical approaches, focusing mainly on animal models studies.

We surveyed all NHS hospitals where surgery is undertaken. Response rates, by round, were 64%, 56% and 51%. Despite important regional variations, the surveys showed increasing systemic pressure on anaesthetic and peri‐operative services due to the need to support critical care pandemic demands. During Rounds 1 and 2, approximately one in eight anaesthetic staff were not available for anaesthetic work. Approximately one in five operating theatres were closed and activity fell in those that were open. Some mitigation was achieved by relocation of surgical activity to other locations. Approximately one‐quarter of all surgical activity was lost, with paediatric and non‐cancer surgery most impacted. During January 2021, the system was largely overwhelmed. Almost one‐third of anaesthesia staff were unavailable, 42% of operating theatres were closed, national surgical activity reduced to less than half, including reduced cancer and emergency surgery. Redeployed anaesthesia staff increased the critical care workforce by 125%. Three‐quarters of critical care units were so expanded that planned surgery could not be safely resumed. At all times, the greatest resource limitation was staff. Due to lower response rates from the most pressed regions and hospitals, these results may underestimate the true impact. These findings have important implications for understanding what has happened during the COVID‐19 pandemic, planning recovery and building a system that will better respond to future waves or new epidemics.","Kursumovic, E.; Cook, T.

The United States (US) has the highest number of reported COVID-19 cases, and over 16 million people were infected up to the 12 December 2020. To better understand and mitigate the spread of the disease, it is necessary to recognize the pattern of the outbreak. In this study, we explored the patterns of COVID-19 cases in the US from 1 March to 12 December 2020. The county-level cases and rates of the disease were mapped using a geographic information system (GIS). The overall trend of the disease in the US, as well as in each of its 50 individual states, were analyzed by the seasonal-trend decomposition. The disease curve in each state was further examined using K-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that three clusters were observed in the early phase (1 March–31 May). New York has a unique pattern of the disease curve and was assigned one cluster alone. Two clusters were observed in the middle phase (1 June–30 September). California, Texas and Florida were assigned in the same cluster, which has the pattern different from the remaining states. In the late phase (1 October–12 December), California has a unique pattern of the disease curve and was assigned a cluster alone. In the whole period, three clusters were observed. California, Texas and Florida still have similar patterns and were assigned in the same cluster. The trend analysis consolidated the patterns identified from the cluster analysis.

AIM: To explore how family members of patients who are seriously ill or who die during infectious disease outbreaks are supported and cared for during serious illness, before and after patient death and the factors that influence family presence around the time of death. DESIGN: Systematic review and narrative synthesis. DATA SOURCES: CINAHL, Medline, APA PsycInfo and Embase were searched from inception to June 2020. Forward and backward searching of included papers were also undertaken. Records were independently assessed against inclusion criteria. Included papers were assessed for quality, but none were excluded. FINDINGS: Key findings from 14 papers include the importance of communication and information sharing, as well as new ways of using virtual communication. Restrictive visiting practices were understood, but the impact of these restrictions on family experience cannot be underestimated, causing distress and suffering. Consistent advice and information were critical, such as explaining personal protective equipment, which family found constraining and staff experienced as affecting interpersonal communication. Cultural expectations of family caregiving were challenged during infectious disease outbreaks. CONCLUSION: Learning from previous infectious disease outbreaks about how family are supported can be translated to the current COVID-19 pandemic and future infectious disease outbreaks. Consistent, culturally sensitive and tailored plans should be clearly communicated to family members, including when any restrictions may be amended or additional supports provided when someone is dying.","Bloomer, Melissa J; Walshe, Catherine",Palliat Med,358,8

Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the patients of Gastric Cancer (GC; the third leading cause of death in the world) pose a great challenge for the health management of the patients. Since there have been uncertainties to develop a new drug against COVID-19, there is an urgent need for repurposing drugs that can target key proteins of both SARS-CoV-2 and GC. The SARS-CoV-2-RdRp protein contains the NiRAN domain, which is known to have kinase-like folds. A docking study of the FDA approved drugs against GC was performed using AutoDock 4.2 and Glide Schrodinger suite 2019 against SARS-CoV-2-RdRp protein. MMGBSA and MD simulation studies were performed to investigate the binding and stability of the inhibitors with the target protein. In this study, we have found 12 kinase inhibitors with high binding energies namely Baricitinib, Brepocitinib, Decernotinib, Fasudil, Filgotinib, GSK2606414, Peficitinib, Ruxolitinib, Tofacitinib, Upadacitinib, Pamapimod and Ibrutinib. These FDA approved drugs against GC can play a key role in the treatment of COVID-19 patients along with GC as comorbidity. We also hypothesize that JAK, ITK, Rho-associated kinases, FGFR2, FYN, PERK, TYK2, p38-MAPK and SYK kinases can be considered as key therapeutic targets in COVID-19 treatment. Taken altogether, we have proposed the SARS-CoV-2-RdRp as a potential therapeutic target through in-silico studies. However, further in-vitro and in-vivo studies are required for the validation of the proposed targets and drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients already suffering from GC.","Sonkar, Charu; Doharey, Pawan Kumar; Rathore, Anuranjan Singh; Singh, Vishal; Kashyap, Dharmendra; Sahoo, Amaresh Kumar; Mittal, Nitish; Sharma, Bechan; Jha, Hem Chandra",Comput Biol Med,358,12

The unfolded protein response (UPR), a complex adaptive stress response, attempts to restore normal proteostasis, in part, through the up-regulation of various foldases and chaperone proteins including redox-active protein disulphide isomerases (PDIs). There are currently over 20 members of the PDI family each consisting of varying numbers of thioredoxin-like domains which, generally, assist in oxidative folding and disulphide bond rearrangement of peptides. While there is a large amount of redundancy in client proteins of the various PDIs, the size of the family would indicate more nuanced roles for the individual PDIs. However, the role of individual PDIs in disease pathogenesis remains uncertain.

Lack of clinical data, unclear potential of donor-derived infection and non-established recommendations for transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of keratoplasty and cornea donors at ophthalmology departments and eye banks. To eliminate the risk of infection of recipients and medical personnel, we suggest that the blood samples of all donors should be screened with RT-PCR tests and nasopharyngeal swabs should be taken. In addition, a chest CT scan should be performed if the circulation is maintained. Moreover, the donors’ clinical and epidemiological medical history must be screened for typical symptoms and potential contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers to reduce the risk of transmission.

Twenty-four patients had long-term follow-up extending from 14 months to 22 years (mean 83.1 months). Ten of 24 patients (41.6%) did not develop rebleeding for 5–22 years (mean 10.3 years). Overall 5-year survival in these 24 patients was 62.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The modified Sugiura procedure remains an effective rescue therapy for patients with bleeding esophageal varices when alternative treatments fail or are not indicated. Moreover, it can be a life-saving procedure in patients with anatomy unsuitable for shunt surgery or for patients treated in nonspecialized centers where surgical expertise for a shunt operation is not available.","Voros, D.; Polydorou, A.; Polymeneas, G.; Vassiliou, I.; Melemeni, A.; Chondrogiannis, K.; Arapoglou, V.; Fragulidis, G.

This is the first study to empirically examine therapists' experience of resilience and posttraumatic growth during COVID-19. METHOD: This longitudinal study reports on the self-reported resilience and posttraumatic growth of 185 psychotherapists (mostly White, female and North American) across 4 time points during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therapist-reported working alliance, vicarious traumatization, and acceptance of online therapy at baseline were examined as potential predictors of professional self-doubt at baseline as well as potential predictors of subsequent resilience (e.g., reduction of professional self-doubt) and posttraumatic growth. RESULTS: Therapists experienced moderate levels of professional self-doubt, more than outside pandemic times, and this self-doubt decreased over time, thus showing a resilient trajectory. Professional self-doubt at baseline was predicted by higher vicarious trauma and weaker working alliance, less clinical experience, and less acceptance of online therapy technology. Higher levels of resilience over time were predicted by less acceptance of online therapy. Moreover, therapists reported relatively low levels of posttraumatic growth, and this remained consistent during the subsequent 12 weeks. Posttraumatic growth was predicted by high levels of vicarious trauma, and acceptance of online therapy technology. CONCLUSIONS: Therapists in our study reported resilience during the initial months of COVID-19. Those who were relatively more traumatized and more comfortable in their online work during the pandemic experienced more posttraumatic growth.

Methods Patients who had an active DFU during the COVID-19 emergency were included. All participants were managed using a specific triage system driven both by ulcer’severity and concomitant co-diseases. Subjects with severely complicated DFUs were urgently referred to hospital regardless of the concomitant comorbidities. Subjects with complicated DFUs received outpatient evaluation (within 48-72 hours) and were admitted to hospital if required (revascularization, surgical intervention, intravenous antibiotic therapy); after the first outpatient visit or hospitalization, patients were followed according to the number of comorbidities (in the case of 3 or more comorbidities patiente were followed up by telemedicine). Patients with uncomplicated DFUs were managed by telemedicine after outpatient evaluation. Healing, major amputation, death and rate of COVID-19 infection were evaluated. The minimum follow-up was 1 month. Results The study group included 151 patients. The mean age was 69.9±14.2 years, 58.9% were male and 91.4% had type 2 diabetes; 58.7% had severely complicated, 21% complicated and 20.3% uncomplicated DFUs. Among those, 78.8% presented with 3 or more comorbidities. One hundred and six patients had regular clinical follow-ups, while 45 were managed through telemedicine. Forty-one (27.1%) patients healed, 3 (1.9%) had major amputations and 3 (1.9%) died. One patient (0.6%) reported COVID-19 positivity due to infection aquired at home. Conclusion The triage pathway adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic showed adequate management of DFUs and no cases of hospital virus exposure.","Marco, Meloni; Valentina, Izzo; Laura, Giurato; Roberto, Gandini; Luigi, Uccioli",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,358,16

In this paper we use a Bayesian Network (BN) model to estimate the Covid-19 infection prevalence rate (IPR) and infection fatality rate (IFR) for different countries and regions, where relevant data are available. This combines multiple sources of data in a single model. The results show that Chelsea Mass. USA and Gangelt Germany have relatively higher infection prevalence rates (IPR) than Santa Clara USA, Kobe, Japan and England and Wales. In all cases the infection prevalence is significantly higher than what has been widely reported, with much higher community infection rates in all locations. For Santa Clara and Chelsea, both in the USA, the most likely IFR values are 0.3-0.4%. Kobe, Japan is very unusual in comparison with the others with values an order of magnitude less than the others at, 0.001%. The IFR for Spain is centred around 1%. England and Wales lie between Spain and the USA/German values with an IFR around 0.8%. There remains some uncertainty around these estimates but an IFR greater than 1% looks remote for all regions/countries. We use a Bayesian technique called ""virtual evidence"" to test the sensitivity of the IFR to two significant sources of uncertainty: survey quality and uncertainty about Covid-19 death counts.

The strict enforcement of this curfew was extended through May 25, with a gradual relaxation beginning on May 1. This report summarizes an assessment of these early mitigation measures on the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in the island. From March 15 to May 15, 2020, 70,656 results of molecular (RT-PCR) tests were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. Of these, 1,704 were positive, corresponding to 1,311 individuals with COVID-19 included in the study. We derived the epidemic growth rates (r) and the corresponding reproductive numbers (R) from the epidemic curve of these 1,311 individuals with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 using their date of test collection as a proxy for symptoms onset. Through May 31, 2020, there were 143 COVID-19 associated deaths in Puerto Rico, for a case fatality risk of 10.9%. We compared the observed cases and deaths with Gompertz model projections had the mitigation measures not been implemented. The number of daily RT-PCR-confirmed cases peaked on March 30 (85 cases), showing a weekly cyclical trend, with lower counts on weekends and a decreasing secular trend since March 30. The initial exponential growth rate (r) was 15.87% (95% CI: 7.59%, 24.15%), corresponding to R of 1.82 (95% CI:1.37, 2.30). After March 30, the r value reverted to an exponential decay rate (negative) of -2.95% (95% CI: -4.99%, -0.92%), corresponding to R of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.98). We estimate that, had the initial growth rate been maintained, a total of 6,155 additional COVID-19 cases would have occurred by May 15, with 211 additional COVID-19 deaths by May 31. These findings are consistent with very effective implementation of early NPIs as mitigation measures in Puerto Rico. These results also provide a baseline to assess the impact of the transition from mitigation to subsequent containment stages in Puerto Rico.","Valencia, Miguel; Becerra, José E.; Reyes, Juan C.; Castro, Kenneth G.",PLoS One,358,24

We also test whether clear speech can alleviate perceptual difficulty for masked speech. One native and one non-native speaker of English recorded video clips in conversational speech without a mask and conversational and clear speech with a mask. Native English listeners watched video clips presented in quiet or mixed with competing speech. The results showed that word recognition and recall of speech produced with a mask can be as accurate as without a mask in optimal listening conditions. Masks affected non-native speech processing at easier noise levels than native speech. Clear speech with a mask significantly improved accuracy in all listening conditions. Speaking clearly, reducing noise, and using surgical masks as well as good signal amplification can help compensate for the loss of intelligibility due to background noise, lack of visual cues, physical distancing, or non-native speech. The findings have implications for communication in classrooms and hospitals where listeners interact with teachers and healthcare providers, oftentimes non-native speakers, through their protective barriers.","Smiljanic, Rajka; Keerstock, Sandie; Meemann, Kirsten; Ransom, Sarah M.",J Acoust Soc Am,358,1

The same patterns have been seen in hospitalizations. Nevertheless, we show that when a low risk perception occurs, the reduction values decrease between 2% to 4%. Moreover, the increase of disease prevalence also jeopardizes immunization, showing the importance of the mitigation measures maintenance. On the other hand, doubling the vaccination rate would be able to significantly decrease the disease outcomes, reducing deaths by up to 74.4%.

PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging 2019-nCoV pneumonia in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women; age range 16–76 years) with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction underwent thin-section CT. The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were evaluated. RESULTS: Fifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China. Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count. CT images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients. GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients. Forty-four of 51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P < .001).

A sequence-independent virus discovery technique (VIDISCA) was used in combination with high throughput sequencing to detect two novel parvoviruses: a PARV4-like virus named Eh-BtPV-1 in Eidolon helvum from Ghana and the first member of a putative new genus in Artibeus jamaicensis from Panama (Aj-BtPV-1). Those viruses were circulating in the corresponding bat colony at rates of 7–8%. Aj-BtPV-1 was also found in Artibeus lituratus (5.5%).

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline healthcare professionals (HCP) may be at particular risk for infection. No longitudinal data on functional seroconversion in HCP in regions with low COVID-19 prevalence and low pre-test probability exist. METHODS: In a large German university hospital, we performed weekly questionnaire assessments and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) measurements with various commercial tests, a novel surrogate virus neutralisation test, and a neutralisation assay using live SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: From baseline to week 6, 1080 screening measurements for anti-SARS CoV-2 (S1) IgG from 217 frontline HCP (65% female) were performed. Overall, 75.6% of HCP reported at least one symptom of respiratory infection. Self-perceived infection probability declined over time (from mean 20.1% at baseline to 12.4% in week 6, p < 0.001). In sera of convalescent patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, we measured high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, obtained highly concordant results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using e.g. the spike 1 (S1) protein domain and the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) as targets, and confirmed antiviral neutralisation. However, in HCP the cumulative incidence for anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S1) IgG was 1.86% for positive and 0.93% for equivocal positive results over the study period of 6 weeks. Except for one HCP, none of the eight initial positive results were confirmed by alternative serology tests or showed in vitro neutralisation against live SARS-CoV-2. The only true seroconversion occurred without symptoms and mounted strong functional humoral immunity. Thus, the confirmed cumulative incidence for neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 0.47%. CONCLUSION: When assessing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune status in individuals with low pre-test probability, we suggest confirming positive results from single measurements by alternative serology tests or functional assays.

Additionally, little is known about the acceptability of urban-developed survivorship care programs among rural cancer survivors who may have unique values and different attitudes towards help-seeking. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of cancer survivors who return to their rural communities upon completion of active treatment, and to identify the challenges these survivors experience in engaging with quality of life-related support services. The findings of this study will inform the design and development of new interventions, or modification of existing interventions, to better meet the preferences and needs of rural survivors. Identifying the specific challenges and intervention preferences of rural cancer survivors will help to ensure they benefit as much as urban survivors, from efforts to improve post-treatment quality of life. ABSTRACT: The transition from urban centres back to rural and remote communities can be challenging for rural cancer survivors after treatment. This study aimed to (a) provide deeper understanding of the experiences of rural survivors who have completed active cancer treatment and returned to their rural communities, and (b) determine strategies to re-orient existing services or develop new interventions to more appropriately meet rural survivors’ service preferences and needs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 adults (64% female) who lived outside of a metropolitan area and had completed active cancer treatment (n = 13), were the carer for a rural/remote cancer survivor (n = 6), or were both a survivor and carer (n = 3). Thematic analysis was conducted to identify dominant themes in the qualitative data. A range of physical, psychological and practical challenges that impact quality of life among rural survivors post-treatment were found. These challenges appeared to be compounded by a lack of trust in local rural healthcare services and a lack of clear post-treatment pathways to quality of life-enhancing support services.

Limitations for consultations and for follow-up of previous surgical procedures were imposed in order to minimize the risk of contagion in waiting rooms and outpatient clinics. We have identified telemedicine as an alternative way to follow patients during the lockdown. Nevertheless, we have experienced different difficulties. We have not had the possibility to use a secure teleconferencing software. In our unit we had not technological devices. Surgeons in our department were not able to use remote video technology for patient management. Guidelines for an appropriate selection of patients which could be served via telemedicine had to be created. Telemedicine must be regulated by healthcare organizations for legal, ethical, medico-legal and risk management aspects. Even if we have experienced an important need to use telematic solutions during the COVID-19 lockdown, liability and risk management issues has greatly limited this possibility in our unit. The need of telemedicine in the time of COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged us to implement future virtual encounters in order to reduce unnecessary in-person visits by taking into consideration all legal, ethical and medico-legal aspects.","De Santis, Giorgio; Palladino, Teresa; Leti Acciaro, Andrea; Starnoni, Marta",Acta Biomed,358,3

The virus requires an alveolar type-2 pneumocyte in the host to initiate its life cycle. The viral S1 spike protein helps in the attachment of the virus on toACE-2 receptors present on type-2 pneumocytes, and the S2 spike protein helps in the fusion of the viral membrane with the host membrane. Fusion of the SARS-CoV-2virus and host membrane is followed by entry of viral RNA into the host cells which is directly translated into the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) following viral RNA and structural protein syntheses. As the virus replicates within type-2 pneumocytes, the host immune system is activated and alveolar macrophages start secreting cytokines and chemokines, acting as an inflammatory mediator, and chemotactic neutrophils, monocytes, natural NK cells, and CD8+ T cells initiate the local phagocytosis of infected cells. It is not the virus that kills COVID-19 patients; instead, the aberrant host immune response kills them. Modifying the response from the host immune system could reduce the high mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present study examines the viral life cycle intype-2 pneumocytes and resultant host immune response along with possible therapeutic targets.","Singh, Lakhveer; Bajaj, Sakshi; Gadewar, Manoj; Verma, Nitin; Ansari, Mohd Nazam; Saeedan, Abdulaziz S.; Kaithwas, Gaurav; Singh, Manjari",Front Immunol,358,11

Therefore, detecting molecules that can disrupt the nsp10–nsp16 interaction are prospective antiviral drugs. In this study, we screened the North African Natural Products database (NANPDB) for molecules that can interact with the nsp10 interface and disturb the nsp10–nsp16 complex formation. Following rigorous screening and validation steps, in addition to toxic side effects, drug interactions and a risk /benefit assessment, we identified four compounds (genkwanin-6-C-beta-glucopyranoside, paraliane diterpene, 4,5-di-p-trans-coumaroylquinic acid and citrinamide A) that showed the best binding affinity and most favourable interaction with nsp10 interface residues. To understand the conformational stability and dynamic features of nsp10 bound to the four selected compounds, we subjected each complex to 200 ns molecular dynamics simulations. We then calculated the free binding energies of compounds interacting with nsp10 structure using the molecular mechanics-generalised Born surface area (MMGBSA). Of the four compounds, genkwanin-6-C-beta-glucopyranoside demonstrated the most stable complex with nsp10, in addition to a tighter binding affinity of −37.4 ± 1.3 Kcal/mol. This potential to disrupt the nsp10–nsp16 interface interaction and inhibit it now sets the path for functional studies.","Mohammad, Anwar; Alshawaf, Eman; Marafie, Sulaiman K.; Abu-Farha, Mohamed; Al-Mulla, Fahd; Abubaker, Jehad",Biomolecules,358,23

More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease. Objectives: To study the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: we performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital. Measurements and Main Results: The median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar to each other in many respects, such as structure, genetics, and pathobiology. We hypothesized that coronaviruses could affect pulmonary tissues via integration with the critical immune genes after their interaction with renin–angiotensin system (RAS) elements. The aim of the present bioinformatics study was to assess expression changes of the RAS and non-RAS genes, particularly immune response genes, in the lung epithelial cells after infection with SARS-CoV. METHODS: Linear regression, hierarchical clustering, pathway analysis, and network analysis were performed using the E-GEOD-17400 data set. RESULTS: The whole-genome expression data of the lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV for 12, 24, and 48 hours were analyzed, and a total of 15 RAS family and 29 immune genes were found to be highly correlated with the exposure time to the virus in the studied groups. CONCLUSION: RAS genes are important at the initiation of the infections caused by coronavirus family members and may have a strong relationship with the exchange of immune genes in due course following the infection.","Turk, Can; Turk, Seyhan; Temirci, Elif Sena; Malkan, Umit Yavuz; Haznedaroglu, İbrahim C.",J Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst,358,20

In this study, we propose a more flexible geometric structure to be used as a spatial or spatio-temporal scanning window. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the scanning window to determine disease clusters. We evaluated the proposed method over a number of spatial and spatio-temporal datasets (Breast cancer mortality in Northeastern US 1988–1992 and different types of cancer in New Mexico 1982–2007).

In this study, we investigated RNA interference (RNAi), a specific gene silencing process mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes, as an antiviral strategy against HCV. Synthetic siRNAs were designed to target conserved sequences of the HCV 5′ nontranslated region (NTR) located in a functional, stem–loop structured domain of the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which is crucial for initiation of polyprotein translation. Several siRNAs dramatically reduced or even abrogated the replication of selectable subgenomic HCV replicons upon cotransfection of human hepatoma cells with viral target and siRNAs, or upon transfection of cells supporting autonomous replication of HCV replicon with siRNAs. Importantly, three siRNAs also proved capable of strongly inhibiting virus production in cell culture. One siRNA, targeting a sequence that is highly conserved across all genotypes and forms a critical pseudoknot structure involved in translation, was identified as the most promising therapeutic candidate. These results indicate that the HCV life cycle can be efficiently blocked by using properly-designed siRNAs that target functionally important, highly conserved sequences of the HCV IRES. This finding offers a novel approach towards developing IRES-based antiviral treatment for chronic HCV infections.","Chevalier, Christophe; Saulnier, Aure; Benureau, Yann; Fléchet, Dorian; Delgrange, David; Colbère-Garapin, Florence; Wychowski, Czeslaw; Martin, Annette",Mol Ther,358,18

Both global and tissue‐specific deletion studies leading to decreases of the active form of vitamin D, calcitriol [1,25(OH)(2)D], and/or of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), have demonstrated the primary role of calcitriol and VDR in bone, cartilage and tooth development and in the regulation of mineral metabolism and of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and FGF23, which modulate calcium and phosphate fluxes. They have also, however, extended the spectrum of actions of calcitriol and the VDR to include, among others: modulation, jointly and independently, of skin metabolism; joint regulation of adipose tissue metabolism; cardiovascular function; and immune function. Genetic studies in older mice have also shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the important role of the calcitriol/VDR pathway in diseases of aging such as osteoporosis and cancer. In the course of these studies in diverse tissues, important upstream and downstream, often tissue‐selective, pathways have been illuminated, and intracrine, as well as endocrine actions have been described. Human studies to date have focused on acquired or genetic deficiencies of the prohormone vitamin D or the (generally inactive) precursor metabolite 25‐hyrodxyvitamin D, but have yet to probe the pleiotropic aspects of deficiency of the active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, in human disease. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research © 2020 The Authors.

There is growing recognition of the need for public health departments to prioritize a communitywide mental health response strategy to facilitate access to behavioral health services and reduce potential psychological impacts. Due to the US Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) extensive experience providing trauma-informed behavioral healthcare to its Veterans, and the fact that VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) are located throughout the United States, the VA is well situated to be a key partner in local communities’ response plans. In this study we examined the role the VA can play in a community’s behavioral health response using case studies from three disasters. METHODS: This study investigated experiences of VA employees in critical emergency response positions (N = 17) in communities where disasters occurred between 2017 and 2019. All respondents were interviewed March–July 2019. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews exploring participants’ experiences and knowledge about VA activities provided to communities following the regional disasters. Data were analyzed using thematic and grounded theory coding methods. RESULTS: Respondents underscored VA’s primary mission after a disaster was to maintain continuity of care to Veterans. The majority also described the VA supporting community recovery. Specifically, three recent events provided key examples of VA’s involvement in disaster behavioral health response. Each event showed VA’s integration into local response structures was facilitated by pre-existing emergency management and clinical relationships as well as prioritization from VA leadership to engage in humanitarian missions. The behavioral health interventions were provided by behavioral health teams integrated into disaster assistance centers and non-VA hospitals, VA mobile units deployed into the community, and VA telehealth services. CONCLUSIONS: Recent disasters have revealed that coordinated efforts between multidisciplinary agencies can strengthen communities’ capacity to respond to mental health needs, thereby fostering resilience. Building relationships with local VAMCs can help expedite how VA can be incorporated into emergency management strategies. In considering the strengths community partners can bring to bear, a coordinated disaster mental health response would benefit from involving VA as a partner during planning.

Patients with liver metastases usually die of their disease, mostly due to liver failure, since systemic treatments are unable to eradicate micro-metastasis, and interventional loco-regional procedures cannot treat all existing ones. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is the second most common primary liver tumor, showing a poor overall prognosis. When resection is not possible, treatment options include tumor-focused or local ablative therapy, organ-focused or regional therapy and systemic therapy. We reviewed available loco-regional therapeutic options, with particular focus on the CHEMOSAT(®) Melphalan/Hepatic Delivery System (CS-HDS), which is uniquely positioned to perform a percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP), in order to treat the entire liver as a standalone or as complementary therapy. This system isolates the liver circulation, delivers a high concentration of chemotherapy (melphalan), filters most chemotherapy out of the blood and is a repeatable procedure. Most CS-HDS benefits are demonstrated in liver-predominant diseases, like liver metastasis from uveal melanoma (UM), hepatocarcinoma (HCC) and CCA. More than 650 procedures have been performed in Europe to date, mostly to treat liver metastases from UM.

Tests were evaluated on recombinant nucleoprotein, cultured endemic and emerging coronaviruses, stored clinical samples with known SARS-CoV-2 viral loads (n=138), stored samples from patients with respiratory agents other than SARS-CoV-2 (n=100), as well as self-sampled swabs from healthy volunteers (n=35). FindingsLimits of detection in six of seven tested products ranged between 2.08 x 106 and 2.88 x 107 copies per swab, the outlier at 1.58 x 1010 copies per swab. Specificities ranged between 98.53% and 100% in five products, with two outliers at 94.85% and 88.24%. False positive results were not associated with any specific respiratory agent. As some of the tested AgPOCT were early production lots, the observed issues with specificity are unlikely to persist. InterpretationThe sensitivity range of most AgPOCT overlaps with viral load figures typically observed during the first week of symptoms, which marks the infectious period in the majority patients.

We also find evidence that further research has excellent prospects of improving upon these straightforward baselines.","Tan, Chang Wei; Bergmeir, Christoph; Petitjean, François; Webb, Geoffrey I.",Data Min Knowl Discov,358,1

In addition, these vulnerable groups frequently have greater difficulty accessing health services and in treatment adherence. The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of the COVID-19–related lockdown on service utilisation and follow-up adherence in an Italian mental health outpatient service for migrants and individuals in socio-economic difficulties. STUDY DESIGN: The design of this study is a retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: All patients who visited the mental health outpatient service in the months of February and March in the years 2017–2020 were included in the study. To compare service utilisation before and after the lockdown, the number of patients who visited the mental health outpatient service for psychiatric interview were recorded. Follow-up adherence was calculated as the percentage of patients who visited in February and subsequently attended a follow-up visit in March of the same year. RESULTS: The number of patients who visited the outpatient service between February 2017 and February 2020 was continuously increasing. In March 2020, fewer patients visited the service for psychiatric interview, in line with the introduction of lockdown measures. In addition, the number of the patients who visited in February 2020 and returned for their follow-up visits in March 2020 declined from approximately 30% over the same months in 2017–2019 to 17.53% in March 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown-related reduction in numbers of patients accessing the mental health service makes it difficult to help vulnerable populations during a period of time in which their mental health needs are expected to increase. Moreover, the reduction seen in follow-up compliance increases the risk of treatment discontinuation and possible relapse. Proactive alternative strategies need to be developed to reach these vulnerable populations.","Aragona, M.; Barbato, A.; Cavani, A.; Costanzo, G.; Mirisola, C.",Public Health,358,23

However, the order Rodentia (rodents) also harbors coronaviruses, with two human coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) considered to have rodent origins. The coronavirus spike protein mediates viral entry and is a major determinant of viral tropism; importantly, the spike protein is activated by host cell proteases at two distinct sites, designated as S1/S2 and S2’. SARS-CoV-2, which is considered to be of bat origin, contains a cleavage site for the protease furin at S1/S2, absent from the rest of the currently known betacoronavirus lineage 2b coronaviruses (Sarbecoviruses). This cleavage site is thought to be critical to its replication and pathogenesis, with a notable link to virus transmission. Here, we examine the spike protein across coronaviruses identified in both bat and rodent species and address the role of furin as an activating protease. Utilizing two publicly available furin prediction algorithms (ProP and PiTou) and based on spike sequences reported in GenBank, we show that the S1/S2 furin cleavage site is typically not present in bat virus spike proteins but is common in rodent-associated sequences, and suggest this may have implications for zoonotic transfer. We provide a phylogenetic history of the Embecoviruses (betacoronavirus lineage 2a), including context for the use of furin as an activating protease for the viral spike protein. From a One Health perspective, continued rodent surveillance should be an important consideration in uncovering novel circulating coronaviruses.","Stout, Alison E.; Millet, Jean K.; Stanhope, Michael J.; Whittaker, Gary R.",One Health,358,26
