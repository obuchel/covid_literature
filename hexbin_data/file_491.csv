4887,EAP 2019 Congress and Master Course,2019-11-23,"Encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus was isolated from aborted fetuses and lungs of suckling pigs from three Quebec pig farms that experienced outbreaks of reproductive failure in sows and respiratory problems in suckling and post-weaning piglets. Multifocal interstitial pneumonia and mild non-suppurative myocarditis and meningoencephalitis were the more significant histopathological lesions observed in piglets. Vero cells were found to be more sensitive than BHK-21 cells and pig cell lines for primary isolation of EMC virus. The Quebec EMC virus isolates were highly virulent for mice and were antigenically related to reference strain of EMC virus as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence, seroneutralization and Western immunoblotting. Specific virus neutralization antibody titers up to 1:12,800 were detected in samples of thoracic or abdominal fluids of the aborted fetuses.","Dea, S. A.; Bilodeau, R.; Martineau, G.

The ranges widely used in clinical practice reflect these inappropriate sources. The data presented here were obtained using modern methods of analysis on blood samples from healthy, conventionally managed sows from six breeding herds of known disease status in eastern England, and thus represent appropriate ranges for this class of swine. The values differ from earlier reports principally in higher values for total bilirubin, creatine kinase, and more particularly of total plasma and serum proteins. The latter are shown to be due to higher immunoglobulin concentrations than those previously reported.","Heath, M.F.; Evans, R.J.; Gresham, A.C.J.",Br Vet J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130264/,491

Little is known about the complicated interaction during this process at the molecular level. In this study, viral AAPs at 0 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h and 48 h were investigated using a comparative transcriptome analysis to uncover the transcriptional responses of whiteflies to virus infection. Our results have shown that 755, 587, 1140 and 1347 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the comparisons of the data of 0 h vs. 2 h, 0 h vs. 6 h, 0 h vs. 12 h and 0 h vs. 48 h, respectively. KEGG analysis showed that DEGs associated with metabolisms and signal transduction were down-regulated in virus-infected whiteflies. Additionally, 16 up-regulated putative transporter genes and 10 down-regulated genes associated with IL-17 signaling pathway were identified by time-associated gene cluster analysis. These data boost our comprehensions on whitefly-TYLCV interactions associated with different viral AAPs.","Li, Meng; Zhao, Jing; Su, Yun-Lin",Insects,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7290374/,491
12524,Exploring collective emotion transmission in face-to-face interactions,2020-08-07,"Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that have key roles in gene regulation(1,2). Genome-wide occupancy maps of transcriptional regulators are important for understanding gene regulation and its effects on diverse biological processes(3–6). However, only a minority of the more than 1,600 transcription factors encoded in the human genome has been assayed. Here we present, as part of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project, data and analyses from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP–seq) experiments using the human HepG2 cell line for 208 chromatin-associated proteins (CAPs). These comprise 171 transcription factors and 37 transcriptional cofactors and chromatin regulator proteins, and represent nearly one-quarter of CAPs expressed in HepG2 cells. The binding profiles of these CAPs form major groups associated predominantly with promoters or enhancers, or with both. We confirm and expand the current catalogue of DNA sequence motifs for transcription factors, and describe motifs that correspond to other transcription factors that are co-enriched with the primary ChIP target. For example, FOX family motifs are enriched in ChIP–seq peaks of 37 other CAPs. We show that motif content and occupancy patterns can distinguish between promoters and enhancers. This catalogue reveals high-occupancy target regions at which many CAPs associate, although each contains motifs for only a minority of the numerous associated transcription factors. These analyses provide a more complete overview of the gene regulatory networks that define this cell type, and demonstrate the usefulness of the large-scale production efforts of the ENCODE Consortium.","Partridge, E.

16017,Psychometric Properties of the MSLQ-B for Adult Distance Education in China,2021-02-23,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative diseases. There are over 44 million people living with the disease worldwide. While there are currently no effective treatments for AD, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids have the potential to provide a better understanding of Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. Nevertheless, developing brain organoid models is expensive, time consuming and often does not reflect disease progression. Using accurate and inexpensive computer simulations of human brain organoids can overcome the current limitations. Induced whole brain organoids (aiWBO) will greatly expand our ability to model AD and can guide wet lab research. In this study, we have successfully developed and validated artificially induced a whole brain organoid platform (NEUBOrg) using our previously validated machine learning platform, DeepNEU (v6.1). Using NEUBorg platform, we have generated aiWBO simulations of AD and provided a novel approach to test genetic risk factors associated with AD progression and pathogenesis.","Esmail, Sally; Danter, Wayne R.",Front Aging Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7940675/,491
19669,From Face-to-Face to Home-to-Home: Validity of a Teleneuropsychological Battery,2021-06-15,"The role of haem in the activity of cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) is reviewed and a hypothesis postulating multiple effects of haem on enzyme activity under conditions of haem excess or deficiency is proposed, with implications for some therapies of acute hepatic porphyrias. CBS utilises both haem and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) as cofactors. Although haem does not participate directly in the catalytic process, it is vital for PLP binding to the enzyme and potentially also for CBS stability. Haem deficiency can therefore undermine CBS activity by impairing PLP binding and facilitating CBS degradation. Excess haem can also impair CBS activity by inhibiting it via CO resulting from haem induction of haem oxygenase 1 (HO 1), and by induction of a functional vitamin B(6) deficiency following activation of hepatic tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and subsequent utilisation of PLP by enhanced kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) and kynureninase (Kynase) activities. CBS inhibition results in accumulation of the cardiovascular risk factor homocysteine (Hcy) and evidence is emerging for plasma Hcy elevation in patients with acute hepatic porphyrias. Decreased CBS activity may also induce a proinflammatory state, inhibit expression of haem oxygenase and activate the extrahepatic kynurenine pathway (KP) thereby further contributing to the Hcy elevation. The hypothesis predicts likely changes in CBS activity and plasma Hcy levels in untreated hepatic porphyria patients and in those receiving hemin or certain gene-based therapies. In the present review, these aspects are discussed, means of testing the hypothesis in preclinical experimental settings and porphyric patients are suggested and potential nutritional and other therapies are proposed.","Badawy, Abdulla A.-B.",Biosci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8298261/,491
20267,Innovative Strategies of Training Mechanism of Higher Education for New Entrepreneurial Talents,2021-08-09,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is one of the major bacterial pathogens responsible for neonatal sepsis. Whole genome sequencing has, in recent years, emerged as a reliable tool for capsular typing and antimicrobial resistance prediction. This study characterized vaginal and rectal isolates of Group B Streptococcus obtained from pregnant women in Port Harcourt, Nigeria using a whole-genome sequence-based approach. RESULTS: Capsular types Ia, Ib, II, III, IV and V were detected among the 43 isolates sequenced. Twelve sequence types (STs) were identified, with ST19 (n = 9, 27.3 %) and ST486 (n = 5, 15.2 %) the most frequent among non-duplicated isolates. Of the alpha-like proteins (alp) identified, Alp1 was the most prevalent in 11 (33.3 %) isolates. Macrolide and lincosamide resistance determinants were present in 15 (45.5 %) isolates; ermB was detected in 1 (3 %), ermTR in 7 (21.2 %) isolates, lnu gene was detected in 6 (18.2 %) and mef was identified in 3 (9.1 %) isolates. Resistance of GBS to erythromycin and clindamycin (predicted from presence of erm or mef genes) was found to be 30.3 % and 24.2 %, respectively. All isolates were predicted resistant to tetracycline with only the tetM gene identified. Fluoroquinolone-resistance conferring substitutions in gyrA + parC were detected in 9 (27.3 %) isolates and chloramphenicol resistance was predicted from presence of aac6’-aph2 gene in 11 (33.3 %). CONCLUSIONS: The data available from the whole genome sequencing of these isolates offers a small but insightful description of common serotypes and resistance features within colonizing GBS in Nigeria.

23426,Infecties en immunisatie: Een gewaarschuwd mens …,2017-09-26,"BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) has been documented in Africa since 1947 and Asia since 1969. However, the association of congenital ZIKV infection with microcephaly and serious brain defects was not recognized until a large ZIKV outbreak began in Brazil in 2015. A similar association was retrospectively identified in a 2013–2014 French Polynesian outbreak. In this report, we describe two children, ages 6 (Case 1) and 7 years (Case 2), who display a phenotype consistent with CZS. In both cases, the mothers were residing in Cambodia during their pregnancies (2011 and 2010, respectively); Cambodia has reported ZIKV infections since 2007. METHODS: We review epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory data, and the neurodevelopmental status of these two children. RESULTS: Both mothers reported low-grade fever and erythematous rash during their early second trimesters. The infants were born with severe microcephaly (>3 SD below the mean) with central hypotonia and peripheral spasticity (Figure 1). Both had normal karyotypes, negative TORCH results, and neuroimaging suggestive of CZS with subcortical calcifications, polymicrogyria, abnormal corpus callosum, ex-vacuo ventriculomegaly, and reduced white matter (Figure 2). Case 1 had overlapping cranial sutures and redundant scalp (Figure 3). In 2016, serology immunofluorescence assay, immunoglobulin G, and plaque reduction neutralization test for the mother of Case 1 was positive for Zika. Serology for the mother of Case 2 is pending. Presently, both children have severe developmental delays; neither can sit or hold up their head, and both are nonverbal. Case 1 has bilateral hip contractures and hearing loss. Both are visually impaired and require gastrostomy-tube feedings. Case 2 is tracheostomy dependent. CONCLUSION: Given the maternal febrile rash illness, residence in a ZIKV region during pregnancy, infant features consistent with CZS, and the lack of other identified etiology, CZS should be considered as a possible diagnosis in these cases. It suggests that CZS may have occurred prior to the Brazil and French Polynesia outbreaks. Investigations into neurodevelopmental status of older children with possible CZS can provide insights into the possible long-term effects of CZS.

This study aimed to evaluate the independent relationship between chest imaging and mortality and examine the inter-rater variability of interpretations of chest radiographs (CXR) in pediatric ARDS (PARDS). METHODS: Prospective, international observational study in children meeting Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) criteria for PARDS, which requires new infiltrate(s) consistent with pulmonary parenchymal disease, without mandating bilateral infiltrates. Mortality analysis focused on the entire cohort, whereas inter-observer variability used a subset of patients with blinded, simultaneous interpretation of CXRs by intensivists and radiologists. RESULTS: Bilateral infiltrates and four quadrants of alveolar consolidation were associated with mortality on a univariable basis, using CXRs from 708 patients with PARDS. For patients on either invasive (IMV) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with PaO(2)/FiO(2) (PF) ratios (or SpO(2)/FiO(2) (SF) ratio equivalent) > 100, neither bilateral infiltrates (OR 1.3 (95% CI 0.68, 2.5), p = 0.43), nor 4 quadrants of alveolar consolidation (OR 1.6 (0.85, 3), p = 0.14) were associated with mortality. For patients with PF ≤ 100, bilateral infiltrates (OR 3.6 (1.4, 9.4), p = 0.01) and four quadrants of consolidation (OR 2.0 (1.14, 3.5), p = 0.02) were associated with higher mortality. A subset of 702 CXRs from 233 patients had simultaneous interpretations. Interobserver agreement for bilateral infiltrates and quadrants was “slight” (kappa 0.31 and 0.33). Subgroup analysis showed agreement did not differ when stratified by PARDS severity but was slightly higher for children with chronic respiratory support (kappa 0.62), NIV at PARDS diagnosis (kappa 0.53), age > 10 years (kappa 0.43) and fluid balance > 40 ml/kg (kappa 0.48). CONCLUSION: Bilateral infiltrates and quadrants of alveolar consolidation are associated with mortality only for those with PF ratio ≤ 100, although there is high- inter-rater variability in these chest-x ray parameters.

34495,Stille krachten worden zichtbaar,2020-06-15,"BACKGROUND: hepatitis B virus (HBV) and C virus (HCV) are among the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Health care personnel (HCP) are subjected to increased risk of these infections. Therefore, HBV vaccination and post-vaccination serologic testing (PVST) are recommended for them. Our objectives in this study were investigate how well the vaccination guidelines for hospital HCP(s) were implemented. Moreover, the prevalence rates of HBV and HCV infections were calculated. To determine the presence of immunological memory, vaccinated personnel negative to antibody against HB surface antigen with one dose of HB vaccine were boosted. METHODS: From 1 July to 30 November 2017, a cross-sectional study among HCPs working in public hospitals were conducted. All HCPs from various professional categories potentially at risk of exposure to contaminated sources were included. The information was gathered via interview and self-administered questionnaire. The questions were focused on the demographic characteristics, HB vaccination and immunity status and time elapsed since initial vaccination series, and frequency of needelstick injuries during the past 12 months of their work. Moreover, the prevalence rate of HBV and HCV infections were calculated. To determine the presence of immunological memory, subjects negative to HBV seromarkers received a booster dose of the vaccine. RESULTS: A total of 186 out of 766 participants were male and nurses comprised 71% of personnel. Although all HCP were vaccinated, 84% of them completed the course and less than 5% of them received PVST. According to the results, 0.78, 4.6, and 83% were serologically positive to HBV surface antigen, antibodies against HBV core, and S antigens, respectively. Approximately, 91% of seronegative participants responded to a booster dose and only 0.91% of the personnel was anti-HCV positive. CONCLUSION: Most HCP received full HBV vaccination course. Although a minority did PVST, the HBV vaccine-induced long-term protection and HB vaccine booster were not required. Therefore, policies should be made to increase the rate PVST after immunization. According to the results, the HCV infection rate was low and thus pre-recruitment screening was not necessary.","Hiva, Saffar; Negar, Khoshayand; Mohammad-Reza, Parsaei; Gholam-Reza, Ghorbani; Mohsen, Aarabi; Ali-Asghar, Nadi Ghara; Mohammed-Jafar, Saffar",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7291184/,491
34510,Successful Factors for Adoption of Synchronous Tools in Online Teaching at Scale,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with majority of trauma deaths, and objective tools are required to understand the severity of injury. The application of a biomarker like procalcitonin (PCT) in TBI may allow for assessment of severity and thus aid in prognostication and correlation with mortality and outcome. AIMS: The primary objective is to determine the correlation between PCT concentrations with TBI outcomes (mainly in terms of mortality) at intensive care unit (ICU)/hospital discharge. Secondary objectives are to evaluate correlation with associated extra cranial injuries and complications during hospital stay. METHODS: In total, 186 TBI patients aged > 18 years with minimum survival for at least 12 h admitted to the ICU at the level 1 trauma center were prospectively included in the study and divided into two groups: TBI with and without extra cranial injuries. All admitted patients were treated according to the standard institutional protocol. The PCT levels were obtained on admission, on day 2, and 5. Clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and therapeutic data were also collected. Primary mortality is defined as death related to central nervous system (CNS) injury, while secondary mortality defined as death related to sepsis or extracranial cause. RESULTS: Median PCT levels at admission, day 2, and day 5 in TBI patients with extracranial injuries were 3.0, 0.83, and 0.69 ng/ml. In total, primary mortality was observed in 18 (9.7%) patients, while secondary causes were attributable in 20 (12.3%) patients. Regression analysis for primarily CNS cause of mortality showed PCT cutoff level at admission more than 5.5 ng/ml carried sensitivity and specificity of 75%, but for secondary cause (sepsis) of mortality, PCT cutoff values on day 2 > 1.15 ng/ml were derived significant with sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 66%. No significant association of parameters like length of ICU stay, Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), and primary/secondary mortality with the presence of extracranial injuries in TBI patients as compared with TBI alone was noted. CONCLUSION: This observational study demonstrates the poor correlation between PCT concentrations with outcome at days 1, 2, and 5 post-injury. The predicted relationship between PCT levels and outcome was not confirmed, and that these results do not support the prognostic utility of PCT biomarker in this population for outcome (mortality) assessment in TBI patients with or without extracranial injuries.","Goyal, Keshav; Tomar, Gaurav Singh; Sengar, Kangana; Singh, Gyaninder Pal; Aggarwal, Richa; Soni, Kapil Dev; Mathur, Purva; Kedia, Shweta; Prabhakar, Hemanshu",Neurocrit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7292243/,491

DESIGN: A 19-question international, cross-sectional survey on thrombolytic use in pulmonary embolism was developed, validated, and administered. A multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine factors predictive of utilization of thrombolytics in the setting of cardiac arrest secondary to pulmonary embolism. SETTING: International survey study. SUBJECTS: Physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals who were members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thrombolytic users were compared with nonusers. Respondents (n = 272) predominately were physicians (62.1%) or pharmacists (30.5%) practicing in an academic medical center (54.8%) or community teaching setting (24.6%). Thrombolytic users (n = 177; 66.8%) were compared with nonusers (n = 88; 33.2%) Thrombolytic users were more likely to work in pulmonary/critical care (80.2% thrombolytic use vs 59.8%; p < 0.01) and emergency medicine (6.8% vs 3.5%; p < 0.01). Users were more likely to have an institutional guideline or policy in place pertaining to the use of thrombolytics in cardiac arrest (27.8% vs 13.6%; p < 0.01) or have a pulmonary embolism response team (38.6% vs 19.3%; p < 0.01). Lack of evidence supporting use and the risk of adverse outcomes were barriers to thrombolytic use. Working in a pulmonary/critical care environment (odds ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.24–4.52) and comfort level (odds ratio, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.7–4.53) were predictive of thrombolytic use in the multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Most survey respondents used thrombolytics in the setting of cardiac arrest secondary to known or suspected pulmonary embolism. This survey study adds important data to the literature surrounding thrombolytics for pulmonary embolism as it describes thrombolytic user characteristic, barriers to use, and common prescribing practices internationally.","Rech, Megan A.; Horng, Michelle; Holzhausen, Jenna M.; Van Berkel, Megan A.; Sokol, Sarah S.; Peppard, Sarah; Hammond, Drayton A.",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314323/,491

In this paper we present new structural reduction rules for verification of deadlock freedom and safety properties of Petri nets. These new rules are presented together with a large body of rules found in diverse literature. For some rules we leverage an SMT solver to compute if application conditions are met. We use a CEGAR approach based on progressively refining the classical state equation with new constraints, and memory-less exploration to confirm counter-examples. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the usefulness of this structural verification approach.","Thierry-Mieg, Yann",Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324236/,491

In a CMDP, the controller possesses a certain amount of a critical resource, such as electric power. Each action of the controller can consume some amount of the resource. Resource replenishment is only possible in special reload states, in which the resource level can be reloaded up to the full capacity of the system. The task of the controller is to prevent resource exhaustion, i.e. ensure that the available amount of the resource stays non-negative, while ensuring an additional linear-time property. We study the complexity of strategy synthesis in consumption MDPs with almost-sure Büchi objectives. We show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time. We implement our algorithm and show that it can efficiently solve CMDPs modelling real-world scenarios.","Blahoudek, František; Brázdil, Tomáš; Novotný, Petr; Ornik, Melkior; Thangeda, Pranay; Topcu, Ufuk",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363315/,491

However, studies show that incumbent firms have persistent problems with adopting and scaling such practices. In this paper, we present an empirical account of agile transformation in a large manufacturing company that has adopted the SAFe framework. Based on interviews, focus groups, and observation data, we identify three themes for understanding how employees experience and cope with transformative change by: 1) making sense of the new, 2) practicing with peers and 3) letting go of legacy. Key findings are that initially employees are more concerned with making sense of the new rather than with the implementation of agile itself and that implementation of agile happens very gradually over time rather than through major breakthroughs. Thus, it takes time for employees to weather change, become acquainted with the new way of working and stabilize how they work together in the agile teams and across the ARTs (Agile Release Trains).

While infectious SARS-CoV-2 has not previously been identified in wastewater, infectious SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from the feces of at least one patient, raising concerns about the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. The fate and inactivation characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater are unknown, with current inactivation estimates based on surrogate models. In this study, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and RNA signal was determined in water and wastewater. The times for 90% reduction (T(90)) of viable SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and tap water at room temperature were 1.5 and 1.7 days, respectively. In high-starting titer (10(5) TCID(50) mL(–1)) experiments, infectious virus persisted for the entire 7-day sampling time course. In wastewater at 50 and 70 °C, the observed T(90) values for infectious SARS-CoV-2 were decreased to 15 and 2 min, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found to be significantly more persistent than infectious SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the environmental detection of RNA alone does not substantiate risk of infection.","Bivins, Aaron; Greaves, Justin; Fischer, Robert; Yinda, Kwe Claude; Ahmed, Warish; Kitajima, Masaaki; Munster, Vincent J.; Bibby, Kyle",Environ Sci Technol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7553037/,491

42193,Announcements,2020-11-18,"OBJECTIVES: First responders are at elevated risk for psychological distress from frequent exposure to potentially traumatic events. Self-compassion may buffer against the negative impact of these stressors, and the potential emotional challenges of having high levels of compassion for others. However, little is known about the psychological impact of compassion in first responders. We examined how self-compassion, compassionate love for others, and service role interacted to predict mental health in a diverse group of first responders. METHODS: First responders (N = 171) with both traditional and emotional support roles completed an online survey including measures of self-compassion, compassionate love, psychological distress, post-traumatic stress, secondary traumatic stress, burnout, resilience, compassion satisfaction, and life satisfaction. RESULTS: Greater self-compassion and compassionate love both independently predicted less depersonalization (|β|s ≥ .18, ps < .01). Greater self-compassion predicted less general psychological distress, post-traumatic stress, secondary traumatic stress, and emotional exhaustion, as well as greater resilience and life satisfaction (|β|s ≥ .35, ps < .001). Greater compassionate love predicted greater personal accomplishment and compassion satisfaction for all first responders (|β|s ≥ .30, ps < .001); for traditional first responders only, greater self-compassion predicted greater personal accomplishment and compassion satisfaction (role x self-compassion; |β|s ≥ .16, ps < .05). Emotional support first responders reported less emotional exhaustion and greater resilience than traditional first responders (|β|s ≥ .21, ps < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Self-compassion and compassionate love each play important roles in promoting mental health among first responders.

Self-reported data were gathered from informal caregivers providing care to someone aged 50+ (n=835) through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Respondents reported their current and pre-pandemic health behaviors and demographics. Chi-square tests were used to examine bivariate associations between pandemic time (pre vs. post) and each examined behavior.

Slow travel aims to encourage individuals to travel to their destinations more slowly, stay for a longer period in the chosen destination, and travel less. For slow travellers, travelling to the destination is a significant part of the travel experience. The qualitative research aimed to understand the phenomena of travelling by land and the tourist experience holistically using a netnographic approach. The data was collected from the Finnish Facebook -group, Maata pitkin matkustavat. (Those who travel by land) in January 2020. The data consisted of 185 posts and their comments. The goal of the data analysis was to understand the role of consumer value in the slow travel experience. The research findings show the importance of minimizing travel time and the costs of travelling by land. Also, leisure time, and “having fun” are valued in travelling by land experience. Thus, self-oriented, active value components, Efficiency, and Play, were most applicable in the collected data set.

However, the clinical impact of implementing CYP2C19 gene-guided pharmacotherapy is unclear, especially among the Chinese population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate P2Y12 receptor inhibitor selection and clinical outcomes upon implementation of CYP2C19 genotype-guided pharmacotherapy in current clinical practice. Methods: This was a single-center observational cohort study. Adult percutaneous coronary intervention patients who received CYP2C19 genetic testing (*2, *3, *17 alleles) were included. Ticagrelor was recommended for patients with a LOF allele. Factors related to P2Y12 inhibitor selection were determined by logistic regression. The primary endpoint was major cardiac or cerebrovascular adverse events (MACCE) within 12 months. MACCE and clinically significant bleeding events (BARC ≥2) in the LOF-clopidogrel group, non-LOF-clopidogrel group, and non-LOF-ticagrelor group were compared with those in the LOF-ticagrelor group. The inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was adjusted in a Cox regression analysis to eliminate confounding factors. Results: Among 1,361 patients, 826 (60.7%) had a LOF allele. Patients with a LOF allele were more likely to be prescribed ticagrelor (multivariate-adjusted OR 1.349; 95% CI 1.040 to 1.751; p = 0.024). The MACCE rate was higher in the LOF-clopidogrel group than in the LOF-ticagrelor group (7.8 vs. 4.0%; log-rank p = 0.029; IPTW-adjusted HR 2.138; 95% CI 1.300–3.515). Compared with the LOF-ticagrelor group, the non-LOF-clopidogrel group showed no significant difference in MACCE rate (5.8 vs. 4.0%; log-rank p = 0.272; IPTW-adjusted HR 1.531; 95% CI 0.864–2.714). Among the patients treated with ticagrelor, there was no significant difference in the MACCE rate between the LOF group and non-LOF group (4.3 vs. 4.0%; log-rank p = 0.846; IPTW-adjusted HR 1.184; 95% CI 0.582–2.410). There was no significant difference in the incidence of clinically significant bleeding events among the four groups. Conclusion: This study confirms that efficiently returned CYP2C19 genotype results did partially guide cardiologists to prescribe ticagrelor for patients with a LOF allele, and that clopidogrel had a higher risk of MACCE than ticagrelor in these patients, which provides support for the implementation of CYP2C19 gene-guided antiplatelet therapy in clinical practice.","Zhang, Yi; Shi, Xiu-Jin; Peng, Wen-Xing; Han, Jia-Lun; Lin, Bai-Di; Zhang, Ru; Zhang, Yun-Nan; Yan, Jia-Lin; Wei, Juan-Juan; Wang, Yi-Fan; Chen, Su-Wei; Nan, Nan; Fang, Zhen-Wei; Zeng, Yong; Lin, Yang",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7854467/,491

Borders do not only act as barriers with friction costs in an otherwise open human interaction space; they are multidimensional organizing principles for mobility, interaction, location, and socio-cultural identities of areas. The existence of borders does therefore not necessarily mean exclusively the existence of costly impedance and transaction frictions. Starting from a historical sketch of focal points in regional science, the paper seeks to develop the contours of a new conceptualisation of enabling space in which borders may be seen as opportunities for innovative development in a cross-border space-economy. Amartya Sen’s capability theory will be used as a cornerstone for a novel interpretation of borders to be used by smart and alert actors as a challenging and promising portfolio of cooperative development strategies for people, business agents, and spatial cohesion policy.

The key reason behind this is the restricted provision of parking lots and the struggle to spot vacant parking space during peak times. To overcome this restriction, one solution is to create smart allocation of free spaces that are easier to locate and use (i.e., trusted and privacy preserved for user or driver). In this work, we provide privacy preserved parking allotment (as a smart solution) to users (or vehicle users) who are willing to pay more charges when they require parking slot near to their destination (or urgent need). In this work (called as P3 Block: Privacy Preserving parking using Blockchain 2.0), one useful and different approach we used as “Incentive based smart parking”. People will get cashback or reward for alerting or spreading genuine information among users. Also, miner will be rewarded for verifying users. Incentive feature will attract more users, also more trust and reputation of specific service provider matter a lot in providing efficient parking slot to vehicle user. Today world is moving towards automation, so automation will be available in all possible applications like manufacturing, finance, retail, food supply management, transportation, home appliances, etc.","Tyagi, Amit Kumar; Kumari, Shabnam; Fernandez, Terrance Frederick; Aravindan, C.",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974946/,491

Nonetheless, they have been unable to present a cohesive response to this challenge as a result of troubled trans-Atlantic relations as well as growing divisions within the EU, fuelled in part by China’s expanding influence in Europe. This paper offers recommendations on how the United States and Europe might be able to repair trans-Atlantic relations and work to counter China’s state-driven technology policies, reform the WTO and establish standards for global infrastructure development. On the security front, they should uphold the 2016 international court ruling and directly challenge China’s maritime claims by conducting more frequent joint naval operations in the region. Finally, they need to work with NGOs to publicise China’s gross human rights violations while expanding ties with Taiwan to bolster its democracy against Chinese coercion. These efforts should underscore that China can no longer benefit from the current system by taking advantage of its rules and norms but should, instead, abide by and help to maintain and strengthen this rules-based order.","Wang, Robert",A New Beginning or More of the Same?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979960/,491

The use of graph theory enables the users to understand and visualize the situations like COVID-19. Looking at this pandemic disease, its impact and the preventing measures, the graph theory would be the most appropriate way to exercise the graph models with theoretical as well as practical aspects to control this epidemic. In the context of COVID-19, this chapter defines the variable set, variable graphs, and their types considering the variations in the vertex sets and edge sets. The virus graph and their type are discussed in this chapter that states that the Virus graph type I and III are not so perilous for all living beings, but virus graph type III and IV are extremely hazardous for the harmony of the world. Initially, the COVID-19 was in Virus graph-I type, but presently it is in Virus graph-II type. Given different aspects for expansion of pandemic, this chapter presents growth types of virus graphs and their variation as 1-1, 1-P, and 1-all growth types. This chapter provide the number of infected people after ‘n’ number of days concerning different values of P and growth rates with I0 = 100. At the end of this chapter, the country-wise starting dates of stages of the virus graph-I and II are specified.

Formal models like Petri nets with transits and Petri games can prevent errors when developing such algorithms. Petri nets with transits allow us to follow the data flow between components in a distributed system. They can be model checked against specifications in LTL on both the local data flow and the global behavior. Petri games allow the synthesis of local controllers for distributed systems from safety specifications. Modeling problems in these formalisms requires defining extended Petri nets which can be cumbersome when performed textually. In this paper, we present a web interface (The web interface is deployed at http://adam.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de.) that allows an intuitive, visual definition of Petri nets with transits and Petri games. The corresponding model checking and synthesis problems are solved directly on a server. In the interface, implementations, counterexamples, and all intermediate steps can be analyzed and simulated.

Based on the planned risk information-seeking model and its extended framework, two predictive models were constructed: one for cancer information seeking and the other for cancer information avoidance. A structural equation modeling strategy was applied to survey data from China HINTS 2017 (n = 3090) to compare the impact of traditional mass media and social media exposure to cancer-related information on cancer information-seeking and information-avoidance behaviors. The study findings suggest that health-related information exposure through different media channels may generate distinctive information-seeking or information-avoidance behaviors based on various cancer beliefs. Additionally, the findings indicate that social media exposure to health-related and cancer curability beliefs does not lead to cancer information avoidance; both mass media and social media exposure encourage people to seek cancer-related information. Cancer fatalism is positively associated with cancer information-seeking and avoiding intentions, suggesting that negative cancer beliefs predict seemingly contradictory yet psychologically coherent information intentions and behaviors.","He, Rui; Li, Yungeng",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8002949/,491

Our aim was to evaluate possible sex-related differences and factors associated with in-hospital mortality (IHM) in a consecutive cohort of elderly patients with cancer admitted to internal medicine. We included all patients admitted to our department with a diagnosis of cancer during 2018. Based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, demography, comorbidity burden, and diagnostic procedures were evaluated, with IHM as our outcome. We evaluated 955 subjects with cancer (23.9% of total hospital admissions), 42.9% were males, and the mean age was 76.4 ± 11.4 years. Metastatic cancer was diagnosed in 18.2%. The deceased group had a higher modified Elixhauser Index (17.6 ± 7.7 vs. 14 ± 7.3, p < 0.001), prevalence of cachexia (17.9% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001), and presence of metastasis (27.8% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.001) than survivors. Females had a higher age (77.4 ± 11.4 vs. 75.5 ± 11.4, p = 0.013), and lower comorbidity (10.2 ± 5.9 vs. 12.0 ± 5.6, p < 0.001) than males. IHM was not significantly different among sex groups, but it was independently associated with cachexia and metastasis only in women. Comorbidities are highly prevalent in patients with cancer admitted to the internal medicine setting and are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, especially in female elderly patients with advanced disease.","De Giorgi, Alfredo; Fabbian, Fabio; Cappadona, Rosaria; Tiseo, Ruana; Molino, Christian; Misurati, Elisa; Gambuti, Edoardo; Savriè, Caterina; Boari, Benedetta; Raparelli, Valeria; Manfredini, Roberto",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8004908/,491

INTERVENTION: A dedicated ward was opened as part of the trust-wide Covid-19 admissions pathway, led by geriatricians with palliative care input and staffed by relocated nursing and auxiliary personnel. Retrospective data was collected for consecutive patients admitted to the ward between 3rd April and 26th May 2020 and qualitative data regarding staff experience using a questionnaire. RESULT: Of the 168 patients (55% male) admitted, 31.5% came directly from Emergency Department, 17.3% from admission areas and the remainder from inpatient wards. Time spent on the ward ranged from 10 minutes to 17 days (median length of stay 43 hours). 75% had Clinical Frailty Scale score of 6 or more. 150 died with 75% naming Covid-19 as primary cause or contributing factor. Ward staff, who were not palliative care specialists, reported increased confidence in many aspects of palliation including assessing comfort, relieving symptoms, prescribing and administering anticipatory medications and in supporting and communicating with relatives. Staff apprehension about working on a Covid ward eased once the ward was established. Qualitative themes emerging from staff feedback included: professional competency, communication, prioritisation, team work, emotional response, care and consistency in a time of change. DISCUSSION: The pathway and referral system ensured that our ward cared for appropriate older patients living with frailty. The formation of a specialist unit over a short period of time created a series of logistical and management challenges. The emotional burden felt by staff was also prominent in feedback. These challenges were outweighed by the personal and professional development of staff coupled with the strong sense of teamwork, pride and enthusiasm felt in providing high quality care.","Arnott, R; Lewis, A; Berbecila, D; Deery, J; Wells, L; Poon, M H",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989600/,491

Soon after, the virus had spread around the world and became a pandemic. Social restrictions, quarantines, and other governmental policies in response to the pandemic altered normal operations across the world. One area significantly affected is human mobility. Typical movement patterns have been hindered by the pandemic. But inversely, mobility patterns can influence patterns of the virus. With this in mind, we created an interactive web application to visualize in near-real time the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and human mobility, as well as the impact of governmental policies at different spatial scales. The web application allows users to select a country at the global scale or a state or county for the USA and then displays a corresponding plot that compares human mobility to COVID-19 cases across time for the location, as well as to policy data. The application is useful for quickly revealing insightful patterns. First, the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was a rather sudden decrease in mobility. Second, a relationship exists between mobility and COVID-19 offset by a lag, but that lag is not consistent over space or time. Third, spatial autocorrelation of relationship is apparent, meaning locations near each other share similar patterns. Overall, the application is a useful data visualization tool that helps uncover patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.

We aimed to evaluate whether chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) affect the expression of viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) in the liver. METHODS: Twelve pairs of matched liver tissues of HCC and para-carcinoma were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. And 20 liver biopsies from CHB patients were collected from Peking University People's Hospital. The expression of ACE2 and TMRPSS2 were detected using immunofluorescence staining, western blot, and RT-qPCR. The effects of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication or interferon on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression were tested in hepatic cell lines. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of TMPRSS2 in HCC tissues was six-fold higher than that of para-carcinoma tissues (P = 0.002), whereas that of ACE2 was not statistically different between HCC and para-carcinoma tissues. Hepatocellular ACE2 expression was detected in 35% (7/20) of CHB patients and mostly distributed in the inflammatory areas. However, there was no difference in TMPRSS2 expression between areas with or without inflammation. IFN-α2b slightly induced ACE2 expression (2.4-fold, P = 0.033) in HepG2 cells but not in Huh-7, QSG-7701, and L-02 cells. IFN-α2b did not affect TMPRSS2 expression in these cell lines. In addition, HBV replication did not alter ACE2 expression in HepAD38 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Although HBV replication does not directly affect the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, intrahepatic inflammation and carcinogenesis may increase their expression in some patients, which, in turn, may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection in hepatocytes.","Hu, Xiao-Xiao; Ma, Yan-Xiu; Lin, Yao-Xiang; Wu, Xiang-Ji; Wu, Jing; Ma, Hui; Lin, Sheng-Zhang; Chen, Gong-Yin; Pan, Xiao-Ben",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8057318/,491

The pathogenesis of Graves’ disease is still an area of active research. We present a case of Graves’ disease, which developed following SARS-CoV2 infection. Clinical Case: A 43-year-old man with no prior history of thyroid disease, presented for evaluation due to fatigue palpitations, tremors, and hair loss in June 2020. Earlier that month, he was diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 infection and his thyroid function tests (TFTs) during a visit to the emergency department revealed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level of <0.010 mIU/L (0.35-4.94) with a free T4 (FT4) 1.4 ng/dL (0.7-1.5); consistent with subclinical hyperthyroidism. He continued to report palpitations and tremors and further workup was done. A thyroid ultrasound showed two sub-centimeter nodules. A thyroid uptake scan followed, which showed heterogeneous activity in the thyroid gland, (12% and 32% uptake at 6 and 24 hours respectively) with focal increased uptake in the medial lobes, without cold nodules or hot nodules. Repeat TFTs one month later showed a suppressed TSH <0.010 mIU/L, and a normal FT4 1.3 ng/dL. Given suspicion for Graves’ disease, further labs were ordered. Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) were found to be elevated at 173 % baseline (<=140). Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies were also elevated at 362 IU/mL H* (<=9) and 2 IU/mL H* (<=1) respectively. The overall picture was consistent with evolving early Graves’ disease. Conclusion: Multiple factors are frequently cited in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hyperthyroidism including viral and bacterial infections(1) and there have been several reported cases of autoimmune disease related to SARS-CoV2 infection(2). This case is one of several emerging cases of autoimmune hyperthyroidism possibly linked to COVID-19. References: 1. Smith, T. J . Graves’ Disease.

While previous research has established why and how coalitions emerge and dissolve, how they are maintained and the outcomes they generate have been less explored, especially in housing studies. This research contributes to the study of movement coalitions through an empirical examination of the dynamics of how coalitions interact, cooperate, and sustain alliances, in addition to exploring the outcomes that are produced as a result of these coalitions. It draws upon a comparative approach of housing coalitions in Dublin and Lisbon, where local housing groups have played a critical role in protesting against housing injustices and in articulating alternative policy solutions to the housing crisis. In mapping the diversity of coalition members, this research finds that tolerance for difference and negotiation capacity impacts how long coalitions last as well as the outcomes that they lead to. This study contributes to the study of coalitions by analyzing the relationship between outcomes and the mechanisms which sustain coalitions using a comparative framework.","Lima, Valesca",Comp Eur Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8108406/,491

Herein, we report a rapid, noninvasive, and high-throughput analytical chemical methodology, aiming at real-time monitoring of skin conditions and early detection of skin disorders. Within this methodology, adhesive sampling and laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry are coordinated to record skin surface molecular mass in minutes. Automated result interpretation is achieved by data learning, using similarity scoring and machine learning algorithms. Feasibility of the methodology has been demonstrated after testing a total of 117 healthy, benign-disordered, or malignant-disordered skins. Remarkably, skin malignancy, using melanoma as a proof of concept, was detected with 100% accuracy already at early stages when the lesions were submillimeter-sized, far beyond the detection limit of most existing noninvasive diagnosis tools. Moreover, the malignancy development over time has also been monitored successfully, showing the potential to predict skin disorder progression. Capable of detecting skin alterations at the molecular level in a nonsurgical and time-saving manner, this analytical chemistry platform is promising to build personalized skin care.","Zhu, Yingdi; Lesch, Andreas; Li, Xiaoyun; Lin, Tzu-En; Gasilova, Natalia; Jović, Milica; Pick, Horst Matthias; Ho, Ping-Chih; Girault, Hubert H.",JACS Au,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8154208/,491

We also sought to document teachers’ perspectives on how they attended to equity in mathematics to support students with language barriers. We interviewed nine teachers to explore their perspectives of factors that support or hinder equity in mathematics teaching and learning during remote instruction compared to face-to-face instruction and how they support the diverse needs (inclusive of language barriers) of students. There were salient factors in this study that supported or hindered equitable mathematics instruction, such as teachers’ beliefs, expectations for students, access to resources, students’ socioeconomic status, and language barriers. Hence, it is recommended that policymakers, school administrators, and teachers need to collaborate to systematically plan to ensure that all students have access to quality mathematics.","Yılmaz, Zuhal; Gülbağcı Dede, Hande; Sears, Ruthmae; Yıldız Nielsen, Selin",Educ Stud Math,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8170451/,491

The burden of COVID-19 varies between and within countries due to differences in contextual and individual factors, transmission rates, and clinical and public health interventions. OBJECTIVES: To identify high-risk areas, between April and October, on a weekly basis and at the municipality level, and to assess the temporal evolution of COVID-19, considering municipalities classified by incidence levels. METHODS: This is an ecological study following a 3-step approach, i.e., (1) calculation of the relative risk (RR) of the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases, weekly, per municipality, using a spatial scan analysis; (2) classification of the municipalities according to the European Centre for Disease Control incidence categorization on November 19; and (3) characterization of RR temporal evolution by incidence groups. RESULTS: Between April and October, the mean RR was 0.53, with a SD of 1.44, varying between 0 and 46.4. Globally, the north and Lisbon and Tagus Valley (LVT) area were the regions with the highest number of municipalities with a RR above 3.2. In April and beginning of May, most of the municipalities with an RR above 3.2 were from the north, while between May and August most municipalities with an RR above 3.2 were from LVT area. Comparing the incidence in November and retrospectively analyzing the RR showed the huge variation, with municipalities with an RR of 0 at a certain time classified as extremely high in November. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed considerable variation in RR over time and space, with no consistent “better” or “worst” municipality. In addition to the several factors that influence COVID-19 transmission dynamics, there were some outbreaks over time and throughout the country and this may contribute to explaining the observed variation. Over time, on a weekly basis, it is important to identify critical areas allowing tailored and timely interventions in order to control outbreaks in early stages.","Moniz, Marta; Soares, Patrícia; Nunes, Carla",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8247836/,491
55513,Enabling customer co-creation behavior at a distance: the case of patients using self-monitoring handheld devices in healthcare,2021-07-05,"The existing contagious epidemic disease, [SARS]‐CoV‐2, has been one of the biggest public health problems that humankind combatting against since December 2019. Answering the increase in the number of infected patients during the pandemic is one of the biggest challenges for healthcare systems, where resources have already been employed by a significant number of patients. While assigning most of the resources to infected people is an effective way in a short‐term planning, its bitter effects on regular healthcare cannot be undervalued. Moreover, within this plan the risk of spreading the disease to other patients and healthcare providers is another risk that should not be underestimated. Therefore, in this study, we proposed the Delphi‐based multicriteria decision‐making (MCDM) framework for selecting the most appropriate location for an isolation hospital serving only epidemic‐based patients with mild to moderate symptoms. The integrated framework consists of Delphi, Best–Worst Method, and interval type‐2 fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methodologies. Nine most effecting criteria are considered in the evaluation of five alternative locations in a real case study conducted at the European side of Istanbul. Ataturk Airport is determined as the best location to set up an isolation hospital based on determined nine evaluation criteria. The effectiveness and robustness of the framework are analyzed through comparative and sensitivity analyses.","Aydin, Nezir; Seker, Sukran",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250932/,491

56625,Digitale en fysieke zorg: op zoek naar evenwicht,2021-08-09,"Background: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening chronic cardiopulmonary disease. However, there are limited studies reflecting the available biomarkers from separate gene expression profiles in PAH. This study explored two microarray datasets by an integrative analysis to estimate the molecular signatures in PAH. Methods: Two microarray datasets (GSE53408 and GSE113439) were exploited to compare lung tissue transcriptomes of patients and controls with PAH and to estimate differentially expressed genes (DEGs). According to common DEGs of datasets, gene and protein overrepresentation analyses, protein–protein interactions (PPIs), DEG–transcription factor (TF) interactions, DEG–microRNA (miRNA) interactions, drug–target protein interactions, and protein subcellular localizations were conducted in this study. Results: We obtained 38 common DEGs for these two datasets. Integration of the genome transcriptome datasets with biomolecular interactions revealed hub genes (HSP90AA1, ANGPT2, HSPD1, HSPH1, TTN, SPP1, SMC4, EEA1, and DKC1), TFs (FOXC1, FOXL1, GATA2, YY1, and SRF), and miRNAs (hsa-mir-17-5p, hsa-mir-26b-5p, hsa-mir-122-5p, hsa-mir-20a-5p, and hsa-mir-106b-5p). Protein–drug interactions indicated that two compounds, namely, nedocromil and SNX-5422, affect the identification of PAH candidate biomolecules. Moreover, the molecular signatures were mostly localized in the extracellular and nuclear areas. Conclusions: In conclusion, several lung tissue-derived molecular signatures, highlighted in this study, might serve as novel evidence for elucidating the essential mechanisms of PAH. The potential drugs associated with these molecules could thus contribute to the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to ameliorate PAH.","Yao, Xiaoting; Jing, Tian; Wang, Tianxing; Gu, Chenxin; Chen, Xi; Chen, Fengqiang; Feng, Hao; Zhao, Huiying; Chen, Dekun; Ma, Wentao",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8346036/,491
57298,Exploring critical factors of the perceived usefulness of a learning analytics dashboard for distance university students,2021-09-02,"STUDY QUESTION: How was the Logbook for the Nurses and Midwives Certification programme of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) developed? SUMMARY ANSWER: The Logbook for the ESHRE Nurses and Midwives Certification programme, which questions 56 roles, was developed based on an extensive literature review and expert opinion. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The ESHRE Executive Committee established the Nurses and Midwives Certification Committee (NMCC) in 2012. Since inception (2015), the certification programme has been delivered annually, with the exception of 2020 because of SARS-CoV-2. One-hundred-fourteen nurses/midwives have obtained ESHRE certification (passing rate=72%) and the programme is now accessible to nurses/midwives globally. The Certification program aims (i) to recognise the extended role of nurses/midwives delivering fertility care and (ii) to expand their theoretical background. The pre-requisites for certification are (i) being educated to a bachelor level of education and (ii) completing a practice based Logbook to demonstrate supervision of professional experience. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Between 2012 and 2014, the NMCC completed a systematic literature search for papers relating to clinical, non-clinical and extended roles of nurses and midwives in fertility settings. In addition, the NMCC invited a larger expert panel of European senior nurses and midwives to a meeting to discuss their needs and preferences regarding the certification programme and to survey the diverse roles performed by nurses and midwives in their country. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The NMCC comprised four nurses/midwives, one clinical embryologist, and one medical doctor (both in advisory capacity). The Medline database was searched by entering a search string in PubMed combining (MeSH) terms related to reproductive medicine and nursing or midwifery. Opinion and empirical papers relating to roles of nurses/midwives in fertility settings were included. The surveyed expert panel included twelve nurses/midwives, representing Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 49 papers, of which 24 empirical papers, were identified with the search string (n = 47) and snowball strategy (n = 2). The papers originated from 13 countries spread across Asia, Oceania, Europe, and North America. All twelve European senior nurses and midwives responded to the survey. Finally, 56 different roles were included in the Logbook. Forty-four roles were performed by nurses/midwives working in fertility settings according to the surveyed expert panel (n = 18), the literature (n = 8), or both the surveyed expert panel and literature (n = 18). An additional twelve observations of laboratory procedures were added by the NMCC. Substantial variation in roles and responsibilities existed across the countries from which the evidence originated. Whereas a considerate proportion of roles were performed in at least five countries (n = 16/56), a minority of roles were only performed by nurses/midwives in some countries (n = 7/56). Eight specialist roles (e.g. embryo transfer) were performed independently by nurses/midwives in some countries, whilst in other countries, nurses/midwives merely had an assisting role. In addition to completing the Logbook, participants were expected to write two ethical cases according to a guideline, testifying to their ability to reflect as a senior nurse/midwife. From 2015, the content of the Logbook was further developed. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This abstract relates to the development and content of the Logbook and not the curriculum/educational material required for the theoretical exam of the Nurses and Midwives Certification programme. The NMCC continuously improves the Logbook and elements have been added and removed since its creation. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The review and survey illustrated the variation in roles and responsibilities of nurses/midwives across the studied countries, further highlighting the opportunity for professional development within fertility care. Further research is required to elicit the experience of certified nurses/midwives with the programme and its impact on their professional and personal development.

57586,"Realising the Good University: Social Innovation, Care, Design Justice and Educational Infrastructure",2021-09-09,"Young carers (YCs) are children and youth who provide caregiving for family members who may experience an illness, disability, addiction, language barriers, and/or age-related needs. Many of them show compassion towards others and continue to put their family members’ needs before their own. They also report having no time for other activities or for themselves due to the caregiving role. Self-compassion might allow YCs to be kind to themselves, be mindful of their emotions, and understand that others, like them, go through similar experiences. While the relationship between outward and inward compassion has been examined in past research, studies have yet to determine YCs’ self-compassion level in the context of providing care for others. The purpose of this qualitative study was to gain a better understanding of what compassion and self-compassion meant for YCs and whether they saw themselves as self-carers in addition to being caregivers. Six focus groups with YCs ages 12 to 18 years (n = 33) were conducted. Eight boys and 26 girls were divided into younger and older focus groups. A constant comparison analysis yielded three major themes: characteristics of compassion, self-compassion in YCs, and supports for self-compassion. Overall, YCs showed continual compassion for their loved ones, but despite understanding the value of self-care and self-compassion in one’s lives, very few YCs displayed self-compassion. Some reported conflicts and tensions within them and between them and their family member(s). The role of parents and YC programs were addressed as a possibility for supporting self-compassion.","Berardini, Yana; Chalmers, Heather; Ramey, Heather",Child Adolesc Social Work J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8417674/,491

Three driving simulator experiment scenarios were developed to simulate the typical traffic and weather conditions on the rural Interstate 80 (I-80) in Wyoming. A total of 25 professional drivers from the WYDOT and trucking industry were recruited to participate in the driving simulator experiment. Participants' instantaneous speeds at various locations were collected to reveal the effects of CV TIMs on their speed selection. The results showed that average speed profiles under CV scenarios were generally lower than under baseline scenarios, particularly for winter conditions (snowy and severe weather). The variance of speed under CV scenarios was found to be significantly lower than the baseline scenarios, indicating that CV TIMs have the potential to harmonize the variations in speed. In addition, for the work zone driving simulator experiment, this research revealed that the mean time-to-collision (TTC) under baseline scenario is approximately 40 % lower than CV scenario, and the mean deceleration to avoid a crash (DRAC) under baseline scenario is approximately 19.3 % higher than CV scenario. These findings suggest that CV TIMs can reduce the risk of crashes. Research findings would provide the WYDOT with early insights into the effectiveness of CV TIMs, which could assist with developing more efficient transportation management strategies under adverse weather conditions.","Yang, Guangchuan; Ahmed, Mohamed; Gaweesh, Sherif; Adomah, Eric",Accident; analysis and prevention,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2020.105707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818760/,491

OBJECTIVE To assess patterns of intravenous iodinated/gadolinium-based contrast material (ICM/GBCM) use in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS Society of Chairs of Radiology in Children's Hospitals (SCORCH) members were invited to complete a Web-based survey regarding intravenous contrast material use at their institutions. RESULTS Sixty-six percent (42/64) of SCORCH member institutions responded, 76% of which are academic hospitals. Ioversol and gadopentetate dimeglumine are the most commonly used ICMs and GBCMs (52% and 81%, respectively). Premedication policies to mitigate risk of allergic-like contrast reactions are more common for ICMs than GBCMs (71% vs. 32%). For both ICMs and GBCMs, most institutions premedicate or avoid contrast material in the setting of a prior allergic-like contrast reaction of any severity. Policies regarding ICM and GBCM use in children with renal insufficiency are in place at 74% and 88% of institutions, respectively, but are variable. CONCLUSION Policies concerning premedication for prevention of allergic-like contrast agent reactions and administration of contrast materials in children with renal insufficiency are variable and not consistently present at all pediatric institutions. This highlights the need for standardization of practice patterns and pediatric-specific research on these topics.","Trout, Andrew T; Dillman, Jonathan R; Ellis, James H; Cohan, Richard H; Strouse, Peter J",Pediatric radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00247-011-2112-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21594547/,491

A 44-item Likert-type, web-based survey was distributed to Montana-based professionals who directly provide suicide prevention services to American Indians at risk for suicide. Descriptive statistics were calculated for survey items, and Mann-Whitney U tests examined the differences in telehealth use, training, skills among Montana geographic areas, and barriers between providers and their clients/patients. Results: Among the 80 respondents, two-thirds agreed or strongly agreed that American Indians experienced greater social disconnection since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Almost 98% agreed that telehealth was needed, and 93% were willing to use telehealth for suicide prevention services. Among current users, 75% agreed telehealth was effective for suicide prevention. Over one-third of respondents reported using telehealth for the first time during COVID-19 pandemic, and 30% use telehealth at least ""usually"" since the COVID-19 pandemic began, up from 6.3%.

72665,"Employer Liability for ""Take-Home"" COVID-19.",2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Kawasaki disease is an acute, self-limited vasculitis of childhood. The increasing frequency of the disease as well as the deficiency of specific diagnostic means renders its diagnosis and treatment an area of intense investigation. The purpose of this review is to summarize all the known features of Kawasaki disease and also give an insight to the latest findings. RECENT FINDINGS Kawasaki disease is one of the leading causes of acquired heart disease in children while its cause remains essentially unknown. Viruses, bacterial conventional as well as superantigens, and genetic polymorphisms have been implicated in the etiology of the disease. Markers of inflammation, such as CCL2 and CCXCL10, contribute to the pathology and the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. Intravenous administration of immunoglobulin remains the mainstay of therapy for Kawasaki disease. Nevertheless, forms of the disease refractory to intravenous administration of immunoglobulin therapy may respond to aspirin, corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and/or plasmapheresis. SUMMARY The present review covers evidence regarding the history of Kawasaki disease, the epidemiology, etiology, pathology, genetic influences, and long-term sequela.

By labeling RG7116 with zirconium-89 ((89)Zr) we aimed to visualize in vivo HER3 expression and study the biodistribution of this antibody in human tumor-bearing mice. Biodistribution of (89)Zr-RG7116 was studied in subcutaneously xenografted FaDu tumor cells (HER3-positive). Dose-dependency of (89)Zr-RG7116 organ distribution and specific tumor uptake was assessed by administering doses ranging from 0.05 to 10 mg/kg RG7116 to SCID/Beige mice. Biodistribution was analyzed at 24 and 144 h after injection. MicroPET imaging was performed at 1, 3, and 6 days after injection of 1.0 mg/kg (89)Zr-RG7116 in the FaDu, H441, QG-56 and Calu-1 xenografts with varying HER3 expression. The excised tumors were analyzed for HER3 expression. Biodistribution analyses showed a dose- and time-dependent (89)Zr-RG7116 tumor uptake in FaDu tumors. The highest tumor uptake of (89)Zr-RG7116 was observed in the 0.05 mg/kg dose group with 27.5%ID/g at 144 h after tracer injection. MicroPET imaging revealed specific tumor uptake of (89)Zr-RG7116 in FaDu and H441 models with an increase in tumor uptake over time. Biodistribution data was consistent with the microPET findings in FaDu, H441, QG56 and Calu-1 xenografts, which correlated with HER3 expression levels. In conclusion, (89)Zr-RG7116 specifically accumulates in HER3 expressing tumors.

76630,Changes in synovitis and bone marrow lesions may not mediate the effect of cartilage loss on joint pain in osteoarthritis.,2020-10-01,"Most intracranial aneurysms morphologic studies focused on characterization of size, location, aspect ratio, relationship to the surrounding vasculature and hemodynamics. However, the spatial orientation with respect to the gravity direction has not been taken into account although it could trigger various hemodynamic conditions. The present work addresses this possibility. It was divided in two parts: 1) the orientations of 18, 3D time-of-flight MRI (3D TOF MRI), scans of saccular aneurysms were analyzed. This investigation suggested that there was no privileged orientation for cerebral aneurysms. The aneurysms were oriented in the brain as follows: 9 - down, 9 - up; 11 - right, 7 - left; 6 - front, 12 - back. 2) Based on these results, subsidiary in vitro experiments were performed, analyzing the behavior of red blood cells (RBCs) within a silicone model of aneurysm before and after flow diverter stent (FDS) deployment in the parent vessel. These experiments used a test bench that reproduces physiological pulsatile flow conditions for two orientations: an aneurysm sack pointing either up (opposite to gravitational force) and down (along the gravitational force). The results showed that the orientation of an aneurysm significantly affects the intra-aneurysmal RBCs behavior after stenting, and therefore that gravity can affect the intra-aneurysm behavior of RBCs. This suggests that the patient׳s aneurysm orientation could impact the outcome of the FDS treatment. The implementation of this effect in patient-specific numerical and preoperative decision support techniques could contribute to better understand the intrasaccular biological and hemodynamic events induced by FDS.","Chodzyński, Kamil J; Eker, Omer F; Vanrossomme, Axel E; de Sousa, Daniel Ribeiro; Coussement, Grégory; Vanhamme, Luc; Dubois, Frank; Bonafé, Alain; Chopard, Bastien; Courbebaisse, Guy; Zouaoui Boudjeltia, Karim",Journal of biomechanics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2016.10.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27810105/,491

Design A qualitative exploratory descriptive design used interviews and focus group to collect data. Setting Registered nurses and registered midwifes from a tertiary metropolitan hospital took part in the study. Participants A voluntary sample of 29 adults was recruited from the Australian nursing (n = 25) and midwifery (n = 4) workforce. There were six men (mean age = 36.83 years; SD = 8.93) and 23 women (mean age = 41.36 years; SD = 10.25). Participants were recruited through advertisement on notice boards and emails from unit managers. Results Thematic analysis revealed five themes but the focus here is on staff judgements which are against the guidelines. Participants indicated that where in their judgement the patient posed no risk and they judged themselves skilled in the procedure, they were justified in deviating from the guidelines. Some staff judgements appeared to be self-protecting, while others were irrational and inconsistent. Conclusions Despite use of standard precautions being mandated, staff often deviated from them based on their own assessment of the situation or the patient. Any deviance from the guidelines is of concern but especially so when staff take it upon themselves to apply their own criteria or judgements. These results also suggest there may be some organisational inadequacies with regards to training and supervision of staff.","Bouchoucha, Stephane L; Moore, Kathleen A",Journal of infection prevention,https://doi.org/10.1177/1757177417738332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29796095/,491
83937,A molecular survey of canine respiratory viruses in New Zealand.,2021-04-12,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is responsible for increasing deaths globally. Most estimates have focused on numbers of deaths, with little direct quantification of years of life lost (YLL) through COVID-19. As most people dying with COVID-19 are older with underlying long-term conditions (LTCs), some have speculated that YLL are low. We aim to estimate YLL attributable to COVID-19, before and after adjustment for number/type of LTCs. Methods: We first estimated YLL from COVID-19 using standard WHO life tables, based on published age/sex data from COVID-19 deaths in Italy. We then used aggregate data on number/type of LTCs to model likely combinations of LTCs among people dying with COVID-19. From these, we used routine UK healthcare data to estimate life expectancy based on age/sex/different combinations of LTCs. We then calculated YLL based on age, sex and type of LTCs and multimorbidity count. Results: Using the standard WHO life tables, YLL per COVID-19 death was 14 for men and 12 for women. After adjustment for number and type of LTCs, the mean YLL was slightly lower, but remained high (13 and 11 years for men and women, respectively). The number and type of LTCs led to wide variability in the estimated YLL at a given age (e.g. at ≥80 years, YLL was >10 years for people with 0 LTCs, and <3 years for people with ≥6). Conclusions: Deaths from COVID-19 represent a substantial burden in terms of per-person YLL, more than a decade, even after adjusting for the typical number and type of LTCs found in people dying of COVID-19. The extent of multimorbidity heavily influences the estimated YLL at a given age. More comprehensive and standardised collection of data on LTCs is needed to better understand and quantify the global burden of COVID-19 and to guide policy-making and interventions.","Hanlon, Peter; Chadwick, Fergus; Shah, Anoop; Wood, Rachael; Minton, Jon; McCartney, Gerry; Fischbacher, Colin; Mair, Frances S; Husmeier, Dirk; Matthiopoulos, Jason; McAllister, David A",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15849.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709037/,491
88718,A survey of canine respiratory pathogens in New Zealand dogs.,2018,"BACKGROUND The first case of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in France in January 2020 and the government decided on national confinement from March 17 to May 11, 2020. Our aim was to analyze the incidence of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for traumatic injuries during this period. METHODS Any visit with an ICD-10 discharge diagnosis code of burn, fracture, traumatic wound, or sprain/bruise contusion was recorded within the 2 weeks before (weeks 10 and 11) and during the confinement (weeks 12 and 19). The visits with the same ICD-10 discharge diagnosis code during similar weeks of the previous 2 years were also included. For each of those visits, the number of hospitalizations was counted. RESULTS The number of recorded visits between week 10 and 19 in 2018, 2019, and 2020 was, respectively, 2657, 2625, and 1106 children. The average number of visits per day during the confinement (13±5) was significantly different from the average number of visits per day during the same weeks in 2018 and 2019 (38±8 vs. 39±9, P<0.0001). The average number of visits per day was significantly lower during confinement compared with 2018/2019 for three categories of diagnoses (P<0.0001) but not for burns (1.7 vs. 1.8, P=0.23). The average number of hospitalizations per day was significantly lower during the confinement than during 2018/2019 (1.6±1.3 vs. 2.6±1.8, P<0.0001). CONCLUSION Confining children in an urban setting appears to decrease the incidence of injuries, except for burns. These data may be useful in reorganizing caregiver supervision and hospital units. These results will need to be consolidated in a multicenter study.","Rougereau, G; Guedj, R; Irtan, S; Qassemyar, Q; Vialle, R; Langlais, T",Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcped.2021.02.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33685751/,491

METHODS The data on 8,958 twin pairs (3,108 MZ twin pairs and 5,850 DZ twin pairs) from the Twins Early Development Study were analysed. CU traits were assessed at ages 7, 9, 12 and 16 by mothers and analysed using a biometric latent growth model. RESULTS Individual differences in the baseline level of CU traits were highly heritable (76.5%), while the heritability of the developmental course of CU traits was moderate (43.6%). The genetic influences on baseline level and developmental course of CU traits were mostly nonoverlapping. Nonshared environment made a modest contribution to the baseline level of CU traits (21.7%). Nonshared environmental influences on the developmental course of CU traits were moderate (43.2%), with nearly half of them being the same as those influencing the baseline level and just over half being specific. Shared environmental effects did not contribute to systematic change across childhood and adolescence but were rather age-specific. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that rather than only being conceptualized as factors of stability, genes also play a dynamic role in explaining systematic change in CU traits. Genetic effects for the initial risk and subsequent development of CU traits are not the same. In addition to genetic factors, nonshared environmental influences play an important role in explaining why some children will increase or maintain their CU traits over time, whereas other will desist. New genetic and environmental influences with age suggest that repeated, age-tailored interventions may be required throughout development to make a lasting difference in the presentation of CU traits and associated outcomes.","Takahashi, Yusuke; Pease, Christopher R; Pingault, Jean-Baptiste; Viding, Essi","Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418200/,491

For bone tissue engineering, a number of small animal models exist. Here we describe the protocol for one such model, the rat calvarial defect. This versatile model allows for evaluation of biomaterials and bone tissue engineering approaches within a reproducible, non-load-bearing orthotopic site. Crucial steps for ensuring appropriate experimental control and troubleshooting tips learned through extensive experience with this model are provided. The surgical procedure itself takes ∼30 min to complete, with ∼2 h of perioperative care, and tissue collection is generally performed 4-12 weeks postoperatively. Several analytical techniques are presented, which evaluate the cellular and extracellular matrix components, functionality and mineralization, including histological, mechanical and radiographic methods.","Spicer, Patrick P; Kretlow, James D; Young, Simon; Jansen, John A; Kasper, F Kurtis; Mikos, Antonios G",Nature protocols,https://doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2012.113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23018195/,491

103041,A survey of diseases of working farm dogs in New Zealand.,2009,"The hydrocarbon-chain packing structure of intercellular lipids in the stratum corneum (SC) is critical to the skin's barrier function. We previously found that formation of V-shaped ceramide reduces the barrier function of skin. There are few agents, apart from ceramides and fatty acids that can improve the orthorhombic packing (Orth) ratio of the intercellular lipid packing structure. In this study, we investigated agents that directly increase the Orth ratio. We selected an intercellular lipid model consisting of ceramide, cholesterol, and palmitic acid and performed differential scanning calorimetry. We focused on natural moisturizing factor components in the SC, and therefore investigated amino acids and their derivatives. The results of our intercellular lipid model-based study indicate that N-acetyl-L-hydroxyproline (AHYP), remarkably, maintains the lamellar structure. We verified the effect of AHYP on the lamellar structure and hydrocarbon chain packing structure of intercellular lipids using time-resolved X-ray diffraction measurements of human SC. We also determined the direct physicochemical effects of AHYP on the Orth ratio of the hydrocarbon-chain packing structure. Hence, the results of our human SC study suggest that AHYP preserves skin barrier function by maintaining the hydrocarbon-chain packing structure of intercellular lipids via electrostatic repulsion. These findings will facilitate the development of skincare formulation that can maintain the skin's barrier function.","Ohnari, Hiroki; Sekiya, Masatoshi; Naru, Eiji; Ogura, Taku; Sakata, Osamu; Obata, Yasuko",Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,https://doi.org/10.1248/cpb.c21-00152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34193714/,491
103980,"GPs should return to offering face-to-face appointments without prior triage, says NHS.",2021-05-14,"BACKGROUND Preoperative frailty is strongly associated with postoperative complications and mortality. However, the pathways between frailty, postoperative complications, and mortality are poorly described. The authors hypothesized that the occurrence of postoperative complications would mediate a substantial proportion of the total effect of frailty on mortality after elective noncardiac surgery. METHODS Following protocol registration, the authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of intermediate- to high-risk elective noncardiac surgery patients (2016) using National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data. The authors conducted Bayesian mediation analysis of the relationship between preoperative frailty (exposure, using the Risk Analysis Index), serious complications (mediator), and 30-day mortality (outcome), comprehensively adjusting for confounders. The authors estimated the total effect of frailty on mortality (composed of the indirect effect mediated by complications and the remaining direct effect of frailty) and estimated the proportion of the frailty-mortality association mediated by complications. RESULTS The authors identified 205,051 patients; 1,474 (0.7%) died. Complications occurred in 20,211 (9.9%). A 2 SD increase in frailty score resulted in a total association with mortality equal to an odds ratio of 3.79 (95% credible interval, 2.48 to 5.64), resulting from a direct association (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% credible interval, 1.34 to 2.30) and an indirect association mediated by complications (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% credible interval, 1.58 to 2.96). Complications mediated 57.3% (95% credible interval, 40.8 to 73.8) of the frailty-mortality association. Cardiopulmonary complications were the strongest mediators among complication subtypes. CONCLUSIONS Complications mediate more than half of the association between frailty and postoperative mortality in elective noncardiac surgery.

Several companies have already developed commercial devices, and more publications are reporting absolute boundary values or percentiles for neonates. We compared four commercially used devices to discover whether they provided consistent results in the same patients. METHODS We recruited nine preterm infants and tested them for 2 h, using sensors from two different devices. The measurements were carried out six times on each child, so that all four devices were compared with each other. A total of 54 measurements were conducted. The following devices were compared: the NIRO 200 (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K), the INVOS 5100c (Somanetics), the Fore-Sight (CAS Med.) and the SenSmart X-100 (NONIN). RESULTS The cerebral tissue oxygenation data yielded by the individual devices differed significantly from each other, ranging from a minimum difference of 2.93% to a maximum difference of 12.66%. CONCLUSION The commercially available NIRS devices showed highly significant differences in local cerebral tissue oxygenation levels, to the extent that the industry cannot agree on uniform and reproducible standards. Therefore, NIRS should only be used for trend measurements in preterm infants.","Schneider, Anna; Minnich, Bernd; Hofstätter, Edda; Weisser, Christof; Hattinger-Jürgenssen, Erna; Wald, Martin",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.12698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847771/,491

DESIGN Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification III). SETTING Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS Forty-one women with sigmoid and rectal endometriotic lesions who underwent segmental resection. INTERVENTION Segmental resection procedures performed between 2004 and 2011. Patient demographic, operative, and postoperative data were compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Sigmoid resection was performed in 6 patients (15%), and rectal anterior resection in 35 patients (high in 21 patients [51%], and low, i.e., <10 cm from the anal verge, in 14 [34%]). In 4 patients a temporary ileostomy was created. There was 1 anastomotic leak (2.4%), in a patient with an unprotected anastomosis, which was treated via laparoscopic surgery and creation of a temporary ileostomy. Other postoperative complications included hemoperitoneum, pelvic abscess, pelvic collection, and a ureteral vaginal fistula, in 1 patient each (all 2.4%). CONCLUSION A protective stoma may be averted in low anastomosis if it is >5 cm from the anal verge and there are no adverse intraoperative events.","Akladios, Cherif; Messori, Pietro; Faller, Emilie; Puga, Marco; Afors, Karolina; Leroy, Joel; Wattiez, Arnaud",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2014.08.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25109779/,491
116687,Perspective from a Teaching and Learning Center During Emergency Remote Teaching.,2020-08-01,"OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review to identify the clinical, fiscal and environmental evidence on the use of urological telehealth and/or virtual clinic strategies. Our secondary aim was to highlight research gaps in this rapidly evolving field. METHODS Our PROSPERO registered (CRD42019151946) systematic search of Embase, Medline and Cochrane Review Database was performed for original research articles pertaining to adult urology telehealth or virtual clinic strategies. Risk of bias (RoB) assessment performed according to Cochrane 2.0 RoB or Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for non-randomised studies. RESULTS 5,813 participants met inclusion from 18 original articles (2 randomised controlled trials; 10 prospective; 6 retrospective). Urology sub-specialities: Uro-oncology (n=6), General urology (n=8), Endo-urology (n=2), and Lower urinary tract symptoms and/or incontinence (n=2). Across all sub-specialties, prospective studies utilising VC reported: primary median VC discharge rate of 16.6% (IQR 14.7%-29.8%) and primary median face-to-face (FTF) clinic referral rate of 32.4% (IQR 15.5%-53.3%). Further, direct cost analysis demonstrated a median annual cost-savings of £56,232 (IQR £46,260-£61,116). Grade II and IIIb complications were reported in two acute ureteric colic studies, with a rate of 0.20% (3/1,534) and 0.13% (2/1,534), respectively. Annual carbon footprint avoided ranged from 0.7 to 4.35 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions, depending on mode of transport utilised. Patient satisfaction was inconsistently reported, and assessments lacked prospective evaluation using validated questionnaires. CONCLUSION Virtual urology clinics are a promising new platform which can offer clinical, financial and environmental benefits to support an increasing urological referral burden. Further prospective evidence is required across urological subspecialties to confirm equivalency and safety against traditional face-to-face assessment.","Edison, M A; Connor, M J; Miah, S; El-Husseiny, T; Winkler, M; Dasgupta, R; Ahmed, H U; Hrouda, D",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.15125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32463991/,491

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Inclusion criteria were: 1) focus on gambling harms; 2) focus on harms to the gambler rather than affected others; 3) discussion of specific listed harms and not just harms in general terms. Exclusion criteria were: 1) research of non-human subjects; 2) not written in English; 3) not an empirical study; 4) not available as a full article. METHODS We conducted a systematic search using the Web of Science and Scopus databases in August 2020. Assessment of quality took place using Standard Quality Assessment Criteria. RESULTS A total of 59 studies published between 1994 and 2020 met the inclusion criteria. These were categorised into thematic groups for comparison and discussion. There were replicated differences found in groups defined by age, socioeconomic status, education level, ethnicity and culture, risk severity, and gambling behaviours. CONCLUSION Harms appear to be dependent on specific social, demographic and environmental conditions that suggests there is a health inequality in gambling related harms. Further investigation is required to develop standardised measurement tools and to understand confounding variables and co-morbidities. With a robust understanding of harms distribution in the population, Primary Care Workers will be better equipped to identify those who are at risk, or who are showing signs of Gambling Disorder, and to target prevention and intervention programmes appropriately.","Raybould, Jodie N; Larkin, Michael; Tunney, Richard J",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10337-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33549082/,491

In the past decades, the use of dietary supplements has significantly increased due to both the modern lifestyle and the food shortages of the industrialised countries. The purpose of this review paper is to collect scientific evidences from basic and clinical studies which support the use of dietary supplements to define the clinical framework for patients with varicocele. In the present review, we used keywords such as dietary supplements, varicocele, male infertility, oxidative stress, DNA fragmentation, sperm parameters to find the proper articles. The standard search biomedical engines were used for seeking the papers. The use of dietary supplements such as minerals, vitamins and antioxidants has an essential role in the prevention and treatment of varicocele by increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes (e.g. peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) and decreasing the levels of inflammatory markers (e.g. tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and interleukin-1) in testis. According to the results, the dietary supplements may alleviate the spermatogenesis in varicocele patients through different mechanisms such as suppression of stress oxidative and inflammation in testicular tissue.","Arab, Davood; Doustmohammadi, Hoda; Ardestani Zadeh, Arash",Andrologia,https://doi.org/10.1111/and.13879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33108825/,491

The goal of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of measuring synovial fluid interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels for identifying PJI of the shoulder. METHODS Thirty-two consecutive patients evaluated for pain at the site of a shoulder arthroplasty were prospectively enrolled from November 2012 to September 2013 and underwent revision surgery (thirty-five procedures during which samples were obtained for synovial fluid IL-6 analysis). Cases were categorized into infection (n = 15) and no-infection (n = 20) groups on the basis of objective preoperative and intraoperative findings. Twenty patients treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were also enrolled to serve as a non-infected control group. Synovial fluid was obtained through aspiration intraoperatively for all patients, as well as preoperatively for some. Synovial fluid IL-6 levels were measured with use of a cytokine immunoassay that utilizes electrochemiluminescent detection. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the diagnostic utility of synovial fluid IL-6 analysis. RESULTS Based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, synovial fluid IL-6 measurement had an area under the curve of 0.891 with an ideal cutoff value of 359.3 pg/mL. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were 87%, 90%, 8.45, and 0.15, respectively. Seven patients who underwent a single-stage revision had negative results on standard perioperative testing, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels, but multiple positive intraoperative tissue cultures. The level of synovial fluid IL-6 was elevated in five of these seven patients, with a median value of 1400 pg/mL. Intraoperative synovial fluid IL-6 values correlated well with preoperative IL-6 synovial fluid values (correlation = 0.61; p = 0.025) and frozen-section histologic findings (p < 0.001). Synovial fluid IL-6 levels were also significantly elevated in patients with Propionibacterium acnes infection (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Measurement of synovial fluid IL-6 levels is more sensitive and specific than current preoperative testing for predicting positive cultures for patients undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty. This diagnostic accuracy can lead to improved decision-making in the management of PJI.","Frangiamore, Salvatore J; Saleh, Anas; Kovac, Mario Farias; Grosso, Matthew J; Zhang, Xiaochun; Bauer, Thomas W; Daly, Thomas M; Ricchetti, Eric T; Iannotti, Joseph P",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

148193,Prevalence of endemic enteropathogens of calves in New Zealand dairy farms.,2015,"BACKGROUND/AIMS Sphingosine, a sphingoid long chain base, is a natural lipid with antimicrobial properties. Recent animal studies have shown that preventive sphingosine inhalation can rescue susceptible mice, such as cystic fibrosis-, burn injured- or aged mice from bacterial pulmonary infection. While preventing lung infections in susceptible patients has obvious clinical merit, treatment strategies for an established infection are also direly needed, particularly in the times of rising antibiotic resistance. Here, we tested the potential of sphingosine in treating an established pulmonary infection. METHODS We used a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model in male CF-1 mice and a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain that was isolated from a septic patient (P. aeruginosa 762). We determined susceptibility to intranasal infection and ascertained when the pulmonary infection was established by continuous core body temperature monitoring. We quantified sphingosine levels in the tracheal epithelium by immunohistochemistry and studied the effects on sphingosine on bacterial membrane permeabilization and intracellular acidification using fluorescent probes. RESULTS We first determined that septic mice are highly susceptible to P. aeruginosa infection 2 days after indu-cing sepsis. Additionally, at this time, sphingosine levels in the tracheal epithelium are significantly reduced as compared to levels in healthy mice. Secondly, upon intranasal Pseudomonas inoculation, we ascertained that pulmonary infection was established as early as 2.5 h after inoculation as evidenced by a significant drop in core body temperature. Using these times of infection susceptibility and detection (2 days post CLP, 2.5h after inoculation) we treated with inhaled sphingosine and observed pulmonary bacterial loads reduced to levels found in infected healthy mice after inoculation and decreased infection-associated mortality. Further, our data demonstrate that sphingosine induces outer membrane permeabilization, disrupting the membrane potential and leading to intracellular acidification of the bacteria. CONCLUSION Sphingosine shows efficacy in treating P. aeruginosa lung infections not only prophylactically, but also therapeutically.","Beckmann, Nadine; Pugh, Amanda M; Auteri, Nicholas J; Edwards, Michael J; Gulbins, Erich; Caldwell, Charles C","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",https://doi.org/10.33594/000000287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33080125/,491

Originally developed in oncology and among English-speaking participants, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the content and cross-cultural validity of the SPFQ in other indications and non-English-speaking countries. METHODS Semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews were conducted with 80 participants across eight non-English-speaking countries (in Europe, South America and Asia) who had received an investigational medicinal product as part of a clinical trial in the past three years. Interviews comprised concept elicitation to identify concepts of importance to participants' trial experiences, and cognitive debriefing to assess understanding and perceived importance of SPFQ instructions, items and response options. RESULTS Concept elicitation findings supported the content validity of the SPFQ. During cognitive debriefing, SPFQ instructions and the majority of items were well understood by participants. Participants generally considered the SPFQ items important to their clinical trial experience, albeit a handful of items assessed concepts that had not been experienced by trial participants or were redundant with other SPFQ items. The instructions, response options and recall period of the SPFQ were generally well understood. No country-level differences in understanding or importance were apparent. CONCLUSION Study findings provide evidence for the content and cross-cultural validity of the SPFQ and support implementation of the SPFQ as a means of obtaining participant feedback across global development programmes in a variety of indications.","Greene, Alison; Elmer, Mary; Ludlam, Sean; Shay, Kathyjo; Bentley, Sarah; Trennery, Claire; Grimes, Rebecca; Gater, Adam",Therapeutic innovation & regulatory science,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43441-020-00179-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691362/,491

Five peloid samples were gathered from their places of origin, namely Gölemezli, Dalyan, Köprüköy, Gökçeada, and Dikili. Mineral analysis and physical and chemical analyses including electrical conductivity, density, cations, anions, trace elements, organic matters, and water retention capacity at 105 °C were performed. The peloids contained a combination of clay minerals (mainly montmorillonite, kaolinite, and muscovite) and non-clay minerals (mainly quartz, calcite, dolomite, and albite) except for Gölemezli peloid, which was dominated by calcite. The other minerals (i.e., chloride-serpentine, sphalerite, pyrite, magnesium calcite, cristobalite) were also found in some peloids. Gölemezli, Dalyan, and Köprüköy peloids had high total organic matters, mainly humic substances. The water retention capacity was high in Dalyan, Köprüköy, and Dikili peloids. All peloids had a pH value slightly greater than 7 (range 7.93-8.69). Dalyan, Köprüköy, and Dikili peloids had a high water retention capacity. Dalyan and Gökçeada peloids had a high electrical conductivity, 22.040 and 9.020 μS/cm, respectively. The density of peloids was ranged between 1.240 (Gölemezli) and 1.450 (Gökçeada) g/cm3. Total mineralization of investigated peloids was greater than 1000 mg/L: Köprüköy, 2754.8 mg/L; Gölemezli, 3092.8 mg/L; Dikili, 4044.6 mg/L; Gökçeada, 6576.6 mg/L; and Dalyan, 11782.9 mg/L, mainly sodium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, sulfate, bicarbonate, and metasilicic acid.

162345,Why does resilience matter? Global implications for the tourism industry in the context of COVID-19,2021,"Introduction Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant cause of maternal mortality with the greatest risk postpartum. Mode of delivery influences VTE risk, with emergency caesarean section (CS) associated with the highest risk (CS). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended for selected women to reduce the risk of VTE. We aimed to investigate the impact of mode of delivery and thromboprophylaxis on hypercoagulability as measured by thromboelastometry (TEM) and thrombin generation (TG) in women at high VTE risk. Materials and Methods Blood was collected from 99 pregnant women with VTE risk factors at up to five time points from pre- (T1) and post (T2)-delivery to 6 weeks postpartum (T5). Multiple linear regression was utilised to compare TG and TEM between those with vaginal delivery (VD) and CS at each time point. Paired sample t -test with post hoc Bonferroni correction was utilised to compare laboratory markers over time. Results Women in both groups had a median of three postpartum VTE risk factors, with higher body mass index and parity post-VD. In both the groups, TG and TEM parameters suggested hypercoagulability at T2 compared with T1, with resolution at T5. There were minimal differences between groups, apart from T2 with shorter clot formation time and higher maximum clot firmness in the VD group. Conclusion TG and TEM illustrate hypercoagulability associated with pregnancy and delivery. The pattern of postpartum hypercoagulability seen in women with VTE risk factors was similar irrespective of mode of delivery. Further research is required to establish the effect of labour on TG/TEM in the absence of low molecular weight heparin use.","Guimicheva, Boriana; Roberts, Lara N; Patel, Jignesh P; Subramanian, Devi; Arya, Roopen",TH open : companion journal to thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-3402807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31915751/,491

However, the evidence remains inconsistent and, at most, makes the case for differences between rural and urban environments as a whole. Here, we propose a model of depression driven by an individual's accumulated experience mediated by social networks. The connection between observed systematic variations in socioeconomic networks and built environments with city size provides a link between urbanization and mental health. Surprisingly, this model predicts lower depression rates in larger cities. We confirm this prediction for US cities using three independent datasets.

163398,Barriers and drivers of environmental sustainability: Australian hotels,2021,"Background: To eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, WHO currently recommends routine vaccination of adolescent girls with two doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine before sexual debut. However, many countries have yet to implement this because of financial or logistical barriers to delivering two doses outside the infant immunisation programme. Methods: Using three independent HPV transmission models, we estimated the long-term health benefits and cost-effectiveness of one-dose versus two-dose HPV vaccination, in 192 countries, assuming that one dose of the vaccine gives either a shorter duration of full protection (20 or 30 years) or lifelong protection but lower vaccine efficacy (e.g., 80%) compared to two doses. We simulated routine vaccination with the 9-valent HPV vaccine in 10-year-old girls at 80% coverage for the years 2021-2120, with a one-year catch-up of 80% 11-14-year-old girls on the first year of the programme. Findings: Over the next century, one-dose vaccination at 80% coverage could avert 64 million (80%UI 62.2-64.8) and 66.6 million (80%UI 63.4-69.1) cervical cancer cases should one dose of the vaccine confer 20 and 30 years of protection, respectively. Should one dose of the vaccine provide lifelong protection at 80% vaccine efficacy, 68.4 million (80%UI 63.8-69.4) cervical cancer cases could be prevented. Across all country income groups, two-dose schedules conferring lifelong protection would avert only slightly more cases (2.1-8.7 million) than the one-dose scenarios explored. Around 330 to 5230 additional girls need to be vaccinated with the second dose to prevent one cervical cancer case, depending on the epidemiological profiles of the country. Interpretation: Results were consistent across the three independent models and suggest that one-dose vaccination has similar health benefits to a two-dose programme while simplifying vaccine delivery, reducing costs and alleviating vaccine supply constraints.

MCO enforcement has made Malaysians spend most of their time staying at home, and even some have lost their income source. Another sector that has been greatly affected is the educational sector. Today’s landscape of education has changed dramatically with the phenomenal rise of virtual classes from home. Learning and teaching processes are undertaken remotely and on digital platforms to curb the spreading of the virus. This situation has affected the lesson and learning process from home to many of the several students in Malaysia. Therefore, this study investigates the challenges of home learning during MCO among students in the Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Pahang Branch. A simple random sampling technique was used to distribute the online survey questionnaires, involving a sample of 213 students. Besides, a descriptive statistic was used to study the students’ demographic characteristics according to the challenges. In contrast, logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with home learning challenges during MCO. Based on the findings, most male and female students were not well prepared for home learning during MCO, with a percentage of 71.60% and 69.70%, respectively. As a result, 79.81% agreed that home learning is more stressful than the physical classes on the campus. In comparison, 79.63% of Social Science and 83.02% of Science and Technology students claimed that the workload given is way more significant during online classes. Furthermore, this study concludes that the most associated challenges of home learning faced by the students during MCO are the abundance of workload and loss of interest in the subject.","Mohamed, Siti Rosiah Syafiza Saila Samsudin Ismail Nazihah Nik Muhammad Farhan Hakim Nik Badrul Alam Noor Izyan Mohamad Adnan",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1988/1/012052,491

However, there are four known, endemic seasonal coronaviruses in humans (HCoVs) and whether antibodies for these HCoVs play a role in severity of COVID-19 disease has generated a lot of interest. Of these seasonal viruses NL63 is of particular interest as it uses the same cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV-2.We use functional, neutralising assays to investigate cross reactive antibodies and their relationship with COVID-19 severity. We analysed neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2, NL63, HKU1, and 229E in 38 COVID-19 patients and 62 healthcare workers, and a further 182 samples to specifically study the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and NL63.We found that although HCoV neutralisation was very common there was little evidence that these antibodies neutralised SARS-CoV-2. Despite no evidence in cross neutralisation, levels of NL63 neutralisating antibodies become elevated after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through infection or following vaccination.","Wells, D.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness profile of COVID-19 vaccines against VOC. Methods. Published and preprinted randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies that evaluated the VE against VOC (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, or Delta) were searched until 31 August 2021. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. VE was defined as (1-estimate). Results. Seven RCTs (51,169 participants), 10 cohort studies (14,385,909 participants) and 16 case-control studies (734,607 cases) were included. Eight COVID-19 vaccines (mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, NVX-CoV2373, BBV152, CoronaVac, and BBIBP-CorV) were included in this analysis. Full vaccination was effective against Alpha, Beta/Gamma, and Delta variants, with VE of 88.3% (95% CI, 82.4-92.2), 70.7% (95% CI, 59.9-78.5), and 71.6% (95% CI, 64.1-77.4), respectively. But partial vaccination was less effective, with VE of 59.0% (95% CI, 51.3-65.5), 49.3% (95% CI, 33.0-61.6), and 52.6% (95% CI, 43.3-60.4), respectively. mRNA vaccines seemed to have higher VE against VOC over others, significant interactions (pinteraction < 0.10) were observed between VE and vaccine type (mRNA vaccines vs. non-mRNA vaccines). Conclusions. Full vaccination of COVID-19 vaccines is highly effective against Alpha variant, and moderate effective against Beta/Gamma and Delta variants. Partial vaccination has less VE against VOC. mRNA vaccines seem to have higher VE against Alpha, Beta/Gamma, and Delta variants over others.","Zeng, B.; Gao, L.; Zhou, Q.; Yu, K.; Sun, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.23.21264048v1?rss=1,491

NGOs may not be able to operate the social services efficiently in the absence of such funds. Lately, there are plenty of organizations that have taken initiatives to render social services for targeted populations in order to curb social problems such as poverty, hunger, crimes, etc., through the use of some forms of philanthropic instruments including Islamic social finance, ethical finance, and others. Today, however, philanthropic financial instruments such as socially responsible investment (SRI), social impact bonds (SIB), and even Waqf are issued by financial institutions rather than socially driven institutions. As such, they have been treated as commercial financial instruments rather than socially driven mechanisms. This paper aims to elucidate the potentials of selected modern financial philanthropic instruments that deal with the healthcare sector. The strengths and weaknesses of the selected instruments will be assessed to explore their potentials in serving the healthcare services sector particularly for the underprivileged. The healthcare sector is highlighted as the focus of this study due to its relevance to the present challenge of the Covid-19 pandemic. This is an exploratory study that adopts the qualitative method whereby a rigorous review of the relevant literature is conducted to examine the potential that philanthropic Islamic financial instruments can offer in providing healthcare services to the underprivileged. The findings elaborate on three important models of philanthropic instruments, namely social impact bonds (SIB), development impact bonds (DIB), and takaful-waqf models. It was also found that these philanthropic instruments have varied strengths and weaknesses that require rectification in the future.","Hassan, R.; Jamaludin, K.

169583,Application of Open-Hardware-Based Solutions for Rapid Transition From Stationary to the Remote Teaching Model During Pandemic,2021,"Abstract Metal parts manufactured with engineered porosity offer advantages over traditional parts as they have excellent specific mechanical properties at a lower weight. This is especially of interest in the aerospace and automobile industries. Additive manufacturing allows for creating parts with computer aided design (CAD) modeled lattice structures that offer lightweight parts. However, there is a need for porous structures at the micron scale (<50 µm) which cannot be achieved in a controlled manner using traditional powder-bed based metal additive manufacturing processes. Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing (ECAM) is a novel non-thermal metal additive manufacturing process capable of producing metal 3D parts with engineered porosity at the micron scale. There is a lack of understanding of the cause of porosity and controlling the porosity generated in the parts created using this process. In this paper, the effects of the electrical parameters of deposition, such as the pulse duty cycle and pulse frequency during electrodeposition, on the porosity of the manufactured parts were mathematically modeled. The model predicts that higher frequency electrodeposition leads to more porous structures. The model developed in this study can be used to predict the process parameters needed to deposit nickel microstructures with desired levels of porosity between 20 and 55 %. These model predictions were also validated by experiments. Two mechanisms for the cause of porosity in the deposits were identified. The diffusion-limited deposition phenomenon causing a lack of availability of cations results in larger sized pores and hollow structures to form on the part. The crystal growth and the nucleation process cause micron-scale pores.","Kamaraj, Abishek B.; Sundaram, Murali",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314876; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314876,491

By analyzing interviews, observations, ecological momentary assessments, and system data, we examined tensions in how badges as connected learning technologies operate in teens' sociotechnical ecosystems. We found that, due to issues of unwanted context collapse and incongruent identity representations, youth only used certain affordances of the system and did so sporadically. Additionally, we noted that some features seemed to prioritize values of adult stakeholders over youth.

We evaluated the feasibility of adding HBV testing and treatment of pregnant women and birth-dose vaccination of HBV-exposed infants to the HIV prevention of MTCT (PMTCT) program infrastructure in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where HBV treatment and birth-dose vaccination programs are not established. Methods: As part of the HIV PMTCT program at two maternity centers in Kinshasa, DRC, pregnant women were screened for HBV at routine prenatal care registration. Pregnant women with high viral load and/or HBeAg positivity were offered tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). HBV-exposed infants received a birth-dose of HBV vaccine within 24 hours of life. The primary endpoint was the feasibility and acceptability of the study. Results: Of 4,016 women screened, 109 (2.7%) were HBsAg-positive. Ten of 91 (11.1%) women evaluated had high-risk disease. Of 88 infants, 60 (68.2%) received a birth-dose vaccine; of these, 46 (76.7%) received a timely birth-dose. No cases of HBV MTCT were observed in our cohort. There were no serious adverse events associated with TDF nor with birth-dose vaccine. The study procedures were highly acceptable (>80%) among mothers. Conclusions: Adding HBV screening and treatment of pregnant women and infant birth-dose vaccination to existing HIV PMTCT platforms is feasible in countries like the DRC. Birth-dose vaccination against HBV integrated within the current Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) and HIV PMTCT program could accelerate progress toward HBV elimination in Africa.","Thompson, P.; Morgan, C.

170520,Barriers and Challenges of Computing Students in an Online Learning Environment: Insights from One Private University in the Philippines,2020-11-20,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed behavioural norms and how people conceptualise everyday life. It has led to prolific use of specific terminology that is new or was previously outside the lexical boundaries of common use. Terms like ‘social distancing’, ‘lockdown’ and ‘new normal’ were previously jargon limited to specialist fields. The COVID-19 pandemic which spread globally in 2020 has led to great social change and an associated lexical influence.

This was at a time of growing awareness of COVID-19 in Indonesia, that included a partial lockdown in Jakarta. As such, there was a great deal of attention to COVID-19 in the mass media. To study this, we apply quantitative content analysis to the sample data to identify the range and frequency of words borrowed from English. We examine this use of code-switching to also undertake qualitative analysis, exploring the various socio-linguistic dimensions of those borrowed terms. Some usage was found to address lexical gaps in Indonesian language, where other usage appeared more for stylistic, emphatic purposes, drawing on the semiotic power of English in the Indonesian context. Code-switching reiteration was particularly prominent in the sample data. We argue that through code-switching reiteration, the print media can introduce new foreign vocabulary to Indonesian readers, which subsequently generates opportunities for language change. COVID-19 has expedited this process, meaning that there has been an increased likelihood of Indonesian language change during 2020. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.","Foster, S.

Remote Teaching During the Pandemic: Reflections on the Challenges and Successes of Urgent Adjustments by University Teachers,2021,"The number of available biological sequences has increased significantly in recent years due to various genomic sequencing projects, creating a huge volume of data. Consequently, new computational methods are needed to analyze and extract information from these sequences. Machine learning methods have shown broad applicability in computational biology and bioinformatics. The utilization of machine learning methods has helped to extract relevant information from various biological datasets. However, there are still several obstacles that motivate new algorithms and pipeline proposals, mainly involving feature extraction problems, in which extracting significant discriminatory information from a biological set is challenging. Considering this, our work proposes to study and analyze a feature extraction pipeline based on mathematical models (Numerical Mapping, Fourier, Entropy, and Complex Networks). As a case study, we analyze Long Non-Coding RNA sequences. Moreover, we divided this work into two studies, e.g., (I) we assessed our proposal with the most addressed problem in our review, e.g., lncRNA vs. mRNA; (II) we tested its generalization on different classification problems, e.g., circRNA vs. lncRNA. The experimental results demonstrated three main contributions: (1) An in-depth study of several mathematical models; (2) a new feature extraction pipeline and (3) its generalization and robustness for distinct biological sequence classification.","Bonidia, Robson Parmezan; Sampaio, Lucas Dias Hiera; Domingues, Douglas Silva; Paschoal, Alexandre Rossi; Lopes, Fabrício Martins; de Leon Ferreira de Carvalho, André Carlos Ponce; Sanches, Danilo Sipoli",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.140368,491

Due to this tourism crisis, this research attempted to uncover the possible influence of the corporate social responsibility efforts of the international tourism businesses and of the knowledge of COVID-19 on the US travelers’ decision formation for international tourism products. A quantitative approach and survey methodology were used. The findings revealed that corporate social responsibility improves travelers’ attitudes and behavioral intentions. In addition, the travelers’ knowledge perception of COVID-19 was significantly associated with their psychological distress. Decreasing this psychological distress related to overseas tourism was of importance to boost a positive attitude toward international traveling, which directly leads to increased behavioral intentions. Testing for the metric invariance revealed that an association between the corporate social responsibility and intentions was only significant when the travelers strongly felt an ascription of responsibility for the COVID-19 outbreak and the pandemic. The theoretical uses and the practical values of this research are discussed.","Han, Heesup Lee Soyeun Jinkyung Jenny Kim Ryu Hyungseo Bobby",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208639,491

Accurate travel demand information is an important issue for the transportation systems, especially for airline industry. So, “optimal seat capacity problem between origin and destination pairs” which is related to the load factor must be solved. In this study, a method for determining optimal seat capacity that can supply the highest load factor for the flight operation between any two countries has been introduced. The machine learning methods of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Linear Regression (LR), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Random Forest (RF) have been applied and a software has been developed to solve the problem. The data set generated from The World Bank Database, which consists of thousands of features for all countries, has been used and a case study has been done for the period of 2014-2019 with Turkish Airlines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that 1983 features have been used to forecast air travel demand in the literature within a model that covers all countries while previous studies cover only a few countries using far fewer features. Another valuable point of this study is the usage of the last regular data about the air transportation before COVID-19 pandemic. In other words, since many airline companies have experienced a decline in the air travel operation in 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic, this study covers the most recent period (2014-2019) when flight operation performed on a regular basis. As a result, it has been observed that the developed model has forecasted the passenger load factor by an average error rate of 6.741% with GB, 6.763% with RF, 8.161% with ANN, and 9.619 % with LR. © 2021, IICM.

Glycolytic metabolism has been identified as a determinant of susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, but its role in the development and maintenance of HIV-1 latency has not been elucidated. By combining transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analysis, we here show that transition to latent HIV-1 infection downregulates glycolysis, while viral reactivation by conventional stimuli reverts this effect. Decreased glycolytic output in latently infected cells is associated with downregulation of NAD+/NADH. Consequently, infected cells rely on the parallel pentose phosphate pathway and its main product, the antioxidant NADPH, fueling antioxidant pathways maintaining HIV-1 latency. Of note, blocking NADPH downstream effectors, thioredoxin and glutathione, favors HIV-1 reactivation from latency in lymphoid and myeloid cellular models. This provides a “shock and kill effect” decreasing proviral DNA in cells from people-living-with-HIV/AIDS. Overall, our data show that downmodulation of glycolysis is a metabolic signature of HIV-1 latency that can be exploited to target latently infected cells with eradication strategies.","Shytaj, Iart Luca; Procopio, Francesco Andrea; Tarek, Mohammad; Carlon-Andres, Irene; Tang, Hsin-Yao; Goldman, Aaron R.; Munshi, MohamedHusen; Forcato, Mattia; Leskov, Konstantin; Ye, Fengchun; Lucic, Bojana; Cruz, Nicolly; Singh, Amit; Bicciato, Silvio; Padilla-Parra, Sergi; Lusic, Marina; Diaz, Ricardo Sobhie; Alvarez-Carbonell, David; Savarino, Andrea",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.30.424810,491

When lack of access to microcredit is exacerbated by a public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic, its real significance as an essential service in poverty alleviation becomes more apparent. The outbreak and spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to dramatic transformations of every sector of the Nigerian society including microcredit delivery system, where formal and informal actors co-exist often in an uneasy relationship. Unfortunately, strategies for inclusive microcredit delivery before and during the COVID-19 pandemic are lacking in Nigeria, fuelling the further exclusion of informal sector in microcredit governance and policy process in Nigeria. The paper reviews the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria and identifies policy gaps in microcredit delivery and governance mechanism. The study also highlights the linkages between COVID-19 and microcredit in poverty alleviation with a view to catalysing increased and inclusive access to microcredit and sustainability policy in Nigeria. It is argued that acknowledging the role of microcredit in informal economy and poverty alleviation is the critical first step towards framing a sustainable microcredit policy in which primary stakeholders are involved.","Onuka, Onwuka Ifeanyi",Asia-Pacific Journal of Rural Development,https://doi.org/10.1177/10185291211007925,491

To understand the probability and severity of this threat, quantification of the level of immunity/protection of the population is required. We use an age-structured model including infection, vaccination and waning immunity to estimate the distribution of immunity to COVID-19 in the Canadian population. By late Summer 2021, coinciding with the end of the vaccination program, we estimate that 60 - 80% of the Canadian population will have some immunity to COVID-19. Model results show that this level of immunity is not sufficient to stave off a Fall 2021 resurgence. The timing and severity of a resurgence, however, varies in magnitude given multiple factors: relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, the rate of waning immunity, the transmissibility of variants of concern, and the protective characteristics of the vaccines against infection and severe disease. To prevent large-scale resurgence, booster vaccination and/or re-introduction of public health mitigation may be needed.","Dick, D. W.; Childs, L.

Along this line of research, temporal network has come out to be one of the most promising network platforms to investigate. Especially, such network with spatially moving agents has been established to be capable of modelling a number of practical instances. In this paper, we examine the dynamical outcomes of moving agents interacting based upon their physical proximity. For this, we particularly emphasize on the impact of competing interactions among the agents depending on their physical distance. We specifically assume attractive coupling between agents which are staying apart from each other, whereas we adopt repulsive interaction for agents that are sufficiently close in space. With this set-up, we consider two types of coupling configurations, symmetry-breaking and symmetry-preserving couplings. We encounter variants of collective dynamics ranging from synchronization, inhomogeneous small oscillation to cluster state and extreme events while changing the attractive and repulsive coupling strengths. We have been able to map all these dynamical behaviors in the coupling parameter space. Complete synchronization being the most desired state in absence of repulsive coupling, we present an analytical study for this scenario that agrees well with the numerical results.","Chowdhury, Sayantan Nag; Majhi, Soumen; Ghosh, Dibakar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07058v1.pdf,491

In this study, the most appropriate distribution between the negatively skewed distributions for left-censored data in Parametric Inverse Hazard Models was tried to be determined. Methods: Within the scope of the study, firstly, the data were produced uncensored according to different parameters of each distribution. Then, simulation studies were carried out in different censorship rates (15%, 25% and 35%) and various sample sizes (1000, 2000 and 3000) in order to determine the most appropriate distribution. AIC, AICC, HQIC, and CAIC information criteria were employed to compare the distribution performances. Since it was not possible to study simulations of all possible scenarios, scenarios similar to each other were generally preferred over others. Results: In the simulation results, the most appropriate distributions to be used for left-censored data in Parametric Inverse Hazard Models were found as Generalized Inverse Weibull as well as Log-Logistic, Log-Normal, Inverse Normal and Gamma distributions. It was also detected that the Marshal-Olkin distribution revealed a superior performance compared to the Modified Weibull, Generalized Gamma, Gamma, and Flexible Weibull distributions. Log logistics dis?tribution gave the most appropriate result among the analyzed distributions in the examination made with real data application. Conclusion: The use of censored data analysis in evaluations in terms of Covid-19 is quite additive, considering that more statistical evaluation will be needed in the next period of the epidemic.

We evaluated sepsis recording across primary care electronic records, hospital episodes and mortality registrations. Methods and Findings: Cohort study including 378 general practices in England from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database from 2002 to 2017 with 36,209,676 patient-years of follow-up with linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality registrations. Incident sepsis episodes were identified for each source. Concurrent records from different sources were identified and age-standardised and age-specific incidence rates compared. Logistic regression analysis evaluated associations of gender, age-group, fifth of deprivation and period of diagnosis with concurrent sepsis recording. There were 20,206 first episodes of sepsis from primary care, 20,278 from HES and 13,972 from ONS. There were 4,117 (20%) first HES sepsis events and 2,438 (17%) mortality records concurrent with incident primary care sepsis records within 30 days. Concurrent HES and primary care records of sepsis within 30 days before or after first diagnosis were higher at younger or older ages and for patients with the most recent period of diagnosis with those diagnosed during 2007:2011 less likely to have a concurrent HES record given CPRD compared to those diagnosed during 2012 to 2017 (odd ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.70). At age 85 and older, primary care incidence was 5.22 per 1,000 patient years (95% CI 1.75 to 11.97) in men and 3.55 (0.87 to 9.58) in women which increased to 10.09 (4.86 to 18.51) for men and 7.22 (2.96 to 14.72) for women after inclusion of all three sources.

In Indian traditional system of medicine, HA has been used to treat gastric ailments, for wound healing and also to improve glycaemic control. Glucose lowering activity of HA root, bark, seed, leaf and fruit extract in different parts of India as well as in Chinese traditional medicine is widely reported. Purpose In the meta-analysis reported in this article, we summarize glucose-lowering effects of HA extracts from different plant parts as reported in multiple studies involving animal models of diabetes. Our analysis helps to quantify the glucose-lowering effect of HA in comparison with standard diabetes drugs. The analysis also sheds light on differential efficacy levels of HA extracted from different plant parts. Study design The meta-analysis was carried out following PRISMA guidelines. Literature was searched to identify studies published between years 2011 to 2019 reporting glucose-lowering effects of HA extract on rodent models of diabetes. Methods Longitudinal meta-analysis was carried out on time-course data extracted from selected studies to calculate standardized mean change of glucose value from day 1 to days 7, 14 and 21 post-treatment by HA extract or standard anti-diabetic drug. Subgroup analysis was carried out for studies reporting effects of HA on leaf and seed extracts. Standardized mean difference in levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and serum total protein between treatment and control groups were also assessed. Results We shortlisted nine articles to be used for this meta-analysis. Summarized standardized mean changes of glucose value between day 1 and day 21 post-treatment indicated glucose-lowering effects of HA extracts to be marginally lower but comparable to that of standard anti-diabetic drugs like Glibenclamide or Sitagliptin. However, subgroup analysis revealed seed extracts of HA to be more potent than leaf extracts or even standard drugs. Effects of the extract on levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and serum total protein was also commensurate with its glucose-lowering property. Conclusions Our results, summarized over multiple studies, present a clear quantitative assessment of the anti-diabetic property of HA, in particular the seed extracts compared to standard anti-diabetic drugs. Further differential analysis of the seed extracts will be useful to arrive at a herbal formulation with superior anti-diabetic property and possibly lesser side effects than chemical entities.","Divya, C.

T cells can contribute to the rapid clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections1-5. We hypothesised that pre-existing memory T cell responses, with cross-protective potential against SARS-CoV-26-12, would expand in vivo to mediate rapid viral control, potentially aborting infection. We studied T cells against the replication transcription complex (RTC) of SARS-CoV-2 since this is transcribed first in the viral life cycle13-15 and should be highly conserved. We measured SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in a cohort of intensively monitored healthcare workers (HCW) who remained repeatedly negative by PCR, antibody binding, and neutralisation for SARS-CoV-2 (exposed seronegative, ES). 16-weeks post-recruitment, ES had memory T cells that were stronger and more multispecific than an unexposed pre-pandemic cohort, and more frequently directed against the RTC than the structural protein-dominated responses seen post-detectable infection (matched concurrent cohort). The postulate that HCW with the strongest RTC-specific T cells had an abortive infection was supported by a low-level increase in IFI27 transcript, a robust early innate signature of SARS-CoV-2 infection16. We showed that the RNA-polymerase within RTC was the largest region of high sequence conservation across human seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV) and was preferentially targeted by T cells from UK and Singapore pre-pandemic cohorts and from ES. RTC epitope-specific T cells capable of cross-recognising HCoV variants were identified in ES. Longitudinal samples from ES and an additional validation cohort, showed pre-existing RNA-polymerase-specific T cells expanded in vivo following SARS-CoV-2 exposure, becoming enriched in the memory response of those with abortive compared to overt infection. In summary, we provide evidence of abortive seronegative SARS-CoV-2 infection with expansion of cross-reactive RTC-specific T cells, highlighting these highly conserved proteins as targets for future vaccines against endemic and emerging Coronaviridae.","Swadling, L.; Diniz, M.

Patients with deficits of controlled semantic retrieval in the context of semantic aphasia (SA) after stroke may benefit from this approach since their deficits tend to be accompanied by deficits of cognitive control. We assessed the effect of both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation in healthy controls and semantic aphasia patients. Experiment 1 manipulated extrinsic reward using high or low levels of points for correct responses during a semantic association task. Experiment 2 manipulated the intrinsic value of items using self-reference; allocating pictures of items to the participant (‘self’) or researcher (‘other’) in a shopping game before people retrieved their semantic associations. These experiments revealed that patients, but not controls, showed better performance when given an extrinsic reward, consistent with the view that increased external motivation may help to ameliorate patients’ semantic control deficits. However, while self-reference was associated with better episodic memory, there was no effect on semantic retrieval. We conclude that semantic control deficits can be reduced when extrinsic rewards are anticipated; this enhanced motivational state is expected to support proactive control, for example, through the maintenance of task representations.

C-suite executives have minimal understanding of what pricing can do and how it impacts a firm’s performance. After two years in the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis, consultants agree that the next wave of strategies and business models will require the development of strategic pricing capabilities, including analytics and software. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted 49 interviews with CXOs, VPs of pricing and CEOs of pricing software vendors to understand how the best-performing companies use pricing to drive profits and select pricing technologies. Then, supported by the Professional Pricing Society, the world’s largest organization dedicated to pricing, the authors conducted a 2020 survey of 540 pricing professionals to understand the perceptions of pricing in the C-suite and how top executives prioritize pricing investments. The authors complemented their own research with analysis of publicly available data, analyst presentations and public comments by CEOs on pricing. Findings: The authors propose a portfolio of 15 activities to include in the CEO’s strategic agenda and 10 actions to get started with in the short term. The next normal will not be based on business-as-usual. For the next three to five years, developing strategic pricing capabilities will give firms a competitive advantage over those who continue to neglect this hidden gem. Originality/value: In the context of the accelerating economic recovery, the authors address one of the most pressing priority for the C-suite. The authors focus on a series of actions and activities that the C-suite can take to accelerate recovery and focus on profitable growth. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Liozu, S.

However, despite an abundance of predictions, the literature still lacks empirical investigations of the impact of the pandemic. In this paper, we perform a first of a kind analysis and investigate the short-run impact of COVID-19 on the activity in the insurance in one country?North Macedonia. By utilizing a seasonal autoregressive model, we find that during the first half of 2020, the activity in the insurance industry shrank by more than 10% to what was expected. The total loss in the industry amounted to approximately 8.2 million euros. This was much less than the volume of reserves that the Insurance Supervision Agency made available as funds for dealing with the potential crisis. In addition, the pandemic induced changes in the insurance activity structure?the share of motor vehicles class in the total industry activity fell at the expense of the property classes. Our results suggest that the insurance industry in North Macedonia was well prepared to tackle the consequences of the pandemic and that automatic stabilizers had a major influence on weakening the overall negative impact.","Stojkoski, Viktor Jolakoski Petar Ivanovski Igor",Risk Management and Insurance Review,https://doi.org/10.1111/rmir.12187,491

Previous studies using the rodent malaria model indicate that the dermal inoculation site may be where sporozoites are most vulnerable to antibodies, yet, functional in vivo assays with human malaria parasites are lacking. Here, we present the first characterization of P. falciparum sporozoites in the skin, comparing their motility to two rodent malaria species and investigating whether the environment of its natural host influences P. falciparum sporozoite motility using a human skin xenograft model. The combined data suggest that in contrast to the liver and blood stages, the skin is not a species-specific barrier for Plasmodium. We observe that P. falciparum sporozoites inoculated into mouse skin move with similar speed, displacement and duration, and enter blood vessels in similar numbers as the rodent parasites. Thus, interventions targeting P. falciparum sporozoite migration can be tested in the murine dermis. Importantly, to streamline quantification of sporozoite motility, we developed a toolbox allowing for automated detection and tracking of sporozoites in intravital microscopy videos. This establishes a platform to test vaccine candidates, immunization protocols, monoclonal antibodies and drug candidates for their impact on human malaria sporozoites in vivo. Screening of intervention strategies for in vivo efficacy against Pf sporozoites using this new platform will have the potential to validate targets prior to expensive clinical trials.","Hopp, Christine S.; Kanatani, Sachie; Archer, Nathan K.; Miller, Robert J.; Liu, Haiyun; Chiou, Kevin; Miller, Lloyd S.; Sinnis, Photini",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/716878,491

We tested the effect of two probiotic consortia, OL-1 and OL-2, against SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets and assessed their effect on cytokine production and transcriptome in a human monocyte-derived macrophage (Mf) and dendritic cell (DC) model. The results showed that the consortia significantly reduced the viral load, modulated immune response, and regulated viral receptor expression in ferrets compared to placebo. In human Mf and DC model, OL-1 and OL-2 induced cytokine production and genes related to SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral immunity. The study results indicate that probiotic stimulation of the ferret immune system leads to improved anti-viral immunity against SARS-COV-2 and that critical genes and cytokines for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity are stimulated in human immune cells in vitro.

Consequently, being able to accurately predict appropriate linear B-cell epitope regions would pave the way for the development of new protein-based vaccines. Knowing how much confidence there is in a prediction is also essential for gaining clinicians’ trust in the technology. In this article, we propose a calibrated uncertainty estimation in deep learning to approximate variational Bayesian inference using MC-DropWeights to predict epitope regions using the data from the immune epitope database. Having applied this onto SARS-CoV-2, it can more reliably predict B-cell epitopes than standard methods.

This unprecedented COVID-19 situation has mainly situated the teachers and learners into the uncomfortable position for not only having to continue teaching-learning online classes for the first time but also to do it without any notice or preparedness. Behind such backdrop, this paper attempts to explore the challenges and opportunities for adopting Remote Teaching in the time of COVID-19. To this end, this study devised a survey questionnaire for students of Shaqra University, Saudi Arabia, to have a ground reality of the situation and prospects of teaching-learning online. The collected data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The study result suggests that in response to the immediate impact of school closures, it is necessary to facilitate the continuity of education for all through remote learning mode, which is safe and suitable for the current world situation by ensuring the digital devices, internet infrastructure, the availability of the communication network to the peripheral users in rural interiors and teacher-students training for new survival digital skills. The study also reflected that the excellent benefits of learning technology and media apps help continue the wheel of education through impacting the learners' motivation and immersion to learning.

180396,Transferring interactive activities in large lectures from face-to-face to online settings,2020,"Mass mortalities of the larval stage of the giant freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, have been occurring in Bangladesh since 2011. Mortalities can reach 100% and have resulted in an 80% decline in the number of hatcheries actively producing M. rosenbergii. To investigate a causative agent for the mortalities, a disease challenge was carried out using infected material from a hatchery experiencing mortalities. Moribund larvae from the challenge were prepared for metatranscriptomic sequencing. De novo virus assembly revealed a 29 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with similarities in key protein motif sequences to yellow head virus (YHV), an RNA virus that causes mass mortalities in marine shrimp aquaculture, and other viruses in the Nidovirales order. Primers were designed against the novel virus and used to screen cDNA from larvae sampled from hatcheries in the South of Bangladesh from two consecutive years. Larvae from all hatcheries screened from both years were positive by PCR for the novel virus, including larvae from a hatchery that at the point of sampling appeared healthy, but later experienced mortalities. These screens suggest that the virus is widespread in M. rosenbergii hatchery culture in southern Bangladesh, and that early detection of the virus can be achieved by PCR. The hypothesised protein motifs of MrGV suggest that it is likely to be a new species within the Nidovirales order. Biosecurity measures should be taken in order to mitigate global spread through the movement of post-larvae within and between countries, which has previously been linked to other virus outbreaks in crustacean aquaculture.","Hooper, Chantelle; Debnath, Partho P.; Biswas, Sukumar; van Aerle, Ronny; Bateman, Kelly S.; Basak, Siddhawartha K.; Rahman, Muhammad M.; Mohan, Chadag V.; Rakibul Islam, H.M.; Ross, Stuart; Stentiford, Grant D.; Currie, David; Bass, David",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.12.090258,491
180581,Association rules on the COVID-19 variants of concern to guide choices of tourism destinations,2021,"Currently, there is a heated debate in society around the topic of vaccination. The views of supporters and opponents of vaccinations clash, which is particularly visible on the Internet and social media. Clearly, the discussions are particularly lively at this time due to the challenge facing countries around the world to immunise large numbers of people with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in order to contain the raging pandemic. Although the dispute over vaccination undoubtedly contributes to an increase in public awareness of this issue, it also brings a large dose of chaos and disinformation. The discussion about vaccinations is often accompanied by a lack of substantive content and presentation of scientifically verified arguments, while mutual hostility, threats and dissemination of untrue information dominate. This situation negatively affects parents who, as a consequence, have a problem with making an informed decision about their child’s vaccination. It is also a source of high stress: on the one hand, there is the obligation to vaccinate, while on the other hand, there is a fear of adverse reactions to vaccines, which is framed in psychology as the so-called approach–avoidance conflict and the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance. Many parents deal with this conflict by looking for information, e.g. by asking their paediatrician. However, they do not always find understanding with them either, which deepens their anxiety and frustration. The aim of the article is to draw attention to the above problem, to characterise the social discussion on vaccination, to emphasise the special role of the doctor and doctor–patient communication in this regard, and to provide recommendations on how to effectively conduct this kind of communication. © Medical Communications Sp. z o.o.","Księska-Koszałka, J.

However, molecular details of such co-transcriptional mechanisms remain obscure, partly due to technical limitations in purifying authentic nascent transcripts. We present a new approach to purify and profile nascent RNA, called Polymerase Intact Nascent Transcript (POINT) technology. This three-pronged methodology maps nascent RNA 5’ends (POINT-5), establishes the kinetics of co-transcriptional splicing patterns (POINT-nano) and profiles whole transcription units (POINT-seq). In particular we show by depletion of the nuclear exonuclease Xrn2 that this activity acts selectively on cleaved 5’P-RNA at polyadenylation sites. Furthermore POINT-nano reveals that splicing occurs either immediately after splice site transcription or is delayed until Pol II transcribes downstream sequences. Finally, we connect RNA cleavage and splicing with either premature or full-length transcript termination. We anticipate that POINT technology will afford full dissection of the complexity of co-transcriptional RNA processing.

However, the self-supervised representation learning for link prediction in HBNs has been slightly explored in previous researches. Therefore, this study proposes a two-level self-supervised representation learning, namely selfRL, for link prediction in heterogeneous biomedical networks. The meta path detection-based self-supervised learning task is proposed to learn representation vectors that can capture the global-level structure and semantic feature in HBNs. The vertex entity mask-based self-supervised learning mechanism is designed to enhance local association of vertices. Finally, the representations from two tasks are concatenated to generate high-quality representation vectors. The results of link prediction on six datasets show selfRL outperforms 25 state-of-the-art methods. In particular, selfRL reveals great performance with results close to 1 in terms of AUC and AUPR on the NeoDTI-net dataset. In addition, the PubMed publications demonstrate that nine out of ten drugs screened by selfRL can inhibit the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.

The procedure was performed using a standard 11-mm reusable trocar for a 10-mm, 30 degree-angled, rigid scope and curved reusable instruments inserted transumbilically without trocars. Operative time was 90 minutes, and the final incision length was 14 mm. The use of minimal pain medication permitted discharge on the third postoperative day, and after 25 months, the patient remains asymptomatic with a no visible umbilical scar. CONCLUSIONS Giant biliary cysts can be removed by single-access laparoscopy. Because of this technique, surgeons work in ergonomic positions, and the cost of the procedure remains similar to that of the multitrocar technique. The incision length and the use of pain medication are kept minimal as well.","Dapri, Giovanni; Barabino, Matteo; Carnevali, Pietro; Surdeanu, Ion; Himpens, Jacques; Cadière, Guy-Bernard; Donckier, Vincent",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23477183/,491

METHODS This is a retrospective descriptive case series, which analysed the medical and nursing records of all highly-suspected/suspected SARS patients admitted to a major acute hospital in Hong Kong. Key nursing personnel were also interviewed. RESULTS The study included a total of 17 highly-suspected and 49 suspected SARS paediatric patients (age: 1-16). None of the paediatric patients was eventually diagnosed of SARS. Most cases presented fever (highly-suspected: 76.5%/ suspected: 100%), cough (64.7%/71.4%), nausea and vomiting (35.3%/28.6%). Nursing care was provided to the patients as necessary. Both the children and parents experienced fear of SARS, as well as separation anxiety arisen from hospitalization in a strict isolation setting. CONCLUSIONS Infection control overshadowed the family-centred nursing practices in the management of SARS paediatric patients. A major nursing care issue for SARS paediatric patients was to achieve a careful balance between attending to patients' physical and psychological needs and adhering to the infection control guidelines, while at the same time offering psychological support to family members. The current philosophy and practice of family-centred nursing model neglect the special needs of children with infectious diseases and predominantly apply to children with non-infectious diseases that family visits are allowed and nursing care by parents are encouraged.","Chan, Sophia S C; Leung, Daisy Y K; Wong, Emmy M Y; Tiwari, Agnes F Y; Wong, David C N; Lo, S L; Lau, Y L",Journal of paediatrics and child health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16487385/,491
189287,Letter: A coronavirus-like agent present in faeces of cows with diarrhoea.,1975,"The high-resolution crystal structure of kexin (Kex2) in complex with a peptidyl-chloromethylketone inhibitor containing a noncognate lysine at the P(1) position provides the structural basis for the differential lysine/arginine selectivity that defines the prohormone (proprotein) convertase (PC) family. By comparison with the previous structures of Kex2 and furin, this structure of the acylated enzyme provides a basis for the observed decrease in the acylation rate with substrates containing a lysine at P(1) and the absence of an effect on the deacylation rate without involving mobility of the S(1) lid. The structure of the complex shows that a secondary subsite in the S(1) pocket is present, and that this site recognizes and binds the P(1) lysine in a more shallow fashion than arginine. This results in a displacement of the bound peptide away from the S385 nucleophile relative to substrates containing a P(1) arginine. It is concluded that this alternate binding site and resultant displacement of the scissile bond in the active site results in the observed decrease in the acylation rate. Studies of the inactivation kinetics of Kex2 by two peptidyl chloromethylketone inhibitors demonstrates that the selectivity between lysine and arginine at the P(1) position arises at the acylation step, consistent with what was observed with peptidyl substrates [Rockwell NC, Fuller RS (2001) J Biol Chem 276:38394-38399].","Wheatley, Joshua L; Holyoak, Todd",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17426142/,491

Lessons for national implementation of a simulation-based programme.,2016,"AIMS We aim to quantify differences in clinical outcomes from COVID-19 infection in Aotearoa New Zealand by ethnicity and with a focus on risk of hospitalisation. METHODS We used data on age, ethnicity, deprivation index, pre-existing health conditions and clinical outcomes on 1,829 COVID-19 cases reported in New Zealand. We used a logistic regression model to calculate odds ratios for the risk of hospitalisation by ethnicity. We also considered length of hospital stay and risk of fatality. RESULTS After controlling for age and pre-existing conditions, we found that Māori have 2.50 times greater odds of hospitalisation (95% CI 1.39-4.51) than non-Māori non-Pacific people. Pacific people have three times greater odds (95% CI 1.75-5.33). CONCLUSIONS Structural inequities and systemic racism in the healthcare system mean that Māori and Pacific communities face a much greater health burden from COVID-19. Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions are also at greater risk. This should inform future policy decisions including prioritising groups for vaccination.","Steyn, Nicholas; Binny, Rachelle N; Hannah, Kate; Hendy, Shaun C; James, Alex; Lustig, Audrey; Ridings, Kannan; Plank, Michael J; Sporle, Andrew",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34239143/,491

This study sought to describe the age-distribution of SARS-CoV-2 testing in the Northern Region of New Zealand. METHODS A retrospective single-centre review of all SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at LabPLUS, Auckland City Hospital, between 12 February and 18 April 2020. RESULTS A total of 22,333 tests were performed, with 313 (1.40%) positive results. The age-adjusted SARS-CoV-2 testing rate was three times higher in adults than in children. The overall proportion of positive tests was lower in children (0.86%) than adults (1.45%). However, within the paediatric population the proportion of tests positive differed significantly between those <10 years old (0.08%) and those 10-14 years old (2.6%). CONCLUSION The lower proportion of tests positive in children <10 years of age suggests they are appropriately tested relative to their rates of disease. A large high school-associated cluster makes the higher proportion of tests positive in children 10-14 years old difficult to interpret. Older children may have a higher risk of infection and increasing testing in intermediate and high school aged children may be indicated.","Chhibber, Aakash V; Muttaiyah, Sharmini; McAuliffe, Gary; Fox-Lewis, Shivani; De Almeida, Mary; Blakiston, Matthew; Playle, Veronica; Fox-Lewis, Andrew; Roberts, Sally",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32777799/,491

Because its sequence data differ from that of known human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is suspected to have crossed the species barrier between an animal host and humans. The SARS outbreak began in China's Guangdong Province, where approximately 1,500 probable cases were identified during November 2002-June 2003. Detection of SARS-like coronavirus has been reported previously in masked palm civets (sometimes called civet cats) and a raccoon dog for sale in a live animal market in Shenzhen municipality. This report summarizes results of an investigation conducted by public health authorities in Guangdong Province, which compared the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV IgG antibody in animal traders (i.e., workers in live animal markets) with that of persons in control groups. The results indicated that 13% of the animal traders, none of whom had SARS diagnosed, had IgG antibody to SARS-CoV, compared with 1%-3% of persons in three control groups. Although the results provide indirect support for the hypothesis of an animal origin for SARS, they also underscore the need for detailed patient histories and more focused animal studies to confirm an animal origin for SARS.",,MMWR.

In the present study, we have produced a polyclonal antibody against the purified human p63 protein to reassess the subcellular distribution of p63 by confocal immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy, and cell fractionation. Double immunofluorescence of COS cells showed significant colocalization of p63 and a KDEL-containing lumenal ER marker protein, except for differences in the staining of the outer nuclear membrane. Immunoelectron microscopy of native HepG2 cells and of COS cells transfected with p63 revealed that both endogenous and overexpressed p63 are predominantly localized in the rough ER. While p63 was colocalized with protein disulfide isomerase, an ER marker protein, very little overlap of p63 was found with ERGIC-53, an established marker for the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. When rough and smooth membranes were prepared from rat liver, p63 was found to copurify with ribophorin II, a rough ER protein. Both p63 and ribophorin II were predominantly recovered in rough microsomes and were largely separated from the intermediate compartment marker protein p58. From these results it is concluded that p63 is localized in the rough ER.","Schweizer, A; Rohrer, J; Slot, J W; Geuze, H J; Kornfeld, S",Journal of cell science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7673362/,491
197519,An exploration of conceptual and temporal fallacies in international health law and promotion of global public health preparedness.,2007,"Background The endemic human coronavirus NL63 strain (HCoV-NL63) employs angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors on cell surfaces to infect hosts in the same manner as SARS-CoV and the novel SARS-CoV-2. It has been proposed that patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) therapy infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a higher mortality rate due to over-expression of ACE-2 receptors. Aim We sought to evaluate the impact of ACE-I/ARB on infectivity of various endemic coronavirus strains, hypothesizing that rates of ACE-I use among patients with HCoV-NL63 would be higher compared to other endemic coronavirus strains that do not utilize the ACE-2 receptor. Design/Methods A retrospective cohort study was designed to evaluate a total 466 subjects with a positive respiratory pathogens panel for one of the endemic coronavirus strains. Rate of ACE-I/ARB use among each coronavirus strain and clinical outcomes from the 88 HCoV-NL63 positive subjects was collected. Results Analysis revealed a higher rate of ACE-I (p=0.006) use among the HCoV-NL63 positives compared to the other three endemic coronavirus strains. The rate of invasive mechanical ventilation (p=0.007) and 90-day mortality (p=0.045) among HCoV-NL63 positives on ACE-I therapy was higher compared to those HCoV-NL63 positives not on ACE-I therapy. Conclusion Concurrent therapy with an ACE-I was associated with an increased rate and severity of infection with the HCoV-NL63. This association was not found in infected patients on concurrent ARB therapy. These findings support the importance of further evaluation in patients on these therapies who are infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.","Krvavac, Armin; Patel, Tarang P; Karle, Ethan M; Epstein, Nicholas B; Reznikov, Elizabeth A; Gates, Lancer G; Holliday, Zachary M",Missouri medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32848272/,491

DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING A newly set up SARS screening clinic in the emergency department of a university hospital in Hong Kong's New Territories. PARTICIPANTS 556 hospital staff, patients, and relatives who attended the screening clinic and who had had contact with someone with SARS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Number of confirmed cases of SARS. RESULTS Of the 556 people, 141 were admitted to hospital, and 97 had confirmed SARS. Fever, chills, malaise, myalgia, rigor, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, and neck pain but not respiratory tract symptoms were significantly more common among the 97 patients than among the other patients. The overall accuracy of the WHO guidelines for identifying suspected SARS was 83% and their negative predictive value was 86% (95% confidence interval 83% to 89%). They had a sensitivity of 26% (17% to 36%) and a specificity of 96% (93% to 97%). CONCLUSIONS Current WHO guidelines for diagnosing suspected SARS may not be sufficiently sensitive in assessing patients before admission to hospital. Daily follow up, evaluation of non-respiratory, systemic symptoms, and chest radiography would be better screening tools.","Rainer, Timothy H; Cameron, Peter A; Smit, DeVilliers; Ong, Kim L; Hung, Alex Ng Wing; Nin, David Chan Po; Ahuja, Anil T; Si, Louis Chan Yik; Sung, Joseph J Y",BMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12816820/,491

Second, I review studies of archived viruses from the three recent influenza pandemics. Third, I discuss current limitations in using molecular data to study the evolution of infectious disease.

OBJECTIVE To provide preliminary results on the potential therapeutic benefit and tolerability of interferon alfacon-1 plus corticosteroids for SARS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Open-label study of 22 patients diagnosed as having probable SARS at North York General Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, between April 11 and May 30, 2003. INTERVENTIONS Thirteen patients were treated with corticosteroids alone and 9 patients were treated with corticosteroids plus subcutaneous interferon alfacon-1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical parameters, including oxygen saturation and requirement, laboratory measures, and serial chest radiography results. RESULTS Resolution of fever and lymphopenia were similar between the 2 treatment groups. Of the 13 patients treated with corticosteroids alone, 5 (38.5%) were transferred to the intensive care unit, 3 (23.1%) required intubation and mechanical ventilation, and 1 (7.7%) died. Of the 9 patients in the interferon alfacon-1 treatment group, 3 (33.3%) were transferred to the intensive care unit, 1 (11.1%) required intubation and mechanical ventilation, and none died. The interferon alfacon-1 treatment group had a shorter time to 50% resolution of lung radiographic abnormalities (median time, 4 days vs 9 days; P =.001), had better oxygen saturation (P =.02), resolved their need for supplemental oxygen more rapidly (median, 10 days vs 16 days; P =.02), had less of an increase in creatine kinase levels (P =.03), and showed a trend toward more rapid resolution of lactate dehydrogenase levels compared with the group receiving corticosteroids alone. CONCLUSIONS In this preliminary, uncontrolled study of patients with SARS, use of interferon alfacon-1 plus corticosteroids was associated with reduced disease-associated impaired oxygen saturation, more rapid resolution of radiographic lung abnormalities, and lower levels of creatine kinase. These findings suggest that further investigation may be warranted to determine the role of interferon alfacon-1 as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of SARS.","Loutfy, Mona R; Blatt, Lawrence M; Siminovitch, Katharine A; Ward, Sarah; Wolff, Bryan; Lho, Hyoung; Pham, Dieu H; Deif, Hassan; LaMere, Elizabeth A; Chang, Margaret; Kain, Kevin C; Farcas, Gabriella A; Ferguson, Patti; Latchford, Mary; Levy, Gary; Dennis, James W; Lai, Enoch K Y; Fish, Eleanor N",JAMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14693875/,491

These cells were named very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSEL-SC). The authors hypothesized that they are direct descendants of the germ lineage. Germ lineage, in order to pass genes on to the next generation, has to create soma and thus becomes a 'mother lineage' for all somatic cell lineages present in the adult body. Germ potential is established after conception in a totipotent zygote and retained subsequently during development in blastomers of morula, cells form the inner cell mass of blastocyst, epiblast and population of primordial germ cells.

METHODS The database was designed by specialists, under the organization of the Beijing Commanding Center for SARS Treatment and Cure, including 686 data items in six sub-databases: primary medical-care seeking, vital signs, common symptoms and signs, treatment, laboratory and auxiliary test, and cost. All hospitals having received SARS inpatients were involved in the project. Clinical data was transferred and coded by trained doctors and data entry was carried out by trained nurses, according to a uniformed protocol. A series of procedures had been taken before the database was finally established which included programmed logic checking, digit-by-digit check on 5% random sample, data linkage for transferred cases, coding of characterized information, database structure standardization, case reviewe by computer program according to SARS Clinical Diagnosis Criteria issued by the Ministry of Health, and exclusion of unqualified patients. RESULTS The database involved 2148 probable SARS cases in accordant with the clinical diagnosis criteria, including 1291 with complete records. All cases and record-complete cases showed an almost identical distribution in sex, age, occupation, residence areas and time of onset. The completion rate of data was not significantly different between the two groups except for some items on primary medical-care seeking. Specifically, the data completion rate was 73% - 100% in primary medical-care seeking, 90% in common symptoms and signs, 100% for treatment, 98% for temperature, 90% for pulse, 100% for outcomes and 98% for costs in hospital. CONCLUSION The number of cases collected in the Beijing Clinical Database of SARS Patients was fairly complete. Cases with complete records showed that they could serve as excellent representatives of all cases.

Preliminarily, Bacillus atrophaeus were inoculated into different environments (dry, hydrated, and saliva) to imitate coughing and sneezing and serve as a ""worst-case"" regarding challenged PPE. The inactivation of the microbes by scCO2 sterilization with NovaKill or H2O2 sterilant was investigated as a function of exposure times ranging from 5 to 90 min with a goal of elucidating possible mechanisms. Also, human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 were inoculated on the respirator material, and viral activity was determined post-treatment. Moreover, we investigated the reprocessing ability of scCO2-based decontamination using wettability testing and surface mapping. Different inactivation mechanisms have been identified in scCO2 sanitization, such as membrane damage, germination defect, and dipicolinic acid leaks. Moreover, the viral sanitization results showed a complete inactivation of both coronavirus HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. We did not observe changes in PPE morphology, topographical structure, or material integrity, and in accordance with the WHO recommendation, maintained wettability post-processing. These experiments establish a foundational understanding of critical elements for the decontamination and reuse of PPE in any setting and provide a direction for future research in the field.","Bennet, Devasier; Harris, Ashlee F; Lacombe, Jerome; Brooks, Carla; Bionda, Nina; Strickland, Aaron D; Eisenhut, Tony; Zenhausern, Frederic",Sci Total Environ,,491

METHODS: Adults (18-40â¯years; BMI 18-35â¯kg/m2) participated in a parallel, double-blinded dietary intervention during which beverages sweetened with aspartame, glucose (25% of energy requirements (ereq)), fructose or HFCS (25% and 17.5% ereq) were consumed for two weeks. Groups were matched for sex, baseline BMI and plasma lipid/lipoprotein concentrations. 24-h serial blood samples were collected at baseline and after the intervention. Primary outcomes were 24-h triglyceride AUC, LDL-cholesterol (C), and apolipoprotein (apo)B. Interactions between fructose and glucose were assessed post hoc. FINDINGS: 145 subjects (26.0â¯±â¯5.8â¯years; body mass index 25.0â¯±â¯3.7â¯kg/m2) completed the study. As expected, the increase of 24-h triglycerides compared with aspartame was highest during fructose consumption (25%: 6.66â¯mmol/Lx24h 95% CI [1.90 to 11.63], Pâ¯=â¯0.0013 versus aspartame), intermediate during HFCS consumption (25%: 4.68â¯mmol/Lx24h 95% CI [-0.18 to 9.55], Pâ¯=â¯0.066 versus aspartame) and lowest during glucose consumption. In contrast, the increase of LDL-C was highest during HFCS consumption (25%: 0.46â¯mmol/L 95% CI [0.16 to 0.77], Pâ¯=â¯0.0002 versus aspartame) and intermediate during fructose consumption (25%: 0.33â¯mmol/L 95% CI [0.03 to 0.63], Pâ¯=â¯0.023 versus aspartame), as was the increase of apoB (HFCS-25%: 0.108â¯g/L 95%CI [0.032 to 0.184], Pâ¯=â¯0.001; fructose 25%: 0.072â¯g/L 95%CI [-0.004 to 0.148], Pâ¯=â¯0.074 versus aspartame). The post hoc analyses showed significant interactive effects of fructose*glucose on LDL-C and apoB (both Pâ¯<â¯0.01), but not on 24-h triglyceride (Pâ¯=â¯0.340). CONCLUSION: A significant interaction between fructose and glucose contributed to increases of lipoprotein risk factors when the two monosaccharides were co-ingested as HFCS. Thus, the effects of HFCS on lipoprotein risks factors are not solely mediated by the fructose content and it cannot be assumed that glucose is a benign component of HFCS. Our findings suggest that HFCS may be as harmful as isocaloric amounts of pure fructose and provide further support for the urgency to implement strategies to limit free sugar consumption.","Hieronimus, Bettina; Medici, Valentina; Bremer, Andrew A; Lee, Vivien; Nunez, Marinelle V; Sigala, Desiree M; Keim, Nancy L; Havel, Peter J; Stanhope, Kimber L",Metabolism,,491

To prevent the spread of it, a high sensitivity and efficient method for COVID-19 detection is necessary. By analyzing the COVID-19 chest X-ray images, a combination method of image regrouping and ResNet-SVM was proposed in this study. The lung region was segmented from the original chest X-ray images and divided into small pieces, and then the small pieces of lung region were regrouped into a regular image randomly. Furthermore the regrouped images were fed into the deep residual encoder block for feature extraction. Finally the extracted features were as input into support vector machine for recognition. The visual attention was introduced in the novel method, which paid more attention to the features of COVID-19 without the interference of shapes, rib and other related noises. The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved 93% accuracy without large number of training data, outperformed the existing COVID-19 detection models.

METHODS: An Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on 29 January 2020. A total of 4393 adults &#8805;18 y of age and residing or working in the province of Hubei, central China were included in the study. RESULTS: The majority of the participants expressed a great degree of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government compared with the local government. Being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.35 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.80 to 3.08]) and having a high institutional trust score (OR 2.23 [95% CI 1.96 to 2.53]) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive practices scores. The majority of study participants (n=3640 [85.7%]) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with COVID-19. Few of the participants from Wuhan (n=475 [16.6%]) and those participants who were under quarantine (n=550 [13.8%]) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment.

212002,"Tackling the invisible during COVID-19 urban prevention: insights on housing and mobility in Maputo, Mozambique",2021,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, there has been a massive increase in child marriages following the COVID-19 crisis. In Indonesia, too, this figure has risen with Indonesia ranked amongst ten countries with the highest rates of child marriage in the world. One of the Indonesian provinces with a high incidence of child marriage cases is in Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine what is causing the rate of child marriages to increase since the outbreak of COVID-19 in NTB. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Using snowball sampling techniques, the researcher selected 23 study participants, including ten parents (seven mothers and three fathers) with children who were married underage and 13 adolescents aged 14 to 17 years old (ten females and three males) who were married between March and December 2020. They came from two different regencies of NTB: Lombok Barat and Lombok Utara. METHODS: This study employed qualitative phenomenology as the method of inquiry. Data was obtained through semi-structured in-depth interviews and analyzed in a two-stage coding model. The results of the analysis were asserted on phenomenological themes. RESULTS: The data reveals that teenagers get married because: 1) they believe that marriage is an escape-from schoolwork, house chores, and the stress and boredom of studying and staying at home during the pandemic; 2) the customary law- some local customs encourage or permit child marriage; 3) there is a lack of understanding of the impact and long term implications of underage marriage; 4) economic problems- financial problems trigger parents to marry their children at a young age; and 5) the influence of the surrounding environment and peers, which encourages early marriage. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a number of recommendations for the prevention of child marriage: 1) socializing the prevention of child marriage; 2) offering alternative activities and support systems for adolescents to overcome frustration and pressure due to online learning and staying at home; 3) changing society's view that marrying children solves adolescent promiscuity, prevents pregnancy, and addresses the issue of non-marital pregnancy.","Rahiem, Maila D H",Child Abuse Negl,,491
213219,Legal regime of vaccines in Spain: Reflections on the situation created by the coronavirus,2020,"To safely resume sports, college and university athletic programs and regional athletic conferences created plans to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Mitigation measures included physical distancing, universal masking, and maximizing outdoor activity during training; routine testing; 10-day isolation of persons with COVID-19; and 14-day quarantine of athletes identified as close contacts* of persons with confirmed COVID-19. Regional athletic conferences created testing and quarantine policies based on National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) guidance (1); testing policies varied by conference, school, and sport. To improve compliance with quarantine and reduce the personal and economic burden of quarantine adherence, the quarantine period has been reduced in several countries from 14 days to as few as 5 days with testing (2) or 10 days without testing (3). Data on quarantined athletes participating in NCAA sports were used to characterize COVID-19 exposures and assess the amount of time between quarantine start and first positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Despite the potential risk for transmission from frequent, close contact associated with athletic activities (4), more athletes reported exposure to COVID-19 at social gatherings (40.7%) and from roommates (31.7%) than they did from exposures associated with athletic activities (12.7%). Among 1,830 quarantined athletes, 458 (25%) received positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results during the 14-day quarantine, with a mean of 3.8 days from quarantine start (range = 0-14 days) until the positive test result. Among athletes who had not received a positive test result by quarantine day 5, the probability of having a positive test result decreased from 27% after day 5 to <5% after day 10. These findings support new guidance from CDC (5) in which different options are provided to shorten quarantine for persons such as collegiate athletes, especially if doing so will increase compliance, balancing the reduced duration of quarantine against a small but nonzero risk for postquarantine transmission. Improved adherence to mitigation measures (e.g., universal masking, physical distancing, and hand hygiene) at all times could further reduce exposures to SARS-CoV-2 and disruptions to athletic activities because of infections and quarantine (1,6).","Atherstone, Christine; Peterson, Meaghan L; Malone, Mackenzie; Honein, Margaret A; MacNeil, Adam; O039,; Neal, Catherine S; Paul, Stephen; Harmon, Kimberly G; Goerl, Kyle; Wolfe, Cameron R; Casani, Julie; Barrios, Lisa C",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,491

METHODS: We recruited current adult and pediatric fellows and 2020 graduates of nephrology training programs in the United States to participate in a survey measuring COVID-19's effects on their training experiences and wellbeing. RESULTS: Of 1005 nephrology fellows-in-training and recent graduates, 425 participated (response rate 42%). Telehealth was widely adopted (90% for some or all outpatient nephrology consults), as was remote learning (76% of conferences were exclusively online). Most respondents (64%) did not have in-person consults on COVID-19 inpatients; these patients were managed by telehealth visits (27%), by in-person visits with the attending faculty without fellows (29%), or by another approach (9%). A majority of fellows (84%) and graduates (82%) said their training programs successfully sustained their education during the pandemic, and most fellows (86%) and graduates (90%) perceived themselves as prepared for unsupervised practice. Although 42% indicated the pandemic had negatively affected their overall quality of life and 33% reported a poorer work-life balance, only 15% of 412 respondents who completed the Resident Well-Being Index met its distress threshold. Risk for distress was increased among respondents who perceived the pandemic had impaired their knowledge base (odds ratio [OR], 3.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00 to 4.77) or negatively affected their quality of life (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.29 to 5.46) or work-life balance (OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 2.18 to 4.71).

222322,"The association between COVID-19 deaths and short-term ambient air pollution/meteorological condition exposure: a retrospective study from Wuhan, China",2020,"Rationale: The ideal ventilator settings in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) while on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) are unknown. ELSO recommends modest driving pressures and PEEP (i.e., “lung rest”) during ECMO to minimize ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) and improve mortality. However, even lower driving pressures (DP) may improve inflammatory and lung injury biomarker profiles, and possibly improve mortality. The focus of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of very-low DP in patients with ARDS on ECMO. Methods: Patients on ECMO due to ARDS from coronavirus disease 2019 had their DP decreased from 10 to 1-5 cmH2O for two hours, as tolerated. The other ventilator settings were unchanged and were consistent with ELSO guidelines;positive end-expiratory pressure (10-15 cmH2O) and a respiratory rate 10 breaths per minute. During the low DP protocol, the transpulmonary pressure was monitored with esophageal manometry. Plasma (for IL6 and sRAGE) and urine were collected before and after the protocol. Results: Thirty patients were enrolled and ultimately 21 patients underwent the low DP protocol. Seventeen were male, aged 51 ± 9 years, median BMI of 31.7 kg/m2 (IQR 27.4-35.2), with a median SOFA score of 10 (IQR 8-12) at ICU admission. There were no complications during the low DP protocol (1-5 cm H2O). The protocol was performed a median of 16 (IQR 13.5-20) hours after ECMO initiation. Average ECMO days were 21 (IQR 12.5-41) with a survival to hospital discharge of 43% (9/21). Baseline average tidal volume (TV) was 3.4±2.6 ml/kg of predicted body weight (PBW), during the low DP protocol the TV decreased to 2.7±3.2 ml/kg of PDW. Two groups were noted-those who had spontaneous breaths vs. those who did not (see Figure 1). Ten patients during the low DP protocol continued to have unchanged TV, 5.2±2.8 to 5.4±2.7 ml/kg of PBW due to spontaneous breathing found on esophageal manometry. Eleven patients had no spontaneous breaths and TV decreased from 1.76±0.57 to 0.2±0.38 ml/kg of PBW during the low DP protocol. The spontaneous vs. nonspontaneous breathing groups has a statistically different TV before, during, and after the low DP protocol (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: Very-low DP is feasible in patients on ECMO support which may decrease VILI. However, in the absence of neuromuscular blockade patients might spontaneously breathe with the same transpulmonary pressure. Thus, whether low DP offers any advantage in spontaneous breathing vs. non-spontaneous breathing requires further study. (Table Presented).","Odish, M.

In order to deal with these problems, a online teaching system based on human action recognition is developed to assist teachers in real-time capturing the class status of classmates and improve the efficiency of home-based online teaching. Here, the system uses the OpenPose human body gesture recognition algorithm to obtain the key points of the student's body in class in front of the camera, and recognizes the student's class behavior through the analysis of the coordinates.

An influenza outbreak can interfere with combat readiness in a military setting, as the infection can incapacitate soldiers. Vaccination remains the most effective tool to prevent and mitigate seasonal influenza. Although influenza vaccinations for U.S. Army soldiers can be monitored through military health systems, those systems cannot capture DoD civilians and Army dependents who may not use military health services. This study aims to gauge flu vaccine uptake and perceptions in U.S. Army civilians and dependents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was e-mailed to civilian and dependent enrollees of Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. The survey contained 24 questions pertaining to demographics, vaccine history, history of the flu, and beliefs toward vaccines. Chi-square tests, t-tests, and logistic regressions were performed to investigate the association between demographic, behavior, and belief factors with vaccine uptake. Free-text answers were coded and categorized by themes. RESULTS: Over 70% of respondents were vaccinated for the flu. There were differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated respondents regarding their perceptions of barriers to vaccination, benefits of the flu vaccine, severity of flu symptoms, and personal risk of getting ill with the flu. After controlling for confounders, flu vaccination in the previous season and healthcare worker status were associated with increased vaccine uptake, while perceived barriers to influenza vaccination were associated with decreased vaccine uptake. CONCLUSIONS: Flu vaccine uptake may be increased by increasing access to vaccination, promoting vaccination and addressing concerns at the provider level, and engaging positively framed public messaging. Increasing flu vaccine uptake is of particular importance as the flu season approaches during the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic.","Burns, Veronica M; Castillo, Fritz M; Coldren, Rodney L; Prosser, Trisha; Howell, Renee L; Kabbur, Mahendra B",Mil. med,,491

The goal of this study has been to investigate the utility of a specific spike-DTH test using a coronavirus recombinant protein in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: DTH studies were performed by intradermal injection of a commercial recombinant spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 along with conventional serology studies. RESULTS: Fifty-one COVID-19 patients were studied showing 84,3% of concordance with spike-DTH and anti-RBD-IgG. Spike-DTH was superior to identify seven more COVID-19 individuals. A high specificity was found with no positive spike DTH reactions in the non-sick individuals. The skin test also showed more stable results over time while specific anti-RBD-IgG decreased gradually. Clinical severity groups also showed a progressive gradient of larger positive spike-DTH. CONCLUSION: Specific spike DTH test seems to be an easy method to study cell immune response.","Barrios, Yvelise; Franco, Andres; Sanchez-Machin, Inmaculada; Poza-Guedes, Paloma; Gonzalez-Perez, Ruperto; Matheu, Victor",Clin Immunol,,491

We aim to identify biomarkers of coagulation, endothelial function, and fibrinolysis that are associated with disease severity and may have prognostic potential. METHODS: We performed a single-center prospective study of 14 adult COVID-19(+) intensive care unit patients who were age- and sex-matched to 14 COVID-19(-) intensive care unit patients, and healthy controls. Daily blood draws, clinical data, and patient characteristics were collected. Baseline values for 10 biomarkers of interest were compared between the three groups, and visualized using Fisher's linear discriminant function. Linear repeated-measures mixed models were used to screen biomarkers for associations with mortality. Selected biomarkers were further explored and entered into an unsupervised longitudinal clustering machine learning algorithm to identify trends and targets that may be used for future predictive modelling efforts. RESULTS: Elevated D-dimer was the strongest contributor in distinguishing COVID-19 status; however, D-dimer was not associated with survival. Variable selection identified clot lysis time, and antigen levels of soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and plasminogen as biomarkers associated with death. Longitudinal multivariate k-means clustering on these biomarkers alone identified two clusters of COVID-19(+) patients: low (30%) and high (100%) mortality groups. Biomarker trajectories that characterized the high mortality cluster were higher clot lysis times (inhibited fibrinolysis), higher sTM and PAI-1 levels, and lower plasminogen levels. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal trajectories of clot lysis time, sTM, PAI-1, and plasminogen may have predictive ability for mortality in COVID-19.","Juneja, Ganeem K; Castelo, Matthew; Yeh, Calvin H; Cerroni, Samantha E; Hansen, Bettina E; Chessum, James E; Abraham, Joel; Cani, Erblin; Dwivedi, Dhruva J; Fraser, Douglas D; Slessarev, Marat; Martin, Claudio; McGilvray, Scott; Gross, Peter L; Liaw, Patricia C; Weitz, Jeffrey I; Kim, Paul Y",J Thromb Haemost,,491

225563,Une journée dans la vie d'un pestiféré,2021,"BACKGROUND: High-frequency, rapid-turnaround SARS-CoV-2 testing continues to be proposed as a way of efficiently identifying and mitigating transmission in congregate settings. However, two SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks occurred among intercollegiate university athletic programs during the fall 2020 semester despite mandatory directly observed daily antigen testing. METHODS: During the fall 2020 semester, athletes and staff in both programs were tested daily using Quidel's Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA), with positive antigen results requiring confirmatory testing with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We used genomic sequencing to investigate transmission dynamics in these two outbreaks. RESULTS: In Outbreak 1, 32 confirmed cases occurred within a university athletics program after the index patient attended a meeting while infectious despite a negative antigen test on the day of the meeting. Among isolates sequenced from Outbreak 1, 24 (92%) of 26 were closely related, suggesting sustained transmission following an initial introduction event. In Outbreak 2, 12 confirmed cases occurred among athletes from two university programs that faced each other in an athletic competition despite receiving negative antigen test results on the day of the competition. Sequences from both teams were closely related and distinct from viruses circulating in Team 1's community, suggesting transmission during intercollegiate competition in Team 2's community. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that antigen testing alone, even when mandated and directly observed, may not be sufficient as an intervention to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in congregate settings, and highlight the importance of supplementing serial antigen testing with appropriate mitigation strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in congregate settings.","Moreno, Gage K; Braun, Katarina M; Pray, Ian W; Segaloff, Hannah E; Lim, Ailam; Poulsen, Keith; Meiman, Jonathan; Borcher, James; Westergaard, Ryan P; Moll, Michael K; Friedrich, Thomas C; O039,; Connor, David H",Clin. infect. dis,,491
225716,Monitoring the dynamics of emotions during Covid-19 using twitter data,2020,"PURPOSE: Health care systems in most European countries were temporarily restructured to provide as much capacity as possible for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Subsequently, all elective surgeries had to be cancelled and postponed for months. The aim of the present study was to assess the pretreatment health status before and after COVID-19-related cancellation and the psychosocial distress caused by the cancellation. METHODS: For this study, a questionnaire was developed collecting sociodemographic data and information on health status before and after the cancellation. To assess psychosocial distress, the validated depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), was implemented. PHQ-9-Scores of 10 and above were considered to indicate moderate or severe depressive symptoms. In total, 119 patients whose elective orthopaedic surgery was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic were surveyed once at least 8 weeks after the cancellation. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients (65%; 34 female, 43 male) completed the questionnaire and were included. The predominant procedures were total knee arthroplasty (TKA), hip arthroscopy and foot and ankle surgery. The mean pain level significantly increased from 5.5 ± 2.2 at the time of the initially scheduled surgery to 6.2 ± 2.5 at the time of the survey (p < 0.0001). The pain level before cancellation of the surgery was significantly higher in female patients (p = 0.029). An increased analgetic consumption was identified in 46% of all patients. A mean PHQ-9 score of 6.1 ± 4.9 was found after cancellation. PHQ-9 scores of 10 or above were found in 14% of patients, and 8% exhibited scores of 15 points or above. Significantly higher PHQ-9 scores were seen in female patients (p = 0.046). No significant differences in PHQ-9 scores were found among age groups, procedures or reasons for cancellation. CONCLUSION: Cancellation of elective orthopaedic surgery resulted in pain levels that were significantly higher than when the surgery was scheduled, leading to increased analgesic use. Additionally, significant psychosocial distress due to the cancellation was identified in some patients, particularly middle-aged women. Despite these results, confidence in the national health care system and in the treating orthopaedic surgeons was not affected.

228091,Understanding title IX: Implications for higher education,2020,"Systemic inequity concerning the social determinants of health has been known to affect morbidity and mortality for decades. Significant attention has focused on the individual-level demographic and co-morbid factors associated with rates and mortality of COVID-19. However, less attention has been given to the county-level social determinants of health that are the main drivers of health inequities. To identify the degree to which social determinants of health predict COVID-19 cumulative case rates at the county-level in Georgia, we performed a sequential, cross-sectional ecologic analysis using a diverse set of socioeconomic and demographic variables. Lasso regression was used to identify variables from collinear groups. Twelve variables correlated to cumulative case rates (for cases reported by 1 August 2020) with an adjusted r squared of 0.4525. As time progressed in the pandemic, correlation of demographic and socioeconomic factors to cumulative case rates increased, as did number of variables selected. Findings indicate the social determinants of health and demographic factors continue to predict case rates of COVID-19 at the county-level as the pandemic evolves. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence that health disparities continue to widen, disproportionality affecting vulnerable populations.","Richmond, Holly L; Tome, Joana; Rochani, Haresh; Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai; Shah, Gulzar H; Schwind, Jessica S",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,491

We aimed to examine the epidemiology, attendance patterns, disposition, and adherence to follow-up, by FWs on work permit to two emergency departments (EDs) in Singapore. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we included consecutive FWs on work permit who registered at the EDs of two public restructured hospitals from 1 May 2016 to 31 October 2016. Data obtained from electronic medical records included patient demographics, triage acuity, disposition, ED diagnoses and bill information. RESULTS: There were 6,429 individual FWs on work permit who contributed to 7,157 ED visits over the 6-month study period, with male predominance (72.7%, 4672/6429), and median age of 31 (interquartile range 26 to 38) years. A high proportion of these FWs were triaged to low-acuity status compared to the general ED population (66.9% versus 45.9%, P<0.001). Trauma-related injuries contributed to 34.4% of their visits, and were more likely to result in admission compared to non-trauma-related conditions (18.7% vs 15.2%, P<0.001). FWs engaged in shipyard, construction and process industries were more likely to be discharged ""against medical advice"" (14.8% vs 3.2%, P<0.001), and default their specialist outpatient follow-up (50.1% vs 34.2%, P<0.001) for non-trauma-related conditions compared to trauma-related injuries. CONCLUSION: In Singapore, the EDs of public restructured hospitals provide healthcare safety nets to FWs on work permit. These workers made more low-acuity visits compared to the general population during the study period and may face potential barriers to admission and follow-up.","Chan, Joanna S E; Chia, Dennis W J; Hao, Ying; Lian, Sherman W Q; Chua, Mui Teng; Ong, Marcus E H",Ann Acad Med Singap,,491
229255,Off-label medical prescription and COVID-19: An ethical-legal reflexion,2020,"Background Chest radiography (CXR) has not been validated for its prognostic utility in evaluating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyze the prognostic value of a CXR severity scoring system for younger (non-elderly) patients with COVID-19 upon initial presentation to the emergency department (ED). Outcomes of interest included hospitalization, intubation, prolonged stay, sepsis, and death. Materials & Methods In this retrospective study, patients between the ages of 21 and 50 years who presented to EDs of an urban multicenter health system from March 10 - 26, 2020 with COVID-19 confirmation on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were identified. Each patient's ED CXR was divided into 6 zones and examined for opacities by two cardiothoracic radiologists with scores collated into a total concordant lung zone severity score. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to evaluate the relationship between clinical parameters, CXR scores, and patient outcomes. Results The study included 338 patients: 210 males (62%), median age 39 [31-45]. After adjustment for demographics and co-morbidities, independent predictors of hospital admission (n=145, 43%) were CXR severity score &#8805; 2 (OR: 6.2, 95% CI 3.5-11, p<0.001) and obesity (OR 2.4 (1.1-5.4) or morbid obesity. Of patients who were admitted, a CXR score &#8805;3 was an independent predictor of intubation (n=28) (OR: 4.7, 95% CI 1.8-13, p=0.002) as was hospital site. We found no significant difference in primary outcomes across race/ethnicity, those with a history of tobacco use, asthma or diabetes mellitus type II. Conclusion For patients aged 21-50 with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department, a chest x-ray severity score was predictive of risk for hospital admission and intubation.","Toussie, Danielle; Voutsinas, Nicholas; Finkelstein, Mark; Cedillo, Mario A; Manna, Sayan; Maron, Samuel Z; Jacobi, Adam; Chung, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Eber, Corey; Concepcion, Jose; Fayad, Zahi; Gupta, Yogesh Sean",Radiology,,491

230843,Fostering Student-Student Interactions in a First-Year Experience Course Taught Online during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The average respiration rate for an adult is 12-20 breaths per minute, which constantly exposes the lungs to allergens and harmful particles. As a result, respiratory diseases, which includes asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute lower respiratory tract infections (LTRI), are a major cause of death worldwide. Although asthma, COPD and LTRI are distinctly different diseases with separate mechanisms of disease progression, they do share a common feature - airway inflammation with intense recruitment and activation of granulocytes and mast cells. Neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells are crucial players in host defense against pathogens and maintenance of lung homeostasis. Upon contact with harmful particles, part of the pulmonary defense mechanism is to recruit these cells into the airways. Despite their protective nature, overactivation or accumulation of granulocytes and mast cells in the lungs results in unwanted chronic airway inflammation and damage. As such, understanding the bright and the dark side of these leukocytes in lung physiology paves the way for the development of therapies targeting this important mechanism of disease. Here we discuss the role of granulocytes in respiratory diseases and summarize therapeutic strategies focused on granulocyte recruitment and activation in the lungs.","Tavares, Luciana P; Peh, Hong Yong; Tan, Wan Shun Daniel; Pahima, Hadas; Maffia, Pasquale; Tiligada, Ekaterini; Levi-Schaffer, Francesca",Pharmacol Res,,491

PURPOSE: To compare medical masks to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory-confirmed viral infection and respiratory illness including coronavirus specifically in healthcare workers. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL from January 1, 2014, to March 9, 2020. Update of published search conducted from January 1, 1990, to December 9, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the protective effect of medical masks to N95 respirators in healthcare workers. DATA EXTRACTION: Reviewer pair independently screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four RCTs were meta-analyzed adjusting for clustering. Compared with N95 respirators; the use of medical masks did not increase laboratory-confirmed viral (including coronaviruses) respiratory infection (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.90-1.25; I2 = 0%; low certainty in the evidence) or clinical respiratory illness (OR 1.49; 95% CI: 0.98-2.28; I2 = 78%; very low certainty in the evidence). Only one trial evaluated coronaviruses separately and found no difference between the two groups (P = .49). LIMITATIONS: Indirectness and imprecision of available evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Low certainty evidence suggests that medical masks and N95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in healthcare workers during non-aerosol-generating care. Preservation of N95 respirators for high-risk, aerosol-generating procedures in this pandemic should be considered when in short supply.","Bartoszko, Jessica J; Farooqi, Mohammed Abdul Malik; Alhazzani, Waleed; Loeb, Mark",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,,491

Africa is still early in this epidemic, therefore the extent of disease severity is not yet clear. We used a mathematical model to fit to the observed cases of COVID-19 in South Africa to estimate the basic reproductive number and critical vaccination coverage to control the disease for different hypothetical vaccine efficacy scenarios. We also estimated the percentage reduction in effective contacts due to the social distancing measures implemented. Early model estimates show that COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa had a basic reproductive number of 2.95 (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83-3.33). A vaccine with 70% efficacy had the capacity to contain COVID-19 outbreak but at very higher vaccination coverage 94.44% (95% Crl 92.44-99.92%) with a vaccine of 100% efficacy requiring 66.10% (95% Crl 64.72-69.95%) coverage. Social distancing measures put in place have so far reduced the number of social contacts by 80.31% (95% Crl 79.76-80.85%). These findings suggest that a highly efficacious vaccine would have been required to contain COVID-19 in South Africa. Therefore, the current social distancing measures to reduce contacts will remain key in controlling the infection in the absence of vaccines and other therapeutics.","Mukandavire, Zindoga; Nyabadza, Farai; Malunguza, Noble J; Cuadros, Diego F; Shiri, Tinevimbo; Musuka, Godfrey",PLoS One,,491

We investigated a complementary disinfectant to chlorine, copper-silver ionization (CSI), with the aim of lowering the amount of chlorine used in pools and limiting health risks from DBPs. We sampled an indoor and outdoor pool treated with CSI-chlorine during the swimming season in 2017-2018 and measured 71 DBPs, speciated total organic halogen, in vitro mammalian cell cytotoxicity, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) thiol reactivity as a cytotoxicity predictor. Controlled, simulated swimming pools were also investigated. Emerging DBP concentrations decreased by as much as 80% and cytotoxicity decreased as much as 70% in the indoor pool when a lower chlorine residual (1.0 mg/L) and CSI was used. Some DBPs were quantified for the first time in pools, including chloroacetaldehyde (up to 10.6 µg/L), the most cytotoxic haloacetaldehyde studied to date and a major driver of the measured cytotoxicity in this study. Three highly toxic iodinated haloacetic acids (iodoacetic acid, bromoiodoacetic acid, and chloroiodoacetic acid) were also quantified in pools for the first time. We also found that the NAC thiol reactivity was significantly correlated to cytotoxicity, which could be useful for predicting the cytotoxicity of swimming pool waters in future studies.","Allen, Joshua M; Plewa, Michael J; Wagner, Elizabeth D; Wei, Xiao; Bollar, Gretchen E; Quirk, Lucy E; Liberatore, Hannah K; Richardson, Susan D",Environ. sci. technol,,491

The role that animal hosts play in disease transmission is still understudied and researchers wish to find suitable animal models for fundamental research and drug discovery. In this systematic review, we aimed to compile and discuss all articles that describe experimental or natural infections with SARS-CoV-2, from the initial discovery of the virus in December 2019 through to October 2020. We systematically searched four databases (Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science). The following data were extracted from the included studies: type of infection (natural or experimental), age, sample numbers, dose, route of inoculation, viral replication, detection method, clinical symptoms and transmission. Fifty-four studies were included, of which 34 were conducted on animal reservoirs (naturally or experimentally infected), and 20 involved models for testing vaccines and therapeutics. Our search revealed that Rousettus aegyptiacus (fruit bats), pangolins, felines, mink, ferrets and rabbits were all susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, while dogs were weakly susceptible and pigs, poultry, and tree shrews were not. In addition, virus replication in mice, mink, hamsters and ferrets resembled subclinical human infection, so these animals might serve as useful models for future studies to evaluate vaccines or antiviral agents and to study host-pathogen interactions. Our review comprehensively summarized current evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals and their usefulness as models for studying vaccines and antiviral drugs. Our findings may direct future studies for vaccine development, antiviral drugs and therapeutic agents to manage SARS-CoV-2-caused diseases.","Younes, Salma; Younes, Nadin; Shurrab, Farah; Nasrallah, Gheyath K",Rev Med Virol,,491

In this study, we aim to assess the impact of the duration of the lockdown on glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using Cochrane library. A simulation model was created using glycemic data from previous disasters (taken as similar in impact to current lockdown) taking baseline HBA1c and diabetes-related complications data from India-specific database. A multivariate regression analysis was conducted to analyse the relationship between the duration of lockdown and glycaemic targets & diabetes-related complications. RESULTS: The predictive model was extremely robust (R2 = 0.99) and predicted outcomes for period of lockdown up to 90 days. The predicted increment in HBA1c from baseline at the end of 30 days and 45 days lockdown was projected as 2.26% & 3.68% respectively. Similarly, the annual predicted percentage increase in complication rates at the end of 30-day lockdown was 2.8% for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 2.9% for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.5% for retinal photocoagulation, 9.3% for microalbuminuria, 14.2% for proteinuria, 2.9% for peripheral neuropathy, 10.5% for lower extremity amputation, 0.9% for myocardial infarction, 0.5% for stroke and 0.5% for infections. CONCLUSION: The duration of lockdown is directly proportional to the worsening of glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications. Such increase in diabetes-related complications will put additional load on overburdened healthcare system, and also increase COVID19 infections in patients with such uncontrolled glycemia.","Ghosal, Samit; Sinha, Binayak; Majumder, Milan; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,491
235317,Successful Use of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in a Patient Recently Treated for Follicular Lymphoma,2020,"Background and Objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a viral disease that is spreading worldwide and became a pandemic. Although most of the time, the symptoms of the infection are flu like, a percentage of patients develop severe forms, along with severe complications. Many of them are known among front-line health workers, but the number of uncommon presentations and complications has increased. This case report aims to alert healthcare workers on less common forms of presentation, and to introduce this differential diagnosis in the evaluation of patients with COVID-19, given the increasing occurrence of pneumothorax in patients who are not mechanical ventilated. Case presentation: A 57-year-old female patient came to the Emergency Department (ED) by ambulance, with acute respiratory failure. She had SpO2 = 43% on room air at home, and 86% on admission in ED after oxygen delivery (on a reservoir mask). SARS-CoV-2 infection was suspected based on symptoms that started three days ago (fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and fatigability). Blood was taken for lab tests, pharyngeal and nasal swabs for the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) test, and native computed tomography (CT) was scheduled. The thoracic CT scan showed massive right pneumothorax, partially collapsed lung, multiple bilateral lung infiltrates with a ground glass aspect and the RT-PCR test came back positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite the prompt diagnosis and treatment of pneumothorax (thoracostomy was performed and the drain tube was placed), the patient died after a long hospitalization in the intensive care unit. Conclusion: Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP), as a complication in severe forms of COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in female patients without risk factors is rare, and early diagnosis and treatment are essential for increasing the survival chances of these patients.","Marza, Adina Maria; Petrica, Alina; Buleu, Florina Nicoleta; Mederle, Ovidiu Alexandru",Medicina (Kaunas),,491
236228,The Teacher Support Imperative: Teacher Education and the Pedagogy of Connection,2021,"The emergency department (ED) is one of the crucial parts of the hospital infrastructure during all phases of the pandemic. The ED plays an important part in detecting an increasing number of new contagious diseases, which could potentially lead to an epidemic or pandemic.During a pandemic, the ED's main task is to detect infected individuals. These patients then need to be isolated and an adequate treatment is required. The ED must be prepared in order to perform well in such a situation. One major part for readiness is communication in an open manner to all partners within the department, as well as with emergency medical services and other departments of the hospital.The ED must be restructured to withstand the rising number of infected patients. These patients must be separated from other critically ill patients. Strategies for a diagnostic workup depending on the kind of infection have to be put in place. Pathways for the outpatient and inpatient management must be defined to avoid overcrowding in the ED. Depending on the number of patients, escalation and de-escalation strategies have to be set up within the hospital.Over the whole course of the pandemic, all staff members are the key resources for the ED and the entire hospital.

236229,The Teacher Support Imperative: Teacher Education and the Pedagogy of Connection,2021,"The emergency department (ED) is one of the crucial parts of the hospital infrastructure during all phases of the pandemic. The ED plays an important part in detecting an increasing number of new contagious diseases, which could potentially lead to an epidemic or pandemic.During a pandemic, the ED's main task is to detect infected individuals. These patients then need to be isolated and an adequate treatment is required. The ED must be prepared in order to perform well in such a situation. One major part for readiness is communication in an open manner to all partners within the department, as well as with emergency medical services and other departments of the hospital.The ED must be restructured to withstand the rising number of infected patients. These patients must be separated from other critically ill patients. Strategies for a diagnostic workup depending on the kind of infection have to be put in place. Pathways for the outpatient and inpatient management must be defined to avoid overcrowding in the ED. Depending on the number of patients, escalation and de-escalation strategies have to be set up within the hospital.Over the whole course of the pandemic, all staff members are the key resources for the ED and the entire hospital. The ED can only cope with a pandemic situation if staff are working together as a whole.

236671,UC System may not use SAT/ACT tests for admissions and scholarship decisions,2020,"The highly contagious Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as the new dominant global strain, and reports of reduced effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Delta variant are highly concerning. While there has been extensive focus on understanding the amino acid mutations in the Delta variant s Spike protein, the mutational landscape of the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (25 proteins) remains poorly understood. To this end, we performed a systematic analysis of mutations in all the SARS-CoV-2 proteins from nearly 2 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 176 countries/territories. Six highly-prevalent missense mutations in the viral life cycle-associated Membrane (I82T), Nucleocapsid (R203M, D377Y), NS3 (S26L), and NS7a (V82A, T120I) proteins are almost exclusive to the Delta variant compared to other variants of concern (mean prevalence across genomes: Delta = 99.74%, Alpha = 0.06%, Beta = 0.09%, Gamma = 0.22%). Furthermore, we find that the Delta variant harbors a more diverse repertoire of mutations across countries compared to the previously dominant Alpha variant (cosine similarity: meanAlpha = 0.94, S.D.Alpha = 0.05; meanDelta = 0.86, S.D.Delta = 0.1; Cohen s dAlpha-Delta = 1.17, p-value < 0.001). Overall, our study underscores the high diversity of the Delta variant between countries and identifies a list of targetable amino acid mutations in the Delta variant s proteome for probing the mechanistic basis of pathogenic features such as high viral loads, high transmissibility, and reduced susceptibility against neutralization by vaccines.","Ghosh, Pritha; Suratekar, Rohit; Niesen, Michiel J.M.; Anand, Praveen; Donadio, Gregory; Soundararajan, Venky; Venkatakrishnan, AJ",,,491
236993,Preservice Teachers’ Mathematical Mindsets During Pandemic-Induced Pivot to Online Learning,2020,"Covid-19, the most severe global pandemic since the Spanish flu that followed World War I, threatens nearly every country, from global powers to developing nations. This threat presents a concurrent challenge for educational systems. With schools closed during the pandemic, students and teachers have had to stay at home worldwide. This shift has required us to move beyond conventional ideas regarding education. From kindergarten to higher education, schools offered web-based and online classes, both synchronous and asynchronous. However, while technology emerged as a savior, it is not possible to achieve thorough learning only by listening or watching content. Instead of championing technologies in which pedagogy is irrelevant, schools must invest in helping students become lifelong learners, enrich their learning processes, and focus on critical self-reflection, problem-solving skills, imagination, ideas, and projects involving social problems. A significant attempt to redefine the concepts that we have traditionally used must be made. The aim of this article is to develop new suggestions on how curriculum as the essence and core of all educational systems can be reconceptualized for the post-Covid-19 era.","Aktan, Sümer",Prospects (Paris),,491
238406,Dampak Pandemi COVID-19 Pada Pelayanan Pasien Kanker Di Rumah Sakit Tersier Di Indonesia: Serial Kasus,2020,"Theatre has been associated with contagion and contagious emotions since Plato and Aristotle. In the twentieth century, Antonin Artaud proposed that theatre or performance should be like the plague that takes control of actors' and spectators' bodies and infects them with an affective energy. For these infections to happen, however, audiences and actors must be in the same room. In times of the corona pandemic, this spatial proximity has been substituted by theatre mostly performed and/or streamed online. This article offers some preliminary thoughts on this development: it considers what we descriptively call ""viral theatre."" We argue that we currently witness a form of viral theatre that manifests itself through an interplay of three aspects: first, the fact that both performers and spectators are in a state of disruption, second, the willingness/expectations on the part of spectators to participate in the event, and, finally, the use of communication technologies such as Zoom. The framework of the pandemic, therefore, enhances and modifies what viral theatre can be and what kind of effect it can have, oscillating between more Platonic notions of dangerous contagion when plays force us to explore questions of complicity and the Aristotelian ideal of cathartic emotions when plays/performers reach out to us for moral support.","Liedke, H.; Pietrzak-Franger, M.",Journal of Contemporary Drama in English,,491

The current global statistics for the disease are 111 million cases and 2.45 million deaths, with new cases emerging each day. Although several drugs including remdesivir have been approved for emergency use, they remain ineffective in bringing the infection under control. Therefore, there is a need for highly effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. The recent advancements in mRNA vaccines have catapulted them to be forefront in the race to develop vaccines for COVID-19. Two mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics, respectively, have been granted authorization for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration. Interim analysis of the clinical trials for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines reported an efficacy of 95% and 94.1%, respectively, after the second dose. The adverse events for both the vaccines have been found to be mild to moderate, with mostly injection-site reactions and fatigue. No serious adverse events have been reported. Moreover, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics have announced that their vaccines are effective even against the new strains (B.1.17 and B.1.351) of the virus. Both companies are now scaling up the production of the vaccines to meet the global demand. Although the long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of these vaccines is uncertain, there is hope that they can turn the tables against COVID-19 in this current pandemic situation.","Sagili Anthony, Deva Priya; Sivakumar, Kavitha; Venugopal, Priyanka; Sriram, Damal Kandadai; George, Melvin",Clin Drug Investig,,491

It is therefore important to identify factors related to delays in calling for help. OBJECTIVES: To analyze whether age, gender, or time of day influence the pain-to-call delay in patients with acute STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were extracted from a prospective registry of STEMI cases managed by 39 mobile intensive care ambulance teams before hospital arrival within 24 hours of onset in our region, the greater metropolitan area of Paris, France. We analyzed the relation between pain-to-call time and the following factors: age, gender, and the time of day when symptoms appeared. We also assessed the influence of pain-to-call time on the rate of prehospital decisions to implement reperfusion therapy. RESULTS: A total of 24 662 consecutive patients were included;19 291 (78%) were men and 4371 (22%) were women. The median age was 61 (interquartile range, 52-73) years (men, 59 [51-69] years;women, 73 [59-83] years;P .0001). The median pain-to-call time was 60 (24-164) minutes (men, 55 [23-150] minutes;women, 79 [31-220] minutes;P .0001). The delay varied by time of day from a median of 40 (17-101) minutes in men between 5 pm and 6 pm to 149 (43-377) minutes in women between 2 am and 3 am. The delay was longer in women regardless of time of day and increased significantly with age in both men and women (P .001). A longer pain-to-call time was significantly associated with a lower rate of implementation of myocardial reperfusion (P .001). CONCLUSION: Pain-to-call delays were longer in women and older patients, especially at night. These age and gender differences identify groups that would benefit most from health education interventions.","Lapostolle, F.; Loyeau, A.; Beggaz, Y.; Boche, T.; Pires, V.; Le Bail, G.; Lamhaut, L.; Simon, B.; Dupas, F.; Allonneau, A.; Juliard, J.

250421,An intelligent framework using disruptive technologies for COVID-19 analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Early human milk provides protection against viral infections due to its high nutritional value, abundance of maternal antibodies and the specific role of lactoferrin (Lf). Lf blocks the early interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host cells by binding to specific cell receptors and has been proposed as a preventative and adjunct treatment for COVID-19. This preliminary report aimed to investigate concentrations of Lf in early milk of SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers versus non-infected controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a cohort of 13 SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and 15 controls, breast milk concentrations of Lf were determined by ELISA on day 3 postpartum. Additionally, colostrum samples of infected mothers were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG determination using RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: No differences were found in breast milk Lf concentrations between SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and controls. In a subgroup analysis, however, symptomatic mothers (n = 7) presented with lower breast milk Lf concentrations, as compared to asymptomatic mothers (p = .041) and healthy controls (p = .029). All milk samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Early human milk of infected mothers displayed IgA and IgG SARS-CoV-2 specific reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed a different early breast milk Lf ""profile"" between COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic mothers with the latter being at non-COVID levels (control group). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any breast milk sample. Early human milk Lf levels are potentially influenced by the severity of maternal COVID-19 infection during pregnancy.","Briana, Despina D; Papadopoulou, Anna; Syridou, Garyfallia; Marchisio, Edoardo; Kapsabeli, Eleni; Daskalaki, Anna; Papaevangelou, Vassiliki",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,491

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted May 5-25, 2020, among 347 hospital staff (nursing and other hospital staff, with the exception of doctors). Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. RESULTS: Of respondents, 16.4% reported clinically significant depression, 13.8% reported clinically significant anxiety, and 13.3% reported insomnia. Among the nursing staff, 20.9% reported clinically significant depression, 15.9% reported clinically significant anxiety, and 17.0% reported insomnia. There was significantly higher depression (P = .000), anxiety (P = .002), and insomnia (P = .007) among nursing staff compared with other hospital staff in 2-tailed t tests. There was a significantly higher prevalence of insomnia among females (&#967;2 = 5.85, df = 2, P = .05).

254071,Higher education and its post-coronial future: utopian hopes and dystopian fears at Cambridge University during Covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: A cruise ship is a closed-off environment that simulates the basic functioning of a city in terms of living conditions and interpersonal interactions. Thus, the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined because of an onboard outbreak of COVID-19 in February, 2020, provides an opportunity to define the shedding pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and patient antibody responses before and after the onset of symptoms. METHODS: We recruited adult (&#8805;18 years) passengers from Hong Kong who had been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan in February, 2020. All participants had been found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR 4 days before disembarking and were transferred to further quarantine in a public estate in Hong Kong, where they were recruited. Participants were prospectively screened by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, and serum IgG and IgM against internal nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor-binding protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (upon entering quarantine) and on days 4, 8, and 12 of quarantine. FINDINGS: On Feb 22, 2020, 215 adults were recruited, of whom nine (4%; 95% CI 2-8) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR or serology and were hospitalised. Of these nine patients, nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR was positive in eight patients (89%; 57-99) at baseline. All nine patients were positive for anti-RBD IgG by day 8. Eight (89%; 57-99) were simultaneously positive for nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR and anti-RBD IgG. One patient who was positive for anti-RBD IgG and had a negative viral load had multifocal peripheral ground-glass changes on high-resolution CT that were typical of COVID-19. Five patients (56%; 27-81) with ground-glass changes on high-resolution CT were found to have higher anti-nucleoprotein-IgG OD values on day 8 and 12 and anti-RBD IgG OD value on day 12 than patients without ground-glass changes. Six (67%; 35-88) patients remained asymptomatic throughout the 14-day quarantine period. INTERPRETATION: Patients with COVID-19 can develop asymptomatic lung infection with viral shedding and those with evidence of pneumonia on imaging tend to have an increased antibody response. Positive IgG or IgM confirmed infection of COVID-19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. A combination of RT-PCR and serology should be implemented for case finding and contact tracing to facilitate early diagnosis, prompt isolation, and treatment.

The slot waveguides were fabricated using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes, including multiscale lithography and selective reactive ion etching (RIE), forming femtoliter fluidic channels. Finite difference method (FDM) simulation was used to calculate the optical field distribution of the waveguide mode when the waveguide sensor was excited by transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light. For the TE polarization, a strong optical field was created in the slot region and its field intensity was 14× stronger than the evanescent sensing field from the TM polarization. The nanoscale confinement of the optical sensing field significantly enhanced the light-analyte interaction and improved the optical sensitivity.

255877,"The diffusion of Airbnb: a comparative look at earlier adopters, later adopters, and non-adopters",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading worldwide. Since the main route of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is probably via contact with virus-containing droplets of the exhaled air, any method of securing the airway is of extremely high risk for the health care professionals involved. We evaluated the aerosol exposure to the interventional team during a tracheotomy in a semi-quantitative fashion. In addition, we present novel protective measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To visualize the air movements occurring during a tracheotomy, we used a breathing simulator filled with artificial fog. Normal breathing and coughing were simulated under surgery. The speed of aerosol propagation and particle density in the direct visual field of the surgeon were evaluated. RESULTS: Laminar air flow (LAF) in the OR reduced significantly the aerosol exposure during tracheostomy. Only 4.8â±â3.4% of the aerosol was in contact with the surgeon. Without LAF, however, the aerosol density in the inspiratory area of the surgeon is ten times higher (47.9â±â10.8%, pâ<â0.01). Coughing through the opened trachea exposed the surgeon within 400ms with 76.0â±â8.0% of the aerosol - independent of the function of the LAF. Only when a blocked tube was inserted into the airway, no aerosol leakage could be detected. DISCUSSION: Coughing and expiration during a surgical tracheotomy expose the surgical team considerably to airway aerosols. This is potentially associated with an increased risk for employees being infected by airborne transmitted pathogens. Laminar airflow in an operating room leads to a significant reduction in the aerosol exposure of the surgeon and is therefore preferable to a bedside tracheotomy in terms of infection prevention. Ideal protection of medical staff is achieved when the procedure is performed under endotracheal intubation and muscle relaxation.","Loth, Andreas German; Guderian, Daniela Brigitta; Haake, Birgit; Zacharowski, Kai; Stöver, Timo; Leinung, Martin",Shock,,491

An application to COVID-19,2021,"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to bring the attention of the intellectual capital (IC) research and practice communities to the value of IC in hotels' efforts to resolve or mitigate environmental problems over time. This research has been set to examine the relationships between key KM and IC concepts including environmental knowledge structures and exploitation and exploration of environmental knowledge (EK) as drivers of environmental organisational learning. The research has also examined the relevance of pro-environmental behavioural intention capital (PEBIC) as a component of structural capital and therefore an integral part of the intellectual capital of hotels.Design/methodology/approachThe data analysis technique used to test the proposed conceptual model is partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Sample received from 87 companies from the Spanish hospitality sector in a longitudinal study (six years).FindingsThe results support that environmental knowledge structures (exploitation and exploration) has a positive impact on PEBIC over time. In other words, environmental organisational learning has the capability to create structural capital in hotel over time.Originality/valueThe research has addressed the challenges of exploration and exploitation of EK and PEBIC from a perspective not previously covered in the extant literature, further improved by the longitudinal nature of this study. Our focus on the hospitality sector makes this research relevant for management structures at numerous of hotels, as well as to their supply chains around the world. In addition, this research highlights the value to create structural capital through EK and organisational learning in the context of take care of our natural resources.","Martínez-Martínez, Aurora Juan-Gabriel Cegarra-Navarro Garcia-Perez Alexeis Vicentini Francesca",Journal of Intellectual Capital,,491

We show that ACE2 expression peaks during erythropoiesis and renders erythroid progenitors vulnerable to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Early erythroid progenitors, defined as CD34-CD117+CD71+CD235a-, show the highest levels of ACE2 and constitute the primary target cell to be infected during erythropoiesis. SARS-CoV-2 causes the expansion of colony formation by erythroid progenitors and can be detected in these cells after 2 weeks of the initial infection. Our findings constitute the first report of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in erythroid progenitor cells and can contribute to understanding both the clinical symptoms of severe COVID-19 patients and how the virus can spread through the circulation to produce local inflammation in tissues, including the bone marrow.","Huerga Encabo, Hector; Grey, William; Garcia-Albornoz, Manuel; Wood, Henry; Ulferts, Rachel; Aramburu, Iker Valle; Kulasekararaj, Austin G; Mufti, Ghulam; Papayannopoulos, Venizelos; Beale, Rupert; Bonnet, Dominique",Stem Cell Reports,,491

263254,Back to routine after the coronavirus pandemic lockdown: A proposal from a psychological perspective,2021,"Background Brachial plexus block is popular choice for upper limb surgeries and offers good and relatively safe anesthesia. Among various approaches supraclavicular approach is the most consistent method for anaesthesia and postoperative pain management in surgery below the elbow joint. Many drugs are used as adjuvants in brachial plexus block for faster onset, denser block and for prolongation of postoperative analgesia. Dexmedetomidine also has been shown to prolong the sensory and motor duration when added as an adjuvant to local anaesthetic in nerve blocks. Objective To assess the effect of adding dexmedetomidine to ropivacaine in brachial block. Method Sixty patients, planned for upper limb surgeries under ultrasound guided brachial block were randomly allocated into two groups. Group RS (n=30) received 30 ml of 0.5% Ropivacaine + 1 ml Normal Saline and Group RD (n=30) received 30 ml of 0.5% Ropivacaine + 0.75 mcg/kg Dexmedetomidine diluted to 1 ml solution. The onset time to sensory and motor blockade were recorded. The duration of sensory and motor block and duration of analgesia were recorded. Result The mean time to onset of sensory block (12.60±2.67 min Vs 22.17±2.81 min) and motor block (14.20±3.22 min Vs 22.53±3.97) in Group RD was significantly faster in Group RD than Group RS. The mean duration of sensory block (838.70±164.11 min Vs 670.20±145.16 min), motor block (804.16±148.71 min Vs 594.93±53.89 min) and duration of analgesia (1193.80±223.11 min Vs 828.23±136.30 min) were significantly longer in Group RD compared to Group RS. The incidence of side effects in both groups were comparable. Conclusion From this study, it can be concluded that addition of Dexmedetomidine 0.75 mcg/ kg to 0.5% Ropivacaine results in early onset of sensory and motor blockade, prolongation of duration of sensory and motor blockade and duration of analgesia postoperatively without any significant side effects.","Sharma, S; Shrestha, A; Koirala, M",Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),,491

However, low solubility limits its clinical usage. OBJECTIVES: To improve the efficacy of icaritin treatment, a micelle system was designed for targeted delivery of drugs to OSCC cells. METHODS: In the present study, the micelles loaded with icaritin were self-assembled from the amphipathic polymer via film dispersion. Nanoparticles were characterized with the transmission electron microscope and dynamic light scattering. The cytotoxicity of icaritin nanoparticles was analyzed by CCK-8, and in vitro target-selective intracellular uptake behaviors were observed using a laser confocal microscope. RESULTS: The micelles were spherical with the mean diameter of 121.2 nm. In vitro studies revealed that icaritin was stablely and slowly released from micelles. Cytotoxicity analysis demonstrated that icartin-loaded micelles exhibited better therapeu-tic efficacy compared with free icaritin. Cellular uptake and intracellular release results revealed that micelles efficiently de-livered icaritin into OSCC cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that encapsulated icaritin in polycaprolactone - polyethylene glycol (PCL-PEG) micelles may provide safe and effective drug delivery in OSCC treatments.","Yang, Jian-Guang; Zhang, Jing; Chen, Xiao-Jie; Zhou, Gang",Curr. drug deliv,,491

In India as well, as a precautionary measure, complete and partial lockdowns were announced in phases during March 25 to May 31, 2020. The restricted human activities led to a drastic reduction in seismic background noise in the high frequency range of 1-20 Hz, representative of cultural noise. In this study, we analyse the effect of anthropogenic activity on the Earth vibrations, utilizing ambient noise recorded at twelve broadband seismographs installed in different environmental and geological conditions in Gujarat. We find that the lockdowns caused 1-19 dB decrease in seismic noise levels. The impact of restricted anthropogenic activities is predominantly visible during the daytime in urban areas, in the vicinity of industries and/or highways. A 27-79% reduction in seismic noise ground displacement (drms) is observed in daytime during the lockdown, in populated areas. However, data from station MOR reveals a drastic decrease in drms amplitude both during the day (79%) and night times (87%) since factories in this area operate round the clock.

In addition, in order to better understand the experiences of poverty, open questions regarding the effect of COVID-19 on the participants' lives and their means of coping with the pandemic were employed. The study was conducted in May 2020, just after the first lockdown, through online media and through social workers who personally went to disadvantaged neighborhoods to reach out to participants who are vulnerable to digital illiteracy. The analysis points to major differences between the groups, with people in poverty suffering more in terms of their economic and employment situation and mental distress. In addition, we found that people in poverty needed and received more support.

However, the precise clinical and biochemical variables associated with AKI progression in patients with severe COVID-19 remain unclear. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 278 hospitalized patients who were admitted to the ward and intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020, at the University Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil. Patients aged &#8805; 18 years with COVID-19 confirmed on RT-PCR were included. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. We evaluated the incidence of AKI, several clinical variables, medicines used, and outcomes in two sub-groups: COVID-19 patients with AKI (Cov-AKI), and COVID-19 patients without AKI (non-AKI). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: First, an elevated incidence of AKI (71.2%) was identified, distributed across different stages of the KDIGO criteria. We further observed higher levels of creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the Cov-AKI group than in the non-AKI group, at hospital admission. On univariate analysis, Cov-AKI was associated with older age (>62 years), hypertension, CRP, MCV, leucocytes, neutrophils, NLR, combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatment, use of mechanical ventilation, and vasoactive drugs. Multivariate analysis showed that hypertension and the use of vasoactive drugs were independently associated with a risk of higher AKI in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we preferentially found an altered erythrocyte and leukocyte cellular profile in the Cov-AKI group compared to the non-AKI group, at hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the development of AKI in patients with severe COVID-19 was related to inflammatory blood markers and therapy with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, with vasopressor requirement and hypertension considered potential risk factors. Thus, attention to the protocol, hypertension, and some blood markers may help assist doctors with decision-making for the management of COVID-19 patients with AKI.","de Almeida, Danilo Candido; Franco, Maria do Carmo Pinho; Dos Santos, Davi Rettori Pardo; Santos, Marina Colella; Maltoni, Isabela Soucin; Mascotte, Felipe; de Souza, Alexandra Aparecida; Pietrobom, Paula Massaroni; Medeiros, Eduardo Alexandrino; Ferreira, Paulo Roberto Abrão; Machado, Flavia Ribeiro; Goes, Miguel Angelo",PLoS One,,491

With these new initiatives, it is conceivable that the diagnosis of cancer care may be delayed. We aimed to evaluate differences in patient populations being evaluated for cancer before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a retrospective review of our electronic medical record and examined patient characteristics of those presenting for a possible new cancer diagnosis to our urologic oncology clinic. Data was analyzed using logistic and linear regression models. RESULTS: During the 3-month period before the COVID-19 pandemic began, 585 new patients were seen in one urologic oncology practice. The following 3-month period, during the COVID-19 pandemic, 362 patients were seen, corresponding to a 38% decline. Visits per week increased to pre-COVID-19 levels for kidney and bladder cancer as the county entered the green phase. Prostate cancer visits per week remained below pre-COVID-19 levels in the green phase. When the 2 populations pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 were compared, there were no notable differences on regression analysis. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic decreased the total volume of new patient referrals for possible genitourinary cancer diagnoses. The impact this will have on cancer survival remains to be determined.","Maganty, Avinash; Yu, Michelle; Anyaeche, Vivian I; Zhu, Toby; Hay, Jordan M; Davies, Benjamin J; Yabes, Jonathan G; Jacobs, Bruce L",Urol. oncol,,491

A DSGE modeling in small open economy,2021,"The spread of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, poses major challenges for individuals and societies at large. The question now is how individuals and society are dealing with these challenges, and what health, psychological, social, and economic effects they will have to bear. Meaningful answers can only be provided using a generalizable database that contains contex-tual information such as family characteristics and offers a life-course perspective. We argue that these criteria are best met by household panel survey data. In this paper, we illustrate the importance of such data and show how they can aid in explaining the current and future effects of the pandemic on individuals, households, and society. Furthermore, we describe the survey design of SOEP-CoV, a supplementary telephone survey to the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) study.","Kühne, Simon; Kroh, Martin; Liebig, Stefan; Zinn, Sabine",Surv.

In this paper, we have reviewed the role of Bcl-xL in the context of host infection by eight different RNA and DNA viruses: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus (IAV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1), Maraba virus (MRBV), Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and coronavirus (CoV). We have described an influence of viral infection on the intracellular level of Bcl-xL and discussed the impact of Bcl-xL-dependent cell survival control on infection-accompanying pathogenic events such as tissue damage or oncogenesis. We have also presented anti-viral treatment strategies based on the pharmacological regulation of Bcl-xL expression or activity.","Wyzewski, Zbigniew; Switlik, Weronika; Mielcarska, Matylda Barbara; Gregorczyk-Zboroch, Karolina Paulina",Int. j. mol. sci.

The participants filled the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Impact of Event Scale 6 and the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire. The results proved a relationship between Covid stress, performance and EI, which has a moderating effect between the stress and both indicators of performance, even when sociodemographic variables were controlled. In essence, professionals with high levels of EI and low Covid stress showed the highest performance and the lowest CWB when compared to those who presented less emotional capabilities and higher stress. These results confirm the importance of EI in improving the effectiveness of work performance and reinforce the role of EI as a protective variable that can safeguard occupational health.","Sadovyy, Max Sánchez-Gómez Martín Bresó Edgar",Personality and Individual Differences,,491

Such preparation needs community policy involvement at grassroots levels and needs to be collaboratively instigated at international levels. The death so far of over 2000 nurses is unacceptable in this pandemic, and we need to better protect and sustain the workforce. The International Council of Nurses has been instrumental in data gathering of nurses' experiences during COVID-19.

280138,(Job)Keeping up appearances,2021,"Background: Multiple serosurveillance studies have focused on the presence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the general population and confirmed cases. However, seroprevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) among contacts of confirmed cases can add further value to the scientific findings. Objectives: The objective is to estimate COVID-19 seropositivity among contacts of COVID-19 cases and to compare the seropositivity between types of contact for the assessment of differential risk and transmission dynamics. Methods: Large scale population-based serosurveillance on contacts of COVID-19 cases was carried out during the second half of August 2020 in Ahmedabad using the COVID-Kavach. The seropositivity among contacts was estimated and correlated-compared with type of contact and other demographic factors. Results: With 1268 positive for IgG antibodies from 3973 samples, the seropositivity against COVID-19 among contacts of cases in Ahmedabad was 31.92% (95% confidence interval 30.48%-33.38%). The seropositivity among family contacts was significantly higher (39.36%) as compared to other contacts (28.72%) (Z = 6.60, P < 0.01). This trend is seen across all age groups and both the sex groups. The seropositivity has increasing trend with increasing age and is significantly higher among females (35.11%) than males (28.95%) (Z = 4.16, P < 0.01). Conclusion: Seropositivity of 31.92% among contacts indicates that a large proportion of contacts have already acquired immunity on account of their contact with the case. Higher seropositivity among family contacts justifies the risk categorization and testing strategy adopted for the contacts of the cases. This also reaffirms the need for contact tracing strategy for controlling the inevitable spread of pandemic.","Prakash, Om; Solanki, Bhavin; Sheth, Jay Kirtikumar; Kadam, Mina; Vyas, Sheetal",Indian J Public Health,,491

281064,National and Institutional Responses -- Reimagined Operations -- Pandemic Disruptions and Academic Continuity for a Global University,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Following well-established practices in demography, this article discusses several measures based on the number of COVID-19 deaths to facilitate comparisons over time and across populations. SETTINGS: National populations in 186 United Nations countries and territories and populations in first-level subnational administrative entities in Brazil, China, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Spain and the USA. PARTICIPANTS: None (death statistics only). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: An unstandardised occurrence/exposure rate comparable to the Crude Death Rate; an indirectly age-and-sex standardised rate that can be derived even when the breakdown of COVID-19 deaths by age and sex required for direct standardisation is unavailable; the reduction in life expectancy at birth corresponding to the 2020 number of COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: To date, the highest unstandardised rate has been in New York, at its peak exceeding the state 2017 crude death rate. Populations compare differently after standardisation: while parts of Italy, Spain and the USA have the highest unstandardised rates, parts of Mexico and Peru have the highest standardised rates. For several populations with the necessary data by age and sex for direct standardisation, we show that direct and indirect standardisation yield similar results. US life expectancy is estimated to have declined this year by more than a year (-1.26 years), far more than during the worst year of the HIV epidemic, or the worst 3 years of the opioid crisis, and to reach its lowest level since 2008. Substantially larger reductions, exceeding 2 years, are estimated for Panama, Peru, and parts of Italy, Spain, the USA and especially, Mexico. CONCLUSIONS: With lesser demand on data than direct standardisation, indirect standardisation is a valid alternative to adjust international comparisons for differences in population distribution by sex and age-groups. A number of populations have experienced reductions in 2020 life expectancies that are substantial by recent historical standards.","Heuveline, Patrick; Tzen, Michael",BMJ Open,,491

METHODS: According to the fifth and sixth editions of the new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, we carried out the case analysis and infectious disease investigation and research on the confirmed and suspected cases of new coronavirus pneumonia admitted to the second-floor ward of the hospital from January 28th, 2020, to February 26th, 2020. RESULTS: From January 28th, 2020 to February 26th, 2020, 83 patients were admitted, 40 were cured, and 7 died. Before February 13th, 69 patients were admitted, including 22 confirmed patients and 47 suspected patients. After February 13th, the data of newly hospitalized suspected patients decreased to 2 people. The average time from onset to diagnosis was 5.38 days. About 57.1% of the confirmed patients were isolated at home before admission, and 53.2% of the suspected patients were isolated by hospital observation before admission. The proportion of fever and other clinical symptoms was 81.8%, 65.5% of the patients had the fastest heart rate of 90-120 rpm, and 11 of the patients had severe/critical illness, accounting for 20%. The count of leukocytes, neutrophils, and C-reactive proteins (CRPs) in severe patients was higher than those in light patients (P<0.05), and the count of lymphocytes was lower than that in mild patients (P=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus pneumonia in Qingshan District of Wuhan in February was diagnosed promptly, controlled,and treated effectively.

The discovery of RaTG13 bat coronavirus in China suggested a high probability of a bat origin. Here we report molecular and serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses (SC2r-CoVs) actively circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Whole genome sequences were obtained from five independent bats (Rhinolophus acuminatus) in a Thai cave yielding a single isolate (named RacCS203) which is most related to the RmYN02 isolate found in Rhinolophus malayanus in Yunnan, China. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were also detected in bats of the same colony and in a pangolin at a wildlife checkpoint in Southern Thailand. Antisera raised against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of RmYN02 was able to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 despite the fact that the RBD of RacCS203 or RmYN02 failed to bind ACE2. Although the origin of the virus remains unresolved, our study extended the geographic distribution of genetically diverse SC2r-CoVs from Japan and China to Thailand over a 4800-km range.

290755,Tingkat Pengetahuan Dan Strategi Koping Masyarakat Indonesia Menghadapi Pandemi COVID-19,2020,"Introduction During the COVID-19 pandemic, pre-existing dementia was associated with a 3x increase in risk of hospitalisation and (25.6%) of COVID-19 related deaths had dementia. However, it is unclear whether people living with dementia are at higher risk of COVID-19 due to dementia or whether there may be a biologically plausible link between dementia and COVID-19. The ApoE e4 allele is highly associated with dementia. We aimed to test the COVID-19 risk associated with dementia and the association between ApoE e4e4 allele and COVID-19 with the aim of clarifying biological vulnerability. Methods UK Biobank (England) participants baseline (2006 to 2010), plus secondary care data to 2017. Separate analysis tested dementia and ApoE genotype association with COVID-19 status (16th March-31st May 2020) or mortality (to March 31, 2020, plus incomplete deaths from April, 2020) in logistic models, adjusted for demographics and technical covariates. Results In 269,070 participants aged 65+, including 507(0.2%) hospitalized COVID-19 patients, those with pre-existing dementia were at increased risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19 (OR = 3.50 95% CI 1.93 to 6.34) and also for COVID-19 and death (OR = 7.30 95% CI 3.28–16.21). In 375,689 European-ancestry UKB participants, ApoE e4e4 homozygotes were more likely to be COVID-19 test positives (reaching genome-wide significance: OR = 2.24, 95% CI:1.72–2.93, p = 3.24 × 10–9) and of mortality with test-confirmed COVID-19 (OR = 4.29, 95% CI: 2.38–7.72, p = 1.22 × 10–6), compared to e3e3s homozygotes. The associations were little changed in subsets of participants who were free of diseases associated with ApoE e4 and COVID-19 severity. Conclusion Dementia was found to be disproportionally common in older adults who develop severe COVID-19. We have shown a plausible genetic pathway of increased COVID-19 risk with dementia, therefore suggesting that the positive association between dementia and COVID-19 is not just the result of high cases of COVID-19 in care homes.","Masoli, J.; Kuo, C.

292143,Google Meet as a synchronous language learning tool for emergency online distant learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: perceptions of language instructors and preservice teachers,2021,"PURPOSE: To examine the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women during the confinement due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 15 April and 14 May 2020, a multicentre cross-sectional survey was performed to study depression, anxiety and resilience in a sample of Spanish pregnant women during the lockdown set up by the Government in response to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. We designed an anonymous online self-administered questionnaire (https://bit.ly/34RRpq1) that included the Spanish validated versions of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience 10-items Scale (CD-RISC-10). RESULTS: A total of 514 pregnant women completed the survey. 72.8% had been confined < 40 days and 27.2% between 41 and 60 days. 182 (35.4%) participants scored over 10, with 21.3% scoring over 13 (75th Percentile) in depressive symptoms rates. We found high trait and anxiety scores, with 223 (43.4%) and 227 (44.2%) pregnant women scoring over the trait and state mean scores. Neither depression, anxiety or resilience levels showed any significant correlation with the length of confinement. We found low CD-RISC-10 scores. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms during the quarantine, although we did not find an increased prevalence of psychological distress according to length of home confinement. Resilience correlated negatively with depression and anxiety.","Lubián López, Daniel María; Butrón Hinojo, Carmen Aisha; Arjona Bernal, Jose Eduardo; Fasero Laiz, María; Alcolea Santiago, José; Guerra Vilches, Virginia; Casaus Fernández, Marta; Bueno Moral, Ana; Olvera Perdigones, Antonio; Rodríguez Rodríguez, Begoña; Cuevas Palomino, Andrés; Presa Lorite, Jesús; Coronado Martín, Pluvio; Sánchez-Prieto, Manuel; Sánchez-Borrego, Rafael; González-Mesa, Ernesto",J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol,,491

295181,Exploring the Role of Islamic Fintech in Combating the Aftershocks of COVID-19: The Open Social Innovation of the Islamic Financial System,2021,"Since December 2019, Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly throughout the world, leading to a global effort to develop vaccines and treatments. Despite extensive progress, there remains a need for treatments to bolster the immune responses in infected immunocompromised individuals, such as cancer patients who recently underwent a haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Immunological protection against COVID-19 is mediated by both short-lived neutralizing antibodies and long-lasting virus-reactive T cells. Therefore, we propose that T cell therapy may augment efficacy of current treatments. For the greatest efficacy with minimal adverse effects, it is important that any cellular therapy is designed to be as specific and directed as possible. Here, we identify T cells from COVID-19 patients with a potentially protective response to two major antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Spike and Nucleocapsid protein. By generating clones of highly virus-reactive CD4+ T cells, we were able to confirm a set of nine immunodominant epitopes and characterize T cell responses against these. Accordingly, the sensitivity of T cell clones for their specific epitope, as well as the extent and focus of their cytokine response was examined. Moreover, using an advanced T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing approach, we determined the paired TCR-&#945;ß sequences of clones of interest. While these data on a limited population require further expansion for universal application, the results presented here form a crucial first step towards TCR-transgenic CD4+ T cell therapy of COVID-19.","Verhagen, Johan; van der Meijden, Edith D; Lang, Vanessa; Kremer, Andreas E; Völkl, Simon; Mackensen, Andreas; Aigner, Michael; Kremer, Anita N",Clin. exp. immunol,,491
295182,Exploring the Role of Islamic Fintech in Combating the Aftershocks of COVID-19: The Open Social Innovation of the Islamic Financial System,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To describe whether rheumatic inflammatory diseases (RID) are associated with a higher risk of hospitalization and/or mortality from COVID-19 and identify the factors associated with hospitalization and mortality in RID and COVID-19 in different Hospitals in Andalusia. METHODS: Design: Multicentre observational case-control study. PATIENTS: RID and COVID-19 from different centres in Andalusia. CONTROLS: patients without RIS matched by sex, age and CRP-COVID. Protocol A list of patients with PCR for COVID-19 was requested from the microbiology service from March 14 to April 14, 2020. The patients who had RID were identified and then consecutively a paired control for each case. Variables The main outcome variable was hospital admission and mortality from COVID-19. Statistical analysis Bivariate followed by binary logistic regression models (DV: mortality/hospital admission). RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-six patients were included, 78 with RID and COVID-19 and 78 without RID with COVID-19. The patients did not present characteristics of COVID-19 disease different from the general population, nor did they present higher hospital admission or mortality. The factor associated with mortality in patients with RID was advanced age (OR [95% CI], 1.1 [1.0-1.2]; p = 0.025), while the factors associated with hospitalization were advanced age (OR [95% CI], 1.1 [1.0-1.1]; p = 0.007) and hypertension (OR [95% CI], 3.9 [1.5-6.7]; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Mortality and hospital admission due to COVID-19 do not seem to increase in RID. Advanced age was associated with mortality in RID and, in addition, HTN was associated with hospital admission.","Mena-Vázquez, Natalia; Manrique Arija, Sara; Rojas-Giménez, Marta; Raya-Álvarez, Enrique; Velloso-Feijoó, María Luisa; López-Medina, C; Ramos-Giraldez, Consuelo; Godoy-Navarrete, Francisco Javier; Redondo-Rodríguez, Rocío; Cabezas-Lucena, Alba María; Morales-Águila, M; Romero-Barco, C M; Fernández-Nebro, Antonio",,,491

297444,Clinical Efficacy of Arbidol in Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2020,"Social media posts can be used to explore public perceptions of interprofessional teams and healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to use social listening technique to explore unfiltered public perceptions of the professionals involved in healthcare teams during the COVID-19 pandemic, in a naturalistic online setting, and to elaborate on the emotional reactions in response to an online social media post. A cross-sectional retrospective review of comments on a specific social media post was conducted between 15 March and 28 April 2020 using summative content analysis. One image that was widely circulated on social media platforms with two questions: 'Who society thinks works at hospital? versus who really works at hospitals?' was selected. Three platforms were searched, Facebook®, Twitter®, and LinkedIn®. Only publicly available posts were included. Out of the initial 40 posts identified, 21 posts which had 1759 comments were analysed and 1576 were included for coding. Of the emerging nine themes, perceptions of who is in the team was the largest (40.5%, n = 639), followed by agreement (23.1%, n = 364) and feeling excluded (16.2%, n = 255). Of emotional expressions, 42.1% were positive and 57.9% negative. The most frequent emotions were frustration (54.4%, n = 857) followed by gratitude (16.3%, n = 257) and relief (15.9%, n = 250). The post brought considerable attention to the role of the interprofessional team and generated many feelings of frustration and exclusion. For this reason, the response to this social media post is very important and not to be overlooked. Healthcare professionals need to work together to strengthen their presence as an interprofessional team, united to deliver safe effective quality care for patients. The current COVID-19 pandemic and the media attention should be taken as an opportunity by the interprofessional community to work together to combat negative media stereotypes. Further research is warranted on public perceptions of the healthcare team.","El-Awaisi, Alla; O039,; Carroll, Veronica; Koraysh, Somaya; Koummich, Sarra; Huber, Marion",J Interprof Care,,491
297672,"Impact of COVID-19 on transportation in Lagos, Nigeria",2020,"BACKGROUND: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections is important for treatment, isolation of infected and exposed individuals, and contact tracing. RT-qPCR is the ""gold-standard"" method to sensitively detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but most laboratory-developed RT-qPCR assays involve complex steps. Here, we aimed to simplify RT-qPCR assays by streamlining reaction setup, eliminating RNA extraction, and proposing reduced-cost detection workflows that avoid the need for expensive qPCR instruments. METHOD: A low-cost RT-PCR based ""kit"" was developed for faster turnaround than the CDC developed protocol. We demonstrated three detection workflows: two that can be deployed in laboratories conducting assays of variable complexity, and one that could be simple enough for point-of-care. Analytical sensitivity was assessed using SARS-CoV-2 RNA spiked in simulated nasal matrix. Clinical performance was evaluated using contrived human nasal matrix (n = 41) and clinical nasal specimens collected from individuals with respiratory symptoms (n = 110). FINDING: The analytical sensitivity of the lyophilised RT-PCR was 10 copies/reaction using purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 20 copies/reaction when using direct lysate in simulated nasal matrix. Evaluation of assay performance on contrived human matrix showed 96.7-100% specificity and 100% sensitivity at &#8805;20 RNA copies. A head-to-head comparison with the standard CDC protocol on clinical specimens showed 83.8-94.6% sensitivity and 96.8-100% specificity. We found 3.6% indeterminate samples (undetected human control), lower than 8.1% with the standard protocol. INTERPRETATION: This preliminary work should support laboratories or commercial entities to develop and expand access to Covid-19 testing. Software guidance development for this assay is ongoing to enable implementation in other settings.

As a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Cuscutae Semen-Mori Fructus coupled-herbs (CSMFCH) has been known to act a curative effect on OA for thousands of years. Nevertheless, the substantial basis and molecular mechanism of CSMFCH in treating OA remain elusive. Methods: Herein, an integrated approach, including network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experiment validation, was utilized to reveal the new candidate active component and mechanism of CSMFCH in treating OA. Results: The results show that kaempferol is the most significant bioactive component of CSMFCH on OA. The mechanism and targets of CSMFCH against OA are relevant to hormone regulation, oxidant stress, and reproductive promotion. In order to validate network pharmacology results, molecular docking and experiment validation were conducted. In detail, molecular docking was employed to verify the strong binding interactions between kaempferol and the core targets. UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS was used to identify kaempferol in the CSMFCH extract. In vitro and in vivo experiments further proved CSMFCH and kaempferol could enhance the mouse Leydig (TM3) and mouse Sertoli (TM4) cell viability, improve the male reproductive organ weights, sperm quality, and decrease testis tissue damage in the OA mouse model induced by CP.

Unravelling the nature of the protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, under various environmental and physiological conditions, could therefore prove to be crucial in development of therapeutics. Here, we study the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 to understand the effect of temperature on the properties of the protein-membrane system. The membrane embedded dimeric M proteins were studied using atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations at temperatures ranging between 10 and 50 {degrees}C. While temperature induced fluctuations should be monotonic, we observe a steady rise in the protein dynamics up to 40 {degrees}C, beyond which it surprisingly reverts back to the low temperature behaviour. Detailed investigation reveals disordering of the membrane lipids in the presence of the protein, which induces additional curvature around the transmembrane region. Coarse-grained simulations indicate temperature dependent aggregation of M protein dimers. Our study clearly indicates that the dynamics of membrane lipids and integral M protein of SARS-CoV-2 enables it to better associate and aggregate only at a certain temperature range (i.e., ~30 to 40 {degrees}C). This can have important implications in the protein aggregation and subsequent viral budding/fission processes.","Rath, Soumya Lipsa; Tripathy, Madhusmita; Mandal, Nabanita",,,491

We describe two cases of COVID-19-associated pneumonia, which presented skin manifestations in advanced stage of illness, when nasopharyngeal swabs became negative for SARS-CoV-2. The first case presented erythematous, maculopapular lesions; the second developed petechial, vesicular and blood-encrusted lesions on the limbs. Histopathology documented perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, with prevalent CD4+ T-cells in both patients. The research of SARS-CoV-2 in tissues with real time RT-PCR was negative. Basal keratinocytes displayed C4d deposits in one case, who developed laboratory signs indicative of a procoagulative condition at the same time as the skin rash. Skin manifestations during SARS-CoV-2 infection seem to be clinically relevant and further studies are necessary to assess if they are linked to systemic complications, lack of viral clearance or cascades of immune responses induced by the virus, even in patients affected by mild pneumonia.","Mencarini, Paola; Scarabello, Alessandra; Del Nonno, Franca; Lalle, Eleonora; Falasca, Laura; Gualano, Gina; Nardacci, Roberta; Mosti, Silvia; Musso, Maria; Libertone, Raffaella; Di Bari, Virginia; Rosati, Silvia; Colombo, Daniele; Castilletti, Concetta; Palmieri, Fabrizio",J. dermatol,,491
306558,The Impact of Demographic Characteristics on Academic Performance: Face-to-Face Learning Versus Distance Learning Implemented to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors for the severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in comparison with the non-severe patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CNKI to collect all relevant studies published before July 26, 2020, and a total of 30 papers were included in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: In the severe COVID-19 patients, 60% (95% CI = 56-64%) were male, 25% (95% CI = 21-29%) were over 65 years old, 34% (95% CI = 24-44%) were obese, and 55% (95% CI = 41-70%) had comorbidities. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (34%, 95% CI = 25-44%), diabetes (20%, 95% CI = 15-25%), and cardiovascular disease (CVD; 12%, 95% CI = 9-16%). The most common blood test abnormalities were elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 87%, 82-92%), decreased lymphocyte count (68%, 58-77%), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (69%, 95% CI = 57-81%). In addition, abnormal laboratory findings revealing organ dysfunctions were frequently observed in the severe cases, including decrease in albumin (43%, 95% CI = 24-63%) and increase in aspartate aminotransferase (47%, 95% CI = 38-56%), alanine aminotransferase (28%, 95% CI = 16-39%), troponin I/troponin T (TnI/TnT; 29%, 95% CI = 13-45%), and serum Cr (SCr; 10%, 95% CI = 5-15%). CONCLUSION: The male, elderly and obese patients and those with any comorbidities, especially with hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, were more likely to develop into severe cases. But the association between hypertension, diabetes, CVD, and severity of COVID-19 was declined by the increase of age. A significant elevation in cardiac TnI/TnT, the hepatic enzymes, and SCr and the reduction in lymphocytes with elevated CRPs are important markers for the severity. Specific attention should be given to the elderly male and obese patients and those with indications of severe immune injury in combination with bacterial infection and indication of multi-organ dysfunction or damages.","Hu, Jianhua; Wang, Yanggan",Gerontology,,491

However, there is as yet little evidence on how the pandemic and shielding impacted the health and social well-being of CV older people. METHODS: We used data from wave 9 (2018/2019) and the first COVID-19 substudy (June/July 2020) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Using logistic and linear regression models, we investigated associations between being CV and health and social well-being during the pandemic, while controlling for prepandemic levels of the outcome variables. We also explored the interactions between CV and age group (50s, 60s, 70s, 80+), and between CV and shielding. RESULTS: CV people were more likely to report worse health and social well-being outcomes during the pandemic, even taking into account prepandemic differences. However, changes in health were not uniform across different age groups, and CV respondents were generally at greater risks of deterioration in health and social well-being compared with those not CV in the same age group. CV respondents who were shielding reported worse outcomes compared with those not CV and not shielding. CONCLUSIONS: While policies focusing on shielding CV older people reduce rates of hospitalisation and death from COVID-19, policymakers should also pay attention to understanding and addressing the wider needs of this group if their long-term health and social well-being are not to be compromised.","Di Gessa, Giorgio; Price, Debora",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,491

The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been named as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). METHODS: We report on the epidemiological and clinical features of 37 children diagnosed with COVID-19. RESULTS: The median age was 10 years, and 57.1% of the children were male. In addition, 78.3% of the children had histories of contact with adult patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19, and 27.0% of our patients had coexisting medical conditions. We found that 40.5% of our patients had mild infection, while 32.4% had moderate infection, and 27.1% had developed severe or critical illness. The most common abnormal laboratory findings in our patients were decreased lymphocytes (45.9%) and increased D-dimer values (43.2%), while abnormal radiological findings were detected in 56.7% of the children. In addition, 64.8% of the patients had received azithromycin, 59.4% of the patients had received oseltamivir, and hydroxychloroquine was used in combination with azithromycin in 35.1% of the children. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 27.0% of the children. CONCLUSIONS: Although COVID- 19 infection is usually mild in childhood, severe clinic can be seen in children with comorbidities or even in children who were previously healthy.","Önal, Pinar; Kilinç, Ayse Ayzit; Aygün, Fatih; Durak, Cansu; Çokugras, Haluk",Pediatr. int,,491
311508,Who do you trust? The digital destruction of shared situational awareness and the COVID-19 infodemic,2020,"AimsTelephone consultations have been in clinical use since the early 1960s and are increasing in frequency and importance in many areas of medicine. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the use of telemedicine consultations increased dramatically alongside utilization of other digital technologies. Despite promise and potential advantages for clinicians (including remote working, improved time management and safety) there are known drawbacks to telephone consultations for psychiatrists. This includes limitations to assessments of mental state and risk, with loss of non-verbal communication often cited as a point in favour of more sophisticated technologies such as video calling. By adopting telephone consultations to a greater extent during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Coventry Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team (CRHTT), we aimed to assess the patient experience in telehealth, through a patient survey.MethodAfter an initial assessment or follow-up consultation with a medical practitioner from the crisis team, patients were invited to take part in a short questionnaire with a member of the administration staff. This consisted of eight questions on a Likert scale and three open questions for comments. Results were collated and analyzed via Microsoft Excel.ResultMost patients found the telephone consultations satisfactory, with more than 90% returning positive scores in understanding, convenience and overall satisfaction. All patients felt listened to and that their confidentiality was maintained;with all but one respondent willing to engage in further consultations via the telephone. Negative scores were typically returned for practical telephonic problems including poor signal, interference and background noise. In their comments patients expressed largely positive views about their experience with their clinician;analysis revealed key insights into the patient experience, demonstrating the convenience, comfort and flexibility possible with ‘telepsychiatry’.ConclusionPatient experience of telemedicine in a UK psychiatric crisis team is mostly positive, with clear advantages for both patients and clinicians. Our results show telephone consultations can be expanded to new patient assessments alongside follow-ups, enabling the team to reach a greater number of service users. This includes service users who are housebound due to infirmity, required to shield or have significant anxiety about the pandemic.","Packer, Jonathan Fisher Emma Simons Anne-Marie Bolochowecki Kirsty Roff Benita Khurmi Sanjay Jones Luke",BJPsych Open,,491

312403,Analysis of the Russian-Chinese economic correlation in the field of foreign trade relations in the pandemic,2020,"Recently, there has been an increase in the number of patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and the number of publications devoted to this problem is increasing. The main etiological factors of AR are pollen of trees, meadow and weeds, as well as mold spores, household allergens and epidermis of animals. Epidemiological studies have found that the prevalence and structure of AR are influenced by regional characteristics, such as the climatic and geographical and social characteristics of the region, and successively therapeutic and preventive algorithms in AR are also different. AIM: To examine the phenotype of the incidence of AR in connection with the characteristics of aeroallergens under the influence of climatic and geographical conditions in northern Vietnam, to make a new contribution to knowledge about AR in Asia and to increase the effect of treatment and prevention in this territory. MATERIALS AND RESEARCH METHODS: The study was conducted in the period from 06.2018 to 09.2018 on the basis of the ENT department of Thainguyen Central Hospital, Vietnam. A total of 556 patients with pathology of ENT organs aged 18 to 70 years were examined, 158 cases of chronic rhinitis were revealed. Among data from 158 patients, 64 patients were diagnosed with AR. We used otorhinolaryngological examination, a standard specific allergological examination and carried out aeropolyneological research in the city of the northern Vietnam, from 06.2018 to 06.2019. RESULT: The aerobiological spectrum is dominated by pollen from the families Moraceae, Urticaceae, Poaceae, Acacia, Artemisia, fern spores and fungal spores from the genus Alternaria. Among patients with chronic rhinitis, 40% were diagnosed with AR, 98.44% of them year-round or perennial AR, with predominant sensitization to house dust mites and molds, much more often to plant pollen. Among 9 (14.06%) patients diagnosed with a polyp of the nasal cavity, 6 (9.37%) patients had increased levels of specific IgE in the blood to a mixture of molds. Sensitization in patients with AR with hypertrophy of the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity is predominant on house dust. CONCLUSION: Predominantly, AR in northern Vietnam was year-round. Especially the connection between the formation of a polyp of the nasal cavity and hypersensitivity to fungal spores has been indicated, which may also indicate the role of social factors in further recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of AR in patients living in North Vietnam.","Kryukov, A I; Bondareva, G P; Severova, E E; Nguyen, T F; Nguyen, K H",Vestn Otorinolaringol,,491

Videoteleconferencing is a well-studied means of virtual care that has successfully been used to remotely assess, diagnose and manage such patients. Successful telemedicine programs often have access to supplemental clinical information to aid in diagnosis and involve interdisciplinary teams to manage patient complexity. Evidence regarding direct-to-home virtual care for people with Alzheimer disease and related dementias is lacking;this model is associated with unique challenges that must be considered as virtual care becomes a more common approach to health care delivery. Virtual care is rapidly evolving and will continue to expand as technology advances to meet health care system demands. Research in this field in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has increased, yet many questions remain unanswered. Existing literature suggests that cognitive assessment tools administered by telemedicine are generally reliable, the implementation of a telemedicine system for assessing and managing Alzheimer disease and related dementias is feasible and the virtual interface appears well accepted. Given the current limitations of virtual care, however, most experts suggest that virtual visits be used to supplement in-person encounters instead of replacing them, when possible.","Gosse, P.

317808,"Air-pollutant mass concentration changes during COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai, China",2020,"Ivermectin (IVM) belongs to the class of macrocyclic lactones, which is used as an antiparasitic agent. At present, the researchers focus on possibility to use IVM in treatment of certain forms of cancer and viral diseases such as COVID-19. The mechanisms of IVM action are not clear. It is assumed that IVM affects chloride channels and increases cytoplasmic concentration of chloride. This study examines the effect of IVM on chloride currents induced by glycine (IGly). Experiments were carried out on isolated pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus with whole-cell patch clamp. A short-term (600 msec) application of IVM in a concentration of 10 µM induced a slow inward current, which persisted after washing the neurons. The low concentrations (0.1-1000 nM) of IVM did not induce any novel current, but it rapidly and reversibly reduced the peak amplitude and accelerated desensitization of IGly in a dose-dependent manner. The threshold concentrations of IVM sufficient to reduce peak amplitude of IGly and to accelerate desensitization of IGly were 100 nM and 0.1 nM, respectively. The study revealed a high sensitivity of neuronal glycine receptors to IVM.","Bukanova, J V; Solntseva, E I; Kondratenko, R V; Skrebitsky, V G",Bull Exp Biol Med,,491

318816,Novice teachers in a changing reality,2020,"BACKGROUND: The working methods of the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) and its recommendations are only partially known by medical professionals and the public. OBJECTIVES: Methodology of the standard operating procedure of the STIKO, annual vaccination recommendations, normal vaccination reaction versus vaccination side effects, instructions for vaccination in case of immunodeficiency, and recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination are presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Presentation of the path to a vaccination recommendation, differences between recommendations and instructions for action, key statements on vaccination in immunodeficiency, and summary of the data situation on COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. RESULTS: The STIKO works purely on an evidence-based basis by systematically evaluating the existing preclinical and clinical studies results for a vaccine using the GRADE method. Only vaccination complications and vaccination injuries are notifiable. Immunodeficient patients can receive inactivated vaccines at any time, but generally not live vaccines. Based on current knowledge, the COVID-19 mRNA vaccination can be described as safe and effective. CONCLUSIONS: The STIKO vaccination recommendations are considered as the medical standard. The published current instructions for vaccination of immunodeficient patients and the recently published recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination, together with their scientific backgrounds and reasons, represent a valuable basis for medical action in the field of vaccination against infectious diseases.","Bogdan, Christian",Hautarzt,,491

The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether on-site testing and antiviral treatment of influenza in residents of homeless shelters reduces influenza spread in these settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial of on-site testing and antiviral treatment for influenza in nine homeless shelter sites within the Seattle metropolitan area. Participants with acute respiratory illness (ARI), defined as two or more respiratory symptoms or new or worsening cough with onset in the prior 7 days, are eligible to enroll. Approximately 3200 individuals are estimated to participate from October to May across two influenza seasons. All sites will start enrollment in the control arm at the beginning of each season, with routine surveillance for ARI. Sites will be randomized at different timepoints to enter the intervention arm, with implementation of a test-and-treat strategy for individuals with two or fewer days of symptoms. Eligible individuals will be tested on-site with a point-of-care influenza test. If the influenza test is positive and symptom onset is within 48 h, participants will be administered antiviral treatment with baloxavir or oseltamivir depending upon age and comorbidities. Participants will complete a questionnaire on demographics and symptom duration and severity. The primary endpoint is the incidence of influenza in the intervention period compared to the control period, after adjusting for time trends. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04141917 .

319939,Posterior Reversible Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome in a Patient after Acute COVID-19 Infection,2021,"Content: Introduction: Ibrutinib is a small molecule Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor which has revolutionised treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). BTK is involved in B-cell receptor signalling regulating normal B-cell activation, interactions and survival. Ibrutinib use can predispose to invasive fungal infections (IFI), via dysregulation of the innate immune system. We report three patients exhibiting central nervous system (CNS) aspergillosis as a complication of Ibrutinib therapy. Case 1: A 73-year-old man diagnosed with TP53-deleted CLL commenced second-line ibrutinib after initial bendamustine therapy. Five months after starting ibrutinib, he presented with confusion and worsening mobility. Ring-enhancing lesions suggestive of cerebral abscesses were identified on CT and were aspirated. Aspirate confirmed Aspergillus fumigatus and he completed a three-month course of voriconazole. Despite successful treatment of IFI, his CLL progressed and alternative chemotherapy was no-longer suitable. He died six months after discharge from pneumonia. Case 2: A 64-year-old woman with CLL diagnosed in 2020 commenced second-line ibrutinib two months after progression through one FCR cycle. Three weeks into cycle three of ibrutinib, at a time of clinical remission, she presented with a one week history of lethargy, confusion and ataxia without fever or lateralising neurological signs. MRI head demonstrated two large ring-enhancing lesions. In view of aspergillosis risk, empirical voriconazole was initiated. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated following abscess drainage and voriconazole treatment continued with clinical improvement. She remains well three months after discharge and is planned to re-commence ibrutinib. Case 3: A 61-year-old woman with a background of Crohn's disease on long term prednisolone was diagnosed with TP53-mutated CLL in 2005 and commenced ibrutinib in 2020. COVID-19 pneumonitis was diagnosed three months prior to presentation which was treated with dexamethasone (without IL-6 inhibition). In January 2021 she was admitted with a three-week history of worsening headache, visual field defect and pyrexia. MRI imaging indicated cerebral abscess. She underwent drainage and Aspergillus fumigatus was grown. She made good clinical progress with voriconazole, although her admission was complicated by Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Discussion: CLL is a haematological malignancy with low incidence of IFI. Cerebral aspergillosis is uncommon, even amongst immunosuppressed individuals, however literature reports have indicated an association with ibrutinib. The first two cases had no other clear predisposition for IFI and are likely attributable to ibrutinib. Case 3 had additional risk factors of long-term and acute steroid use. Onset of ibrutinib-induced CNS IFI can occur early in treatment without any other risk factor and presentations may be atypical, such as the absence of fever in Case 1, or with non-specific symptoms as in Case 2. Ring-enhancement on MRI was present in all three cases. Increased awareness of the potential for IFI, particularly CNS infection, in patients taking ibrutinib is crucial with its increasing use. Clinical suspicion is needed for any patient treated with BTK inhibitors presenting with neurological symptoms or undifferentiated fever. Further research is required to determine if the incidence of invasive aspergillosis in ibrutinib recipients warrants routine antifungal prophylaxis.","Mandal, A.; Keat, S.; Keeley, A.; Locke, T.; Shotton, K.; Partridge, D.; Highley, R.; Wright, J.; Morley, N.",British Journal of Haematology,,491

Pegadaian (Persero) Upc Secang",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has devastated health infrastructure around the world. Both ACE2 (an entry receptor) and TMPRSS2 (used by the virus for spike protein priming) are key proteins to SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, enabling progression to COVID-19 in humans. Comparative genomic research into critical ACE2 binding sites, associated with the spike receptor binding domain, has suggested that African and Asian primates may also be susceptible to disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Savanna monkeys (Chlorocebus spp.) are a widespread non-human primate with well-established potential as a bi-directional zoonotic/anthroponotic agent due to high levels of human interaction throughout their range in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. To characterize potential functional variation in savanna monkey ACE2 and TMPRSS2, we inspected recently published genomic data from 245 savanna monkeys, including 163 wild monkeys from Africa and the Caribbean and 82 captive monkeys from the Vervet Research Colony (VRC). We found several missense variants. One missense variant in ACE2 (X:14,077,550; Asp30Gly), common in Ch. sabaeus, causes a change in amino acid residue that has been inferred to reduce binding efficiency of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting potentially reduced susceptibility. The remaining populations appear as susceptible as humans, based on these criteria for receptor usage. All missense variants observed in wild Ch. sabaeus populations are also present in the VRC, along with two splice acceptor variants (at X:14,065,076) not observed in the wild sample that are potentially disruptive to ACE2 function. The presence of these variants in the VRC suggests a promising model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine and therapy development. In keeping with a One Health approach, characterizing actual susceptibility and potential for bi-directional zoonotic/anthroponotic transfer in savanna monkey populations may be an important consideration for controlling COVID-19 epidemics in communities with frequent human/non-human primate interactions that, in many cases, may have limited health infrastructure.","Schmitt, Christopher A; Bergey, Christina M; Jasinska, Anna J; Ramensky, Vasily; Burt, Felicity; Svardal, Hannes; Jorgensen, Matthew J; Freimer, Nelson B; Grobler, J Paul; Turner, Trudy R",PLoS One,,491

Many metagenomic data sets are now available, with deep sequencing of samples from diverse biological niches. While any individual metagenomic data set can be readily queried using web-based tools, meta-searches through all such data sets are less accessible. In this brief communication, we demonstrate such a meta-metagenomic approach, examining close matches to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in all high-throughput sequencing data sets in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive accessible with the ""virome"" keyword. In addition to the homology to bat coronaviruses observed in descriptions of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence (F. Wu, S. Zhao, B. Yu, Y. M.

323973,Hidden in plain sight: contrasting management and student perceptions of the value of casual teachers in online higher education,2021,"Objective: To identify the key mechanisms, contexts, and outcomes that drive the successful participatory co-design of assistive technologies. Method: A rapid realist review was conducted using a systematic search strategy. After screening, a final set of 28 articles were included. Articles were analyzed for evidence relevant to our initial program theory (IPT), and context-mechanism-outcome configurations were developed, resulting in a revised program theory. Results: All 28 articles included were highly relevant to the IPT, and had sufficient detail regarding the process of participatory co-design. The findings of this review highlight several key context-mechanism-outcome configurations as potential patterns in the data under the two dimensions of the evolving program theory: knowledge integration and the ethico-political dimension. Discussion: This review revealed the key mechanisms of mutual awareness, mutual learning, trust, and reciprocity that need to be taken into account in AT development and assessment. We concluded that participatory co-design requires a restructuring of power relations between end-users and those traditionally in control of technology design. These findings inform the development and assessment of AT for older adults and help guide policy/decision-makers to move forward with the now urgent agenda for scale-up and spread, initiated by the burning platform of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Carroll, S.; Kobayashi, K.; Cervantes, M.

Northern South America (NSA) was one of those areas where pollution changed during lockdown due to high fire activity. This study aims to analyze, for the first time in NSA, the behavior of selected criteria air pollutants during the implementation of the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown in two high populated cities of the region: Bogotá and Medellín in Colombia. A set of tools including surface measurements, as well as satellite and modeled data were used. 24-hour average concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 were collected from air quality stations for the lockdown period ranging from February 21 to June 30, 2020. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) was used to analyze the fire flux OC as a biomass burning (BB) indicator, and tropospheric NO2 concentrations were retrieved from TROPOMI. The HYSPLIT model was used to analyze back trajectories and fire data were obtained from MODIS sensor measurements. Our analysis shows short-term background NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 concentration reductions of 60%, 44%, and 40%, respectively, for the strict lockdown; and 62%, 58%, and 69% for the relaxed lockdown. Corresponding long-term reductions were of 50%, 32%, and 9% for the strict lockdown; and 37%, 29%, and 19% for the relaxed lockdown. Regional BB increased PM2.5 concentrations by 20 µg/m3 during the strict lockdown, and the Saharan dust event increased PM10 concentrations up to 168 µg/m3 in Bogotá, and 104 µg/m3 in Medellín, bringing an additional risk of morbidity and mortality for population. Regional BB has several causes that need to be properly managed to benefit local air quality improvement plans. Future cleaner transport policies equivalent to reduced lockdown mobility could bring pollution close to WHO guidelines.","Mendez-Espinosa, Juan F; Rojas, Nestor Y; Vargas, Jorge; Pachón, Jorge E; Belalcazar, Luis C; Ramírez, Omar",Sci Total Environ,,491
325419,Tourism jobs in demand: Where the best contracts and high salaries go at online offers,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the greatest recent threats to human health, wellbeing and economic growth. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) of human viruses can be a useful tool for population-scale monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and epidemiology to help prevent further spread of the disease, particularly within urban centres. Here, we present a longitudinal analysis (March-July 2020) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA prevalence in sewage across six major urban centres in the UK (total population equivalent 3 million) by q(RT-)PCR and viral genome sequencing. Our results demonstrate that levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA generally correlated with the abundance of clinical cases recorded within the community in large urban centres, with a marked decline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA abundance following the implementation of lockdown measures. The strength of this association was weaker in areas with lower confirmed COVID-19 case numbers. Further, sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater suggested that multiple genetically distinct clusters were co-circulating in the local populations covered by our sample sites, and that the genetic variants observed in wastewater reflected similar SNPs observed in contemporaneous samples from cases tested in clinical diagnostic laboratories. We demonstrate how WBE can be used for both community-level detection and tracking of SARS-CoV-2 and other virus' prevalence, and can inform public health policy decisions. Although, greater understanding of the factors that affect SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater are needed for the full integration of WBE data into outbreak surveillance. In conclusion, our results lend support to the use of routine WBE for monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 and other human pathogenic viruses circulating in the population and assessment of the effectiveness of disease control measures.","Hillary, Luke S; Farkas, Kata; Maher, Kathryn H; Lucaci, Anita; Thorpe, Jamie; Distaso, Marco A; Gaze, William H; Paterson, Steve; Burke, Terry; Connor, Thomas R; McDonald, James E; Malham, Shelagh K; Jones, David L",Water Res,,491

At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, R0 was frequently referenced by the public health community and the wider public. However, this metric is often misused or misinterpreted. Moreover, the complexity of the process of estimating R0 has caused difficulties for a substantial number of researchers. In this article, in order to increase the accessibility of this concept, we address several misconceptions related to the threshold characteristics of R0 and the effective reproduction number (Rt). Moreover, the appropriate interpretation of the metrics is discussed. R0 should be considered as a population-averaged value that pools the contact structure according to a stochastic transmission process. Furthermore, it is necessary to understand the unavoidable time lag for Rt due to the incubation period of the disease.","Lim, Jun-Sik; Cho, Sung-Il; Ryu, Sukhyun; Pak, Son-Il",J Prev Med Public Health,,491

The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of patients with NENs who tested severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a worldwide study collecting cases of patients with NENs along with a positive nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 between June 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021. Centres treating patients with NENs were directly contacted by the principal investigator. Patients with NENs of any primary site, grade and stage were included, excluding small-cell lung carcinoma and mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma. RESULTS: Among 81 centres directly contacted, 88.8% responded and 48.6% of them declined due to lack of cases or interest. On March 31st, 2021, eight recruiting centres enrolled 89 patients. The median age was 64 years at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Most patients had metastatic, non-functioning, low-/intermediate-grade gastroenteropancreatic NENs on treatment with somatostatin analogues and radioligand therapy. Most of them had comorbidities. Only 8% of patients had high-grade NENs and 12% were receiving chemotherapy. Most patients had symptoms or signs of COVID-19, mainly fever and cough. Only 3 patients underwent sub-intensive treatment, whereas most of them received medical therapies, mostly antibiotics. In two third of cases, no changes occurred for the anti-NEN therapy. More than 80% of patients completely recovered without sequelae, whereas 7.8% patients died due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients included in this study reflect the typical NEN population regardless of SARS-CoV-2.

The sensor was constructed on screen-printed carbon electrodes coated with gold nanoparticles. The electrodes were functionalized using 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) which was used for the immobilization of an antibody against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N protein). The binding of the immunosensor with the N protein caused a change in the electrochemical signal. The detection was realised by measuring the change in reduction peak current of a redox couple using square wave voltammetry at 0.04 V versus Ag ref. electrode on the immunosensor upon binding with the N protein. The electrochemical immunosensor showed high sensitivity with a linear range from 1.0 pg.mL-1 to 100 ng.mL-1 and a limit of detection of 0.4 pg.mL-1 for the N protein in PBS buffer pH 7.4. Moreover, the immunosensor did not exhibit significant response with other viruses such as HCoV, MERS-CoV, Flu A and Flu B, indicating the high selectivity of the sensor for SARS-CoV-2. However, cross reactivity of the biosensor with SARS-CoV is indicated, which gives ability of the sensor to detect both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The biosensor was successfully applied to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical samples showing good correlation between the biosensor response and the RT-PCR cycle threshold values. We believe that the capability of miniaturization, low-cost and fast response of the proposed label-free electrochemical immunosensor will facilitate the point-of-care diagnosis of COVID 19 and help prevent further spread of infection.","Eissa, Shimaa; Alhadrami, Hani A; Al-Mozaini, Maha; Hassan, Ahmed M; Zourob, Mohammed",Mikrochim Acta,,491
330774,How hotels adjust technology-based strategy to respond to COVID-19 and gain competitive productivity (CP): strategic management process and dynamic capabilities,2021,"Shigella ssp cause bacillary dysentery (shigellosis) which has high global morbidity in young children and the elderly. The virulence of Shigella relies upon a type III secretion system (T3SS) which injects host altering effector proteins into targeted intestinal cells. The Shigella T3SS contains two components, invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD) and invasion plasmid antigen B (IpaB), that were previously identified as broadly protective antigens. When IpaD and IpaB were co-expressed to give the DB fusion (DBF) protein, vaccine efficacy was further improved. Biophysical characterization under various pH conditions showed that DBF is most stable at pH 7 and 8 and loses its conformational integrity at 48 and 50 oC respectively. Forced degradation studies revealed significant effects on the secondary structure, tertiary structure and conformational stability of DBF. In the presence of phosphate buffers as well as other anionic excipients, DBF demonstrated a concentration dependent conformational stabilization. Molecular docking revealed potential polyanion binding sites in DBF that may interact with phytic acid. These sites can be exploited to stabilize the DBF protein. This work highlights potential destabilizing and stabilizing factors, which not only improves our understanding of the DBF protein but helps in future development of a stable Shigella vaccine.","Jain, Akshay; Hu, Gang; Kumar Ratnakaram, Siva Sai; Johnson, David K; Picking, William D; Picking, Wendy L; Middaugh, Charles Russell",J. pharm. sci,,491

Methods: For 10 decedents with 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan, bilateral lungs underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous multi-point puncture autopsy, and pulmonary pathological changes were described in routine hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) slides. Electron microscopy was also performed. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to detect 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in lung tissue, and the pathological characteristics were demonstrated in combination with clinical data analysis. Results: Of the 10 deaths associated with COVID-19, 7 were male and 3 were female. The average age was 70 (39-87) years. Medical record showed that 7 patients had underlying diseases. The average course of disease was 30 (16-36) days. Nine cases showed fibrinous and suppurative exudation in the alveolar cavity accompanied by the formation of hyaline membrane, and fibroblastic proliferation of alveolar septum. Type â ¡ alveolar epithelial cells showed reactive hyperplasia and desquamation. Many macrophages accumulated in the alveolar cavity. Capillary hyaline thrombus and intravascular mixed thrombus were noted. In some cases, acute bronchiolitis with mucous membrane exfoliation, accumulation of bronchiolar secretions, and bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia occurred. In the cohort, a large number of bacteria (cocci) were detected in 1 case and a large number of fungi (yeast type) were detected in 1 case. Nine cases were positive for the nucleic acids of 2019-nCoV while one case remained negative by RT-PCR. Coronavirus particles were detected in the cytoplasm of type â ¡ alveolar epithelium. Conclusions: The pulmonary pathological changes of fatal COVID-19 are diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), mainly in the acute exudative stage and the organic proliferative stage. There are fibrinous exudate aggregation in alveolar cavity with hyaline membrane formation, fibroblastic proliferation in alveolar septum, and alveolar epithelial cell injuries with reactive hyperplasia and desquamation of type â ¡ alveolar epithelial cells. A large amount of neutrophils and monocytes infiltration is present in most cases and bacteria and fungi are detected in some cases, suggesting a serious bacterial or fungal infection secondary to the DAD.","Wu, J H; Li, X; Huang, B; Su, H; Li, Y; Luo, D J; Chen, S; Ma, L; Wang, S H; Nie, X; Peng, L",Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,,491

334033,A comparison of machine learning methods to predict hospital readmission of diabetic patient,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped virus which binds its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enters hosts cells through the action of its spike (S) glycoprotein displayed on the surface of the virion. Compared to the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2, the majority of currently circulating isolates possess an S protein variant characterized by an aspartic acid-to-glycine substitution at amino acid position 614 (D614G). Residue 614 lies outside the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the mutation does not alter the affinity of monomeric S protein for ACE2. However, S(G614), compared to S(D614), mediates more efficient ACE2-mediated transduction of cells by S-pseudotyped vectors and more efficient infection of cells and animals by live SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes and synthesizes the epidemiological and functional observations of the D614G spike mutation, with focus on the biochemical and cell-biological impact of this mutation and its consequences for S protein function. We further discuss the significance of these recent findings in the context of the current global pandemic.","Jackson, Cody B; Zhang, Lizhou; Farzan, Michael; Choe, Hyeryun",,,491

This study investigated the effects of meteorological factors on daily new cases of COVID-19 in 127 countries, as of August 31 2020. The log-linear generalized additive model (GAM) was used to analyze the effect of meteorological variables on daily new cases of COVID-19. Our findings revealed that temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed are nonlinearly correlated with daily new cases, and they may be negatively correlated with the daily new cases of COVID-19 over 127 countries when temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were below 20°C, 70% and 7 m/s respectively. Temperature(>20°C) was positively correlated with daily new cases. Wind speed (when>7 m/s) and relative humidity (>70%) was not statistically associated with transmission of COVID-19. The results of this research will be a useful supplement to help healthcare policymakers in the Belt and Road countries, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop strategies to combat COVID-19.","Yuan, Jie; Wu, Yu; Jing, Wenzhan; Liu, Jue; Du, Min; Wang, Yaping; Liu, Min",Environ Res,,491

Immune mediated damage has been proposed as a pathogenic factor, but immune responses in lungs of COVID-19 patients remain poorly characterized. Here we show transcriptomic, histologic and cellular profiles of post mortem COVID-19 (n = 34 tissues from 16 patients) and normal lung tissues (n = 9 tissues from 6 patients). Two distinct immunopathological reaction patterns of lethal COVID-19 are identified. One pattern shows high local expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGhigh) and cytokines, high viral loads and limited pulmonary damage, the other pattern shows severely damaged lungs, low ISGs (ISGlow), low viral loads and abundant infiltrating activated CD8+ T cells and macrophages. ISGhigh patients die significantly earlier after hospitalization than ISGlow patients. Our study may point to distinct stages of progression of COVID-19 lung disease and highlights the need for peripheral blood biomarkers that inform about patient lung status and guide treatment.","Nienhold, Ronny; Ciani, Yari; Koelzer, Viktor H; Tzankov, Alexandar; Haslbauer, Jasmin D; Menter, Thomas; Schwab, Nathalie; Henkel, Maurice; Frank, Angela; Zsikla, Veronika; Willi, Niels; Kempf, Werner; Hoyler, Thomas; Barbareschi, Mattia; Moch, Holger; Tolnay, Markus; Cathomas, Gieri; Demichelis, Francesca; Junt, Tobias; Mertz, Kirsten D",Nat Commun,,491

These patients potentially put other patients and healthcare workers at risk of infection. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to define the proportion of asymptomatic patients admitted with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Secondary objectives were to define the positivity rate, reasons for admission, and the geographic distribution in the region. METHODS: Universal surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on patients admitted to this hospital over a 12-week period from April 9, 2020 to July 1, 2020. Positive patients were categorized as either symptomatic or asymptomatic as defined by the 11 criteria per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The positivity rate, proportion with and without symptoms, reasons for admission, and geographic distribution in the region were recorded. RESULTS: The positivity rate ranged from 0.8% to 6.2%. The proportion of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 was 37%. Asymptomatic patients primarily presented to the hospital because of either trauma or labor. Some clusters in the region were identified of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of asymptomatic patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 was significant. Identifying and isolating asymptomatic patients likely prevented exposure and development of hospital-acquired COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers and other patients, supporting the universal surveillance of all admitted patients.","Arnold, Forest W; Bishop, Sarah; Oppy, Leah; Scott, LaShawn; Stevenson, Gina",Am. j. infect. control,,491

This study reflects clinical data on South African children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We collected clinical data of children aged younger than 13 years with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 presenting to Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town between 17th of April and 24th of July 2020. RESULTS: Hundred and fifty-nine children (median age 48·0 months (interquartile range, IQR 12·0-106·0)) were included. Hospitalized children (n=62), median age of 13·5 months (IQR 1·8-43·5) were younger than children not admitted (n=97), median age 81·0 months (IQR 34·5-120·5, p< 0·01). Thirty-three of 159 (20·8%) children had pre-existing medical conditions. Fifty-one of 62 (82·3%) hospitalized children were symptomatic; lower respiratory tract infection was diagnosed in 21/51 (41·2%) and 11/16 (68·8%) children younger than 3 months of age. Respiratory support was required in 25/51 (49·0%) children; 13/25 (52·0%) children were younger than 3 months.

Lower visitor numbers were seen in a broadly positive way by a significant number of respondents while benefit sharing issues from tourism also emerged. Most preferred options to manage overcrowding were restricting access to certain paths, the development of mobile applications to alert people to overcrowding and reporting irresponsible behavior.

352121,Challenges and Coping Strategies of Covid-2019 in the Tourism Industry in Mauritius,2020,"Although acetaminophen (ApAP) is one of the most commonly used medicines worldwide, hepatotoxicity is a risk with overdose or in patients with compromised liver function. ApAP overdose is the most common cause of acute fulminant hepatic failure. Oxidation of ApAP to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) is the mechanism for hepatotoxicity. 1 is a non-hepatotoxic, metabolically unstable lipophilic ApAP analog that is not antipyretic. The newly synthesized 3 is a non-hepatotoxic ApAP analog that is stable, lipophilic, and retains analgesia and antipyresis. Intraperitoneal or po administration of the new chemical entities (NCEs), 3b and 3r, in concentrations equal to a toxic dose of ApAP did not result in the formation of NAPQI. Unlike livers from NCE-treated mice, the livers from ApAP-treated mice demonstrated large amounts of nitrotyrosine, a marker of mitochondrial free radical formation, and loss of hepatic tight junction integrity. Given the widespread use of ApAP, hepatotoxicity risk with overuse, and the ongoing opioid epidemic, these NCEs represent a novel, non-narcotic therapeutic pipeline.","Bazan, Hernan A; Bhattacharjee, Surjyadipta; Burgos, Carolina; Recio, Javier; Abet, Valentina; Pahng, Amanda R; Jun, Bokkyoo; Heap, Jessica; Ledet, Alexander J; Gordon, William C; Edwards, Scott; Paul, Dennis; Alvarez-Builla, Julio; Bazan, Nicolas G",Eur J Med Chem,,491

Although great concern has been expressed about COVID-19 infection acquired through ocular transmission, its underlying mechanism has not currently been clarified. In the current work, we analyzed and elucidated the two main elements that should be taken into account to understand the “ocular route”, both from a clinical and molecular point of view. They are represented by the dynamism of the ocular surface system (e.g., the tear film turnover) and the distribution of ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2 protein. Although it seems, at the moment, that there is a low risk of coronavirus spreading through tears, it may survive for a long time or replicate in the conjunctiva, even in absence of conjunctivitis signs, indicating that eye protection (e.g., protective goggles alone or in association with face shield) is advisable to prevent contamination from external droplets and aerosol.","Napoli, Pietro Emanuele; Nioi, Matteo; D’aloja, Ernesto; Fossarello, Maurizio",J.

We conduct a theoretical analysis of the stochastic model by the suitable Lyapunov function, including the existence and uniqueness of the positive solution, the dynamic properties around the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium;we deduce a stochastic basic reproduction number R0s for the extinction of disease, that is, if R0s≤1, the disease will go to extinction. Particularly, we fit the data from Brazil to predict the trend of the epidemic. Our main findings include the following: (i) stochastic perturbation may affect the dynamic behavior of the disease, and larger noise will be more beneficial to control its spread;(ii) strengthening social isolation, increasing the cure rate and media coverage can effectively control the spread of disease.

The aim of this pilot study was to explore the impact of the public health emergency due to COVID-19 on individual's mental health among 299 Italian adults after a month of home isolation due to COVID-19. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study design. Adults of the general population were invited to a voluntary online health survey. METHODS: Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to examine diverse psycho-social and stressful contextual factors associated with symptoms of psychopathology. RESULTS: Results indicated that females reported higher symptoms of depression, anxiety and circadian rhythm dysregulation, than males. Age and the capacity to adapt to a new environment and to cope with illness were negatively associated with all symptoms of psychopathology. Conversely, engaging in verbally aggressive behaviours and having experienced stressful events related to COVID-19 were positively related to psychopathological symptoms. Finally, social support was negatively associated with depressive symptoms, and substance use during the past months was related to circadian rhythm dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study raise particular concern about psychological well-being considering the negative associations between stressful events during the COVID-19 pandemic, symptoms of psychological distress, and perceived social support. These results have possible significant clinical implications.","Amendola, Simone; Spensieri, Valentina; Hengartner, Michael P; Cerutti, Rita",Br. j. health psychol,,491

A novel, solid-state nanoplasmonic sensor capable of assaying circulating microRNAs through a combined surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (PEF) approach has been developed. Here, the unique localized surface plasmon resonance properties of chemically-synthesized gold triangular nanoprisms (Au TNPs) are utilized to create large SERS and PEF enhancements. With careful modification to the surface of Au TNPs, this sensing approach is capable of quantifying circulating microRNAs at femtogram/microliter concentrations. Uniquely, the multimodal analytical methods mitigate both false positive and false negative responses and demonstrate the high stability of our sensors within bodily fluids. As a proof of concept, microRNA-10b and microRNA-96 were directly assayed from the plasma of six bladder cancer patients. Results show potential for a highly specific liquid biopsy method that could be used in point-of-care clinical diagnostics to increase early cancer detection or any other diseases including SARS-CoV-2 in which RNAs can be used as biomarkers.","Masterson, Adrianna N; Liyanage, Thakshila; Berman, Claire; Kaimakliotis, Hristos; Johnson, Merrell; Sardar, Rajesh",Analyst,,491

363199,Is Caribbean tourism in overdrive? Investigating the antecedents and effects of overtourism in sovereign and nonsovereign small island tourism economies (SITEs),2021,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown various social determinants of health (SDOH) may have contributed to the disparities in COVID-19 incidence and mortality among minorities and underserved populations at county or zip code level. OBJECTIVE: This analysis was carried out at a granular spatial resolution of census tracts, to explore the spatial patterns and contextual SDOH associated with COVID-19 incidence from a Hispanic population mostly consisting of Mexican Americans living in Cameron County, TX on the border of US and Mexico. We performed age-stratified analysis to identify different contributing SDOH and quantify their effects by age groups. METHODS: We included all reported COVID-19 positive cases confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing between March 19th (first case reported) and December 16th, 2020 in Cameron County, TX. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were aggregated to weekly counts by census tracts. We adopted a Bayesian spatiotemporal Negative Binomial model to investigate the COVID-19 incidence rate, in relation to census tract demographics and SDOH obtained from the American Community Survey (ACS). Moreover, we investigated the impact of local mitigation policy on COVID-19 by creating a binary variable ""shelter-in-place"". The analysis was performed on all COVID-19 confirmed cases, and also age-stratified subgroups. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that the relative incidence risk (RR) of COVID-19 was higher among census tracts with a higher percentage of single parent household (RR=1.016; 95% CI: [1.005, 1.027]), and higher percentage of population of limited English proficiency (RR=1.015; 95% CI: [1.003, 1.028]). Lower RR was associated with lower income (RR=0.972; 95% CI: [0.953, 0.993]), and the percentage of population under 18 (RR=0.976; 95% CI: [0.959, 0.993]). The most significant association was related to the ""shelter-in-place"" variable, where the incidence risk of COVID-19 was reduced by over 50% comparing the time periods when policy present vs policy absent (RR=0.506; 95% [0.454, 0.563]). Moreover, age-stratified analyses identified different significant contributing factors, and varying magnitude of the ""shelter-in-place"" effect. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, SDOH including social environment and local emergency measure were identified in relation to COVID-19 incidence risk at the census tract level in a highly disadvantaged population with limited health care access and high prevalence of chronic conditions. Results from our analysis provide key knowledge to design efficient testing strategies and assist local public health departments for COVID-19 control, mitigation and implementation of vaccine strategies.","Bauer, Cici; Zhang, Kehe; Lee, Miryoung; Fisher-Hoch, Susan; Guajardo, Esmeralda; McCormick, Joseph; de la Cerda, Isela; Fernandez, Maria; Reininger, Belinda",,,491
364274,Teachers’ Confidence In Teaching English Using YouTube Channel In Early Pandemic COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Households are important sites for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and preventive measures are recommended. This study aimed to 1) investigate the impact of living with a person infected with SARS-CoV-2; 2) understand how household members implemented infection control recommendations in their home; and 3) identify the information and support needs of household members. METHODS: For this observational mixed-methods study, households with a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited via drive-through testing sites of Municipal Health Services, healthcare worker screening or hospital emergency visits in the University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands and via primary care physicians, hospital emergency visits or preoperative screening in the University Hospital of Antwerp, Belgium. We recorded household characteristics, including characteristics of all household members, together with their views on prevention measures. In a subset of households one adult household member was asked to participate in an interview investigating their views on preventive measures. Survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics and interview data by rapid framework analysis. A triangulation protocol was used to integrate findings. RESULTS: Thirty-four households (120 household members) were included in the quantitative survey. Twenty-two households were invited to be interviewed, of which 18 completed an interview (response 81.8%). Survey data showed that almost all households implemented some preventive measures, the use of face masks being least frequently reported. Measures taken depended on what was physically possible, the perceived severity of illness of the index patient and to what extent household members were willing to limit social interaction. Respondents did not believe in the effectiveness of wearing face masks within the house, and from the interviews this was explained by media coverage of face masks, impracticality and the stigma associated with wearing masks. Interviewees reported that quarantine had a high emotional burden and wished to have more information about the exact duration of quarantine, their own COVID-19 status, symptoms and when to seek medical help. CONCLUSION: People were willing to implement prevention measures, however actual adherence depended on perceived severity of illness and the perceived risk of becoming infected. Homes are social environments and recommendations for infection prevention should account for this context. Incorporating our findings into policy making could provide households with more relevant and actionable advice.","Verberk, Janneke D M; Anthierens, Sibyl A; Tonkin-Crine, Sarah; Goossens, Herman; Kinsman, John; de Hoog, Marieke L A; Bielicki, Julia A; Bruijning-Verhagen, Patricia C J L; Gobat, Nina H",PLoS One,,491

To date, the origin and intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. In this study, we conducted comparative analysis among SARS-CoV-2 and non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains to elucidate their phylogenetic relationships. We found: 1, the SARS-CoV-2 strains analyzed could be divided into 3 clades with regional aggregation; 2, the non-SARS-CoV-2 common coronaviruses that infect humans or other organisms to cause respiratory syndrome and epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis could also be divided into 3 clades; 3, the hosts of the common coronaviruses closest to SARS-CoV-2 were Apodemus chevrieri (a rodent), Delphinapterus leucas (beluga whale), Hypsugo savii (bat) , Camelus bactrianus (camel) and Mustela vison (mink); and 4, the gene sequences of the receptor ACE2 from different hosts could also be divided into 3 clades. The ACE2 gene sequences closest to that of humans in evolution include those from Nannospalax galili (Upper Galilee mountains blind mole rat), Phyllostomus discolor (pale spear-nosed bat), Mus musculus (house mouse), Delphinapterus leucas (beluga whale), and Catharus ustulatus (Swainson's thrush). We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved from a distant common ancestor with the common coronaviruses but not a branch of any of them, implying that the prevalent pandemic COVID-19 agent SARS-CoV-2 may have existed in a yet to be identified primary host for a long time.","Li, Fei-Feng; Zhang, Qiong; Wang, Gui-Yu; Liu, Shu-Lin",Aging (Albany NY),,491

We previously built fully glycosylated full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein models in a viral membrane including both open and closed conformations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and different templates for the stalk region. In this work, multiple µs-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed to provide deeper insights into the structure and dynamics of S protein and glycan functions. Our simulations reveal that the highly flexible stalk is composed of two independent joints and most probable S protein orientations are competent for ACE2 binding. We identify multiple glycans stabilizing the open and/or closed states of the RBD and demonstrate that the exposure of antibody epitopes can be captured by detailed antibody-glycan clash analysis instead of commonly used accessible surface area analysis that tends to overestimate the impact of glycan shielding and neglect possible detailed interactions between glycan and antibodies. Overall, our observations offer structural and dynamic insights into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and potentialize for guiding the design of effective antiviral therapeutics.","Choi, Yeol Kyo; Cao, Yiwei; Frank, Martin; Woo, Hyeonuk; Park, Sang-Jun; Yeom, Min Sun; Croll, Tristan I; Seok, Chaok; Im, Wonpil",J Chem Theory Comput,,491

METHODS: Using a prospective design, participants (N = 2,094) were first assessed in early February 2020 before the coronavirus crisis in the United States and again in mid-March 2020 during the President's ""15 Days to Slow the Spread"" guidelines. Weight, height, and weight discrimination were assessed in the February survey. Psychological, behavioral, and interpersonal responses to the coronavirus were assessed in the March survey. RESULTS: Prepandemic experiences with weight discrimination were associated with greater concerns about the virus, engaging in more preventive behaviors, less trust in people and institutions to manage the outbreak, and greater perceived declines in connection to one's community. BMI tended to be unrelated to these responses. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the risks of complications of coronavirus disease associated with obesity, individuals with higher BMI were neither more concerned about the virus nor taking more behavioral precautions than individuals in other weight categories. Weight discrimination, in contrast, may heighten vigilance to threat, which may have contributed to both positive (greater concern, more precautionary behavior) and negative (less trust, declines community connection) responses to the pandemic.","Sutin, Angelina R; Robinson, Eric; Daly, Michael; Gerend, Mary A; Stephan, Yannick; Luchetti, Martina; Aschwanden, Damaris; Strickhouser, Jason E; Lee, Ji Hyun; Sesker, Amanda A; Terracciano, Antonio",Obesity (Silver Spring),,491
370431,The post-pandemic globalization of intangibles. Towards the transformation higher education internationalisation?,2020,"The use of health apps on mobile devices by healthcare providers and receivers (patients) is proliferating. This has elevated cybersecurity concerns owing to the transmittal of personal health information through the apps. Research literature has mostly focused on the technology aspects of cybersecurity in mobile healthcare. It is equally important to focus on the ethical and regulatory perspectives. This article discusses cybersecurity concerns in mobile healthcare from the ethical perspective, the regulatory/compliance perspective, and the technology perspective. The authors present a comprehensive framework (DeTER) that integrates all three perspectives through which cybersecurity concerns in mobile healthcare could be viewed, understood, and acted upon. Guidance is provided with respect to leveraging the framework in the decision-making process that occurs during the system development life cycle (SDLC). Finally, the authors discuss a case applying the framework to a situation involving the development of a contact tracing mobile health app for pandemics such as COVID-19. © 2021 IGI Global.

In this study, we demonstrated that CPE can be analyzed using an FRET-based ATP probe named ATP indicator based on Epsilon subunit for Analytical Measurements (ATeam). The results revealed that as early as 3 hr, the virus infected cells showed a significantly different Venus/cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) ratio compared to the mock-infected cells. The ATeam technology is therefore useful to determine the early signs of ATP-based CPE as early as 3 hr without morphology-based CPE by light microscopy, and enables high throughput determination of the presence of microorganisms in neglected samples stored in laboratories.","Doysabas, Karla Cristine C; Oba, Mami; Ishibashi, Tomoki; Shibata, Hideki; Takemae, Hitoshi; Shimoda, Hiroshi; Tarigan, Ronald; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Iida, Atsuo; Hondo, Eiichi",J Vet Med Sci,,491

STUDY DESIGN: Eligible patients between the ages of 9 and 14 years with functional abdominal pain disorders (n = 139) received enhanced usual care during their medical visit to a gastroenterologist. Those that failed to respond to enhanced usual care were randomized to receive either a tailored cognitive behavioral therapy (ADAPT) plus medical treatment as usual, or medical treatment as usual only. ADAPT dose (4 sessions of pain management or 6 sessions of pain and anxiety management) was based on presence of clinically significant anxiety. Outcomes included feasibility, based on recruitment and retention rates. Response to ADAPT plus medical treatment as usual vs medical treatment as usual on pain-related outcomes and anxiety measures was also investigated using a structural equation modeling equivalent of a MANCOVA. Anxiety levels and ADAPT dose as moderators of treatment effects were also explored. RESULTS: Based on recruitment and retention rates, stepped care was feasible. Enhanced usual care was effective for only 8% of youth. Participants randomized to ADAPT plus medical treatment as usual showed significantly greater improvements in pain-related disability, but not pain levels, and greater improvements in anxiety symptoms compared with those randomized to medical treatment as usual only. Anxiety and ADAPT treatment dose did not moderate the effect of treatment on disability nor pain.

Thereafter on the basis of α-upward fuzzified preference rough sets, we propose approximate precision, rough degree, approximate quality and their mutual relationships. Furthermore, we presented the idea of new types of fuzzy upward ?-coverings, fuzzy upward ?-neighborhoods and fuzzy upward complement ?-neighborhoods and some relavent properties are discussed. Hereby, we formulate a new type of upward lower and upward upper approximations by applying an upward ?-neighborhoods. After employing the upward ?-neighborhoods based upward rough set approach to it any times, we can only get the six different sets at most. That is to say, every rough set in a universe can be approximated by only six sets, where the lower and upper approximations of each set in the six sets are still lying among these six sets. The relationships among these six sets are established. Subsequently, we presented the idea to combine the fuzzy implicator and t-norm to introduce multigranulation ( ? , T )-fuzzy upward rough set applying fuzzy upward ?-covering and some relative properties are discussed. Finally we presented a new technique for the selection of medicine for treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) using multigranulation ( ? , T )-fuzzy upward rough sets.","Rehman, Noor Ali Abbas Liu Peide Hila Kostaq",International Journal of Intelligent Systems,,491

In response to COVID-19, cities nationwide temporarily housed people experiencing homelessness in unused hotels. One such initiative in New Orleans also enacted a screening, counseling, and linkage-to-care model for HIV and HCV treatment for this temporarily housed population between May and July 2020. METHODS: A non-concurrent cohort study was performed assessing follow up in the treatment of HIV and HCV for this population. Outcome data was collected on seropositive patients' electronic medical record to assess patient progression through the treatment cascade. RESULTS: Of 102 unhoused residents, 25 (24.5%) tested HCV seropositive. Of the HCV positive 21/25 (84%) were connected to the associated clinic for follow up care and 10 (40%) obtained HCV treatment medication. Furthermore, all three patients who tested seropositive for HIV either started or re-initiated anti-viral treatment. The greatest barrier to providing medication for the HCV seropositive patients, once care was initiated, was loss-to-follow-up. CONCLUSION: Targeting homeless persons living in temporary residences for HCV and HIV screening can be effective at promoting access to care for those infected due to this population's high HCV seropositivity especially significant if the patient has a history of intravenous drug use or is over the age of 40. However, continued outreach strategies are needed to assist patients in retention of care.","Cironi, Katherine A; Jones, Austin T; Hauser, Elizabeth M; Olsen, Joseph W; Kissinger, Patricia J",Sex. transm. dis,,491

Despite intensive research efforts, the genes and pathways that contribute to COVID-19 remain poorly understood. We, therefore, used an integrative genomics (IG) approach to identify candidate genes responsible for COVID-19 and its severity. We used Bayesian colocalization (COLOC) and summary-based Mendelian randomization to combine gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from the Lung eQTL (n = 1,038) and eQTLGen (n = 31,784) studies with published COVID-19 genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Additionally, we used COLOC to integrate plasma protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) from the INTERVAL study (n = 3,301) with COVID-19 loci. Finally, we determined any causal associations between plasma proteins and COVID-19 using multi-variable two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). The expression of 18 genes in lung and/or blood co-localized with COVID-19 loci. Of these, 12 genes were in suggestive loci (PGWAS < 5 × 10-05). LZTFL1, SLC6A20, ABO, IL10RB and IFNAR2 and OAS1 had been previously associated with a heightened risk of COVID-19 (PGWAS < 5 × 10-08). We identified a causal association between OAS1 and COVID-19 GWAS. Plasma ABO protein, which is associated with blood type in humans, demonstrated a significant causal relationship with COVID-19 in the MR analysis; increased plasma levels were associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 and, in particular, severe COVID-19. In summary, our study identified genes associated with COVID-19 that may be prioritized for future investigations. Importantly, this is the first study to demonstrate a causal association between plasma ABO protein and COVID-19.","Hernández Cordero, Ana I; Li, Xuan; Milne, Stephen; Yang, Chen Xi; Bossé, Yohan; Joubert, Philippe; Timens, Wim; van den Berge, Maarten; Nickle, David; Hao, Ke; Sin, Don D",Hum. genet,,491

375775,Mathematics education students’ experiences during lockdown: Managing collaboration in elearning,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, cardiovascular disease is still the main cause of death in developed countries. Of these deaths, acute coronary syndromes (ACS) account for a substantial percentage of deaths. Improvement in ACS outcomes, are achieved by reducing the time from symptom onset until reperfusion or total ischemic time (TIT). Nevertheless, due to the overwhelming reality at the beginning of the pandemic, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) care may have been compromised. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated delays in TIT based on the date and timing of admissions in patients with STEMI, by a timeline follow-up form, before and during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Between July 2018 and June 2020, two hundred and twelve patients diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were admitted to our medical center. Upon presentation, cases were assigned a timeline report sheet and each time interval, from onset of symptoms to the catheterization lab, was documented. The information was later evaluated to study potential excessive delays throughout ACS management. RESULTS: Our data evidenced that during the COVID-19 pandemic ACS admissions were reduced by 34.54%, in addition to several in-hospital delays in patient's ACS management including delays in door-to-ECG time (9.43 +/- 18.21 vs. 18.41 +/- 28.34, p = 0.029), ECG-to-balloon (58.25 +/- 22.59 vs. 74.39 +/- 50.30, p = 0.004) and door-to-balloon time (57.41 +/- 27.52 vs. 69.31 +/- 54.14, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic a reduction in ACS admissions occurred in our hospital that accompanied with longer in-hospital TIT due to additional tests, triage, protocols to protect and prevent infection within hospital staff, and maintenance of adequate standards of care. However, door-to-balloon time was maintained under 90 min.","Bruoha, S.; Yosefy, C.; Gallego-Colon, E.; Rieck, J.; Orlov, Y.; Osherov, A.; Jihad, A.

In contrast, little inquiry has occurred at the intersection of entrepreneurship and supply chain management. This presents a tremendous opportunity, as does the relative lack of work bringing together all three fields. We seek to set the stage for exploiting these opportunities by first describing how incorporating a series of key supply chain concepts—omni-channel, last-mile delivery, supply chain agility, supply chain resiliency, and service recovery—could enrich entrepreneurship research. We then explain how the boundaries of key entrepreneurship concepts—opportunity, entrepreneurial orientation, optimal distinctiveness, bricolage, and fear of failure—could be extended to the supply chain context. Both of these moves bring strategic management concepts into play, as well. In accomplishing our tasks, we draw on examples from how firms attempted to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic via moves spanning entrepreneurship, supply chain management, and strategic management.","Ketchen, David J.; Craighead, Christopher W.",J.

380171,To disclose or to falsify: The effects of cognitive trust and affective trust on customer cooperation in contact tracing,2021,"PROBLEM: Lymphocyte immunotherapy (LIT) emerged in the early 1980s as a new therapeutic proposal for couples with a history of recurrent miscarriages (RM). However, in the early 2000s, the effectiveness of LIT was questioned. Recently, meta-analyses have observed the effectiveness and safety of LIT in treating couples with RM. Some studies evaluated the use of LIT in recurrent implantation failure (RIF) in in vitro fertilization cycles. METHODS: This systematic and narrative review evaluated the data available in the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of the use of LIT. Searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were conducted, using the following keywords: ""recurrent miscarriage,"" ""lymphocyte immunotherapy,"" and ""recurrent implantation failure"". RESULTS: This review describes the historical aspects of LIT and discusses its protocols, mechanisms of action, side effects, complications, and current evidence of the effectiveness in cases of reproductive failure. It also discusses the use of LIT during the COVID-19 pandemic and new immunological therapies. CONCLUSION: In the vast majority of studies, the use of LIT for RM couples has shown an improvement in pregnancy outcomes. The most of the current studies that support the evidence are quasi-experimental, with few randomized, double-blind studies (Level of evidence III). However, the current evidence are not convincing for the use of LIT in RIF patients.","Cavalcante, Marcelo Borges; Sarno, Manoel; Barini, Ricardo",Am J Reprod Immunol,,491

382059,The Importance of Vaginal Natural Orifice Surgeries in the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Viral dysregulation or suppression of innate immune responses is a key determinant of virus-induced pathogenesis. Important sensors for the detection of virus infection are the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which, in turn, are antagonized by many RNA viruses and DNA viruses. Among the different escape strategies are viral mechanisms to dysregulate the post-translational modifications (PTMs) that play pivotal roles in RLR regulation. In this review, we present the current knowledge of immune evasion by viral pathogens that manipulate ubiquitin- or ISG15-dependent mechanisms of RLR activation. Key viral strategies to evade RLR signaling include direct targeting of ubiquitin E3 ligases, active deubiquitination using viral deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), and the upregulation of cellular DUBs that regulate RLR signaling. Additionally, we summarize emerging new evidence that shows that enzymes of certain coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, actively deISGylate key molecules in the RLR pathway to escape type I interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses. Finally, we discuss the possibility of targeting virally-encoded proteins that manipulate ubiquitin- or ISG15-mediated innate immune responses for the development of new antivirals and vaccines.","Chiang, Cindy; Liu, Guanqun; Gack, Michaela U",Viruses,,491

The symptoms vary from person to person and many are ""hidden carriers."" Few people experience immediate reaction and even death within 48 h of infection. However, many show mild to chronic symptoms and recover. Nevertheless, the death rate due to COVID-19 transmission is high especially among patients with non-communicable diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide evidence to consider vitamins as epigenetic modifiers to enhance immunity and reduce inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients with non-communicable diseases. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical evidence has suggested the risk of getting infected is high among individuals with non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, cancer, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and renal disease, as well as the elderly with high mortality rate among the cohort. The impact is due to an already compromised immune system of patients. Every patient has a different response to COVID-19, which shows that the ability to combat the deadly virus varies individually. Thus, treatment can be personalized and adjusted to help protect and combat COVID-19 infections, especially in individuals with non-communicable diseases. Based on current published scientific and medical evidence, the suggestions made in this article for combination of vitamin therapy as epigenetic modifiers to control the unregulated inflammatory and cytokine marker expressions, further needs to be clinically proven. Future research and clinical trials can apply the suggestions given in this article to support metabolic activities in patients and enhance the immune response.","Singh, Varsha",Curr Nutr Rep,,491

Our docking and molecular dynamic simulations show that the affinity of the spike protein from the wild type (WT) and the South African B.1.351 (SA) variant towards the MAO enzymes is comparable to that for its ACE2 receptor. This allows for the WT/SA...MAO complex formation, which changes MAO affinities for their neurotransmitter substrates, thus consequently impacting the rates of their metabolic conversion and misbalancing their levels. Knowing that this fine regulation is strongly linked with the etiology of various brain pathologies, these results are the first to highlight the possibility that the interference with the brain MAO catalytic activity is responsible for the increased neurodegenerative illnesses following a COVID-19 infection, thus placing a neurobiological link between these two conditions in the spotlight. Since the obtained insight suggests that a more contagious SA variant causes even larger disturbances, and with new and more problematic strains likely emerging in the near future, we firmly advise that the presented prospect of the SARS-CoV-2 induced neurological complications should not be ignored, but rather requires further clinical investigations to achieve an early diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions.

386870,"Online Learning, Educational Neuroscience and Knowledge Transformation Opportunities for Secondary Education Students",2021,"Biomaterial design relies on controlling interactions between materials and their biological environments to modulate the functions of proteins, cells, and tissues. Phage display is a powerful tool that can be used to discover peptide sequences with high affinity for a desired target. When incorporated into biomaterial design, peptides identified via phage display can functionalize material surfaces to control the interaction between a biomaterial and its local microenvironment. A targeting peptide has high specificity for a given target, allowing for homing a specific protein, cell, tissue, or other material to a biomaterial. A functional peptide has an affinity for a given protein, cell, or tissue, but also modulates its target's activity upon binding. Biomaterials can be further enhanced using a combination of targeting and/or functional peptides to create dual-functional peptides for bridging two targets or modulating the behavior of a specific protein or cell. This review will examine current and future applications of phage display for the augmentation of biomaterials.","Davidson, Thomas A; McGoldrick, Samantha J; Kohn, David H",,,491

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, qualitative research study designed to investigate strategies used by health system leaders from around the world when mobilizing human resources in response to the global COVD-19 pandemic. Prospective interviewees were identified through nonprobability and purposive sampling methods from May to July 2020. The primary outcomes were the critical considerations, as perceived by health system leaders, when redeploying health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic determined through thematic analysis of transcribed notes. Redeployment was defined as reassigning personnel to a different location or retraining personnel for a different task. RESULTS: Nine hospital leaders from 9 hospitals in 8 health systems located in 5 countries (United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea) were interviewed. Six hospitals in 5 health systems experienced a surge of critically ill patients with COVID-19, and the remaining 3 hospitals anticipated, but did not experience, a similar surge. Seven of 8 hospitals redeployed their health care workforce, and 1 had a redeployment plan in place but did not need to use it. Thematic analysis of the interview notes identified 3 themes representing effective practices and lessons learned when preparing and executing workforce redeployment: process, leadership, and communication. Critical considerations within each theme were identified. Because of the various expertise of redeployed personnel, retraining had to be customized and a decentralized flexible strategy was implemented. There were 3 concerns regarding redeployed personnel. These included the fear of becoming infected, the concern over their skills and patient safety, and concerns regarding professional loss (such as loss of education opportunities in their chosen profession). Transparency via multiple different types of communications is important to prevent the development of doubt and rumors. CONCLUSIONS: Redeployment strategies should critically consider the process of redeploying and supporting the health care workforce, decentralized leadership that encourages and supports local implementation of system-wide plans, and communication that is transparent, regular, consistent, and informed by data.","Panda, Nikhil; Sinyard, Robert D; Henrich, Natalie; Cauley, Christy E; Hannenberg, Alexander A; Sonnay, Yves; Bitton, Asaf; Brindle, Mary; Molina, George",J Patient Saf,,491

Here, we speculate that the robust disease resistance of most individuals is due to a swift production of type I interferon (IFN&#945;/ß), presumably sufficient to lower the viremia. A minority of infected individuals with a preexisting chronic inflammatory state fail to mount this early efficient response, leading to a delayed harmful inflammatory response. To improve the epidemiological scenario, we propose combining: (i) the development of efficient antivirals administered early enough to assist in the production of endogenous IFN&#945;/ß; (ii) potentiating early IFN responses; (iii) administering anti-inflammatory treatments when needed, but not too early to interfere with endogenous antiviral responses.","Feuillet, Vincent; Canard, Bruno; Trautmann, Alain",Trends immunol,,491

389902,The Bad and the Great: Another COVID Semester,2020,"Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which are growing at a frightening rate worldwide, has put the world on a long-standing alert. The COVID-19 health crisis reinforced the pressing need to address a fast-developing pandemic. To mitigate these health emergencies and prevent economic collapse, cheap, practical, and easily applicable infection control techniques are essential worldwide. Application of light in the form of photodynamic action on microorganisms and viruses has been growing and is now successfully applied in several areas. The efficacy of this approach has been demonstrated in the fight against viruses, prompting additional efforts to advance the technique, including safety use protocols. In particular, its application to suppress respiratory tract infections and to provide decontamination of fluids, such as blood plasma and others, can become an inexpensive alternative strategy in the fight against viral and bacterial infections. Diverse early treatment methods based on photodynamic action enable an accelerated response to emerging threats prior to the availability of preventative drugs. In this review, we evaluate a vast number of photodynamic demonstrations and first-principle proofs carried out on viral control, revealing its potential and encouraging its rapid development toward safe clinical practice. This review highlights the main research trends and, as a futuristic exercise, anticipates potential situations where photodynamic treatment can provide a readily available solution.","Willis, J.

390432,“Am I Doing Enough?” Special Educators’ Experiences with Emergency Remote Teaching in Spring 2020,2020,"Currently available evidence supports that the predominant route of human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is through respiratory droplets. Indirect hands contact with surfaces contaminated by infectious droplets subsequently touching the mouth, nose or eyes seems to be another route of an indirect contact transmission. Persistence of the virus on different surfaces and other materials has been reported in recent studies: SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard. Viable virus was detected up to 72 h after application to different surfaces, although infectivity decay was also observed. This evidence suggests the likelihood that waste generated from patients affected by COVID-19 or subjects in quarantine treated in private houses or in areas different from hospitals and medical centres could be contaminated by SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, waste streams may represent a route for viral spreading being a potential risk also for the operators directly involved in the different phases of waste management. To address this concern, a specific multidisciplinary working group was settled by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) during the COVID-19 emergency, in order to establish guidelines related to solid waste collection, delivering, withdrawal, transport, treatment and disposal. Temporary stop of waste sorting, instructions for the population on how to package waste, instructions for Companies and operators for the adoption of adequate personal protection equipment (PPE), the use and sanitation of proper vehicles were among the main recommendations provided to the community by publications of freely downloadable reports and infographics in layman language. Incineration, sterilization and properly managed landfills were identified as the facilities to be preferentially adopted for the treatment of this kind of waste, considering the main inactivation strategies of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. treatment length > 9 days and temperature > 70 °C for more than 5 min).","Di Maria, Francesco; Beccaloni, Eleonora; Bonadonna, Lucia; Cini, Carla; Confalonieri, Elisabetta; La Rosa, Giuseppina; Milana, Maria Rosaria; Testai, Emanuela; Scaini, Federica",Sci Total Environ,,491

Type of internet use (for communication, information search) was also analysed amongst frequent users. Significant effects of frequency of use were observed (p = 0.01 for depression, p &lt; 0.001 for QoL), with lower depression symptoms and higher QoL scores amongst more frequent users. Regarding purpose of use, those who reported using the internet for communication purposes had higher QoL. However, use for health-related or Government services information searching was associated with more depression symptoms. Results provide important information regarding the potential benefits of internet use for middle-aged and older people, suggesting that strategies to increase internet usage (particularly for communication) might benefit middle-aged and older adults' mental health and counter isolation as the coronavirus crisis continues to evolve.","Wallinheimo, A.

393246,"Post-coronavirus civil justice, from the crisis to some of the reforms envisaged",2020,"The conservation of crop genetic resources, including their wild relatives, is of utmost importance for the future of mankind. Most crops produce orthodox seeds and can, therefore, be stored in seed genebanks. However, this is not an option for crops and species that produce recalcitrant (non-storable) seeds such as cacao, coffee and avocado, for crops that do not produce seeds at all; therefore, they are inevitably vegetatively propagated such as bananas, or crops that are predominantly clonally propagated as their seeds are not true to type, such as potato, cassava and many fruit trees. Field, in vitro and cryopreserved collections provide an alternative in such cases. In this paper, an overview is given on how to manage and setup a field, in vitro and cryopreserved collections, as well as advantages and associated problems taking into account the practical, financial and safety issues in the long-term. In addition, the need for identification of unique accessions and elimination of duplicates is discussed. The different conservation methods are illustrated with practical examples and experiences from national and international genebanks. Finally, the importance of establishing safe and long-term conservation methods and associated backup possibilities is highlighted in the frame of the global COVID-19 pandemic.","Panis, Bart; Nagel, Manuela; Van den Houwe, Ines",,,491

Here, we developed a trimeric SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) subunit vaccine candidate that simulates the natural structure of the spike (S) trimer glycoprotein. Immunization with the RBD-trimer induced robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and a high level of neutralizing antibodies was maintained for at least 4.5 months. Moreover, the antibodies that were produced in response to the vaccine effectively cross-neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 variant (B.1.351). Of note, when the vaccine-induced antibodies dropped to a sufficiently low level, only one boost quickly activated the anamnestic immune response, conferring full protection against a SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques without typical histopathological changes in the lung tissues. These results demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-trimer vaccine candidate is highly immunogenic and safe, providing long-lasting, broad, and significant immunity protection in nonhuman primates, thereby offering an optimal vaccination strategy against COVID-19.","Yang, Limin; Tian, Deyu; Han, Jian-Bao; Fan, Wenhui; Zhang, Yuan; Li, Yunlong; Sun, Wenqiang; Wei, Yanqiu; Tian, Xiaodong; Yu, Dan-Dan; Feng, Xiao-Li; Cheng, Gong; Bi, Yuhai; Zheng, Yong-Tang; Liu, Wenjun",Innovation (N Y),,491

Since then, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been incorporated as part of the standard treatment algorithm in many centers for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 in early 2020, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been used effectively as rescue therapy and as a bridge to recovery in some patients with refractory respiratory failure. DESIGN SUBJECT AND INTERVENTION: We present a 38-year-old male healthcare worker diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 and progressed to critical condition with severe surgical emphysema on a high-flow nasal cannula with Fio2 100%, a flow of 40 L/min, and a maximum oxygen saturation of 88%. He was successfully treated by applying awake extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, without a need for invasive mechanical ventilation, to avoid worsening barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise potentially induced by positive pressure ventilation.

404000,The role of disaggregated search data in improving tourism forecasts: Evidence from Sri Lanka,2020,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic. The proportion of infected individuals who seroconvert is still an open question. In addition, it has been shown in some individuals that viral genome can be detected up to 3 months after symptom resolution. We investigated both seroconversion and PCR positivity in a large cohort of convalescent serum donors in the New York City (NY, USA) region. Methods: In this observational study, we ran an outreach programme in the New York City area. We recruited participants via the REDCap (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA) online survey response. Individuals with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened via PCR for presence of viral genome and via ELISA for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies. One-way ANOVA and Fisher's exact test were used to measure the association of age, gender, symptom duration, and days from symptom onset and resolution with positive antibody results. Findings: Between March 26 and April 10, 2020, we measured SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres in 1343 people. Of the 624 participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had serologies done after 4 weeks, all but three seroconverted to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, whereas 269 (37%) of 719 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection seroconverted. PCR positivity was detected up to 28 days from symptom resolution. Interpretation: Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 seroconvert, potentially providing immunity to reinfection. We also report that in a large proportion of individuals, viral genome can be detected via PCR in the upper respiratory tract for weeks after symptom resolution, but it is unclear whether this signal represents infectious virus. Analysis of our large cohort suggests that most patients with mild COVID-19 seroconvert 4 weeks after illness, and raises questions about the use of PCR to clear positive individuals.

404251,Strategi guru untuk menjaga karakter siswa selama belajar di rumah,2021,"WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in the world. Due to its popularity, WhatsApp has become a powerful and cheap tool for political campaigning being widely used during the 2019 Indian general election, where it was used to connect to the voters on a large scale. Along with the campaigning, there have been reports that WhatsApp has also become a breeding ground for harmful speech against various protected groups and religious minorities. Many such messages attempt to instil fear among the population about a specific (minority) community. According to research on inter-group conflict, such `fear speech' messages could have a lasting impact and might lead to real offline violence. In this paper, we perform the first large scale study on fear speech across thousands of public WhatsApp groups discussing politics in India. We curate a new dataset and try to characterize fear speech from this dataset. We observe that users writing fear speech messages use various events and symbols to create the illusion of fear among the reader about a target community. We build models to classify fear speech and observe that current state-of-the-art NLP models do not perform well at this task. Fear speech messages tend to spread faster and could potentially go undetected by classifiers built to detect traditional toxic speech due to their low toxic nature. Finally, using a novel methodology to target users with Facebook ads, we conduct a survey among the users of these WhatsApp groups to understand the types of users who consume and share fear speech. We believe that this work opens up new research questions that are very different from tackling hate speech which the research community has been traditionally involved in.","Saha, Punyajoy; Mathew, Binny; Garimella, Kiran; Mukherjee, Animesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03870v1.pdf,491

Methods: A real-time internet-based survey endorsed by the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiologists (AEPC) Working Groups for Cardiac Imaging and Cardiovascular Intensive Care. Inclusion criteria was children 0-18 years admitted to hospital between February 1 and June 6, 2020 with diagnosis of an inflammatory syndrome and acute cardiovascular complications. Results: A total of 286 children from 55 centers in 17 European countries were included. The median age was 8.4 years (IQR 3.8-12.4 years) and 67% were males. The most common cardiovascular complications were shock, cardiac arrhythmias, pericardial effusion and coronary artery dilatation. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction was present in over half of the patients and a vast majority of children had raised cardiac troponin (cTnT) when checked. The biochemical markers of inflammation were raised in majority of patients on admission: elevated CRP, serum ferritin, procalcitonin, NT-proBNP, IL-6 level and D-dimers. There was a statistically significant correlation between degree of elevation in cardiac and biochemical parameters and need for intensive care support (p <0.05). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 33.6% while IgM and IgG antibodies were positive in 15.7% and IgG 43.6 % cases, respectively when checked. One child died in the study cohort. Conclusions: Cardiac involvement is common in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with Covid-19 pandemic. A majority of children have significantly raised levels of NT pro-BNP, ferritin, D-dimers and cardiac troponin in addition to high CRP and procalcitonin levels. Compared to adults with Covid-19, mortality in children with MIS-C is uncommon despite multi-system involvement, very elevated inflammatory markers and need for intensive care support.","Valverde, Israel; Singh, Yogen; Sanchez-de-Toledo, Joan; Theocharis, Paraskevi; Chikermane, Ashish; Di Filippo, Sylvie; Kucinska, Beata; Mannarino, Savina; Tamariz-Martel, Amalia; Gutierrez-Larraya, Federico; Soda, Giridhar; Vandekerckhove, Kristof; Gonzalez Barlatey, Francisco; McMahon, Colin Joseph; Marcora, Simona Anna; Pace Napoleone, Carlo; Duong, Phuoc; Tuo, Giulia; Deri, Antigoni; Nepali, Gauri; Ilina, Maria; Ciliberti, Paolo; Miller, Owen",Circulation,,491

However, the true burden of systemic coagulopathy in COVID-19 remains unknown. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we performed a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database to identify studies that reported the prevalence of systemic coagulopathy using established criteria in patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome was the prevalence of systemic coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC] and/or sepsis-induced coagulopathy [SIC]). Pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals [CIs] were calculated using random-effects model. A total of 5 studies including 1210 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. The pooled prevalence of systemic coagulopathy was 7.1% (95%CI: 3.2%,15.3%, I2 = 93%). The pooled prevalence of DIC (N = 721) and SIC (N = 639) were 4.3% (95%CI 1.7%, 10.4%, I2 = 84%) and 16.2% (95%CI: 9.3%, 26.8%, I2 = 74%), respectively. Only 2 studies reported the prevalence of elevated D-dimer levels with the pooled prevalence of 84.6% (95%CI: 52.0%,96.5%, I2 = 94%). Average D-dimer and fibrinogen levels were remarkably increased, while platelet counts, PT, and aPTT ratios were minimally affected in COVID-19. The estimated prevalence of systemic coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 was low despite D-dimer elevation in most patients. Relatively low systemic coagulopathy in COVID-19 may contribute to the high incidence of thrombosis rather than bleeding in patients with COVID-19.","Uaprasert, Noppacharn; Moonla, Chatphatai; Sosothikul, Darintr; Rojnuckarin, Ponlapat; Chiasakul, Thita",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,,491

409923,Good bye to the free circulation of foreign investments only in times of coronavirus?,2020,"Inside all smart devices, such as smartphones or smartwatches, there are thermally sensitive resistors known as thermistors which are used to monitor the temperature of the device. These thermistors are sensitive to temperature changes near their location on-device. While they are designed to measure the temperature of the device components such as the battery, they can also sense changes in the temperature of the ambient environment or thermal entities in contact with the device. We have developed a model to estimate core body temperature from signals sensed by these thermistors during a user interaction in which the user places the capacitive touchscreen of a smart device against a thermal site on their body such as their forehead. During the interaction, the device logs the temperature sensed by the thermistors as well as the raw capacitance seen by the touch screen to capture features describing the rate of heat transfer from the body to the device and device-to-skin contact respectively. These temperature and contact features are then used to model the rate of heat transferred from the user's body to the device and thus core-body temperature of the user for ubiquitous and accessible fever monitoring using only a smart device. We validate this system in a lab environment on a simulated skin-like heat source with a temperature estimate mean absolute error of 0.743$^{\circ}$F (roughly 0.4$^{\circ}$C) and limit of agreement of $\pm2.374^{\circ}$F (roughly 1.3$^{\circ}$C) which is comparable to some off-the-shelf peripheral and tympanic thermometers. We found a Pearson's correlation $R^2$ of 0.837 between ground truth temperature and temperature estimated by our system. We also deploy this system in an ongoing clinical study on a population of 7 participants in a clinical environment to show the similarity between simulated and clinical trials.","Breda, Joseph; Patel, Shwetak",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11855v1.pdf,491

410624,The impacts of COVID-19 measures on global environment and fertility rate: double coincidence,2020,"Importance: Stay-at-home policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt adolescents' substance use and physical activity. Objective: To compare adolescents' substance use and physical activity behaviors before and after stay-at-home restrictions. Design, Setting, and Participants: Ongoing prospective cohort study of tobacco use behaviors among ninth- and tenth-grade students enrolled at 8 public high schools in Northern California from March 2019 to February 2020 and followed up from September 2019 to September 2020. Race/ethnicity was self-classified from investigator-provided categories and collected owing to racial/ethnic differences in tobacco and substance use. Exposures: In California, a COVID-19 statewide stay-at-home order was imposed March 19, 2020. In this study, 521 six-month follow-up responses were completed before the order and 485 were completed after the order. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of substance use (ie, past 30-day use of e-cigarettes, other tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol) and physical activity (active &#8805;5 days/week) was compared at baseline and follow-up. A difference-in-difference approach was used to assess whether changes from baseline to 6-month follow-up varied if follow-up occurred after the stay-at-home order, adjusting for baseline behaviors and characteristics. All models were weighted for losses to follow-up using the inverse probability method. Weights were derived from a logistic regression model for having a follow-up response (dependent variable), as predicted by baseline characteristics and behaviors. Results: Of 1423 adolescents enrolled at baseline, 1006 completed 6-month follow-up (623 [62%] were female, and 492 [49%] were non-Hispanic White). e-Cigarette use declined from baseline to 6-month follow-up completed before the stay-at-home order (17.3% [89 of 515] to 11.3% [58 of 515]; McNemar &#967;2 = 13.54; exact P < .001) and 6-month follow-up completed after the stay-at-home order (19.9% [96 of 482] to 10.8% [52 of 482]; McNemar &#967;2 = 26.16; exact P < .001), but the extent of decline did not differ statistically between groups responding before vs after the stay-at-home order (difference-in-difference adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.47-1.52; P = .58). In contrast, being physically active was unchanged from baseline if follow-up was before the order (53.7% [279 of 520] to 52.9% [275 of 520]; McNemar &#967;2 = 0.09; exact P = .82) but declined sharply from baseline if follow-up was after the order (54.0% [261 of 483] to 38.1% [184 of 483]; McNemar &#967;2 = 30.72; exact P < .001), indicating a pronounced difference in change from baseline after the stay-at-home order (difference-in-difference adjusted odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69; P < .001). Overall in the cohort, reported use of other tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol did not differ meaningfully before and after the order. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort, a reduction in e-cigarette use occurred independently of COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions, but persistent cannabis and alcohol use suggest continued need for youth substance use prevention and cessation support. Declining physical activity during the pandemic is a health concern.","Chaffee, Benjamin W; Cheng, Jing; Couch, Elizabeth T; Hoeft, Kristin S; Halpern-Felsher, Bonnie",JAMA Pediatr,,491

The aim of this work was to study characteristics, cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and a prior diagnosis of heart failure (HF). Further aims included the identification of predictors and prognostic implications for AHF decompensation during hospital admission and the determination of a potential correlation between the withdrawal of HF guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and worse outcomes during hospitalization. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data for a total of 3080 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and follow-up of at least 30 days were analysed. Patients with a previous history of CHF (n = 152, 4.9%) were more prone to the development of AHF (11.2% vs. 2.1%; P < 0.001) and had higher levels of N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide. In addition, patients with previous CHF had higher mortality rates (48.7% vs. 19.0%; P < 0.001). In contrast, 77 patients (2.5%) were diagnosed with AHF, which in the vast majority of cases (77.9%) developed in patients without a history of HF. Arrhythmias during hospital admission and CHF were the main predictors of AHF. Patients developing AHF had significantly higher mortality (46.8% vs. 19.7%; P < 0.001). Finally, the withdrawal of beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers was associated with a significant increase in in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 have a significant incidence of AHF, which is associated with very high mortality rates. Moreover, patients with a history of CHF are prone to developing acute decompensation after a COVID-19 diagnosis. The withdrawal of GDMT was associated with higher mortality.","Rey, Juan R; Caro-Codón, Juan; Rosillo, Sandra O; Iniesta, Ángel M; Castrejón-Castrejón, Sergio; Marco-Clement, Irene; Martín-Polo, Lorena; Merino-Argos, Carlos; Rodríguez-Sotelo, Laura; García-Veas, Jose M; Martínez-Marín, Luis A; Martínez-Cossiani, Marcel; Buño, Antonio; Gonzalez-Valle, Luis; Herrero, Alicia; López-Sendón, José L; Merino, José L",Eur. j. heart fail,,491

412910,Comparison of Online to Face-To-Face Instruction for Anatomy Review in a Third-Year Clinical Course,2021,"Pictorial cues generally produce stronger search performance relative to categorical cues. We asked how universal is the benefit of a pictorial cue? To test this, we trained observers to categorize sinusoidal gratings in which categories were distinguished by spatial frequency or orientation. Next, participants completed a search task in which targets were pictorially and categorically cued. Measures of target and distractor processing that primarily rely on foveal processing showed universal benefits; however, the benefit was larger in the orientation condition. Importantly, an index of the direction of spatial attention (i.e., target guidance) showed that the orientation condition produced a pictorial benefit but the spatial frequency condition did not. Experiment 2 replicated the spatial frequency results and also included conditions that increased the discriminability, lowered the spatial frequencies, or both increased the discriminability and decreased the spatial frequencies of the categories. We found that only categories utilizing lower spatial frequencies produced a pictorial guidance benefit. This demonstrates that pictorial cues do not universally improve search performance above categorical cues; it depends on the features that distinguish the categories. Additionally, the increased discriminability condition improved guidance but failed to produce a pictorial benefit, suggesting an interesting disassociation between the amount of target guidance and the existence of a pictorial benefit. Given that perception is known to progress from low/coarse to high/fine spatial frequencies, this suggests that the pictorial guidance benefit acts on early low-spatial frequency processing only, but foveal object recognition processes utilize both early and late spatial frequency processing.","Ercolino, Ashley M; Patel, Pooja; Bohil, Corey; Neider, Mark B; Schmidt, Joseph",Atten. percept. psychophys.

413013,Contractual business networks and pandemic: A forward-looking agenda?,2020,"Boffito et al. recalled the critical importance to correctly interpret protein binding. Changes of lopinavir pharmacokinetics in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are a perfect illustration. Indeed, several studies described that total lopinavir plasma concentrations were considerably higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than those reported in patients with HIV. These findings have led to a reduction of the dose of lopinavir in some patients, hypothesizing an inhibitory effect of inflammation on lopinavir metabolism. Unfortunately, changes in plasma protein binding were never investigated. We performed a retrospective cohort study. Data were collected from the medical records of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 treated with lopinavir/ritonavir in intensive care units or infectious disease departments of Toulouse University Hospital (France). Total and unbound concentrations of lopinavir, C reactive protein, albumin, and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) levels were measured during routine care on the same samples. In patients with COVID-19, increased total lopinavir concentration is the result of an increased AAG-bound lopinavir concentration, whereas the unbound concentration remains constant, and insufficient to reduce the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load. Although international guidelines have recently recommended against using lopinavir/ritonavir to treat severe COVID-19, the description of lopinavir pharmacokinetics changes in COVID-19 is a textbook case of the high risk of misinterpretation of a total drug exposure when changes in protein binding are not taken into consideration.","Stanke-Labesque, Francoise; Concordet, Didier; Djerada, Zoubir; Bouchet, Stéphane; Solas, Caroline; Mériglier, Etienne; Bonnet, Fabrice; Mourvillier, Bruno; Ruiz, Stéphanie; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Epaulard, Olivier; Schwebel, Carole; Gautier-Veyret, Elodie; Gandia, Peggy",Clin Pharmacol Ther,,491

The aim of this scoping review is therefore to identify available guidelines, consensus statements, the standard of practice, and practice recommendations on reproductive health service provision during the COVID-19 pandemics. METHODS: We searched guideline databases and websites of professional associations and international organizations working on sexual and reproductive health. We looked for practice recommendations on sexual reproductive health services (SRH) during COVID-19 pandemics. Additionally, we searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Data extraction was done by two independent reviewers using a customized tool that was developed to record the key information of the source that's relevant to the review question. The difference between the two authors on data extraction was resolved by discussion. RESULTS: A total of 21 records were included in the review. Identified recommendations were classified into thematic areas. The records addressed approaches to antenatal care, labour and delivery, postnatal care, safe abortion, contraception, gender-based violence, and artificial reproduction. CONCLUSIONS: There were consistent consensus statements and recommendations that there should be access to sexual and reproductive health services like antenatal care (ANC), postnatal care (PNC), contraception service, safe abortion care, and clinical management of rape survivors during the COVID-19 pandemics with the concerted effort of service re-organization. The practice recommendations focus on innovative ways of service provision to minimize patient and staff exposure to COVID-19 as well as alleviate the burden on the health care system. These include utilizing telemedicine and community/home-based care or self-care.","Tolu, Lemi Belay; Feyissa, Garumma Tolu; Jeldu, Wondimu Gudu",BMC Public Health,,491

414855,A case of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis following vaccination against Covid-19,2021,"Background: The COVID­19 pandemic and associated public health measures have disrupted the lives of people around the world. It is already evident that the direct and indirect psychological and social effects of the COVID­19 pandemic are insidious and affect the mental health of young children and adolescents now and will in the future. The aim and objectives of this knowledge-synthesis study were to identify the impact of the pandemic on children's and adolescent's mental health and to evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions employed during previous and the current pandemic to promote children's and adolescents' mental health. Methodology: We conducted the systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included experimental randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, observational studies, and qualitative studies. Results: Of the 5828 articles that we retrieved, 18 articles met the inclusion criteria. We thematically analyzed them and put the major findings under the thematic areas of impact of the pandemic on children's and adolescents' mental health. These studies reported that pandemics cause stress, worry, helplessness, and social and risky behavioral problems among children and adolescents (e.g., substance abuse, suicide, relationship problems, academic issues, and absenteeism from work). Interventions such as art-based programs, support services, and clinician-led mental health and psychosocial services effectively decrease mental health issues among children and adolescents. Conclusion: Children and adolescents are more likely to experience high rates of depression and anxiety during and after a pandemic. It is critical that future researchers explore effective mental health strategies that are tailored to the needs of children and adolescents. Explorations of effective channels regarding the development and delivery of evidenced-based, age-appropriate services are vital to lessen the effects and improve long-term capacities for mental health services for children and adolescents. Key Practitioner Message: The COVID-19 pandemic's physical restrictions and social distancing measures have affected each and every domain of life. Although the number of children and adolescents affected by the disease is small, the disease and the containment measures such as social distancing, school closure, and isolation have negatively impacted the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents. The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children and adolescents is of great concern. Anxiety, depression, disturbances in sleep and appetite, as well as impairment in social interactions are the most common presentations. It has been indicated that compared to adults, this pandemic may continue to have increased long term adverse consequences on children's and adolescents' mental health. As the pandemic continues, it is important to monitor the impact on children's and adolescents' mental health status and how to help them to improve their mental health outcomes in the time of the current or future pandemics.","Meherali, Salima; Punjani, Neelam; Louie-Poon, Samantha; Abdul Rahim, Komal; Das, Jai K; Salam, Rehana A; Lassi, Zohra S",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,491

Offices and emergency departments (EDs) were the first responders to the pandemic, followed by medical wards and intensive care unit (ICUs). Worldwide efforts sprouted to coordinate proper response by increasing surge capacity and optimizing diagnosis and containment. Within the complex scenario of the outbreak, the medical community shared scientific research and implemented best-guess imaging strategies in order to save time and additional staff exposures. Early publications showed agreement between chest computed tomography (CT) and lung sonography: widespread ground-glass findings resembling acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on CT of COVID-19 patients matched lung ultrasound signs and patterns. Well-established accuracy of bedside sonography for lung conditions and its advantages (such as no ionizing radiation; low-cost, real-time bedside imaging; and easier disinfection steps) prompted a wider adoption of lung ultrasound for daily assessment and monitoring of COVID-19 patients. Growing literature, webinars, online materials, and international networks are promoting lung ultrasound for the same purpose. We propose 11 lung ultrasound roles for different medical settings during the pandemic, starting from the out-of-hospital setting, where lung ultrasound has ergonomic and infection control advantages. Then we describe how medical wards and ICUs can safely integrate lung ultrasound into COVID-19 care pathways. Finally, we present outpatient use of lung ultrasound to aid follow-up of positive case contacts and of those discharged from the hospital.","Boero, Enrico; Schreiber, Annia; Rovida, Serena; Vetrugno, Luigi; Blaivas, Michael",,,491

This paper examines the relative perceptions of the severity of COVID-19 and HIV among a sample of U.S. gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSMs). The ""Love and Sex in the Time of COVID-19"" survey was conducted online from April 2020 to May 2020. GBMSMs were recruited through paid banner advertisements featured on social networking platforms, resulting in a sample size of 696. The analysis considers differences in responses to two scales: the Perceived Severity of HIV Infection and the Perceived Severity of COVID-19 Infection. Participants perceived greater seriousness for HIV infection (mean 46.67, range 17-65) than for COVID-19 infection (mean 38.81, range 13-62). Some items reflecting more proximal impacts of infection (anxiety, loss of sleep, and impact on employment) were similar for HIV and COVID-19. Those aged over 25 and those who perceived higher prevalence of COVID-19 in the United States or their state were more likely to report COVID-19 as more severe than HIV. There is a need to develop nuanced public health messages for GBMSMs that convey the ongoing simultaneous health threats of both HIV and COVID-19.","Stephenson, Rob; Chavanduka, Tanaka M D; Rosso, Matthew T; Sullivan, Stephen P; Pitter, Renée A; Hunter, Alexis S; Rogers, Erin",Am J Mens Health,,491

Clinical characteristics and follow-up data of MIS-C in infants have not been well described. We sought to describe the clinical course, laboratory findings, therapeutics and outcomes among infants diagnosed with MIS-C. METHODS: Infants of age <12 months with MIS-C were identified by reports to the CDC's MIS-C national surveillance system. Data were obtained on clinical signs and symptoms, complications, treatment, laboratory and imaging findings, and diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing. Jurisdictions that reported 2 or more infants were approached to participate in evaluation of outcomes of MIS-C. RESULTS: Eighty-five infants with MIS-C were identified and 83 (97.6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection; median age was 7.7 months. Rash (62.4%), diarrhea (55.3%) and vomiting (55.3%) were the most common signs and symptoms reported. Other clinical findings included hypotension (21.2%), pneumonia (21.2%) and coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm (13.9%). Laboratory abnormalities included elevated C-reactive protein, ferritin, d-dimer and fibrinogen.

Herein, we study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on endoscopic surveillance in Lynch syndrome through a prospective study of patients with Lynch syndrome at a tertiary referral center who were scheduled for endoscopic surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown between March 16, 2020 and June 4, 2020. Of our cohort of 302 individuals with Lynch syndrome, 34 (11%) had endoscopic procedures scheduled during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. Of the 27 patients whose endoscopic surveillance was canceled during this period, 85% rescheduled procedures within 6 months with a median delay of 72 days [interquartile range (IQR), 55-84 days], with identification of an advanced adenoma or gastrointestinal cancer in 13%. Individuals who did not have a rescheduled endoscopic procedure were significantly younger than those with a rescheduled procedure [age 35 (IQR, 26-43) vs. age 55 (IQR, 43-63), P = 0.018]. Male sex was also suggestive of increasing likelihood of not having a rescheduled procedure. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown led to delayed endoscopic surveillance in Lynch syndrome, with potentially impactful delays among young patients. These data also emphasize the importance of timely surveillance in Lynch syndrome during this current, as well as potential future, global pandemics. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented disruptions in cancer screening, which may have disproportionate effects on individuals at increased cancer risk, including those with Lynch syndrome.

It has also increased the suicide rate in vulnerable groups who cannot handle the social and psychological consequences of the pandemic and the measures in place to halt it. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we compared the lethality of suicide attempts and the methods chosen between the three months before the COVID-19 pandemic and three months during curfew and lockdown in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This is a retrospective, causal-comparative study conducted at King Saud Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 62 suicide attempt cases between January 2020 and June 2020 were included in this study. The scale for assessment of the lethality of suicide attempts (SALSA) was used for comparison, and cross-tabulation was used for the data of suicide methods. RESULTS: There was a significant difference (P = 0.003) in the total SALSA score before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. The scores of lethality of suicide attempts were high during the lockdown. No significant difference was found in the suicide methods selected between the two time periods. However, the use of psychotropic medication overdose and self-immolation were prominent during the lockdown period. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely associated with increased lethality of suicide attempts as well as an increased suicide rate.

421163,The practicum in times of Covid-19: Knowledge developed by future physical education teachers in virtual modality,2021,"The onset of coronavirus pandemic has sparked a shortage of facemasks in almost all nations. Without this personal protective equipment, healthcare providers, essential workers, and the general public are exposed to the risk of infection. In light of the aforementioned, it is critical to balance the supply and demand for masks. COVID-19 will also ensure that masks are always considered as an essential commodity in future pandemic preparedness. Moreover, billions of facemasks are produced from petrochemicals derived raw materials, which are non-degradable upon disposal after their single use, thus causing environmental pollution and damage. The sustainable way forward is to utilise raw materials that are side-stream products of local industries to develop facemasks having equal or better efficiency than the conventional ones. In this regard, wheat gluten biopolymer, which is a by-product or co-product of cereal industries, can be electrospun into nanofibre membranes and subsequently carbonised at over 700 °C to form a network structure, which can simultaneously act as the filter media and reinforcement for gluten-based masks.

421164,The practicum in times of Covid-19: Knowledge developed by future physical education teachers in virtual modality,2021,"The onset of coronavirus pandemic has sparked a shortage of facemasks in almost all nations. Without this personal protective equipment, healthcare providers, essential workers, and the general public are exposed to the risk of infection. In light of the aforementioned, it is critical to balance the supply and demand for masks. COVID-19 will also ensure that masks are always considered as an essential commodity in future pandemic preparedness. Moreover, billions of facemasks are produced from petrochemicals derived raw materials, which are non-degradable upon disposal after their single use, thus causing environmental pollution and damage. The sustainable way forward is to utilise raw materials that are side-stream products of local industries to develop facemasks having equal or better efficiency than the conventional ones. In this regard, wheat gluten biopolymer, which is a by-product or co-product of cereal industries, can be electrospun into nanofibre membranes and subsequently carbonised at over 700 °C to form a network structure, which can simultaneously act as the filter media and reinforcement for gluten-based masks. In parallel, the same gluten material can be processed into cohesive thin films using plasticiser and hot press. Additionally, lanosol, a naturally-occurring substance, imparts fire (V-0 rating in vertical burn test), and microbe resistance in gluten plastics.

The push toward remote learning by necessity may now become the new future education model,2021,"The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the prime target for vaccine development. The spike protein mediates both binding to host cells and membrane fusion and is also so far the only known viral target of neutralizing antibodies. Coronavirus spike proteins are large trimers that are relatively unstable, a feature that might be enhanced by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike. Exchange of K986 and V987 for prolines has been shown to stabilize the trimers of SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike proteins. Here, we test multiple versions of a soluble spike protein for their immunogenicity and protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a mouse model that transiently expresses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 via adenovirus transduction. Variants tested include spike proteins with a deleted polybasic cleavage site, proline mutations, or a combination thereof, besides the wild-type protein. While all versions of the protein were able to induce neutralizing antibodies, only the antigen with both a deleted cleavage site and the K986P and V987P (PP) mutations completely protected from challenge in this mouse model.IMPORTANCE A vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. A better understanding of antigen design and attributes that vaccine candidates need to have to induce protective immunity is of high importance. The data presented here validate the choice of antigens that contain the PP mutations and suggest that deletion of the polybasic cleavage site may lead to a further-optimized design.","Amanat, Fatima; Strohmeier, Shirin; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Schotsaert, Michael; Coughlan, Lynda; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Krammer, Florian",mBio (Online),,491

However, the interruption of routine care and support due to the current challenges with healthcare providers, facilities, and essential medicines due to this pandemic is adversely affecting people with CKD. This is because poor management of this disease leads to negative health outcomes.

To understand immunization service interruptions specifically for maternal, neonatal and infant vaccines, we captured the local experiences of members of the Immunising Pregnant Women and Infants Network (IMPRINT) by conducting an online survey over 2-weeks in April 2020. IMPRINT is a global network of clinicians and scientists working in maternal and neonatal vaccinology. The survey included discrete questions to quantify the extent of disruption as well as free-text options to explore the reasons behind reported disruptions. Of the 48 responses received, the majority (75%) were from low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). Of all respondents, 50% or more reported issues with vaccine delivery within their country. Thematic analysis identified three key themes behind immunization disruption: ""access"" issues, e.g., logistical barriers, ""provider"" issues, e.g., staff shortages and user ""concern"" about attending immunization appointments due to COVID-19 fear. Access and provider issues were more commonly reported by LMIC respondents. Overall, respondents reported uncertainty among parents and healthcare providers regarding routine immunization. We conclude that further quantification of routine vaccination disruption is needed, alongside health service prioritization, logistical support and targeted communication strategies to reinforce routine immunizations during the COVID-19 response.","Saso, Anja; Skirrow, Helen; Kampmann, Beate",,,491

Little is known about how they perceive this isolation and its subsequent impact on their relationships with peers, both during and after isolation for treatment. This study describes the experience of hospital isolation from the perspectives of children and adolescents with a malignant brain tumor. The use and impact of information and communication technologies (ICT) as a possible bridge for contact is also explored. Following a qualitative approach utilizing interpretive phenomenological analysis, in-depth interviews were conducted with eight youth participants who had undergone treatment for medulloblastoma. Data analysis generated three main themes: (1) transforming children and relationships, (2) hospitalization in a digital world, and (3) ICTs as a promising bridge back to school. Study findings provide insight into the experience of hospital isolation for children and adolescents, while highlighting the positive social as well as academic outcomes of frequent, open ended ICT use throughout hospital isolation. This is timely, given the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting isolation. Considerations for hospital social workers to promote relationships and connection, while facilitating a smooth transition as these children return to school are included.","Sawyer, Jami-Leigh; Mishna, Faye; Bouffet, Eric; Saini, Michael; Zlotnik-Shaul, Randi",Child Adolesc Social Work J,,491

430143,The use of digital technologies by small and medium enterprises during COVID-19: Implications for theory and practice,2020,"Digital contact tracing has emerged as a viable tool supplementing manual contact tracing. To date, more than 100 contact tracing applications have been published to slow down the spread of highly contagious Covid-19. Despite subtle variabilities among these applications, all of them achieve contact tracing by manipulating the following three components: a) use a personal device to identify the user while designing a secure protocol to anonymize the user's identity; b) leverage networking technologies to analyze and store the data; c) exploit rich sensing features on the user device to detect the interaction among users and thus estimate the exposure risk. This paper reviews the current digital contact tracing based on these three components. We focus on two personal devices that are intimate to the user: smartphones and wearables. We discuss the centralized and decentralized networking approaches that use to facilitate the data flow. Lastly, we investigate the sensing feature available on smartphones and wearables to detect the proximity between any two users and present experiments comparing the proximity sensing performance between these two personal devices.","Ng, Pai Chet; Spachos, Petros; Gregori, Stefano; Plataniotis, Konstantinos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02008v1.pdf,491

By combining a point-mass aircraft dynamical model with models of electrical losses and losses in the gas turbine, the fuel consumed over a given future flight path is minimised subject to constraints on the battery, electric motor and gas turbine. The resulting optimisation problem is used to define a predictive energy management control law that takes into account the variation in aircraft mass during flight. We investigate the performance of algorithms for solving this problem.

While these kinases belong to separate signal transduction cascades, they demonstrate an uncanny propensity to regulate many of the same proteins either through direct phosphorylation or by altering transcription/translation, including: c-MYC, NF-&#954;B, p53 and TAU, as well as each another. A significant number of studies centered on the GSK3 kinases have led to the identification of the GSK3 interactome and a number of substrates, which link GSK3 activity to metabolic control, translation, RNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, cellular division, DNA repair and stress/inflammatory signaling. Interestingly, many of these same pathways and processes are controlled by PKR, but unlike the GSK3 kinases, a clear picture of proteins interacting with PKR and a complete listing of its substrates is still missing. In this review, we take a detailed look at what is known about the PKR and GSK3 kinases, how these kinases interact to influence common cellular processes (innate immunity, alternative splicing, translation, glucose metabolism) and how aberrant activation of these kinases leads to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), diabetes mellitus (DM) and cancer.","Piazzi, Manuela; Bavelloni, Alberto; Faenza, Irene; Blalock, William",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,,491

436447,"Strategic partnership between Japan and New Zealand: foundation, development and prospect",2020,"BACKGROUND: The association between SARS-CoV-2 commercial serological assays and virus neutralization test (VNT) has been poorly explored in mild patients with COVID-19. METHODS: 439 serum specimens were longitudinally collected from 76 healthcare workers with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19. The clinical sensitivity (determined weekly) of nine commercial serological assays were evaluated. Clinical specificity was assessed using 69 pre-pandemic sera. Correlation, agreement and concordance with the VNT were also assessed on a subset of 170 samples. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was estimated at 2 neutralizing antibody titers. RESULTS: The Wantai Total Ab assay targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S protein presented the best sensitivity at different times during the course of disease. The clinical specificity was greater than 95% for all tests except for the Euroimmun IgA assay. The overall agreement with the presence of neutralizing antibodies ranged from 62.2% (95%CI; 56.0-68.1) for bioMérieux IgM to 91.2% (87.0-94.2) for Siemens. The lowest negative percent agreement (NPA) was found with the Wantai Total Ab assay (NPA 33% (21.1-48.3)). The NPA for other total Ab or IgG assays targeting the S or the RBD was 80.7% (66.7-89.7), 90.3 (78.1-96.1) and 96.8% (86.8-99.3) for Siemens, bioMérieux IgG and DiaSorin, respectively. None of commercial assays have sufficient performance to detect a neutralizing titer of 80 (AUC<0.76). CONCLUSIONS: Although some assays show a better agreement with VNT than others, the present findings emphasize that commercialized serological tests including those targeting the RBD cannot substitute a VNT for the assessment of functional antibody response.","Bal, Antonin; Pozzetto, Bruno; Trabaud, Mary-Anne; Escuret, Vanessa; Rabilloud, Muriel; Langlois-Jacques, Carole; Paul, Adèle; Guibert, Nicolas; D039,; Aubarede-Frieh, Constance; Massardier-Pilonchery, Amélie; Fabien, Nicole; Goncalves, David; Boibieux, André; Morfin-Sherpa, Florence; Pitiot, Virginie; Gueyffier, François; Lina, Bruno; Fassier, Jean-Baptiste; Trouillet-Assant, Sophie",Clin. chem,,491

442230,Tanzania – Coronavirus Concerns,2020,"Rationale: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to severe viral pneumonia has been shown to cause impaired lung function and persistent radiological abnormalities several years after recovery. Severe COVID-19 causes ARDS in a minority of patients. Corticosteroids were used in previous viral pandemics and have been shown to reduce mortality and severity of COVID-19 infection. The use of high-dose pulsed methylprednisolone and the long-term pulmonary and functional outcomes following its use in severe COVID-19 have not been widely studied. Methods: A retrospective review of electronic records of patients treated with high-dose pulsed methylprednisolone (1000mg once daily for 3 days, followed by 40mg Prednisolone daily reducing by 5mg every 3 days until a stable dose of 10mg) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK was done. Baseline demographics, microbiological, and radiological data were collected. Survivors were followed at 3 months post-discharge with a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA), spirometry, gas transfer, and 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Results: 15 patients were treated. 14 had ARDS whilst one had paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, myocarditis, and mild respiratory failure. Mean age was 51 years. 13 patients were male. 5 patients died (4 male, 1 female), 4 due to COVID-19 infection and 1 due to myocardial infarction. 1 patient developed viral encephalitis and 1 developed a subdural haemorrhage, both of which resolved without specific treatment. 6 patients had follow-up lung function. The most common abnormalities were a low diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and total lung capacity (TLC) (5 patients each) with DLCO having the lowest mean predicted value (58%), followed by TLC (67%). 10 patients completed follow-up CTPA. The most common CT abnormalities at 3 months were parenchymal bands (7/10, 70%) and 5 developed fibrosis. 8 patients completed a 6MWT. Mean distance walked was 405 metres (standard deviation (SD) 87.4m)/65% predicted (SD 18.5%). Conclusions: In this cohort of severely unwell patients with COVID-19 at 3 months, abnormalities in pulmonary function, CT appearance, and exertional capacity were unsurprisingly common. However, all patients treated at an early stage of their disease survived suggesting there might be some benefit when used sufficiently early, although conclusions about the effect on mortality are not possible with this study. This treatment has been shown to improve outcomes in a small randomized controlled trial. We believe our findings support the need for larger trials to clarify its impact and define the optimal timing for treatment.","Van Zeller, C.; Anwar, A.; Bascon, N.; Barnes, N.; Madden, B.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,491

International Labour Organization (ILO) reported that not only COVID-19 is a serious threat to public health but also the economic and social disruption of this crisis threatens the long-term livelihoods and wellbeing of millions of people. In this short paper, we introduce our hypothesis on using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to predict which employees are most vulnerable to the infections caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Such a system can be used in a wide variety of work places such as libraries, banks, drugstores, and hotel receptions to reduce the risk of severe infections in employees as well as to ensure the safety of labor force and the sustainability of businesses and jobs.","Mortazavi, S.A.R.; Mortazavi, S.M.J.; Parsaei, H.",J.

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases from inception of databases up until 7 March 2021. Studies that met all of the following criteria were included: 1) observational studies or randomized controlled trials that report COVID-19 patients, 2) reporting DPP-4 inhibitor use, 3) mortality, and 4) mortality based on DPP-4 inhibitor use. The exposure was DPP-4 inhibitor, defined as DPP-4 inhibitor use that started prior to COVID-19 hospitalization. The control group was patients with no exposure to DPP-4 inhibitor. The outcome was mortality. The pooled effect estimate was reported as risk ratio (RR). RESULTS: There were 4,477 patients from 9 studies in this systematic review and meta-analysis. 31% of (15%, 46%) the patients use DPP-4 inhibitor. Mortality occurs in 23% (15%, 31%) of the patients. DPP-4 inhibitor was associated with lower mortality in patients with COVID-19 (RR 0.76 [0.60, 0.97], p = 0.030, I2: 44.5%, p = 0.072). Meta-regression analysis showed that the association between DPP-4 inhibitor and mortality was significantly affected by metformin (RR 1.02 [1.00, 1.04], p = 0.048) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) use (RR 1.04 [1.01, 1.07], p = 0.006), but not age (p = 0.759), sex (reference: male, p = 0.148), and hypertension (p = 0.218). CONCLUSION: DPP-4 inhibitor use was associated with lower mortality in COVID-19 patients, and the association was weaker in patients who were also taking metformin and/or ACE inhibitors.","Rakhmat, Iis Inayati; Kusmala, Yudith Yunia; Handayani, Dewi Ratih; Juliastuti, Henny; Nawangsih, Eka Noneng; Wibowo, Arief; Lim, Michael Anthonius; Pranata, Raymond",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,491

In our study, we aimed to reveal that COVID-19 infection affects the endocrine system and triggers subacute thyroiditis (SAT) in the acute period. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In our retrospective study, the ear-nose-throat examination, internal diseases consultation (investigation of COVID-19 symptoms and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] test), routine blood tests, T3, T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone, antithyroglobulin (anti-TG), antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO), thyroid scintigraphy, and thyroid ultrasonography results of 5 patients who applied to the otorhinolaryngology clinic due to complaints of neck pain and odynophagia between April 2020 and February 2021 were examined. FINDINGS: All 5 patients were female patients (30.4 years) with odynophagia and pain in the front lower region of the neck. These patients had no previous history of thyroiditis. COVID-19 PCR tests of the patients diagnosed with SAT were positive, and there were no typical COVID-19 signs and symptoms except odynophagia and neck pain. RESULT: It comes in view that SARS-COV-2 affects thyroid functions and causes SAT and the main symptoms in patients are pain in the neck and odynophagia.","Seyed Resuli, Ali; Bezgal, Muzaffer",Ear Nose Throat J,,491

METHODOLOGY: We collected, at the time of admission, routine clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters of hypoxia, lung damage, inflammation, and organ dysfunction in a consecutive series of 50 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Respiratory Disease and Infectious Disease Units of the University Hospital of Sassari (North-Sardinia, Italy) and alive on discharge. RESULTS: Prolonged HS (PHS, >21 days) patients had significantly lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio and lymphocytes, and significantly higher Chest CT severity score, C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) when compared to non-PHS patients. In univariate logistic regression, Chest CT severity score (OR = 1.1891, p = 0.007), intensity of care (OR = 2.1350, p = 0.022), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (OR = 0.9802, p = 0.007), CRP (OR = 1.0952, p = 0.042) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (OR = 1.0039, p = 0.036) were significantly associated with PHS. However, in multivariate logistic regression, only the PaO2/FiO2 ratio remained significantly correlated with PHS (OR = 0.9164; 95% CI 0.8479-0.9904, p = 0.0275). In ROC curve analysis, using a threshold of 248, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio predicted PHS with sensitivity and specificity of 60% and 91%, respectively (AUC = 0.780, 95% CI 0.637-0.886 p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission is independently associated with PHS in COVID-19 patients. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding.","Zinellu, Angelo; De Vito, Andrea; Scano, Valentina; Paliogiannis, Panagiotis; Fiore, Vito; Madeddu, Giordano; Maida, Ivana; Zinellu, Elisabetta; Mangoni, Arduino Aleksander; Arru, Luigi Benedetto; Carru, Ciriaco; Babudieri, Sergio; Pirina, Pietro; Fois, Alessandro Giuseppe",J Infect Dev Ctries,,491

We assessed the association between RVD and mortality in COVID-19 patients. We searched electronic databases from inception to February 15, 2021. RVD was defined based on the following echocardiographic variables: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), tricuspid S? peak systolic velocity, fractional area change (FAC), and right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS). All meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model. Nineteen cohort studies involving 2307 patients were included. The mean age ranged from 59 to 72?years and 65% of patients were male. TAPSE (mean difference [MD], ?3.13?mm;95% confidence interval [CI], ?4.08??2.19), tricuspid S? peak systolic velocity (MD, ?0.88?cm/s;95% CI, ?1.68 to ?0.08), FAC (MD, ?3.47%;95% CI, ?6.21 to ?0.72), and RVFWLS (MD, ?5.83%;95% CI, ?7.47??4.20) were significantly lower in nonsurvivors compared to survivors. Each 1?mm decrease in TAPSE (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.22;95% CI, 1.08?1.37), 1% decrease in FAC (aHR, 1.09;95% CI, 1.04?1.14), and 1% increase in RVFWLS (aHR, 1.33;95% CI, 1.19?1.48) were independently associated with higher mortality. RVD was significantly associated with higher mortality using unadjusted risk ratio (2.05;95% CI, 1.27?3.31), unadjusted hazard ratio (3.37;95% CI, 1.72?6.62), and adjusted hazard ratio (aHR, 2.75;95% CI, 1.52?4.96). Our study shows that echocardiographic parameters of RVD were associated with an increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Diaz-Arocutipa, Carlos Saucedo-Chinchay Jose Argulian Edgar",Clinical Cardiology,,491

454611,What is essential?: Understanding community resilience and public libraries in the United States during disasters,2020,"The Covid-19 global pandemic posed a particularly acute problem for sport. Although there was massive sectoral disruption in areas like higher education, music, and tourism, sport is unusually dependent on commercial media-financed, impossible-to-repeat live events performed before large co-present crowds that form a key part of the spectacle for the many times larger, distant audiences using an expanding range of screens. Covid-19 exposed the inner workings of sport as a machine that could be disabled by its own global interdependency. The compulsive generation of inequalities of class, ‘race’/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, age, ability, space, and so on resulting from the advanced commoditisation and consequent hierarchisation of contemporary global sport, created the structural imbalance and vulnerability that Covid-19 has mercilessly punished. This article applies a sociological analysis to sport before, during and after the pandemic, arguing that an emphasis on the relationships between human rights and cultural citizenship is required to improve the social institution of sport. It argues that if sociology does not play a key role in reforming sport after Covid-19, then it will have lost the moral compass that first guided the discipline in early modernity when the institution of sport emerged.","Rowe, David",J.

This review article details the drugs that have been tried against SARS CoV 2 infection from a pediatric perspective. The drugs have been classified into 3 main groups: (i) Drugs with antiviral activity like remedesvir, ivermectin and ribavirin that directly act on the virus affecting viral entry, assembly and replication.(ii) Drugs that are immunomodulators like anakinra and interferons which act upon the immune system to modulate the immune response to the virus (iii) Drugs that mitigate the complications like immunoglobulins, glucocorticoids and anticoagulants like aspirin which act at the cytokine release and in treatment of complications like Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome. Pediatric weight loused dosage and safety profiles have been established in other conditions and are being explored in SARS CoV2 infection in these drugs and many drugs are still to establish pediatric doses. (iv) Drugs that have been tried earlier were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and azithromycin but have not shown any therapeutic benefit over the course of the pandemic.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The sample of this descriptive study consisted of 160 news articles published between 11 March and 11 April 2020 on the websites of the three highest-circulating newspapers throughout the nation. A quantitative media context analysis method, consisting of 14 questions and 2 sections was employed to evaluate news on the newspapers. The data was analyzed using SPSS 21.0 statistical package program using numbers and percentages. RESULTS: Forty percent of the news analyzed within the scope of the study were obtained from the newspaper's own news, reporter or columnist, 56.9 % were informative, 6.3 % were advisory and critical against the CAT methods. 95 % of the news included preventive or protective methods against COVID-19. 77.5 % of the complementary and alternative medicine methods mentioned in the news were biologically-based, 20.6 % were mind-body practices. It was determined that 85.0 % of the benefits, harm and side effects of the methods mentioned in the news were announced, but their impact on COVID-19 is not clarified (78.1 %), and there was insufficient information provided about the method and dosage of the method. It was seen that all news contained information on protection against COVID-19 or prevention of COVID19. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the sources and methods and the number of news items changed from one newspaper to another, the news lacked a scientific basis, and as a result, it might lead to misinterpretations among the public. There were different opinions among the experts in the proposed or criticized complementary and alternative medicine methods. It was observed that there was an increase in the number of news items related to using complementary and alternative medicine methods for the treatment of COVID19, a clear and easily understandable language was used in the news, but the content and sources of the news were insufficient in conveying the correct and scientific information. It was reported by previous literature potential interactions between herbal remedies/dietary supplements and prescribed drugs, complications of medical conditions and some adverse effects cause of CAM usage.","Konakci, Gulbin; Ozgursoy Uran, Berna Nilgun; Erkin, Ozum",Complement Ther Med,,491

Compared with discharged or cured patients, severe or died patients often have one or more comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In this study, we systematically collected and analyzed COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes from 70 articles. The commonly occurring 17 phenotypes were classified into different groups based on the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). Based on the HP classification, we systematically analyze three nervous phenotypes (loss of smell, loss of taste, and headache) and four abdominal phenotypes (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea) identified in patients, and found that patients from Europe and USA turned to have higher nervous phenotypes and abdominal phenotypes than patients from Asia. A total of 23 comorbidities were found to commonly exist among COVID-19 patients.

Roma, Gypsies and Travellers are ethnic minorities who experience extreme health inequalities. OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences of cancer diagnosis, treatment and care among people who self-identify as Roma or Gypsies and Travellers. METHODS: A participatory qualitative approach was taken. Peer researchers conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 37) and one focus group (n = 4) with community members in Wales and England, UK. RESULTS: Cancer fatalism is declining, but Roma, Gypsies and Travellers experience barriers to cancer healthcare at service user, service provider and organisational levels. Communication was problematic for all groups, and Roma participants reported lack of access to interpreters within primary care. Clear communication and trusting relationships with health professionals are highly valued and most frequently found in tertiary care. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that Roma, Gypsies and Travellers are motivated to access health care for cancer diagnosis and treatment, but barriers experienced in primary care can prevent or delay access to diagnostic and treatment services. Organisational changes, plus increased cultural competence among health professionals, have the potential to reduce inequalities in early detection of cancer.","Condon, Louise; Curejova, Jolana; Leeanne Morgan, Donna; Fenlon, Deborah",Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),,491

However, its expression profile and detailed roles in glioblastoma (GBM) remain unknown. In this study, we mainly investigated the expression and roles of LINC01094 in GBM and focused on the mechanism by which LINC01094 regulates the malignant characteristics of GBM. Patients and Methods: LINC01094 expression in GBM was determined with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo of GBM cells were evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometry analysis, migration assay, invasion assay, and tumor xenograft models, respectively. Results: LINC01094 was overexpressed in GBM tissues and cell lines. Moreover, increased LINC01094 expression was associated with adverse clinicopathological parameters in patients with GBM. Loss of LINC01094 inhibited GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; promoted cell apoptosis; and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanically, LINC01094 functioned as a molecular sponge for microRNA-577 (miR-577) and consequently enhanced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in GBM cells. Both miR-577 inhibition and BDNF expression enhancement reversed LINC01094 deficiency-mediated inhibition of malignant processes in GBM cells. Conclusion: Our results verified the involvement of the LINC01094/miR-577/BDNF pathway in GBM cells and its enhancing effects on the aggressive behaviors of GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. This pathway may be a novel and promising focus for the future development of targeted therapies for GBM.","Dong, Xiaoyan; Fu, Xiuxin; Yu, Miao; Li, Zengfen",Cancer Manag Res,,491

Samples from rivers and streams as well as coastal waters, were analyzed for the presence of 11 OPEs in dissolved and particulate fraction. OPEs were ubiquitous pollutants in the aquatic environment. Concentrations of dissolved fraction of &#931;OPEs concentrations ranged from 400 to 2158 ng L-1 in rivers, 400-1270 in coastal sites and 377-30,560 ng L-1 in streams. TBOEP showed the highest concentrations followed by TPHP, TNBP and TClPP. Significant particulate fractions were determined for TNBP, TClPP TPHP and TCP. Field partition coefficients in inland waters were dependent on the concentration of total suspended solids. Risk assessment did not show potential threat due to OPEs in rivers and coastal sites, however, potential adverse effects were found in streams.","Pantelaki, Ioanna; Voutsa, Dimitra",Sci Total Environ,,491

The quantification was completely automatic based upon high resolution computed tomography exams. The algorithm was capable of measuring volume and differentiating pulmonary involvement including inflammatory process and fibrosis, emphysema, and ground-glass opacities. The algorithm classifies the percentage of each pulmonary involvement when compared to the entire lung volume. Our algorithm was applied to four different patients groups: no lung disease patients, patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and patients with paracoccidioidomycosis. The quantification results were compared with a semi-automatic algorithm previously validated. Results confirmed that the automatic approach has a good agreement with the semi-automatic. Bland-Altman (B&A) demonstrated a low dispersion when comparing total lung volume, and also when comparing each lung impairment individually. Linear regression adjustment achieved an R value of 0.81 when comparing total lung volume between both methods.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess sleep among a sample of predominantly US frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic using validated measures through a survey distributed on social media. METHODS: A self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31 to September 15, 2020), targeting health care workers who were clinically active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and they reported their demographic and career information. Poor sleep quality was defined as a PSQI score &#8805;5. Moderate-to-severe insomnia was defined as an ISI score >14. The Mini-Z Burnout Survey was used to measure burnout. Multivariate logistic regression tested associations between demographics, career characteristics, and sleep outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 963 surveys were completed. Participants were predominantly White (894/963, 92.8%), female (707/963, 73.4%), aged 30-49 years (692/963, 71.9%), and physicians (620/963, 64.4%). Mean sleep duration was 6.1 hours (SD 1.2). Nearly 96% (920/963, 95.5%) of participants reported poor sleep (PSQI). One-third (288/963, 30%) reported moderate or severe insomnia. Many participants (554/910, 60.9%) experienced sleep disruptions due to device use or had nightmares at least once per week (420/929, 45.2%). Over 50% (525/932, 56.3%) reported burnout. In multivariable logistic regressions, nonphysician (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.7-3.4), caring for patients with COVID-19 (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.8), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.5), female sex (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), and having a sleep disorder (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.7-6.9) were associated with increased odds of insomnia. In open-ended comments (n=310), poor sleep was mapped to four categories: children and family, work demands, personal health, and pandemic-related sleep disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all the frontline health care workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device use and nightmares. Sleep interventions for frontline health care workers are urgently needed.","Stewart, Nancy H; Koza, Anya; Dhaon, Serena; Shoushtari, Christiana; Martinez, Maylyn; Arora, Vineet M",J Med Internet Res,,491

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to discuss the incidence, characteristics, diagnostic criteria, biomarkers, and outcomes of hospitalized patients diagnosed with CAPA. METHODS: A literature search was performed through Pubmed and Web of Science databases for articles published up to March 20th, 2021. RESULTS: In 1,421 COVID-19 patients, the overall CAPA incidence was 13.5% (ranging 2.5-35.0%). The majority required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The time to CAPA diagnosis from illness onset varied between 8.0-16.0 days. However, the time to CAPA diagnosis from ICU admission and IMV initiation ranged between 4.0-15.0 days and 3.0-8.0 days. The most common diagnostic criteria were the modified AspICU-Dutch/Belgian Mycosis Study Group and IAPA-Verweij et al. 77.6% of patients had positive lower respiratory tract cultures, other fungal biomarkers of BAL and serum galactomannan were positive in 45.3% and 18.2% of patients. The CAPA mortality rate was high at 48.4%, despite the widespread use of antifungals. Lengthy hospital and ICU LOS ranging between 16.0-37.5 days and 10.5-37.0 days were observed. CAPA patients had prolonged IMV duration of 13.0-20.0 days. CONCLUSION: The true incidence of CAPA likely remains unknown as the diagnosis is limited by the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria that rely solely on microbiological data with direct or indirect detection of Aspergillus in respiratory specimens, particularly in clinical conditions with a low pretest probability. A well-designed, multi-center study to determine the optimal diagnostic approach for CAPA is required.","Chong, Woon H; Neu, Kristoffer P",J. hosp. infect,,491

478782,Media komunikasi mitigasi bencana alam dalam situasi tanggap darurat pandemi COVID-19,2021,"Multiple effective vaccines are currently being deployed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and are viewed as the major factor in marked reductions of disease burden in regions with moderate to high vaccination coverage. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination programs is, however, significantly threatened by the emergence of new SARS-COV-2 variants that, in addition to being more transmissible than the wild-type (original) strain, may at least partially evade existing vaccines. A two-strain (one wild-type, one variant) and two-group (vaccinated or otherwise) mechanistic mathematical model is designed and used to assess the impact of the vaccine-induced cross-protective efficacy on the spread the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that, in the absence of any co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant, the vaccine-derived herd immunity threshold needed to eliminate the wild-type strain can be achieved if 59% of the US population is fully-vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. This threshold increases to 76% if the wild-type strain is co-circulating with the Alpha variant (a SARS-CoV-2 variant that is 56% more transmissible than the wild-type strain). If the wild-type strain is co-circulating with the Delta variant (which is estimated to be 100% more transmissible than the wild-type strain), up to 82% of the US population needs to be vaccinated with either of the aforementioned vaccines to achieve the vaccine-derived herd immunity. Global sensitivity analysis of the model reveal the following four parameters as the most influential in driving the value of the reproduction number of the variant strain (hence, COVID-19 dynamics) in the US: (a) the infectiousness of the co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant, (b) the proportion of individuals fully vaccinated (using Pfizer or Moderna vaccine) against the wild-type strain, (c) the cross-protective efficacy the vaccines offer against the variant strain and (d) the modification parameter accounting for the reduced infectiousness of fully-vaccinated individuals experiencing breakthrough infection. Specifically, numerical simulations of the model show that future waves or surges of the COVID-19 pandemic can be prevented in the US if the two vaccines offer moderate level of cross-protection against the variant (at least 67%). This study further suggests that a new SARS-CoV-2 variant can cause a significant disease surge in the US if (i) the vaccine coverage against the wild-type strain is low (roughly < 66%), (ii) the variant is much more transmissible (e.g., 100% more transmissible) than the wild-type strain, or (iii) the level of cross-protection offered by the vaccine is relatively low (e.g., less than 50%). A new SARS-CoV-2 variant will not cause such surge in the US if it is only moderately more transmissible (e.g., the Alpha variant, which is 56% more transmissible) than the wild-type strain, at least 66% of the population of the US is fully vaccinated, and the three vaccines being deployed in the US (Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson) offer a moderate level of cross-protection against the variant.","Mancuso, Marina; Eikenberry, Steffen; Gumel, Abba",,,491

Immediately upon delivery, adenovirus-based vectors exhibit multiple complex vector-host interactions and induce innate and adaptive immune responses. This can severely limit their safety and efficacy, particularly after delivery through the blood stream. In this review article we summarize two strategies to modulate Ad vector-induced immune responses: extensive genomic and chemical capsid modifications. Both strategies have shown beneficial effects in a number of preclinical studies while potential synergistic effects warrant further investigations.","Kreppel, Florian; Hagedorn, Claudia",Int. j. mol. sci.

480601,From managing nurses to serving nurses: The case for transfusing nursing management with servant leadership during the global COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Economic inequality is a collective issue that affects all citizens. However, people often fail to support redistribution strategies aimed at redressing inequality. In this work we investigated personal optimism and collective pessimism as psychological processes that contribute to hampering vs. promoting the demand for redistribution. Our prediction was that support for redistribution would require both a pessimistic economic outlook at the collective level and the perception of being economically disadvantaged. In two studies, one of which pre-registered, Italian participants (Study 1: N = 306; Study 2: N = 384) were led to feel relatively poor or rich, rated their perceived control over either their personal or the nation's future and estimated either personal or national economic and general future risks. To measure support for redistribution, participants were invited to allocate their desired level of taxation to each of the five tax brackets included in the Italian personal income tax. Results showed that participants were optimistic about their personal future, but pessimistic about the fate of their nation. This difference was explained by respondents' greater perceived control over personal future than over the nation's future. Importantly, greater pessimism about national economic risks led to greater support for progressive taxation only for participants who felt relatively poor.","Galdi, Silvia; Maass, Anne; Robbiani, Annalisa",PLoS One,,491

Sixty articles per journal were selected from 12 issues each of The Spine Journal, Spine, and Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine, and 40 articles were selected from 8 issues of Global Spine Journal, for a total of 220 articles. All the articles were published in 2019 and were selected using computer-generated numbers. From the references list of each article, one reference was again selected by using a computer-generated number and then checked for citation or quotation errors. RESULTS: The results indicate that 84.1% of articles have a minor citation error, 4.5% of articles have a major citation error, 9.5% of articles have a minor quotation error, and 9.1% of articles have a major quotation error. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine had the fewest citation errors compared with the other journals evaluated in this study. Using chi-square analysis, no association was determined between the occurrence of errors and potential markers of reference mistakes. Still, statistical significance was found between the occurrence of citation errors and the spine journals tested. CONCLUSIONS: In order to advance medical treatment and patient care in spine surgery, detailed documentation and attention to detail are necessary. The results from this study illustrate that improved reference accuracy is required.","Montenegro, Thiago S; Hines, Kevin; Partyka, Paul P; Harrop, James",J Neurosurg Spine,,491

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of patients who underwent EIN or CST surgery for tibia shaft fracture at our center from 2013 to 2018. The patient demographics, fracture characteristics, radiographic information, length of hospital stay, and medical expenses were recorded. All patients were clinically followed-up until they started to walk or for at least 6 months. The treatment outcomes and postoperative complications of the two procedures were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 186 patients who underwent EIN and CST were included in the study. The EIN patients had more low-energy mechanism of injury. In radiographic evaluation, significant differences were observed in distributions of fracture classification and location. Moreover, associated fibula fractures were higher in the EIN group than in the CST group. The CST procedure had faster surgical time, cast duration and lower expenses, and longer hospitalization time. Although they required more clinical visits, patients in the EIN group began exercising and endured weight-bearing earlier than those in the CST group. The average time for bone healing was 68.5 days in the EIN group, and 69.6 days in the CST group. However, the CST provided slight better results of coronal correction than EIN. Moreover, CST patients had less malalignment (> 5°) in complications. None had delay union, nonunion, and shortening over 10 mm at final assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Both EIN and CST patients showed similar treatment outcomes. Hence, not only the characteristics of the patient and fracture, but also the individual's situation and expectation should be considered when choosing the best approach.","Zeng, Shuaidan; Deng, Hansheng; Zhu, Tianfeng; Han, Shuai; Xiong, Zhu; Tang, Shengping",Injury,,491

483350,Situated learning in a business incubator: Encouraging students to become real entrepreneurs,2021,"This article investigates the complex relationship between endogenous and exogenous, deterministic and stochastic stimulating factors in public opinion dynamics. An asynchronous multiagent network model is proposed to explore the interaction mechanism between individual opinions and the public opinion in online multiagent network community, including both the micro and the macro patterns of opinion evolution. In addition, based on random network models, a novel algorithm is provided for opinion evolution prediction. The model property analysis and numerical experiments show that the proposed asynchronous multiagent network model can assimilate and explain some interesting phenomena that are observed in the real world. Further case studies with numerical simulation and real-world applications confirm the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed model in public opinion analysis. The results challenge the common perception that mass media or opinion facilitators play the fundamental role in controlling the development trends of public opinion. This study shows that the formation and evolution of public opinion in the presence of opinion leaders depend also on an individual's emotional inertia and conformity pressures from peers in the same topic group.","Li, Chong; Yang, Yingjie; Liu, Sifeng",Concurr.

To this end, in April/May 2020, the managers of 35 RNPOs located in Poland were queried. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (pS), the coefficient of determination (R 2) and a transformation coefficient (d) were primarily used to verify the hypotheses and interpret the relationships studied. The study revealed four OR descriptive levels-progressive (PR), sustainable (SR), regressive (RR), and downward (DR). The findings also show that the undertaken activities are related to the OR descriptive levels. RNPOs realised one of two adaptations: passive adaptation aimed at returning to the pre-pandemic original state with no changes may lead to a bounce backwards and an uncertain survival, whilst active adaptation leads to a transformation process between OR levels to move forward and thrive in adapting to post-pandemic changes. This study confirmed that building OR requires understanding the ways of transformations among OR levels to undertake activities in strategic areas, i.e., activity scope (AS), cooperation (CO), and finance (FI), to adapt and transform RNPOs' in an environment of post-pandemic uncertainty.","Paluszak, G.

OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, we describe the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19-related pneumothorax. METHODS: Studies were identified through MEDLINE, Pubmed, and Google Scholar databases using keywords of ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""pneumothorax,"" ""pneumomediastinum,"" and ""barotrauma"" from January 1st, 2020 to January 30th, 2021. RESULTS: Among the nine observational studies, the incidence of pneumothorax is low at 0.3% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, the incidence of pneumothorax increases to 12.8-23.8% in those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with a high mortality rate up to 100%. COVID-19-related pneumothorax tends to be unilateral and right-sided. Age, pre-existing lung diseases, and active smoking status are not shown to be risk factors. The time to pneumothorax diagnosis is around 9.0-19.6 days from admission and 5.4 days after IMV initiation. COVID-19-related pneumothoraces are associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased likelihood of ICU admission and death, especially among the elderly. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related pneumothorax likely signify greater disease severity. With the high variability of COVID-19-related pneumothorax incidence described, a well-designed study is required to better assess the significance of COVID-19-related pneumothorax.","Chong, Woon H; Saha, Biplab K; Hu, Kurt; Chopra, Amit",Heart Lung,,491

We summarize here the results of studies, which used these technologies to investigate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in different organs. Studies with in vitro models of lung epithelia showed that alveolar epithelial type II cells, but not differentiated lung alveolar epithelial type I cells, are key targets of SARS-CoV-2, which triggers cell apoptosis and inflammation, while impairing surfactant production. Experiments with human small intestinal organoids and colonic organoids showed that the gastrointestinal tract is another relevant target for SARS-CoV-2. The virus can infect and replicate in enterocytes and cholangiocytes, inducing cell damage and inflammation. Direct viral damage was also demonstrated in in vitro models of human cardiomyocytes and choroid plexus epithelial cells. At variance, endothelial cells and neurons are poorly susceptible to viral infection, thus supporting the hypothesis that neurological symptoms and vascular damage result from the indirect effects of systemic inflammatory and immunological hyper-responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Trevisan, Marta; Riccetti, Silvia; Sinigaglia, Alessandro; Barzon, Luisa",Int. j. mol. sci.

486754,Modal share changes due to COVID-19: The case of Budapest,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Multimorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of at least two chronic diseases, is a common occurrence with ageing and a recognised public health concern, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The multimorbidity population is more susceptible to the virus, its complications, and death. The study aimed to explore the multimorbidity characteristics and their associations at a population level for the first time in Malta. Such data enables adequate priority and policy planning due to COVID-19's predilection for this population. STUDY AND METHODS: Baseline data was collected from 3,947 adults recruited between 2014-2016 through a cross-sectional study. A single-stage sampling strategy was implemented and stratified by age (18 -70 years), sex and locality. Participants were invited to attend a health examination survey consisting of a questionnaire, anthropometric and biological measurements. Descriptive (chi-square) and analytic (regression modelling) statistics were used to determine the characteristics and associations of the multimorbidity population. The chronic diseases considered for multimorbidity were type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, myocardial infraction, coronary heart disease and dyslipidaemia. RESULTS: Multimorbidity was present in 33% (95% confidence interval 31.54-34.47) of the study population, with a male predominance. Hypertension and myocardial infarction were the commonest multimorbidity combination from a young age group (20-30 years). Low socio-economic status and residing on the island of Gozo were positively associated with multimorbidity. CONCLUSION: Multimorbidity in Malta was evident from a young age, with the highest occurrence among the low socio-economic status and residents of Gozo, bringing forward the need for preventive action. An adaptive healthcare system and policies are recommended to prevent, support, and manage multimorbidity non-communicable diseases while bracing for the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Cuschieri, S; Grech, S",Public Health,,491

Chinese Medicines (CMs) had been used to treat and prevent viral infection pneumonia diseases for thousands of years and had accumulated a large number of clinical experiences and effective prescriptions. AIM OF THE STUDY: This research aimed to systematically excavate the classical prescriptions of Chinese Medicine (CM), which have been used to prevent and treat Pestilence (Wenbing, Wenyi, Shiyi or Yibing) for long history in China, to obtain the potential prescriptions and ingredients to alternatively treat COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed the screening system based on data mining, molecular docking and network pharmacology. Data mining and association network were used to mine the high-frequency herbs and formulas from ancient prescriptions. Virtual screening for the effective components of high frequency CMs and compatibility Chinese Medicine was explored by a molecular docking approach. Furthermore, network pharmacology method was used to preliminarily uncover the molecule mechanism. RESULTS: 574 prescriptions were obtained from 96,606 classical prescriptions with the key words to treat ""Warm diseases (Wenbing)"", ""Pestilence (Wenyi or Yibing)"" or ""Epidemic diseases (Shiyi)"". Meanwhile, 40 kinds of CMs, 36 CMs-pairs, 6 triple-CMs-groups existed with high frequency among the 574 prescriptions. Additionally, the key targets of SARS-COV-2, namely 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), were used to dock the main ingredients from the 40 kinds by the LigandFitDock method. A total of 66 compounds components with higher frequency were docked with the COVID-19 targets, which were distributed in 26 kinds of CMs, among which Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma), HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix), Dahuang (Rhei Radix Et Rhizome) and Chaihu (Bupleuri Radix) contain more potential compounds. Network pharmacology results showed that Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix) CMs-pairs could also interact with the targets involving in immune and inflammation diseases. CONCLUSIONS: These results we obtained probably provided potential candidate CMs formulas or active ingredients to overcome COVID-19.

Materials and Methods: Data from a series of COVID-19 patients (978 patients; 658 males [66.9%] and 324 females [33.1%]) admitted to the selected hospitals in Tehran from 20 February to 19 March 2020 were retrieved retrospectively from the Health Information System (HIS) of the hospitals. The statistical tests were used for analyzing the effect and correlation of the variables (drugs) with the average length of stay (ALOS) in the hospital. Results: Diverse medication classes and old drugs with or without strong evidence of therapeutic effects against the novel coronavirus, some previously tried as a treatment for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were mostly used for the treatment of patients in the hospitals. Many medications (broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals) or combination therapies are used without evidence of their therapeutic effects during pandemics. Conclusion: Therefore, guidelines should be provided for the off-label use of these drugs by policymakers and stakeholders during a pandemic emergency due to high demands.

488734,The role of e-learning as a response to crises in reducing the spread of the coronavirus a study of the decisions of higher education and scientific research in the hashemite kingdom of Jordan,2020,"Background: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has diverted resources from healthcare services for patients with chronic medical illness such as cancer. COVID-19 also causes organ dysfunction, complicating cancer treatment. In most countries with an outbreak of COVID-19, modifications of cancer management have been adopted to accommodate the crisis and minimize the exposure of cancer patients to the infection. In countries where COVID-19 numbers are subsiding, medical teams should also be prepared to resume normal practices gradually. Here, we aim to review the literature on the impact of COVID-19 on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as discuss modifications to the management of HCC during and after recovery from the pandemic. Summary: Based on current data, 10–40% of patients with COVID-19 have hepatic injury characterized by an elevation of transaminases and/or hyperbilirubinemia. Multiple mechanisms contribute to the hepatic injury, including direct viral entry to hepatocytes/cholangiocytes, immune-mediated hepatitis, hypoxia, and drug-related hepatotoxicity. In patients with HCC, COVID-19 may exacerbate existing chronic liver disease and complicate the management of cancer. Cancer patients generally have a higher risk of infection and worse outcome, especially those who have recently undergone cancer treatment. Although HCC is under-represented in COVID-19 series, mitigation measures should be implemented to minimize the exposure of patients to the virus. A decision on the treatment of HCC should be balanced with consideration of the availability of medical resources, the level of infection risk of COVID-19, and the risk-benefit ratio of the individual patient. In areas where the COVID-19 outbreak is subsiding, clinicians should be prepared to manage a surge of HCC patients with higher disease burdens and complications. Key Messages: Mitigation measures to protect at-risk patients, such as those with cancers, from SARS-CoV-2 infection should be exercised and the impact of COVID-19 on this group of patients should be thoroughly studied.","Stephen Lam, Chan Kudo Masatoshi",Liver Cancer,,491

492185,A review on recent trends of antiviral nanoparticles and airborne filters: special insight on COVID-19 virus,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (&#8805;18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS: 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03-1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61-12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 µg/mL (18·42, 2·64-128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0-24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. INTERPRETATION: The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 µg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

495716,How is the COVID-19 pandemic shaping transportation access to health care?,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated ""going remote"" with the delivery, support, and assessment of a study intervention targeting older adults enrolled in a clinical trial. While remotely delivering and assessing technology is not new, there are few methods available in the literature that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, and none for older adults specifically. Older adults comprise a diverse population, including in terms of their experience with and access to technology, making this a challenging endeavor. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to remotely deliver and conduct usability testing for a mobile health (mHealth) technology intervention for older adult participants enrolled in a clinical trial of the technology. This paper describes the methodology used, its successes, and its limitations. METHODS: We developed a conceptual model for remote operations, called the Framework for Agile and Remote Operations (FAR Ops), that combined the general requirements for spaceflight operations with Agile project management processes to quickly respond to this challenge. Using this framework, we iteratively created care packages that differed in their contents based on participant needs and were sent to study participants to deliver the study intervention-a medication management app-and assess its usability. Usability data were collected using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and a novel usability questionnaire developed to collect more in-depth data. RESULTS: In the first 6 months of the project, we successfully delivered 21 care packages. We successfully designed and deployed a minimum viable product in less than 6 weeks, generally maintained a 2-week sprint cycle, and achieved a 40% to 50% return rate for both usability assessment instruments. We hypothesize that lack of engagement due to the pandemic and our use of asynchronous communication channels contributed to the return rate of usability assessments being lower than desired. We also provide general recommendations for performing remote usability testing with diverse populations based on the results of our work, including implementing screen sharing capabilities when possible, and determining participant preference for phone or email communications. CONCLUSIONS: The FAR Ops model allowed our team to adopt remote operations for our mHealth trial in response to interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. This approach can be useful for other research or practice-based projects under similar circumstances or to improve efficiency, cost, effectiveness, and participant diversity in general. In addition to offering a replicable approach, this paper tells the often-untold story of practical challenges faced by mHealth projects and practical strategies used to address them.

We performed an ecological study to determine the association of state-level cases and deaths with NCD risk factors and healthcare and social indices. METHODS: We obtained cumulative national and state-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from publicly available database www.covid19india.org from February to end November 2020. To identify association with major NCD risk factors, NCDs, healthcare related and social variables we obtained data from public sources. Association was determined using univariate and multivariate statistics. RESULTS: More than 9.5 million COVID-19 cases and 135,000 deaths have been reported in India towards end of November 2020. There is significant positive correlation (Pearson r) of state-level COVID-19 cases and deaths per million, respectively, with NCD risk factors- obesity (0.64, 0.52), hypertension (0.28, 0.16), diabetes (0.66, 0.46), NCD epidemiological transition index (0.58, 0.54) and ischemic heart disease mortality (0.22, 0.33). Correlation is also observed with indices of healthcare access and quality (0.71, 0.61), urbanization (0.75, 0.73) and human (0.61, 0.56) and sociodemographic (0.70, 0.69) development. Multivariate adjusted analyses shows strong correlation of COVID-19 burden and deaths with NCD risk factors (r2 = 0.51, 0.43), NCDs (r2 = 0.32, 0.16) and healthcare (r2 = 0.52, 0.38).

METHODS: We investigated a cohort of 12,863 UK Biobank community-dwelling individuals > 65 years old (1814 individuals &#8805; 80 years old) tested for COVID-19. Individuals were stratified by age to account for age as a confounder. Risk factors were analyzed for COVID-19-positive diagnosis, hospitalization, and death. RESULTS: All-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) were associated with COVID-19-positive diagnosis, and all-cause dementia and AD remained associated in individuals &#8805; 80 years old. All-cause dementia, AD, or PD were not risk factors for overall hospitalization, but increased the risk of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. All-cause dementia and AD increased the risk of COVID-19-related death, and all-cause dementia was uniquely associated with increased death in &#8805; 80-year-old patients. DISCUSSION: All-cause dementia and AD are age-independent risk factors for disease severity and death in COVID-19.","Tahira, Ana C; Verjovski-Almeida, Sergio; Ferreira, Sergio T",Alzheimers dememt,,491

499364,Interleukin-6 as a potential biomarker of COVID-19 progression,2020,"This paper shows how existing methods of time series analysis and modeling can be exploited in novel ways to monitor and forecast the COVID-19 epidemic. In the past, epidemics have been monitored by various statistical and model metrics, such as evaluation of the effective reproduction number, R ( t ) . However, R ( t ) can be difficult and time consuming to compute. This paper suggests two relatively simple data-based metrics that could be used in conjunction with R ( t ) estimation and provide rapid indicators of how the epidemic's dynamic behaviour is progressing. The new metrics are the epidemic rate of change (RC) and a related state-dependent response rate parameter (RP), recursive estimates of which are obtained from dynamic harmonic and dynamic linear regression (DHR and DLR) algorithms. Their effectiveness is illustrated by the analysis of COVID-19 data in the UK and Italy. The paper also shows how similar methodology, combined with the refined instrumental variable method for estimating hybrid Box-Jenkins models of linear dynamic systems (RIVC), can be used to relate the daily death numbers in the Italian and UK epidemics and then provide 15-day-ahead forecasts of the UK daily death numbers. The same approach can be used to model and forecast the UK epidemic based on the daily number of COVID-19 patients in UK hospitals. Finally, the paper speculates on how the state-dependent parameter (SDP) modeling procedures may provide data-based insight into a nonlinear differential equation model for epidemics such as COVID-19.","Young, Peter C; Chen, Fengwei",Annual reviews in control,,491

501572,Factors associated with severe COVID-19 among patients hospitalized in Rhode Island,2020,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict future intubation among patients diagnosed or suspected with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed or under investigation for COVID-19. A machine learning algorithm was trained to predict future presence of intubation based on prior vitals, laboratory, and demographic data. Model performance was compared to ROX index, a validated prognostic tool for prediction of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: 4087 patients admitted to five hospitals between February 2020 and April 2020 were included. 11.03% of patients were intubated. The machine learning model outperformed the ROX-index, demonstrating an area under the receiver characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84 and 0.64, and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.30 and 0.13, respectively. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients alerted by the model were more likely to require intubation during their admission (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In patients diagnosed or under investigation for COVID-19, machine learning can be used to predict future risk of intubation based on clinical data which are routinely collected and available in clinical setting. Such an approach may facilitate identification of high-risk patients to assist in clinical care.","Arvind, Varun; Kim, Jun S; Cho, Brian H; Geng, Eric; Cho, Samuel K",J Crit Care,,491

We recruited adult volunteers with confirmed influenza and suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to wear medical masks and self-designed triple-layer cotton masks in a regular bedroom and a car with air conditioning. Four 1-hour repeated measurements (two measurements for bedroom the others for car) of particles with a size range of 20-1000 nm measured by number concentrations (NC0.02-1), temperature and relatively humidity, and cough/sneeze counts per hour were conducted for each volunteer. The paired t-tests were used for within-group comparisons in a bedroom and in a car. The results showed that there was no significant difference in NC0.02-1 or cough/sneeze counts between volunteers with medical masks and cotton masks in a bedroom or a car. We concluded that the cotton mask could be a potential substitute for medical mask for respiratory infection person in microenvironment with air conditioning.

Because the severity of the disease is highly variable, predictive models to stratify patients according to their mortality risk are needed. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop a model able to predict the risk of fatal outcome in patients with COVID-19 that could be used easily at the time of patients' arrival at the hospital. METHODS: We constructed a prospective cohort with 611 adult patients in whom COVID-19 was diagnosed between March 10 and April 12, 2020, in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. The analysis included 501 patients who had been discharged or had died by April 20, 2020. The capacity of several biomarkers, measured at the beginning of hospitalization, to predict mortality was assessed individually. Those biomarkers that independently contributed to improve mortality prediction were included in a multivariable risk model. RESULTS: High IL-6 level, C-reactive protein level, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, ferritin level, d-dimer level, neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were all predictive of mortality (area under the curve >0.70), as were low albumin level, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, and ratio of peripheral blood oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2). A multivariable mortality risk model including the SpO2/FiO2 ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, LDH level, IL-6 level, and age was developed and showed high accuracy for the prediction of fatal outcome (area under the curve 0.94). The optimal cutoff reliably classified patients (including patients with no initial respiratory distress) as survivors and nonsurvivors with 0.88 sensitivity and 0.89 specificity. CONCLUSION: This mortality risk model allows early risk stratification of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 before the appearance of obvious signs of clinical deterioration, and it can be used as a tool to guide clinical decision making.","Laguna-Goya, Rocio; Utrero-Rico, Alberto; Talayero, Paloma; Lasa-Lazaro, Maria; Ramirez-Fernandez, Angel; Naranjo, Laura; Segura-Tudela, Alejandro; Cabrera-Marante, Oscar; Rodriguez de Frias, Edgar; Garcia-Garcia, Rocio; Fernández-Ruiz, Mario; Aguado, Jose Maria; Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin; Lopez, Elena Ana; Catalan, Mercedes; Serrano, Antonio; Paz-Artal, Estela",J Allergy Clin Immunol,,491

510051,Could comprehensive cancer centres improve cancer outcomes and equity in New Zealand?,2020,"Understanding the relationships between biomedical terms like viruses, drugs, and symptoms is essential in the fight against diseases. Many attempts have been made to introduce the use of machine learning to the scientific process of hypothesis generation(HG), which refers to the discovery of meaningful implicit connections between biomedical terms. However, most existing methods fail to truly capture the temporal dynamics of scientific term relations and also assume unobserved connections to be irrelevant (i.e., in a positive-negative (PN) learning setting). To break these limits, we formulate this HG problem as future connectivity prediction task on a dynamic attributed graph via positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. Then, the key is to capture the temporal evolution of node pair (term pair) relations from just the positive and unlabeled data. We propose a variational inference model to estimate the positive prior, and incorporate it in the learning of node pair embeddings, which are then used for link prediction. Experiment results on real-world biomedical term relationship datasets and case study analyses on a COVID-19 dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.","Akujuobi, Uchenna; Chen, Jun; Elhoseiny, Mohamed; Spranger, Michael; Zhang, Xiangliang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01916v1.pdf,491
510584,COVID-19 Spread and Inter-County Travel: Daily Evidence from the U.S,2020,"Purpose: The paper explores university leaders' employee-focused sensegiving discourse during the COVID-19 health crisis. The aim is to reveal how leadership sensegiving narratives construct emotion in the rhetor-audience relationship. Design/methodology/approach: A social constructionist, sensemaking approach centres on the meaning-making discourse of university leaders. Using rhetorical discourse analysis (RDA), the study analysed 67 emails sent to staff during a three-month period at the start of the global pandemic. RDA helps to reveal how university leaders help employees make sense of changing realities. Findings: Three core narratives: organisational competence and resilience;empathy, reassurance and recognition;and community and location reveal a multi-layered understanding of leadership sensegiving discourse in which emotion intersects with material and temporal sensemaking dimensions. In supporting a process of organisational identification and belonging, these core narratives help to mitigate audience dissonance driven by the antenarrative of uncertainty. Research limitations/implications: An interpretivist approach was used to analyse qualitative data from two UK universities. While focused on internal communication, the employee perspective was not examined. Nevertheless, this paper extends the human dimension of internal crisis communication, building on constructionist approaches that are concerned with emotion and sensegiving. Originality/value: This paper expands the domain of internal crisis communication. It integrates the social construction of emotion and sensemaking with the underexplored material and temporal dimensions in internal crisis communication and applies RDA. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Yeomans, L.; Bowman, S.",Journal of Communication Management,,491

Conversely, many diseases (such as atherosclerosis, arthritis, bacterial infections (tuberculosis), viral infections (COVID-19), and cancer), cholesterol-lowering drugs (such as statins), and tetracycline-class antibiotics (such as doxycycline) alter MMP activity through transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms. In this review, we summarize evidence that the aforementioned diseases and drugs exert significant epigenetic pressure on genes encoding MMPs, tissue inhibitors of MMPs, and factors that transcriptionally regulate the expression of MMPs. Our understanding of human pathologies associated with alterations in the proteolytic activity of MMPs must consider that these pathologies and their medicinal treatments may impose epigenetic pressure on the expression of MMP genes. Whether the epigenetic mechanisms affecting the activity of MMPs can be therapeutically targeted warrants further research.","Sarker, Hassan; Haimour, Ayman; Toor, Ravneet; Fernandez-Patron, Carlos",Biomolecules,,491

The synaptic mechanisms underlying this variability are poorly understood. We show that synaptic noise, in conjunction with weak feedforward excitation, generates variable motor output in the Aplysia feeding system. A command-like neuron (CBI-10) triggers rhythmic motor programs more variable than programs triggered by CBI-2. CBI-10 weakly excites a pivotal pattern-generating interneuron (B34) strongly activated by CBI-2. The activation properties of B34 substantially account for the degree of program variability. CBI-10- and CBI-2-induced EPSPs in B34 vary in amplitude across trials, suggesting that there is synaptic noise. Computational studies show that synaptic noise is required for program variability. Further, at network state transition points when synaptic conductance is low, maximum program variability is promoted by moderate noise levels. Thus, synaptic strength and noise act together in a nonlinear manner to determine the degree of variability within a feedforward network.","Zhang, Guo; Yu, Ke; Wang, Tao; Chen, Ting-Ting; Yuan, Wang-Ding; Yang, Fan; Le, Zi-Wei; Guo, Shi-Qi; Xue, Ying-Yu; Chen, Song-An; Yang, Zhe; Liu, Feng; Cropper, Elizabeth C; Weiss, Klaudiusz R; Jing, Jian",Sci.

Furthermore, we find a high degree of heterogeneity between the pass-through estimates for different fuel types. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that pass-through rates are higher for customer groups who are more likely to exert competitive pressure by shopping for lower prices.

METHODS: In this retrospective IRB approved HIPPA compliant study, 51 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with abdominopelvic CT were included. Patients were stratified based on disease severity as outpatient (no hospital admission) and patients who were hospitalized. Subset of hospitalized patient required mechanical ventilation (MV). A radiologist blinded to the clinical outcome evaluated single axial slice on CT at L3 vertebral body for VATL3, SATL3, TATL3, and VAT/TATL3. These measures along with age, gender, and BMI were compared. A clinical model that included age, sex, and BMI was compared to clinical + CT model that also included VATL3 to discriminate hospitalized patients from outpatients. RESULTS: There were ten outpatients and 41 hospitalized patients. 11 hospitalized patients required MV. There were no significant differences in age and BMI between the hospitalized and outpatients (all p > 0.05). There was significantly higher VATL3 and VAT/TATL3 in hospitalized patients compared to the outpatients (all p < 0.05). Area under the curve (AUC) of the clinical + CT model was higher compared to the clinical model (AUC 0.847 versus 0.750) for identifying patients requiring hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Higher VATL3 was observed in COVID-19 patients that required hospitalization compared to the outpatients, and addition of VATL3 to the clinical model improved AUC in discriminating hospitalized from outpatients in this preliminary study.","Chandarana, Hersh; Dane, Bari; Mikheev, Artem; Taffel, Myles T; Feng, Yang; Rusinek, Henry",Abdom. radiology (Internet),,491

The virus started from a single organism and is escalating at a rate of 3% to 5% daily and seems to be a never ending process. Understanding the basic dynamics and presenting new predictions models for evaluating the potential effect of the virus is highly crucial. In present work, an evolutionary data analytics method called as Genetic programming (GP) is used to mathematically model the potential effect of coronavirus in 15 most affected countries of the world. Two datasets namely confirmed cases (CC) and death cases (DC) were taken into consideration to estimate, how transmission varied in these countries between January 2020 and May 2020. Further, a percentage rise in the number of daily cases is also shown till 8 June 2020 and it is expected that Brazil will have the maximum rise in CC and USA have the most DC. Also, prediction of number of new CC and DC cases for every one million people in each of these countries is presented. The proposed model predicted that the transmission of COVID-19 in China is declining since late March 2020; in Singapore, France, Italy, Germany and Spain the curve has stagnated; in case of Canada, South Africa, Iran and Turkey the number of cases are rising slowly; whereas for USA, UK, Brazil, Russia and Mexico the rate of increase is very high and control measures need to be taken to stop the chains of transmission. Apart from that, the proposed prediction models are simple mathematical equations and future predictions can be drawn from these general equations. From the experimental results and statistical validation, it can be said that the proposed models use simple linkage functions and provide highly reliable results for time series prediction of COVID-19 in these countries.","Salgotra, Rohit; Gandomi, Mostafa; Gandomi, Amir H.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,491
590572,Providing Services During a Pandemic,2020-08-14,"BACKGROUND: Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated as a result of the immune response are likely to be the most effective therapeutic antibodies, particularly in the case of infectious diseases against which the immune response is protective. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an ubiquitous opportunistic virus that is the most serious pathogenic agent in transplant patients. The available therapeutic armamentarium (e.g. HCMV hyperimmune globulins or antivirals) is associated with severe side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains; therefore, neutralizing human mAb may be a decisive alternative in the prevention of primary and re-activated HCMV infections in these patients. RESULTS: The purpose of this study was to generate neutralizing mAb against HCMV from the immunological repertoire of immune donors. To this aim, we designed an efficient technology relying on two discrete and sequential steps: first, human B-lymphocytes are stimulated with TLR9-agonists and IL-2; second, after both additives are removed, the cells are infected with EBV. Using this strategy we obtained 29 clones secreting IgG neutralizing the HCMV infectivity; four among these were further characterized. All of the mAbs neutralize the infection in different combinations of HCMV strains and target cells, with a potency ~20 fold higher than that of the HCMV hyperimmune globulins, currently used in transplant recipients. Recombinant human monoclonal IgG1 suitable as a prophylactic or therapeutic tool in clinical applications has been generated. CONCLUSION: The technology described has proven to be more reproducible, efficient and rapid than previously reported techniques, and can be adopted at low overall costs by any cell biology laboratory for the development of fully human mAbs for immunotherapeutic uses.","Funaro, Ada; Gribaudo, Giorgio; Luganini, Anna; Ortolan, Erika; Lo Buono, Nicola; Vicenzi, Elisa; Cassetta, Luca; Landolfo, Santo; Buick, Richard; Falciola, Luca; Murphy, Marianne; Garotta, Gianni; Malavasi, Fabio",BMC Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6750-8-85; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19014469/,491

With this data some clinicians have incorporated thromboprophylaxis with higher dose heparin into the management of this patients, to date there´s no information of the effect of this intervention. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort, including consecutive critical and non-critical adults admitted to a referral center in Mexico City, between March 18 and May 19, all with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV 2. Conventional coagulation test results were collected on admission and during hospitalization; use of anticoagulation, and patient outcomes were recorded, all patients had been discharged at the time of the final analysis. Thromboprophylaxis was administered according to institutional recommendations and individual medical criteria, we defined anticoagulant dose according to each medication. We compared the basal characteristics and outcomes in critical and non-critical patients. We evaluated the factors associated with thrombosis, bleeding, and mortality using the Cox Regression Model. Results: We evaluated 447 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19, median age was 50 years (range,18-91), 62.6 % were male, 111 (24.8%) were critical. At admission 156 patients (34.9%) had D-dimer values above 3000 ng/mL, median fibrinogen was 651 mg/dL (range 130-1095), APTT was prolonged (> 3 seconds) in 179 patients (40%), and INR >1.2 in 26 patients (5.8%), median platelet value 215 X103/uL (range 33-666). Thromboprophylaxis’ dosages were prophylactic in 267 (59.7%), intermediate in 75 (16.8%) and therapeutic in 91 (20.4%), 14 patients (3.1%) did not receive any medical thromboprophylaxis and 26 patients (5.8%) received aspirin during hospitalization. According to the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis’ criteria (ISTH criteria) 40 patients (8.9%) had overt-DIC, sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) was present in 28 patients (6.3%), and high risk for bleeding by IMPROVE score ≥7 points was found in 5 patients (1.1%). Overall thrombotic event (TE) was confirmed in five patients (1.1%), arterial thrombosis events in 0.4%, one stroke and one acute myocardial infarction; radiographically confirmed venous thrombosis in 0.67%, two with pulmonary embolism (PE) and one with deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The TE were more common in critical than in non-critical patients (3.6% vs 0.3%). The number of CT pulmonary angiogram or duplex ultrasounds performed when PE/DVT was suspected was eighteen (4%), eight (47%) non-critically ill and ten (53%) in the ICU; the rate of radiographically positive results was 22.2%. The overall major bleeding rate was 2.5%, of these 91% were in the ICU. Mortality was 23.5% in the cohort. Table 1. No factors were found to be associated with thrombosis. The factors associated with bleeding were an INR >1.2 (HR 9.0, 95% CI 1.2-67.3, p 0.03), IMPROVE score ≥7 (HR 81.3, 95% CI 11.9-555.6, p < 0.01), and mechanical ventilation (HR 33.1, 95% CI 4.1-262.2, p 0.01). Factors associated with mortality were: age >70 (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.2, p <0.01), D-Dimer >3000 ng/mL (HR 2.0,95% CI 1.2-3.4, p <0.01), and mechanical ventilation (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.01-2.8, p = 0.02). The presence of more than 450x109/L platelets was associated with reduced mortality (HR 0.31 95% CI 0.19-0.50). Figure 1 Discussion: The late outbreak of COVID-19 in Latin America had led to an empiric use of aggressive thromboprophylaxis. Our data shows a low TE rate as compared with other groups, nevertheless we cannot prove a direct impact of the aggressive thromboprophylaxis, firstly because of the low rate or events, and secondly, due to the limitations of an observational study. On the other hand, the incidence of PE/DVT is conditioned by the number of studies performed, yet radiological confirmation has proven difficult due to concerns about virus exposure. Regarding the security of the intervention, major bleeding rates were slightly higher to what has been otherwise reported, but with no bleeding related deaths. The benefit of higher anticoagulant doses most be shown in clinical trials before we can recommend their generalized use in COVID-19 patients.

Stem cells, which are undifferentiated cells retaining self-renewal potential, excessive proliferation and differentiation capacity into offspring or daughter cells that form different lineage cells of an organism, are considered as an important part of the RM approaches. They have been widely investigated in preclinical and clinical studies for therapeutic purposes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are the vital mediators that regulate the therapeutic effects of stem cells. Besides, they carry various types of cargo between cells which make them a significant contributor of intercellular communication. Given their role in physiological and pathological conditions in living cells, EVs are considered as a new therapeutic alternative solution for a variety of diseases in which there is a high unmet clinical need. This review aims to summarize and identify therapeutic potential of stem cells and EVs in diseases requiring acute emergency care such as trauma, heart diseases, stroke, acute respiratory distress syndrome and burn injury. Diseases that affect militaries or societies including acute radiation syndrome, sepsis and viral pandemics such as novel coronavirus disease 2019 are also discussed. Additionally, featuring and problematic issues that hamper clinical translation of stem cells and EVs are debated in a comparative manner with a futuristic perspective.

OBJECTIVES: The RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit covering 14 respiratory viruses was compared to the RespiFinder Smart22, a broad-spectrum multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) test, targeting 22 viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. STUDY DESIGN: After verification of its analytical performance, the clinical performance of the RespiFinder Smart22 was evaluated by re-analysis of 96 respiratory samples from oncological patients. Additionally, the time to result (TTR) of both methods was compared. RESULTS: The analytical performance of the RespiFinder Smart22 fulfilled all previously specified criteria. Concordant results in both assays were achieved in 74.0% of all clinical specimens and in 91.2% when only positive results were taken into account. The RespiFinder Smart22 yielded additional results in a total of 22 (22.9% of 96) samples due to higher test sensitivity and a broader, highly multiplexed spectrum of pathogens. The TTR of a typical routine test consisting of three samples were 206 and 356 min for the RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit and the RespiFinder Smart22, respectively. However, hands-on time was reduced by 59.0% applying the MLPA method. CONCLUSIONS: In our hands, the RespiFinder Smart22 showed excellent analytical performance while hands-on time was halved in comparison to the RT PCR method. Regarding the clinical evaluation, the MLPA method provided additional results in 22.9% (22/96) of specimens due to its comprehensive format, higher test sensitivity and the capability to detect 22 pathogens compared to 14 with the RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit.","Berning, Lucia; Aberle, Stephan W.; Simon, Benedikt; Luger, Christoph; Apfalter, Petra; Machherndl-Spandl, Sigrid; Kerschner, Heidrun",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.02.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214000900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684925/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214000900,491

598850,Revamping Residency Education during a Pandemic with Twitter-Based Learning,2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND: This is the first randomised controlled trial for assessment of the immunogenicity and safety of a candidate non-replicating adenovirus type-5 (Ad5)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine, aiming to determine an appropriate dose of the candidate vaccine for an efficacy study. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of the Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine was done in a single centre in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged 18 years or older, who were HIV-negative and previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-free, were eligible to participate and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine at a dose of 1 × 10(11) viral particles per mL or 5 × 10(10) viral particles per mL, or placebo. Investigators allocated participants at a ratio of 2:1:1 to receive a single injection intramuscularly in the arm. The randomisation list (block size 4) was generated by an independent statistician. Participants, investigators, and staff undertaking laboratory analyses were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of specific ELISA antibody responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralising antibody responses at day 28. The primary endpoint for safety evaluation was the incidence of adverse reactions within 14 days. All recruited participants who received at least one dose were included in the primary and safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04341389. FINDINGS: 603 volunteers were recruited and screened for eligibility between April 11 and 16, 2020. 508 eligible participants (50% male; mean age 39·7 years, SD 12·5) consented to participate in the trial and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (1 × 10(11) viral particles n=253; 5 × 10(10) viral particles n=129) or placebo (n=126). In the 1 × 10(11) and 5 × 10(10) viral particles dose groups, the RBD-specific ELISA antibodies peaked at 656·5 (95% CI 575·2–749·2) and 571·0 (467·6–697·3), with seroconversion rates at 96% (95% CI 93–98) and 97% (92–99), respectively, at day 28. Both doses of the vaccine induced significant neutralising antibody responses to live SARS-CoV-2, with GMTs of 19·5 (95% CI 16·8–22·7) and 18·3 (14·4–23·3) in participants receiving 1 × 10(11) and 5 × 10(10) viral particles, respectively. Specific interferon γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses post vaccination were observed in 227 (90%, 95% CI 85–93) of 253 and 113 (88%, 81–92) of 129 participants in the 1 × 10(11) and 5 × 10(10) viral particles dose groups, respectively. Solicited adverse reactions were reported by 183 (72%) of 253 and 96 (74%) of 129 participants in the 1 × 10(11) and 5 × 10(10) viral particles dose groups, respectively. Severe adverse reactions were reported by 24 (9%) participants in the 1 × 10(11) viral particles dose group and one (1%) participant in the 5 × 10(10) viral particles dose group. No serious adverse reactions were documented. INTERPRETATION: The Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine at 5 × 10(10) viral particles is safe, and induced significant immune responses in the majority of recipients after a single immunisation.

601487,Leadership Institute for Faculty Development,2021-01-20,"Increasing evidence points to an important role for neutrophils in participating in the pathogenesis of the human demyelinating disease MS and the animal model EAE. Therefore, a better understanding of the signals controlling migration of neutrophils as well as evaluating the role of these cells in demyelination is important to define cellular components that contribute to disease in MS patients. In this study, we examined the functional role of the chemokine CXCL1 in contributing to neuroinflammation and demyelination in EAE. Using transgenic mice in which expression of CXCL1 is under the control of a tetracycline‐inducible promoter active within glial fibrillary acidic protein‐positive cells, we have shown that sustained CXCL1 expression within the CNS increased the severity of clinical and histologic disease that was independent of an increase in the frequency of encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17 cells. Rather, disease was associated with enhanced recruitment of CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) neutrophils into the spinal cord. Targeting neutrophils resulted in a reduction in demyelination arguing for a role for these cells in myelin damage. Collectively, these findings emphasize that CXCL1‐mediated attraction of neutrophils into the CNS augments demyelination suggesting that this signaling pathway may offer new targets for therapeutic intervention.","Grist, Jonathan J.; Marro, Brett S.; Skinner, Dominic D.; Syage, Amber R.; Worne, Colleen; Doty, Daniel J.; Fujinami, Robert S.; Lane, Thomas E.",Eur J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29697856/; https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201747442,491

At the time of survey, fewer than 150 children in Australia and New Zealand had documented infection. The aim of this study was to assess attitudes, readiness and confidence in the early stages of the COVID‐19 pandemic through an online survey of paediatric physicians and sub‐specialists across Australia and New Zealand. METHODS: Multiple email list groups were used to contact paediatric physicians to undertake an online Likert scale survey between 17 and 24 March. Respondents' specialty, experience and work setting were recorded. Ordinal logistic regression was used to determine respondent factors. RESULTS: There were 542 respondents from across Australia and New Zealand: an estimated 11% of the paediatric physician workforce. A minority (36.6%) agreed that their national response had been well coordinated; the majority (92.7%) agreed that senior‐level hospital administrators were taking the situation seriously. Most reported a good understanding of the natural history of COVID‐19 in children, and knowledge of where to find local information. A large proportion of physicians (86.1%) were worried about becoming infected through their work; few (5.8%) reported that they would not come to work to avoid infection. Closure of school and childcares would reduce the ability to continue work at current capacity for 23.6% of respondents. CONCLUSION: Despite limited experience in pandemics, most paediatric physicians felt informed. Concern about exposure at work is common; most were willing to work regardless. The closure of schools and daycares may have an impact on staffing. Coordination and leadership will be critical.","Foley, David A; Kirk, Michael; Jepp, Catherine; Brophy‐Williams, Sam; Tong, Steven Y C; Davis, Joshua S; Blyth, Christopher C; O'Brien, Matthew P; Bowen, Asha C; Yeoh, Daniel K",J Paediatr Child Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32364301/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.14903,491

We used detailed staffing data to examine the relationship between a novel measure of staff size (that is, the number of unique employees working daily), conventional measures of staffing quality, and COVID-19 outcomes among SNFs in the United States without confirmed COVID-19 cases by June 2020. By the end of September 2020, sample SNFs in the lowest quartile of staff size had 6.2 resident cases and 0.9 deaths per 100 beds, compared with 11.9 resident cases and 2.1 deaths per 100 beds among facilities in the highest quartile. Staff size, including staff members not involved in resident care, was strongly associated with SNFs' COVID-19 outcomes, even after facility size was accounted for. Conventional staffing quality measures, including direct care staff-to-resident ratios and skill mix, were not significant predictors of COVID-19 cases or deaths. Reducing the number of unique staff members without decreasing direct care hours, such as by relying on full-time rather than part-time staff, could help prevent outbreaks.","McGarry, Brian E; Gandhi, Ashvin D; Grabowski, David C; Barnett, Michael Lawrence",Health affairs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260313/; https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.00323,491

This was followed by a Microsoft Teams seminar in which the students discussed their questions in subgroups on the basis of their reading and developed a team product they then presented to the other team. Students valued this module as enabling a safe space for their beliefs and views. A vast majority deemed the topics as relevant, two thirds would retake the seminar.

Four COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed by Pfizer, Moderna, University of Oxford/ Astra Zeneca (also Oxford/ Serum Institute of India) and ICMR/ Bharat Biotech have been granted emergency use authorization in the democratic world following established clinical trial procedures in their respective countries. Vaccination of the general public is expected to begin in several weeks. We consider the question of whether people who have received the vaccine can be selectively and immediately cleared to return to normal activities, including hassle-free travel. Methods. We use a delay differential equation model developed previously by our group to calculate the effects of vaccinee ``immunity passports'' on the spreading trajectories of the disease. We consider default virus strains as well as high-transmissibility variants such as B1.1.7 in our analysis. Results. We find that with high vaccine efficacy of 80 percent or greater, vaccinees may be immediately cleared for normal life with no significant increase in case counts. Free travel of such vaccinees between two regions should not jeopardize the infection control performance of either. At current vaccine administration rates, it may be eight months or more before COVID-19 transmission is significantly reduced or eliminated. With lower vaccine efficacy of approximately 60 percent however, social as well as travel restrictions for vaccinees may need to remain in place until transmission of the disease is eliminated. Conclusions. Designing high-efficacy vaccines with easily scalable manufacturing and distribution capacity should remain on the priority list in academic as well as industrial circles. Performance of all vaccines should continue to be monitored in real time during vaccination drive with a view to analysing socio-demographic determinants if any of efficacy, and optimizing distribution accordingly. A speedy and efficacious vaccination drive will provide the smoothest path out of the pandemic with the least additional caseloads, death toll and socioeconomic cost.","Shayak, B.; Sharma, M.

We tested the feasibility of setting up a UK sarcopenia registry, the feasibility of recruitment methods and sought to characterise the pilot registry population. METHODS: six diverse UK sites took part, with potential participants aged 65 and over approached via mailshots from local primary care practices. Telephone pre-screening using the SARC-F score was followed by in-person screening and baseline visit. Co-morbidities, medications, grip strength, Short Physical Performance Battery, bioimpedance analysis, Geriatric Depression Score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Sarcopenia Quality of Life score were performed and permission sought for future recontact. Descriptive statistics for recruitment rates and baseline measures were generated; an embedded randomised trial examined the effect of a University logo on the primary care mailshot on recruitment rates.

We identified both space-time (SaTScan) and transmission (MST-DBSCAN) clusters; we estimated their duration, their transmission behavior (emergence, growth, reduction, etc.) and relative risk. For each cluster, we computed the within number of individuals, their median age and viral load. Among 1'684 space-time clusters identified, 457 (27.1%) were significant (p[≤]0.05), i.e. harboring a higher relative risk of infection, as compared to other regions. They lasted a median of 11 days (IQR 7-13) and included a median of 12 individuals per cluster (IQR 5-20). The majority of significant clusters (n=260; 56.9 %) had at least one person with an extremely high viral load (above 1 billion copies/ml). Those clusters were considerably larger (median of 17 infected individuals, p<0.001) than clusters with subjects showing a viral load lower than 1 million copies/ml (median of 3 infected individuals). The highest viral loads were found in clusters with the lowest average age, while clusters with the highest average age had low to middle viral load. Interestingly, in 20 significant clusters the viral load of three first cases were all below 100'000 copies/ml suggesting that subjects with less than 100'000 copies/ml may still have been contagious. Noteworthy, the dynamics of transmission clusters made it possible to identify three diffusion zones, which mainly differentiated rural from urban areas, the latter being more prone to last and spread in a new nearby clusters. The use of geographic information is key for public health decision makers to mitigate the spread of the virus. This study suggests that early localization of clusters help implementing targeted protective measures limiting the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Ladoy, A.; Opota, O.; Carron, P.-N.; Guessous, I.; Vuilleumier, S.; Joost, S.; Greub, G.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.16.21251641; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.16.21251641v1?rss=1,491

Despite of the importance of EV71, the nonstructural protein 3AB from this virus is little understood for its function during EV71 replication. Here we expressed EV71 3AB protein as recombinant protein in a eukaryotic expression system and uncovered that this protein possesses a nucleic acid helix-destabilizing and strand annealing acceleration activity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that EV71 3AB is a nucleic acid chaperone protein. Moreover, we characterized the RNA chaperone activity of EV71 3AB, and revealed that divalent metal ions, such as Mg(2+) and Zn(2+), were able to inhibit the RNA helix-destabilizing activity of 3AB to different extents. Moreover, we determined that 3B plus the last 7 amino acids at the C-terminal of 3A (termed 3B+7) possess the RNA chaperone activity, and five amino acids, i.e. Lys-80, Phe-82, Phe-85, Tyr-89, and Arg-103, are critical and probably the active sites of 3AB for its RNA chaperone activity.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected trauma database was reviewed at a level 1 major trauma centre from 1 December 2020 to 18 February 2021 looking at demographics, clinical characteristics, and nosocomial infections and compared to our previously published first wave data (26 January 2020 to 14 April 2020). RESULTS: From 1 December 2020 to 18 February 2021, 522 major trauma patients were identified with a mean age of 54.6 years, and 53.4% (n = 279) were male. Common admissions were falls (318; 60.9%) and road traffic accidents (RTAs; 71 (13.6%); 262 of these patients (50.2%) had surgery. In all, 75 patients (14.4%) tested positive for COVID-19, of which 51 (68%) were nosocomial. Surgery on COVID-19 patients increased to 46 (61.3%) in the second wave compared to 13 (33.3%) in the first wave (p = 0.005). ICU admissions of patients with COVID-19 infection increased from two (5.1%) to 16 (20.5%), respectively (p = 0.024). Second wave mortality was 6.1% (n = 32) compared to first wave of 4.7% (n = 31). Cardiovascular (CV) disease (35.9%; n = 14); p = 0.027) and dementia (17.9%; n = 7); p = 0.030) were less in second wave than the first. Overall, 13 patients (25.5%) were Black, Asian and Minority ethnic (BAME), and five (9.8%) had a BMI > 30 kg/m(2). The mean time from admission to diagnosis of COVID-19 was 13.9 days (3 to 44). Overall, 12/75 (16%) of all COVID-19 patients died. CONCLUSION: During the second wave, COVID-19 infected three-times more patients.

Some mechanisms have been suggested which might explain the adverse cardiovascular reactions to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Different vaccine platforms are currently available which include live attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, vector vaccines, DNA vaccines and RNA vaccines. Vaccines increase the endogenous synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins from a variety of cells. Once synthetized, the Spike proteins assembled in the cytoplasma migrate to the cell surface and protrude with a native-like conformation. These proteins are recognized by the immune system which rapidly develops an immune response. Such response appears to be quite vigorous in the presence of DNA vaccines which encode viral vectors, as well as in subjects who are immunized because of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The resulting pathological features may resemble those of active coronavirus disease. The free-floating Spike proteins synthetized by cells targeted by vaccine and destroyed by the immune response circulate in the blood and systematically interact with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expressed by a variety of cells including platelets, thereby promoting ACE2 internalization and degradation. These reactions may ultimately lead to platelet aggregation, thrombosis and inflammation mediated by several mechanisms including platelet ACE2 receptors. Whereas Phase III vaccine trials generally excluded participants with previous immunization, vaccination of huge populations in the real life will inevitably include individuals with preexisting immunity. This might lead to excessively enhanced inflammatory and thrombotic reactions in occasional subjects. Further research is urgently needed in this area.","Angeli, Fabio; Spanevello, Antonio; Reboldi, Gianpaolo; Visca, Dina; Verdecchia, Paolo",Eur J Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33966930/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953620521001424?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2021.04.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0953620521001424,491
624271,PreKindergarten and kindergarten virtual school programs under COVID‐19: A two‐case comparative study,2020-10-22,"OBJECTIVES: Healthcare personnel (HCP) are at an increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection especially in resource-restricted healthcare settings, and return to homes unfit for self-isolation, making them apprehensive about COVID-19 duty and transmission risk to their families. We aimed at implementing a novel multidimensional HCP-centric evidence-based, dynamic policy with the objectives to reduce risk of HCP infection, ensure welfare and safety of the HCP and to improve willingness to accept and return to duty. SETTING: Our tertiary care university hospital, with 12 600 HCP, was divided into high-risk, medium-risk and low-risk zones. In the high-risk and medium-risk zones, we organised training, logistic support, postduty HCP welfare and collected feedback, and sent them home after they tested negative for COVID-19. We supervised use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and kept communication paperless. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited willing low-risk HCP, aged <50 years, with no comorbidities to work in COVID-19 zones. Social distancing, hand hygiene and universal masking were advocated in the low-risk zone. RESULTS: Between 31 March and 20 July 2020, we clinically screened 5553 outpatients, of whom 3012 (54.2%) were COVID-19 suspects managed in the medium-risk zone. Among them, 346 (11.4%) tested COVID-19 positive (57.2% male) and were managed in the high-risk zone with 19 (5.4%) deaths. One (0.08%) of the 1224 HCP in high-risk zone, 6 (0.62%) of 960 HCP in medium-risk zone and 23 (0.18%) of the 12 600 HCP in the low-risk zone tested positive at the end of shift. All the 30 COVID-19-positive HCP have since recovered. This HCP-centric policy resulted in low transmission rates (<1%), ensured satisfaction with training (92%), PPE (90.8%), medical and psychosocial support (79%) and improved acceptance of COVID-19 duty with 54.7% volunteering for re-deployment. CONCLUSION: A multidimensional HCP-centric policy was effective in ensuring safety, satisfaction and welfare of HCP in a resource-poor setting and resulted in a willing workforce to fight the pandemic.","Dutta, Usha; Sachan, Anurag; Premkumar, Madhumita; Gupta, Tulika; Sahoo, Swapnajeet; Grover, Sandeep; Sharma, Sugandhi; Lakshmi, P V M; Talati, Shweta; Biswal, Manisha; Suri, Vikas; Singh, Mini P; Ghai, Babita; Chhabra, Rajesh; Bharti, Bhavneet; Samanta, Jayanta; Arora, Pankaj; Mohindra, Ritin; Malhotra, Sunita; Singh, Gurmeet; Guru, Rashmi Ranjan; Pandey, Navin; Koushal, Vipin; Kumar, Ashok; Bhogal, Ranjitpal Singh; Aggarwal, Arun K; Goel, Kapil; Malhotra, Pankaj; Yaddanapudi, Narayana; Mahajan, Pranay; Thakur, J S; Sehgal, Rakesh; Ghosh, Arnab; Sehgal, Inderpaul Singh; Agarwal, Ritesh; Jayashree, Muralidharan; Bhalla, Ashish; Jain, Sanjay; Kochhar, Rakesh; Chakrabarti, Arunaloke; Puri, Goverdhan Dutt; Ram, Jagat",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619195/,491

Due to constraints in medical care systems, technological solutions should be applied to diagnose, monitor, and alert about the disease’s progress for patients receiving care at home. Some sleep disturbances, such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, can increase the risk for COVID-19 patients. This paper proposes an approach to evaluating patients’ sleep quality with the aim of detecting sleep disturbances caused by pneumonia and other COVID-19-related pathologies. We describe a non-invasive sensor network that is used for sleep monitoring and evaluate the feasibility of an approach for training a machine learning model to detect possible COVID-19-related sleep disturbances. We also discuss a cloud-based approach for the implementation of the proposed system for processing the data streams. Based on the preliminary results, we conclude that sleep disturbances are detectable with affordable and non-invasive sensors.","Dimitrievski, Ace; Zdravevski, Eftim; Lameski, Petre; Villasana, María Vanessa; Miguel Pires, Ivan; Garcia, Nuno M.; Flórez-Revuelta, Francisco; Trajkovik, Vladimir",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21093030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925869/,491

Several subcellular locations and topological conformations of E protein have been proposed. To identify the correct ones, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for the amino or the carboxy terminus of E protein, respectively, were generated. E protein was mainly found in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) of cells transfected with a plasmid encoding E protein or infected with SARS-CoV. No evidence of E protein presence in the plasma membrane was found by using immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy and cell surface protein labeling. In addition, measurement of plasma membrane voltage gated ion channel activity by whole-cell patch clamp suggested that E protein was not present in the plasma membrane. A topological conformation in which SARS-CoV E protein amino terminus is oriented towards the lumen of intracellular membranes and carboxy terminus faces cell cytoplasm is proposed.","Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; DeDiego, Marta L.; Álvarez, Enrique; Jiménez-Guardeño, Jose M.; Regla-Nava, Jose A.; Llorente, Mercedes; Kremer, Leonor; Shuo, Shen; Enjuanes, Luis",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682211001541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21524776/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.03.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682211001541,491

The social determinants of health such as education, work, social security, housing, environment, support networks and social cohesion are important aspects to consider for the control and intervention of this pathology. Therefore, it is essential to have information about the progress of the infections at the national level and thus apply effective public health interventions. Objectives: In this paper, we compare different time series methodologies to predict the number of confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 in Chile and thus support the decisions of health agencies. Methods: We modeled the confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 in Chile by using ARIMA models, exponential smoothing techniques, Poisson models for time-dependent counting data. In addition, we evaluated the accuracy of the predictions by using a training set and test set. Results: The database used in this paper allows us to say that for the confirmed Covid-19 cases the best model corresponds to a well-known Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time-series model, whereas for deaths from Covid-19 in Chile the best model resulted in damped trend method. Conclusions: ARIMA models are an alternative to model the behavior of the spread of Covid-19, however, and depending on the characteristics of the data set, other methodologies can better capture the behavior of these records, for example, Holt-winter is method and time-dependent counting models.","Barria-Sandoval, C.; Ferreira, G.; Benz-Parra, K.; Lopez-Flores, P.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249085; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.20249085v1?rss=1,491
637336,Estimating and Projecting Air Passenger Traffic during the COVID-19 Coronavirus Outbreak and its Socio-Economic Impact,2020-05-06,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has the Spike glycoprotein (S) which is crucial in attachment with host receptor and cell entry leading to COVID-19 infection. The current study was conducted to explore drugs against Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 using in silico pharmacophore modelling and virtual screening approach to combat COVID-19. METHODS: All the available sequences of RBD in NCBI were retrieved and multiple aligned to get insight into its diversity. The 3D structure of RBD was modelled and the conserved region was used as a template to design pharmacophore using LigandScout. Lead compounds were screened using Cambridge, Drugbank, ZINC and TIMBLE databases and these identified lead compounds were screened for their toxicity and Lipinski's rule of five. Molecular docking of shortlisted lead compounds was performed using AutoDock Vina and interacting residues were visualized. RESULTS: Active residues of Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) in S, involved in interaction with receptor, were found to be conserved in all 483 sequences. Using this RBM motif as a pharmacophore a total of 1327 lead compounds were predicted initially from all databases, however, only eight molecules fit the criteria for safe oral drugs. Conclusion: The RBM region of S interacts with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) to mediate viral entry. Based on in silico analysis, the lead compounds scrutinized herewith interact with S, hence, can prevent its internalization in cell using ACE2 and GRP78 receptor. The compounds predicted in this study are based on rigorous computational analysis and the evaluation of predicted lead compounds can be promising in experimental studies.","Shehroz, Muhammad; Zaheer, Tahreem; Hussain, Tanveer",Heliyon,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844020321216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083627/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844020321216; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05278,491

The emergence and disappearance of this pathogen have brought questions regarding its source and evolution. Within the genome sequences of 281 SARS-CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs), a ~430 bp genomic region (from 27 701 bp to 28 131 bp in AY390556.1) with regular variations was investigated. This ~430 bp region overlaps with the ORF8 gene and is prone to deletions and nucleotide substitutions. Its complexity suggested the need for a new genotyping method for coronaviruses related to SARS-similar coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, SARSr-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Bat SARSr-CoV presented 3 genotypes, of which type 0 is only seen in bat SARSr-CoV, type I is present in SARS in the early phase, and type II is found in all SARS-CoV-2. This genotyping also shows potential usage in distinguishing the SARS-similar coronaviruses from different hosts and geographic areas.

To address recent concerns over age-based ICU decision-making, we explored patient-assessed quality of life (QoL) in ICU survivors before the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies published between January 2000 and April 2020, of elderly patients admitted to ICUs. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We extracted data on self-reported QoL (EQ-5D composite score), demographic and clinical variables. Using a random-effect meta-analysis, we then compared QoL scores at follow-up to scores either before admission, age-matched population controls or younger ICU survivors. We conducted sensitivity analyses to study heterogeneity and bias and a qualitative synthesis of subscores. RESULTS: We identified 2536 studies and included 22 for qualitative synthesis and 18 for meta-analysis (n=2326 elderly survivors). Elderly survivors’ QoL was significantly worse than younger ICU survivors, with a small-to-medium effect size (d=0.35 (−0.53 and −0.16)). Elderly survivors’ QoL was also significantly greater when measured slightly before ICU, compared with follow-up, with a small effect size (d=0.26 (−0.44 and −0.08)). Finally, their QoL was also marginally significantly worse than age-matched community controls, also with a small effect size (d=0.21 (−0.43 and 0.00)). Mortality rates and length of follow-up partly explained heterogeneity. Reductions in QoL seemed primarily due to physical health, rather than mental health items. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the proportionality of age as a determinant of ICU resource allocation should be kept under close review and that subjective QoL outcomes should inform person-centred decision -aking in elderly ICU patients.

This disease is characterized by important damage at a multi-organ level, partially due to the abundant expression of ACE2 in practically all human tissues. However, not every organ in which ACE2 is abundant is affected by SARS-CoV-2, which suggests the existence of other multi-organ routes for transmitting the perturbations produced by the virus. We consider here diffusive processes through the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network of proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 as an alternative route. We found a subdiffusive regime that allows the propagation of virus perturbations through the PPI network at a significant rate. By following the main subdiffusive routes across the PPI network, we identify proteins mainly expressed in the heart, cerebral cortex, thymus, testis, lymph node, kidney, among others of the organs reported to be affected by COVID-19.","Estrada, Ernesto",Chaos,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0015626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32872802/,491

Digital contact tracing, the Apple/Google API and big tech’s newfound role as global health policy makers",2020-07-18,"BackgroundCurrent transmission rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still increasing and many countries are facing second waves of infections. Rapid SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is often unavailable but could support public health organizations and hospitals in monitoring and determining transmission links. Here we report the use of reverse complement polymerase chain reaction (RC-PCR), a novel technology for WGS of SARS-CoV-2 enabling library preparation in a single PCR saving time, resources and enables high throughput screening. Additionally, we show SARS-CoV-2 diversity and possible transmission within the Radboud university medical center (Radboudumc) during September 2020 using RC-PCR WGS. MethodsA total of 173 samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and September 2020 were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Ct values of the samples ranged from 16 to 42. They were collected from 83 healthcare workers and three patients at the Radboudumc, in addition to 64 people living in the area around the hospital and tested by the local health services. For validation purposes, nineteen of the included samples were previously sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technologies and compared to RC-PCR WGS results. The applicability of RC-PCR WGS in outbreak analysis for public health service and hospitals was tested on six suspected clusters containing samples of healthcare workers and patients with an epidemiological link. FindingsRC-PCR resulted in sequencing data for 146 samples. It showed a genome coverage of up to 98,2% for samples with a maximum Ct value of 32. Comparison to Oxford Nanopore technologies gives a near-perfect agreement on 95% of the samples (18 out of 19). Three out of six clusters with a suspected epidemiological link were fully confirmed, in the others, four healthcare workers were not associated. In the public health service samples, a previously unknown chain of transmission was confirmed. Significance statementSAR-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing using RC-PCR is a reliable technique and applicable for use in outbreak analysis and surveillance. Its ease of use, high-trough screening capacity and wide applicability makes it a valuable addition or replacement during this ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. FundingNone Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAt present whole genome sequencing techniques for SARS-CoV-2 have a large turnover time and are not widely available. Only a few laboratories are currently able to perform large scale SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. This restricts the use of sequencing to aid hospital and community infection prevention. Added value of this studyHere we present clinical and technical data on a novel Whole Genome Sequencing technology, implementing reverse-complement PCR. It is able to obtain high genome coverage of SARS-CoV-2 and confirm and exclude epidemiological links in 173 healthcare workers and patients. The RC-PCR technology simplifies the workflow thereby reducing hands on time. It combines targeted PCR and sequence library construction in a single PCR, which normally takes several steps.

653805,Self-Regulated Resource Management in Emergency Remote Higher Education: Status Quo and Predictors,2021-06-02,"AIM: This study evaluates a healthcare walk-in centre in an immigrant-dense area from the perspective of Swedish-born patients. BACKGROUND: The studied healthcare centre started a walk-in centre to increase healthcare accessibility for immigrants. This form of care is not primarily for Swedish-born patients although everyone is welcome. For this reason, it is important to evaluate the walk-in centre from different perspectives: the healthcare workers, the immigrant patients, and in this study focusing on the Swedish-born patients. METHOD: This qualitative exploratory study used content analysis to analyse data collected from semi-structured interviews. Semi-structured interviews were held with 12 purposively sampled Swedish-born patients visiting a healthcare centre in Sweden. FINDINGS: Most informants characterised the care they received as professional and timely and noted that accessibility was the main reason they sought care at the walk-in centre. In addition, they noted that being able to seek care on the day they want creates a feeling of security. However, Swedish-born informants seemed to prefer a traditional healthcare centre, although they viewed the walk-in centre as legitimate because everyone has access to it. CONCLUSION: As the walk-in centre was perceived as having good accessibility, participants experienced that they could easily receive help for minor health problems. However, they also identified several ways the walk-in centre could be improved. For example, some participants preferred to remain outside while awaiting their turn to see a healthcare provider and wanted immigrant patients to leave their relatives at home when possible to minimise the risk of spreading infection. In addition, some participants thought a triage system could be implemented so that more severe cases could advance more quickly in the queue. The homogeneous sample of informants raises questions about whether this healthcare model is indeed accessible to everyone.","Wärdig, Rikard; Hadziabdic, Emina; Hjelm, Katarina",Prim Health Care Res Dev,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1463423621000189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883054/,491

The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino acid fragment of the 1273-amino acid S-protein protomer. Antibodies to the RBD domain of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a closely related coronavirus which emerged in 2002-2003, have been shown to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-1 S-protein-mediated entry, and the presence of anti-RBD antibodies correlates with neutralization in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera. Here we show that immunization with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD elicits a robust neutralizing antibody response in rodents, comparable to 100 µg/ml of ACE2-Ig, a potent SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor. Importantly, anti-sera from immunized animals did not mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of S-protein-mediated entry under conditions in which Zika virus ADE was readily observed. These data suggest that an RBD-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 could be safe and effective.","Quinlan, Brian D.; Mou, Huihui; Zhang, Lizhou; Guo, Yan; He, Wenhui; Ojha, Amrita; Parcells, Mark S.; Luo, Guangxiang; Li, Wenhui; Zhong, Guocai; Choe, Hyeryun; Farzan, Michael",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.036418,491

655095,Quantitative mapping of patented technology — The case of electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite,2009-09-30,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In this study, we used field and literature surveys, call recordings, photographs, landscape models and molecular tools to estimate the presence, range and status of amphibians in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We found 18 native species and the suspected presence of Karsenia koreana and two Onychodactylus species. We also determined northern range boundaries for Rana uenoi and Dryophytes japonicus with molecular tools. Based on distribution and modelling, we can expect the contact zone between species within the Rana and Onychodactylus genera to be located along the Changbai Massif, a high mountain range. The species richness was higher in the lowlands and at lower latitudes, with up to 11 species, while species richness in northern areas was half that value. Following the categories and criteria of The IUCN Red List of species, ecological models and known threats, we recommended ten species to be listed as threatened at the national level. The ecology of species in the DPR Korea is understudied, although species reliant on agricultural wetlands (e.g., rice paddies) are not as threatened as species living in forested areas due to the enduring presence of extensive agricultural landscapes. ABSTRACT: Determining the range, status, ecology and behaviour of species from areas where surveys and samplings are uncommon or difficult to conduct is a challenge, such as in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPR Korea). Here, we used genetic samples, field surveys, call recordings, photographic identification and a literature review to estimate the presence, range and status of amphibians in the DPR Korea. From our combined results and based on the IUCN Red List categories and criteria, we were able to estimate the national threat levels for most species. Our results demonstrated the presence of 18 native species and the suspected presence of Karsenia koreana and two Onychodactylus species. We reported the first record for Rana uenoi in the vicinity of Pyongyang using molecular tools and similarly confirmed the presence of Dryophytes japonicus at the same location. Based on distribution and modelling, we can expect the contact zone between species within the Rana and Onychodactylus genera to be located along the Changbai Massif, a mountain range that marks a shift in ecoregions and acts as a barrier to dispersion. The species richness was higher in the lowlands and at lower latitudes, with such areas populated by up to 11 species, while more northern regions were characterised by species richness of about half of that value. The combination of ecological models and known threats resulted in the recommendation of ten species as threatened at the national level following the IUCN Red List categories and criteria. This high number of threatened species was anticipated based on the high threat level to amphibians in bordering nations and globally. While the ecology of species in the DPR Korea is still understudied, we argue that species relying on agricultural wetlands such as rice paddies are not under imminent threat due to the enduring presence of extensive agricultural landscapes with low rates of chemical use and mechanisation. The maintenance of such landscapes is a clear benefit to amphibian species, in contrast to more industrialised agricultural landscapes in neighbouring nations. In comparison, the status of species dependent on forested habitats is unclear and threat levels are likely to be higher because of deforestation, as in neighbouring nations.","Borzée, Amaël; Litvinchuk, Spartak N.; Ri, Kyongsim; Andersen, Desiree; Nam, Tu Yong; Jon, Gwang Hyok; Man, Ho Song; Choe, Jong Sik; Kwon, Sera; Othman, Siti N.; Messenger, Kevin; Bae, Yoonhyuk; Shin, Yucheol; Kim, Ajoung; Maslova, Irina; Luedtke, Jennifer; Hobin, Louise; Moores, Nial; Seliger, Bernhard; Glenk, Felix; Jang, Yikweon",Animals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11072057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34359183/,491
657506,"Interleukin-6 and Severity of COVID-19 Patients in Hefei, China",2020-06-25,"Maintaining a high quality of conversation between doctors and patients is essential in telehealth services, where efficient and competent communication is important to promote patient health. Assessing the quality of medical conversations is often handled based on a human auditory-perceptual evaluation. Typically, trained experts are needed for such tasks, as they follow systematic evaluation criteria. However, the daily rapid increase of consultations makes the evaluation process inefficient and impractical. This paper investigates the automation of the quality assessment process of patient–doctor voice-based conversations in a telehealth service using a deep-learning-based classification model. For this, the data consist of audio recordings obtained from Altibbi. Altibbi is a digital health platform that provides telemedicine and telehealth services in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The objective is to assist Altibbi’s operations team in the evaluation of the provided consultations in an automated manner. The proposed model is developed using three sets of features: features extracted from the signal level, the transcript level, and the signal and transcript levels. At the signal level, various statistical and spectral information is calculated to characterize the spectral envelope of the speech recordings. At the transcript level, a pre-trained embedding model is utilized to encompass the semantic and contextual features of the textual information. Additionally, the hybrid of the signal and transcript levels is explored and analyzed. The designed classification model relies on stacked layers of deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Evaluation results show that the model achieved a higher level of precision when compared with the manual evaluation approach followed by Altibbi’s operations team.","Habib, Maria; Faris, Mohammad; Qaddoura, Raneem; Alomari, Manal; Alomari, Alaa; Faris, Hossam",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34068602/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21093279,491
657841,Circular Migration and Precarity: Perspectives from Rural Bihar,2020-11-12,"The Covid-19 crisis has forced great societal changes, including forcing many to work from home (WFH) in an effort to limit the spread of the disease. The ability to work from home has long been considered a perk, but we have few estimates of how many jobs are actually possible to be performed from home. This paper proposes a method to estimate the share of these jobs. For each occupation, we obtain a WFH friendly measure by asking respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to evaluate whether the corresponding tasks can be performed from home based on the descriptions from the International Standard Classification of Occupations 2008 (ISCO-08) standard. The share of WFH friendly jobs in an economy can then be estimated by combining these measures with the labor statistics on occupational employments. Using Norway as an illustrating example, we find that approximately 38% of Norwegian jobs can be performed from home. The Norwegian results also suggest that the pandemic and the government’s attempts to mitigate this crisis may have a quite uneven impact on the working population. Those who are already disadvantaged are often less likely to have jobs that can be performed from home.","Holgersen, Henning; Jia, Zhiyang; Svenkerud, Simen",J Labour Mark Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33681696/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12651-021-00287-z,491

Imposed restrictions and treatment precautions may have also influenced OHCA processes-of-care. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic period on incidence, characteristics, and survival from OHCA in Victoria, Australia. METHODS: Using data from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry, we compared 380 adult OHCA patients who received resuscitation between 16th March 2020 and 12th May 2020, with 1218 cases occurring during the same dates in 2017−2019. No OHCA patients were COVID-19 positive. Arrest incidence, characteristics and survival rates were compared. Regression analysis was performed to understand the independent effect of the pandemic period on survival. RESULTS: Incidence of OHCA did not differ during the pandemic period. However, initiation of resuscitation by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) significantly decreased (46.9% versus 40.6%, p = 0.001). Arrests in public locations decreased in the pandemic period (20.8% versus 10.0%; p < 0.001), as did initial shocks by public access defibrillation/first-responders (p = 0.037). EMS caseload decreased during the pandemic period, however, delays to key interventions (time-to-first defibrillation, time-to-first epinephrine) significantly increased. Survival-to-discharge decreased by 50% during the pandemic period (11.7% versus 6.1%; p = 0.002). Survivors per million person-years dropped in 2020, resulting in 35 excess deaths per million person-years. On adjusted analysis, the pandemic period remained associated with a 50% reduction in survival-to-discharge. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic period did not influence OHCA incidence but appears to have disrupted the system-of-care in Australia. However, this could not completely explain reductions in survival.","Ball, J; Nehme, Z; Bernard, S; Stub, D; Stephenson, M; Smith, K",Resuscitation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300957220304652?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32961304/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.09.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300957220304652,491

Therapeutic gene transduction of FOXM1 in vascular endothelium or treatment with FDA-approved drug Decitabine was sufficient to reactivate FoxM1-dependent lung endothelial regeneration in aged mice, reverse aging-impaired resolution of inflammatory injury, and promote survival. In COVID-19 lung autopsy samples, FOXM1 expression was not induced in vascular endothelial cells of elderly patients in contrast to mid-age patients. Thus, Decitabine reactivation of FoxM1-dependent vascular repair represents a potential effective therapy for elderly COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS patients.","Huang, Xiaojia; Zhang, Xianming; Machireddy, Narsa; Mutlu, Gökhan M.; Fang, Yun; Wu, David; Zhao, You-Yang",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.442061,491

We conducted the first nationwide population study using a probability-based sample to assess active SARS-CoV-2 infection, combined with a longitudinal follow-up of the entire cohort over the next 6 months. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing results and the first 3-week follow-up results are presented. METHODS: A probability-based sample of the Slovenian population (N = 2.1 million) was selected from the Central Population Register (n = 3,000). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal samples using the cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 assay. Each participant filled in a detailed baseline questionnaire with basic sociodemographic data and current and past medical history compatible with COVID-19. After 3 weeks participants were interviewed for the presence of COVID-19–compatible clinical symptoms and signs, including in household members, and offered immediate testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA if indicated. RESULTS: 1,368 (46%) individuals consented to participate and completed the questionnaire. Two of 1,366 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (prevalence 0.15%; posterior mean 0.18%, 95% Bayesian CI 0.03–0.47%; 95% HDR 0.01–0.41%). No newly diagnosed infections occurred in the cohort during the first 3-week follow-up round. CONCLUSIONS: The low prevalence of active COVID-19 infections found in this study accurately predicted the dynamic of the epidemic in Slovenia over the subsequent month. Properly designed and timely executed studies using probability-based samples combined with routine target-testing figures provide reliable data for informed decisions on relaxing or strengthening mitigation strategies.","Vodičar, Polona Maver; Valenčak, Anja Oštrbenk; Zupan, Blaž; Županc, Tatjana Avšič; Kurdija, Slavko; Korva, Miša; Petrovec, Miroslav; Demšar, Janez; Knap, Nataša; Štrumbelj, Erik; Vehovar, Vasja; Poljak, Mario",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20304195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32688068/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20304195?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.07.013,491

Viral infections were diagnosed by either immunological (monoclonal antibodies) or molecular (RT‐PCR) methods. Each of two sets of primer pairs developed for detection of all CoVs (panCoV) failed to detect 15 of the 53 (28.3%) hCoV strains identified. On the other hand, all hCoV strains could be detected by using type‐specific primers targeting genes 1ab and N. The HuH‐7 cell line was found to be susceptible to isolation and identification of OC43‐ and 229E‐like strains. Overall, hCoV infection was caused by OC43‐like, 229E‐like, and NL63‐like strains in 25 (53.2%), 10 (21.3%), and 9 (19.1%) patients, respectively. In addition, three patients (6.4%) were infected by untypeable hCoV strains. NL63‐like strains were not found to circulate in 2003–2004, and 229E‐like strains did not circulate in 2004–2005, while OC43‐like strains were detected in both seasons. The monthly distribution reached a peak during January through March. Lower predominated over upper respiratory tract infections in each age group. In addition, hCoV infections interested only immunocompetent infants and young children during the first year of life, while all adults were immunocompromised patients. Coinfections of hCoVs and other respiratory viruses (mostly interesting the first year of life) were observed in 14 of the 47 (29.8%) patients and were associated with severe respiratory syndromes more frequently than hCoV single infections (P = 0.002). In conclusion, the use of multiple primer sets targeting different genes is recommended for diagnosis of all types of hCoV infection. In addition, the detection of still untypeable hCoV strains suggests that the number of hCoVs involved in human pathology might further increase. Finally, hCoVs should be screened routinely for in both infants and immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory infection. J. Med.

COVID-19 started in China in 2019, and it is still spreading even now. Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scan are the most important imaging techniques for diagnosing COVID-19. All researchers are looking for effective solutions and fast treatment methods for this epidemic. To reduce the need for medical experts, fast and accurate automated detection techniques are introduced. Deep learning convolution neural network (DL-CNN) technologies are showing remarkable results for detecting cases of COVID-19. In this paper, deep feature concatenation (DFC) mechanism is utilized in two different ways. In the first one, DFC links deep features extracted from X-ray and CT scan using a simple proposed CNN. The other way depends on DFC to combine features extracted from either X-ray or CT scan using the proposed CNN architecture and two modern pre-trained CNNs: ResNet and GoogleNet. The DFC mechanism is applied to form a definitive classification descriptor. The proposed CNN architecture consists of three deep layers to overcome the problem of large time consumption. For each image type, the proposed CNN performance is studied using different optimization algorithms and different values for the maximum number of epochs, the learning rate (LR), and mini-batch (M-B) size. Experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approach compared to other modern and state-of-the-art methodologies in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and f_score.","Saad, Waleed; Shalaby, Wafaa A.; Shokair, Mona; El-Samie, Fathi Abd; Dessouky, Moawad; Abdellatef, Essam",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33680212/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-021-02967-7,491
674401,Global Mortality Benefits of COVID-19 Action,2020-07-27,"There have been various infectious disease eradication programs implemented in various parts of the world with varying degrees of success since the early 1900s. Of all those programs, the one that achieved monumental success was the Smallpox Eradication Program (SEP). Most of the global health leaders and authorities that came up with the new idea of disease eradication in the 1980s tried to design and shape the new programs based on their experience in the SEP. The SEP had a very effective tool, vaccine, that did not require a cold chain system, and a relatively simple way of administration. The total cost of the eradication program was about US$300 million and the entire campaign took about 10 y. However, the Guinea worm and polio eradication programs that followed in the footsteps of SEP attained varying levels of success, consuming a huge amount of resources and taking a much longer time (>30 y each). This paper reviews the factors that played major roles in hindering the attainment of eradication goals and outlines possible recommendations for the way forward. Among other things, this paper strongly emphasizes that endemic countries should take the lead in all matters pertaining to making decisions for disease elimination and/or eradication initiatives and that ‘elimination as a public health problem’ is the preferred option rather than going for complete eradication at the expense of other health programs and thereby contributing to weakening of already fragile health systems, mainly in Africa.","Gebre, Teshome",Int Health,https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihab011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33693720/,491

However, little is known about the public's compliance with mask-wearing behaviours. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the public's mask-wearing behaviours in the context of COVID-19. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Online survey from 6 April 2020 to 5 May 2020 in China. PARTICIPANTS: This study included 10,165 persons who lived in China, understood Chinese, and were not health care providers. METHODS: Descriptive statistics were used to assess the public's mask-wearing behaviours. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors affecting the mask-wearing behaviours. RESULTS: Nearly all (99%) people wore a mask during the covid-19 pandemic, with most (73.3%) demonstrating good compliance with face mask use. However, 41.8% of the participants seldom cleaned their hands before putting on a face mask, and more than half (55.3%, 62.1%) of those who touched (n=8108, 79.8%) or adjusted (n=9356, 92.0%) their mask while using it failed to consistently wash their hands afterward. When removing a used mask, 7.6% of the participants discarded it into a garbage bin without a lid and 22.5% discarded it into a garbage bin in their reach regardless of presence of a lid. Participants reported wearing disposable medical masks (93.8%), followed by N95 respirators (26.2%), and cloth face masks (8.5%). Some participants wore multiple masks simultaneously (occasionally 26.5%, often 2.1%, always 1.5%). A total of 5,981 (58.8%) participants reported reusing disposable masks, with nearly two thirds (n=3923, 65.6%) indicating they would hang the used masks in well-ventilated places. More than one-third (37.6%) of the respondents did not replace mask when it had been used for more than 8 hours. Exposure to instructions on face mask use was the strongest predictor of good compliance (odds ratio=4.13, 95% confidential interval= 3.60-4.75, p=0.000). Other factors included specific situations, location, and gender. The influence of age needs further investigation. Most participants (76.4%) accessed information mainly via social media platforms. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all people wore face mask and most of them used it properly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hand hygiene before and during mask-wearing, choosing an appropriate type of face mask, reusing disposal face mask, and disposing of used face masks should be particularly emphasized in future evidence dissemination or behaviour-change interventions. Information on social media platforms for evidence dissemination and behaviour change may benefit the public the most, but this initiative requires further research to investigate its effectiveness.","Tan, Min; Wang, Yingying; Luo, Li; Hu, Jiale",Int J Nurs Stud,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748920303448; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020748920303448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33352496/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103853,491
678391,SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital workers. What about us?,2021-08-02,"To assess the codon evolution in virus–host systems, Avian coronavirus and its natural host Gallus gallus were used as a model. Codon usage (CU) was measured for the viral spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), nonstructural protein 2 (NSP2) and papain-like protease (PL(pro)) genes from a diverse set of A. coronavirus lineages and for G. gallus genes (lung surfactant protein A, intestinal cholecystokinin, oviduct ovomucin alpha subunit, kidney vitamin D receptor and the ubiquitary beta-actin) for different A. coronavirus replicating sites. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) trees accommodating all virus and host genes in a single topology showed a higher proximity of A. coronavirus CU to the respiratory tract for all genes. The codon adaptation index (CAI) showed a lower adaptation of S to G. gallus compared to NSP2, PL(pro) and N. The effective number of codons (Nc) and GC(3%) revealed that natural selection and genetic drift are the evolutionary forces driving the codon usage evolution of both A. coronavirus and G. gallus regardless of the gene being considered. The spike gene showed only one 100% conserved amino acid position coded by an A. coronavirus preferred codon, a significantly low number when compared to the three other genes (p < 0.0001). Virus CU evolves independently for each gene in a manner predicted by the protein function, with a balance between natural selection and mutation pressure, giving further molecular basis for the viruses’ ability to exploit the host's cellular environment in a concerted virus–host molecular evolution.","Brandão, Paulo Eduardo",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24091362/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213003250; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170213003250; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.09.033,491
678906,Isolating the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on urban air quality in Canada,2021-05-18,"In addition to a set of canonical genes, coronaviruses encode additional accessory proteins. A locus located between the spike and envelope genes is conserved in all coronaviruses and contains a complete or truncated open reading frame (ORF). Previously, we demonstrated that this locus, which contains the gene for accessory protein 3a from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), encodes a protein that forms ion channels and regulates virus release. In the current study, we explored whether the ORF4a protein of HCoV-229E has similar functions. Our findings revealed that the ORF4a proteins were expressed in infected cells and localized at the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). The ORF4a proteins formed homo-oligomers through disulfide bridges and possessed ion channel activity in both Xenopus oocytes and yeast. Based on the measurement of conductance to different monovalent cations, the ORF4a was suggested to form a non-selective channel for monovalent cations, although Li(+) partially reduced the inward current. Furthermore, viral production decreased when the ORF4a protein expression was suppressed by siRNA in infected cells. Collectively, this evidence indicates that the HCoV-229E ORF4a protein is functionally analogous to the SARS-CoV 3a protein, which also acts as a viroporin that regulates virus production.

A case study using SWOT and DPSIR",2021-03-16,"Microbes and their activities have pervasive influence and deterministic roles in the functioning and health of the geosphere, atmosphere and biosphere, i.e. in nature. Microbiology can be considered a language of nature. We have argued that the relevance of microbes for everyday personal decisions and collective policies requires that society attains microbiology literacy, through the introduction of child‐relevant microbiology topics into school curricula. That is: children should learn the microbiology language of nature. Children can be effective transmitters of new and/or rapidly evolving knowledge within families and beyond, where there is a substantive information asymmetry (witness digital technology, social media, and new languages in foreign countries). They can thus be key disseminators of microbiology knowledge, where there will be information asymmetry for the foreseeable future, and thereby contribute to the attainment of microbiology literacy in society. The education of family and friends can be encouraged/stimulated by home assignments, family leisure projects, and school‐organised microbiology‐centric social‐education events. Children are key stakeholders in family decisions. Their microbiology knowledge, and their dissemination of it, can help inform and increase the objectivity of such decisions.","Timmis, Kenneth; Timmis, James; Jebok, Franziska",Microb Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32649058/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.13619,491

Furthermore, we intend to explore the association between antibody levels and with demographic factors. Methods: 177 COVID-19 convalescents in Sichuan Province were voluntarily participated in our study. 363 serum samples were collected from June, 2020 to November, 2020. Duration of seroprevelance in these convalescents and their demographic characteristics were described, and the risk factors to antibody levels were analysed. Results: Men had more than twice the odds of having IgM antibody positive compared with women (OR=2.419, 95% CI:[1.232, 4.751]). Participants without symptoms were nearly 0.5 times IgG seropositive than those with symptoms (OR=0.455, 95% CI: [0.220, 0.940]). People aged[≥]60 years were nearly 3 times IgG seropositive than those who aged < 20 years (OR=2.986, 95% CI: [1.058, 8.432]). Seroprevalence in asymptomatic declined quicker than symptomatic. Conclusions: Age and gender may affect the antibody levels and seroprevalence. Asymptomatic appeared more easier to turn to seronegative than symptomatic.

683786,Returning to paradise: Investigating issues of tourism crisis and disaster recovery on the island of Bali,2016-09-30,"Unlike the original canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), CPV-2 variants have gained the ability to replicate in vivo in cats but there is limited information on the disease patterns induced by these variants in the feline host. During 2008, two distinct cases of parvoviral infection were diagnosed in our laboratories. A CPV-2a variant was identified in a 3-month-old Persian kitten displaying clinical sign of feline panleukopenia (FPL) (acute gastroenteritis and marked leukopenia) and oral ulcerations, that died eight days after the onset of the disease. Two pups living in the same pet shop as the cat were found to shed a CPV-2a strain genetically identical to the feline virus and were likely the source of infection. Also, non-fatal infection by a CPV-2c strain occurred in a 2.5-month-old European shorthair kitten displaying non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea and normal white blood cell counts. By sequence analysis of the major capsid protein (VP2) gene, the feline CPV-2c strain showed 100% identity to a recent canine type-2c isolate. Both kittens had been administered multivalent vaccines against common feline pathogens including FPL virus. Whether and to which extent the FPL vaccines can protect cats adequately from the antigenic variants of CPV-2 should be assessed.","Decaro, Nicola; Buonavoglia, Domenico; Desario, Costantina; Amorisco, Francesca; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Parisi, Antonio; Terio, Valentina; Elia, Gabriella; Lucente, Maria Stella; Cavalli, Alessandra; Martella, Vito; Buonavoglia, Canio",Res Vet Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528810000755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20334885/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.03.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528810000755,491

METHODS: We systemically and comprehensively retrieved the eligible study evaluating clinical differences between severe vs non-severe Covid-19. Main effect sizes were demographic characteristics, comorbidities, signs and symptoms, laboratory findings as well as radiological features of chest CT. RESULTS: A total of 2566 Covid-19 people (771 in the severe group and 1795 in the non-severe group) from 14 studies were eligible for this meta-analysis. It was demonstrated that older age and males were more likely to have severe Covid-19. Patients with underlying comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and COPD were significantly more susceptible to severe Covid-19. Patients with dyspnoea were more likely to be severely ill. Depressed total lymphocytes were observed in this article. Meanwhile, although reticulation (30.8%), intrathoracic lymph node enlargement (20.5%) and pleural effusions (30.8%) were relatively infrequent, meta-analysis revealed that patients with these presentations in chest CT were associated with increased risk of severe Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in clinical characteristics between the severe and non-severe Covid-19 patients. Many factors are related to the severity of the disease, which can help clinicians to differentiate severe patients from non-severe patients.","Zhang, Yun-Jing; Sun, Xi-Feng; Xie, Bing; Feng, Wen-Juan; Han, Shi-Liang",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34546617/,491

We review metabolic pathways that influence immune cell function and cellular persistence in chronic infections. We also highlight the role of nutrients in altering the tissue microenvironment with lessons from the tumor microenvironment that shapes the quality and quantity of cellular immune responses. Multiple layers of biological networks, including the nature of nutritional supplements, the genetic background, previous exposures, and gut microbiota status have impact on cellular performance and immune competence against molecularly defined targets. We discuss how immune metabolism determines the differentiation pathway of antigen-specific immune cells and how these insights can be explored to devise better strategies to strengthen anti-pathogen-directed immune responses, while curbing unwanted, non-productive inflammation.","Ramalho, Renata; Rao, Martin; Zhang, Chao; Agrati, Chiara; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Zumla, Alimuddin; Maeurer, Markus",Semin Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32519148/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-020-00798-w,491

To provide care for our 40 000 patients, without resident support, we needed to develop quickly a new culture of communication and innovation. We accomplished this by regular, transparent meetings with senior leadership and key stakeholders who were empowered to make rapid decisions. We then convened regular meetings with clinic leadership and frontline providers to receive feedback and implement new practices. These rapid meeting cycles allowed for a nimble response to a changing landscape. We optimised our video-conferencing and telehealth services, reached out to our most vulnerable patients and engaged other providers and medical students who were not engaged in patient care due to social isolation practices. We discuss the implications of these innovations on our future practice.","Doolittle, Benjamin R; Richards, Bradley; Tarabar, Amerisa; Ellman, Matthew; Tobin, Daniel",Fam Med Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32737058/; https://doi.org/10.1136/fmch-2020-000513,491
