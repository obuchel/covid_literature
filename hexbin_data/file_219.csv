616,Preventing the next 'SARS' - European healthcare workers' attitudes towards monitoring their health for the surveillance of newly emerging infections: qualitative study,2011-07-08,"BACKGROUND: Hospitals are often the epicentres of newly circulating infections. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of acquiring infectious diseases and may be among the first to contract emerging infections. This study aims to explore European HCWs' perceptions and attitudes towards monitoring their absence and symptom reports for surveillance of newly circulating infections. METHODS: A qualitative study with thematic analysis was conducted using focus group methodology. Forty-nine hospital-based HCWs from 12 hospitals were recruited to six focus groups; two each in England and Hungary and one each in Germany and Greece. RESULTS: HCWs perceived risk factors for occupationally acquired infectious diseases to be 1.) exposure to patients with undiagnosed infections 2.) break-down in infection control procedures 3.) immuno-naïvety and 4.) symptomatic colleagues. They were concerned that a lack of monitoring and guidelines for infectious HCWs posed a risk to staff and patients and felt employers failed to take a positive interest in their health. Staffing demands and loss of income were noted as pressures to attend work when unwell. In the UK, Hungary and Greece participants felt monitoring staff absence and the routine disclosure of symptoms could be appropriate provided the effectiveness and efficiency of such a system were demonstrable. In Germany, legislation, privacy and confidentiality were identified as barriers. All HCWs highlighted the need for knowledge and structural improvements for timelier recognition of emerging infections. These included increased suspicion and awareness among staff and standardised, homogenous absence reporting systems. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring absence and infectious disease symptom reports among HCWs may be a feasible means of surveillance for emerging infections in some settings. A pre-requisite will be tackling the drivers for symptomatic HCWs to attend work.","Aghaizu, Adamma; Elam, Gillian; Ncube, Fortune; Thomson, Gail; Szilágyi, Emese; Eckmanns, Tim; Poulakou, Garyphallia; Catchpole, Mike",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3160373/,219
4299,The patient voice: a survey of worries and anxieties during health system transition in HIV services in Vietnam,2020-01-10,"BACKGROUND: Vietnam is shifting toward integrating HIV services into the public health system using social health insurance (SHI), and the HIV service delivery system is becoming decentralized. The study aim was to investigate current SHI coverage and patients’ perspectives on this transition. METHODS: A survey of 1348 HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy (aged ≥18 years) was conducted at an HIV outpatient clinic at a central-level hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam, in October and November 2018. Insurance coverage, reasons for not having a SHI card, perceived concerns about receiving HIV services in SHI-registered local health facilities, and willingness to continue regularly visiting the current hospital were self-reported. Logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze factors associated with not having a SHI card and having concerns about receiving HIV services in SHI-registered hospitals/clinics. RESULTS: SHI coverage was 78.0%. The most frequently reported reason for not having a SHI card was that obtaining one was burdensome, followed by lack of information on how to obtain a card, and financial problems. Most patients (86.6%) had concerns about receiving HIV services at SHI-registered local health facilities, and disclosure of HIV status to neighbors and low quality of HIV services were the main concerns reported. Participants aged < 40 years old and unmarried were more likely to report lack of SHI cards, and women and those aged ≥40 years were more likely to have concerns. However, 91.4% of patients showed willingness to continue regular visits to the current hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Although SHI coverage has been rapidly improving among HIV patients, most participants had concerns about the current system transition in Vietnam. In response to their voiced concerns, strengthening the link between higher-level and lower-level facilities may help to ensure good quality HIV services at all levels while mitigating patients’ worries and anxieties.","Matsumoto, Shoko; Nguyen, Hoai Dung Thi; Nguyen, Dung Thi; Van Tran, Giang; Tanuma, Junko; Mizushima, Daisuke; Van Nguyen, Kinh; Oka, Shinichi",BMC Int Health Hum Rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6954624/,219
5467,"Zika, public health, and the distraction of abortion",2016-11-29,"Viral infections are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in elderly people and young children throughout the world. The most common pathogens include coxsackie virus (CV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, no antiviral agents with low toxicity and drug resistance are currently available in clinic therapy. The present study aimed to examine the antiviral activities of emodin (an ingredient of Rheum palmatum) against CVB5 and RSV infections, in an attempt to discover new antiviral agents for virus infection. The monomer emodin was extracted and isolated from Rheum palmatum. The antiviral activities of emodin on HEp-2 cells were evaluated, including virus replication inhibition, virucidal and anti-absorption effects, by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tet-razolium bromide (MTT) assay and plaque reduction assay (PRA). The kinetics of virus inhibition by emodin in a period of 14 h was further determined by plaque assay and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Cytokine (IFN-γ, TNF-α) mRNA expressions after emodin treatment (7.5, 15, 30 μmol/L) were also assessed by qPCR post-infection. The results showed that emodin had potent inhibitory activities against CVB5 and RSV, with the 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) ranging from 13.06 to 14.27 μmol/L and selectivity index (SI) being 5.38–6.41 μmol/L. However, emodin couldn’t directly inactivate the viruses or block their absorption to cells. It acted as a biological synthesis inhibitor against CVB(4) and RSV in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, especially during the first 0–4 h post-infection. Moreover, emodin could decrease the mRNA expression of IFN-α but enhance TNF-γ expression significantly compared to the viral controls in vitro. Our results provide a molecular basis for development of emodin as a novel and safe antiviral agent for human enterovirus and respiratory virus infection in the clinical therapy.","Liu, Zhao; Ma, Nian; Zhong, Yan; Yang, Zhan-qiu",J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089517/,219

Several studies have reported that PRV can cross the specie barrier and induce human encephalitis, but a definitive diagnosis of human PRV encephalitis is debatable due to the lack of PRV DNA detection. Here, we report a case of human PRV encephalitis diagnosed by the next-generation sequencing (NGS) of PRV sequences in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a patient. A male pork vendor developed fever and seizures for 6 days. NGS results showed PRV sequences in his CSF and blood. Sanger sequencing showed that PRV DNA in the CSF and PRV antibodies in both the CSF and blood were positive. MRI results revealed multiple inflammatory lesions in the bilateral hemisphere. Based on the clinical and laboratory data, we diagnosed the patient with PRV encephalitis. This case suggests that PRV can infect humans, causing severe viral encephalitis. People at risk of PRV infection should improve their self-protection awareness.","Wang, Di; Tao, Xiaogen; Fei, Mingming; Chen, Jian; Guo, Wei; Li, Ping; Wang, Jinquan",J Neurovirol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223082/,219

13022,COVID-19: The need to heed distress calls of healthcare workers,2020-09-03,"A decade of genetic counseling of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) affected families has generated two important observations. First, the uptake rate for presymptomatic testing for FTD is low in our department of Clinical Genetics at the Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. Second, FTD at-risk counselees reported substantial familial opposition to genetic testing, which is distinct from the attitude in Huntington Disease affected families. We hypothesize that the low acceptance for FTD genetic counseling is consequential to the familial opposition and explain this within the theoretical framework of separation-individuation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that separation-individuation problems do not similarly influence the acceptance of HD genetic counseling, due to the educative role of the well-organised patient organization for HD in the Netherlands. We offer counseling recommendations that serve to facilitate the individuation of the counselee with respect to the FTD genetic test.","Riedijk, S. R.; Niermeijer, M. F.

14642,"Vaccination concerns, beliefs and practices among Ukrainian migrants in Poland: a qualitative study",2021-01-07,"INTRODUCTION: Traditional management of traumatic hemothorax/hemopneumothorax (HTX/HPTX) has been insertion of large-bore 32–40 French (Fr) chest tubes (CTs). Retrospective studies have shown 14Fr percutaneous pigtail catheters (PCs) are equally effective as CTs. Our aim was to compare effectiveness between PCs and CTs by performing the first randomized controlled trial (RCT). We hypothesize PCs work equally as well as CTs in management of traumatic HTX/HPTX. METHODS: Prospective RCT comparing 14Fr PCs to 28–32Fr CTs for management of traumatic HTX/HPTX from 07/2015 to 01/2018. We excluded patients requiring emergency tube placement or who refused. Primary outcome was failure rate defined as retained HTX or recurrent PTX requiring additional intervention. Secondary outcomes included initial output (IO), tube days and insertion perception experience (IPE) score on a scale of 1–5 (1 = tolerable experience, 5 = worst experience). Unpaired Student’s t-test, chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were utilized with significance set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were enrolled. Baseline characteristics between PC patients (N = 20) and CT patients (N = 23) were similar. Failure rates (10% PCs vs. 17% CTs, P = 0.49) between cohorts were similar. IO (median, 650 milliliters[ml]; interquartile range[IR], 375–1087; for PCs vs. 400 ml; IR, 240–700; for CTs, P = 0.06), and tube duration was similar, but PC patients reported lower IPE scores (median, 1, “I can tolerate it”; IR, 1–2) than CT patients (median, 3, “It was a bad experience”; IR, 3–4, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients with traumatic HTX/HPTX, 14Fr PCs were equally as effective as 28–32Fr CTs with no significant difference in failure rates. PC patients, however, reported a better insertion experience. www.ClinicalTrials.gov Registration ID: NCT02553434","Bauman, Zachary M.; Kulvatunyou, Narong; Joseph, Bellal; Gries, Lynn; O’Keeffe, Terence; Tang, Andrew L.; Rhee, Peter",World J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7790482/,219
14702,With Gratitude—HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice 2020 Reviewers,2021-01-11,"Neutrophils are the key cells of our innate immune system mediating host defense via a range of effector functions including phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis. For this, they employ an arsenal of anti-microbial cargoes packed in their readily mobilizable granule subsets. Notably, the release of granule content is tightly regulated; however, under certain circumstances, their unregulated release can aggravate tissue damage and could be detrimental to the host. Several constituents of neutrophil granules have also been associated with various inflammatory diseases including cancer. In cancer setting, their excessive release may modulate tissue microenvironment which ultimately leads the way for tumor initiation, growth and metastasis. Neutrophils actively infiltrate within tumor tissues, wherein they show diverse phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. While most studies are focused at understanding the phenotypic heterogeneity of neutrophils, their functional heterogeneity, much of which is likely orchestrated by their granule cargoes, is beginning to emerge. Therefore, a better understanding of neutrophil granules and their cargoes will not only shed light on their diverse role in cancer but will also reveal them as novel therapeutic targets. This review provides an overview on existing knowledge of neutrophil granules and detailed insight into the pathological relevance of their cargoes in cancer. In addition, we also discuss the therapeutic approach for targeting neutrophils or their microenvironment in disease setting that will pave the way forward for future research.","Rawat, Kavita; Syeda, Saima; Shrivastava, Anju",Cancer Metastasis Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7802614/,219
14896,COVID-19: prioritizing healthcare workers,2020-12-02,"The current study describes ethnobotanical (EB) and traditional ethnomedicinal (TEMs) uses of medicinal plants (MPs) of Tehsil Samahni area of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. Indigenous inhabitants of the area mostly reside in remote mountainous areas and depend on wild plants for life necessities and treatment of different diseases. This paper presents first quantitative ethnobotanical study describing the popularity level of MPs in indigenous communities by using relative popularity level (RPL) and rank order of priority (ROP) indices. The data of TEMs and EB uses were collected from 200 interviewees consisting of traditional herbal practioners (110) and farmers (90) from study area using structured and semi-structured interview methodology during year 2019. It was found that illiterate peasants have more knowledge and practice of TEMs than other people. A total of 150 plant species belonging to 58 families with botanical and local names, parts used, mode of recipes preparation, administration mechanism and TEMs uses were documented in systematic manner. It was explored that highest number (7.69%) of plants of Moraceae were used in TEMs and followed by species of Asteraceae (6.29%). The ethnobotanical data was analyzed by using quantitative ethnobotanical tools viz: informant consensus factor (ICF), fidelity level (FL), relative frequency of citation (RFC), use value index (UVI), relative importance of plants (RIP), relative populatiry level (RPL) and rank order of popularity (ROP). The leaf ranked first (36.49%) and fruit 2(nd) (12.07%) being used in TEMs while prevalent use-form was decoction (29.28%), followed by tea (23.05%) and preferably taken as oral (46.66%). ICF analysis proved that diabetes, hypertension, rabies, snake sting and joint pains were the most prevalent occurring infirmities. The highest RFC (0.95) was found for Acacia modesta, followed by Boerhavia procumbens (RFC:0.87) and Berberis lycium (RFC:0.85). The relative importance of MPs was calculated by using UVI and Moringa oleifera showed highest (1.38), followed by Zanthoxylum armatum (1.25) and Withania somnifera (1.24) use-values. High UVI of plants depicts that these species are predominantly used in local health care system. The plants Phyllanthus emblica, Morus macruora, Justicia adhatoda and Melia azedarach depicted high values (1.00) of FL and RPL proving that these taxa are commonly used in indigenous medicines by local inhabitants and have better potential for drug discovery by ethnopharmacological analysis. Out of total, 26 species had more than 50% ROP index and Phyllanthus emblica and Flacourtia indica (ROP = 100) followed by Morus macruora (ROP: 97) were used to cure ‘hypertension and hyperlipidemia’ and ‘cough, chest infection’, respectively. It was found that 30% of total species were previously reported as medicinal while 70% plants were first time reported to be used in TEMs and authenticated by using of quantitative ethnobotanical tools. Ethnopharmacological potential of indigenous plants was confirmed by RIP and RPL indices which had been used to cure one or more body systems and were promulgated in the local herbal medicine system. The research provides clues to screen these plant species by using latest phytochemical and pharmacological analysis for novel drug discovery. This study will also be useful for conservation of bioculture traditional knowledge of indigenous communities and the most important is to conserve medicinal plants of the study area for future generations.","Ishtiaq, Muhammad; Maqbool, Mehwish; Ajaib, Muhammad; Ahmed, Maqsood; Hussain, Iqbal; Khanam, Humaira; Mushtaq, Waheeda; Hussain, Tanveer; Azam, Shehzad; Hayat Bhatti, Khizar; Ghani, Abdul",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7806180/,219

Our model explores effective sinking methods of high-quality medical resources, training and guidance practices, assistance and guidance measures, and the ability to improve the grassroots services so that more chronically ill populations can stay in the community family as long as possible. In such an environment, they can receive cheap, safe, and suitable services. It can also lead to further improvement in constructing the government's regional medical rehabilitation care service system and can formulate long-term care relevant compensation policies.","Zhang, Xuelei; Wang, Xiaofeng",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8110381/,219
21051,History of work-related diseases as a tool to protect the health of workers,2021-09-11,"Payment for performance (P4P) has been employed in low and middle-income (LMIC) countries to improve quality and coverage of maternal and child health (MCH) services. However, there is a lack of consensus on how P4P affects health systems. There is a need to evaluate P4P effects on health systems using methods suitable for evaluating complex systems. We developed a causal loop diagram (CLD) to further understand the pathways to impact of P4P on delivery and uptake of MCH services in Tanzania. The CLD was developed and validated using qualitative data from a process evaluation of a P4P scheme in Tanzania, with additional stakeholder dialogue sought to strengthen confidence in the diagram. The CLD maps the interacting mechanisms involved in provider achievement of targets, reporting of health information, and population care seeking, and identifies those mechanisms affected by P4P. For example, the availability of drugs and medical commodities impacts not only provider achievement of P4P targets but also demand of services and is impacted by P4P through the availability of additional facility resources and the incentivisation of district managers to reduce drug stock outs. The CLD also identifies mechanisms key to facility achievement of targets but are not within the scope of the programme; the activities of health facility governing committees and community health workers, for example, are key to demand stimulation and effective resource use at the facility level but both groups were omitted from the incentive system. P4P design considerations generated from this work include appropriately incentivising the availability of drugs and staffing in facilities and those responsible for demand creation in communities. Further research using CLDs to study heath systems in LMIC is urgently needed to further our understanding of how systems respond to interventions and how to strengthen systems to deliver better coverage and quality of care.","Cassidy, Rachel; Tomoaia-Cotisel, Andrada; Semwanga, Agnes Rwashana; Binyaruka, Peter; Chalabi, Zaid; Blanchet, Karl; Singh, Neha S.; Maiba, John; Borghi, Josephine",Soc Sci Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8434440/,219

31837,Complexity Sciences,2017-07-13,"Social networks form phenomena that exist and evolve; they are dynamic. These phenomena have been realized and studied by the anthropology and sociology research communities since 1930. However, the recent rapid development in information technology and the internet has increased the interest in social networks and as a model they have been adapted to more applications and domains. Though researchers first studied social networks of humans, for our study described in this chapter we argue that genes and proteins act collaboratively and exist in communities analogous to humans, animals, insects, etc. They complement each other and collectively achieve specific tasks where some would have major roles appearing upfront and others may play minor background roles. However, molecules turn into aggressive actors when their internal structure is augmented; consequently, they may deviate from their target, change camp, and disturb other molecules leading to disaster. Such mutations may be uncontrolled and unintentionally occur inside a body, or they may be intentional and controlled by humans to serve one of two purposes, treatment or bioterrorism. In other words, mutation in the molecules (genes) can lead to a change in behavior. This may lead to good or bad effect, e.g., recovery from illness or diseases that may severely affect the body causing disability or death. Once mutated outside the body, molecules may turn into harmful biological weapons of mass destruction. The latter process does not require sophisticated equipment and hence is extremely dangerous with the uprising global terrorism activities. Bioterrorism is therefore a serious concern for humanity. One could say that mutated biological agents outside the body once misused could be way more dangerous than mutated molecules within the body. In this chapter, we will elaborate on bioterrorism and its consequences; we will also propose a model to study social networks of genes within the body leading to the identification of disease biomarkers.","Naji, Ghada; Nagi, Mohamad; ElSheikh, Abdallah M.; Gao, Shang; Kianmehr, Keivan; Özyer, Tansel; Rokne, Jon; Demetrick, Douglas; Ridley, Mick; Alhajj, Reda",Counterterrorism and Open Source Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176268/,219

While delivery of remote teaching was generally viewed favourably, problem areas included clinic cancellations and clinical simulated case examinations. Oral Health Sciences graduates can practise as dental hygienist-therapists. Materials and methods An anonymous and voluntary online survey asked students to rate and comment on different formats of remote teaching and assessment. This material is supplemented by internal papers describing the planning and delivery of remote teaching and assessment. Results Nineteen of 29 students completed the survey (response rate: 66%). The interactive platform Collaborate was the most popular remote teaching format, although a number reported connectivity issues. Questionmark software, used to deliver a timed live examination, was rated highly. Cancellation of remaining clinical sessions was rated by Year 3 and 4 students as particularly problematic. Remote clinical simulated case examinations gave several students concerns. Other concerns were the impact on revision and adapting to different exam formats. Discussion The challenge was particularly complex as the curriculum involves a mixture of educational and clinical teaching and assessment, all requiring General Dental Council approval. Responses suggest remote teaching and assessment generally went smoothly. Results may help to inform future course development in this and similar courses in order to overcome or mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19.

Primary infections with HMBPP-producing pathogens drive the evolution of multieffector functional responses in Vγ2Vδ2 T cells, although Vγ2Vδ2 T cells display different patterns of responses during the acute and chronic phases of Mtb infection and in other infections. Expanded Vγ2Vδ2 T cells in primary Mtb infection can exhibit a broader TCR repertoire and a greater clonal response than previously assumed, with different distribution patterns of Vγ2Vδ2 T-cell clones in lymphoid and non-lymphoid compartments. Emerging in vivo data suggest that HMBPP activation of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells appears to impact other immune cells during infection.","Chen, Zheng W",Cellular & molecular immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/cmi.2012.46; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23147720/,219

OBJECTIVE To determine the technical feasibility, safety, and functional outcome with ADAPT using the new large-bore 6F SOFIA Plus catheter. METHODS A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from six university hospitals was performed. The following parameters of all acute stroke procedures (June 2015- January 2016) using the SOFIA Plus catheter were analyzed: accessibility of the thrombus with the catheter, recanalization success (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction ≥2b), time to recanalization, procedure-related complications. Furthermore, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at presentation and discharge and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at 90 days were recorded. RESULTS 85 patients were treated using the SOFIA Plus catheter. The occlusion site was the anterior circulation in 94.1%. Median baseline NIHSS score was 18. In 64.7%, ADAPT alone was successful after a median procedure time of 21 min. With additional use of stent retrievers in the remaining cases, the recanalization rate was 96.5%. No catheter-related complications such as dissections were observed. Thrombus migration to a new vascular territory occurred in 4.7% and symptomatic hemorrhage in 4.7%. After 3 months, mRS 0-2 was achieved in 49.4%. Mortality rate was 20%. CONCLUSIONS In the majority of cases, thrombus aspiration using the SOFIA Plus catheter results in successful recanalization after a short procedure time. With additional use of stent retrievers, a high recanalization rate can be achieved (96.5%). The complication rate was in line with those of previous publications.","Möhlenbruch, M A; Kabbasch, C; Kowoll, A; Broussalis, E; Sonnberger, M; Müller, M; Wiesmann, M; Trenkler, J; Killer-Oberpfalzer, M; Weber, W; Mpotsaris, A; Bendszus, M; Stampfl, S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27998957/,219

N protein is thought to dysregulate cell signalling and the transcription of cellular genes, including FGL2, which encodes a prothrombinase implicated in vascular thrombosis, fibrin deposition and pneumocyte necrosis. Here, we showed that N protein expressed in cultured human cells was predominantly found in the cytoplasm and was competent in repressing the transcriptional activity driven by interferon-stimulated response elements. However, the expression of N protein did not influence the transcription from the FGL2 promoter. More importantly, N protein did not modulate the expression of FGL2 mRNA or protein in transfected or SARS-CoV-infected cells. Taken together, our findings did not support the model in which SARS-CoV N protein specifically modulates transcription of the FGL2 gene to cause fibrosis and vascular thrombosis.","Siu, Kam-Leung; Chan, Ching-Ping; Chan, Chris; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Jin, Dong-Yan",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.009209-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19423547/,219

As viruses vary tremendously in size, structure, genomic composition, and tissue tropism, multiple sensors are required to detect their presence in various cell types and tissues. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the diversity, specificity, and signaling pathways downstream of viral sensors and ask whether two distinct sensors that recognize the same viral component are complementary, compensatory, or simply redundant. We also discuss why viral sensors are differentially distributed in distinct cell types and whether a particular cell type dominates the IFN-I response during viral infection. Finally, we review evidence suggesting that inappropriate signaling through viral sensors may induce autoimmunity. The picture emerging from these studies is that disparate viral sensors in different cell types form a dynamic and integrated molecular network that can be exploited for improving vaccination and therapeutic strategies for infectious and autoimmune diseases.","Wang, Yaming; Swiecki, Melissa; McCartney, Stephen A; Colonna, Marco",Immunological reviews,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065x.2011.01049.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21884168/,219

Accurate diagnoses of cases is key in managing the pandemic by identification, isolation and treatment of patients and defining the epidemiology of the virus. By mid-January 2020, a scientist from China published the full genome of the virus, which facilitated the development of accurate molecular diagnostic assays. By the end of January 2020, the WHO, in collaboration with laboratories in Asia, Europe and the USA, published several real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rtRT-PCR) protocols that allowed identification of cases and development of commercial assays. Clinical investigations facilitated development of accurate case definition and guidance for laboratories on the optimum specimens and procedures for diagnoses. Currently, laboratory-based rtRT-PCR is the recommended test for diagnoses of acute cases to ensure patients can be identified and isolated and to facilitate the public health response. However, due to delays in diagnoses, severe shortage of tests and laboratory capacity, point-of-care molecular or antigen tests are becoming more attractive. Although serological tests are not suitable for diagnoses of acute cases, they are important to define epidemiological questions, including attack rate in the population, and to identify immune individuals.

SsReV1 has a genome of 28 055 bp and is composed of 11 double-stranded RNA segments. With a combination of unique molecular features, virion shape and composition, and phylogenetic analysis, SsReV1 is significantly distinct from all known reoviruses and defines a novel genus in the family Reoviridae. Interestingly, two conserved domains, double-stranded RNA binding motif (dsRBM, Pfam 00 035) and reovirus sigma C capsid protein (Reo_σC, pfam04 582), were identified in the genome of SsReV1, which are widespread in diverse virus lineages. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that multiple cross-family horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events could occur between reoviruses and double-stranded DNA viruses, single-stranded RNA viruses and even cellular organisms. Interestingly, the dsRBM of SsReV1 was phylogenetically related to dsRNA-binding proteins of some insects, but not reoviruses. These results indicated that SsReV1 is a new taxonomic representative in Reoviridae, which provides new insights into the diversity and global ecology of reoviruses and other segmented double-stranded RNA viruses. More importantly, the present results provided evidence indicating that reoviruses indeed have HGT events with other virus lineages on a large scale and that HGT may serve as an important driving factor that plays a key role in the evolution of reoviruses.","Liu, Lijiang; Cheng, Jiasen; Fu, Yanping; Liu, Huiquan; Jiang, Daohong; Xie, Jiatao",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28548042/,219

METHODS Residents and faculty collaboratively developed a program aimed at improving resident wellness. Program implementation began in July of 2018 and after 1 year, residents evaluated the program's effects on burnout. We used the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and a Likert scale to evaluate the effects of the program. RESULTS After 1 year of the resident wellness program, the MBI results showed an increase in the number of residents in the ""engaged"" category and a decrease in those rated as ""burnout."" Residents rated favorably initiatives grouped into the following themes: time away from work, faculty engaging with residents outside of the hospital environment, efforts to enhance residents' self-efficacy, fostering a positive culture among residents, and providing easy access to physical activity. The majority of initiatives were targeted to the ""culture of wellness"" domain, as defined by the Stanford Well MD framework. Our program targeted to a lesser extent the other 2 domains, ""efficiency of practice"" and ""personal resilience."" CONCLUSION After 1 year, the wellness program resulted in a trend toward improving burnout. Future efforts should be focused on targeting the multidimensional drivers of burnout as defined by established wellness frameworks. Realizing new stressors brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic will also be an area of active effort and research.","Acevedo, Joseph R; Schlacter, Jamie A; Chambers, Tamara N; Jacobson, Lia K; Yalamanchili, Ronica; Clark, Bhavishya; Pan, Dorothy; Kokot, Niels C; Johns, Michael M","Ear, nose, & throat journal",https://doi.org/10.1177/01455613211009139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33848201/,219

Measuring temporal variation in the all-cause mortality sex ratio before and during the pandemic in populations exposed to different constraints on risky behavior would allow us to better anticipate changes in the ratio and to better understand its association with infection control strategies. METHODS I apply time Box-Jenkins modeling to 262 months of pre-pandemic mortality sex ratios to arrive at counterfactual values of 10 intra-pandemic ratios. I compare counterfactual to observed values to determine if intra-pandemic ratios differed detectably from those expected as well as whether the Norwegian and Swedish differences varied from each other. RESULTS The male to female mortality sex ratio in both Norway and Sweden increased during the pandemic. I, however, find no evidence that the increase differed between the two countries despite their different COVID-19 containment strategies. CONCLUSION Societal expectations of who will die during the COVID-19 pandemic will likely be wrong if they assume pre-pandemic mortality sex ratios because the intra-pandemic ratios appear, at least in Norway and Sweden, detectably higher. The contribution of differences in policies to reduce risky behavior to those higher ratios appears, however, small.","Catalano, Ralph",Scandinavian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211010017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33985372/,219

91208,Importance of involving patients and public in health research in Bangladesh and Nepal.,2020-11-05,"BACKGROUND Around 10% of the female population is estimated to have a subclinical eating disorder. Many of these women are of working age. Previous research has shown associations between unhealthy eating behaviors and occupational stress or burnout. However, no previous study has explored the association between disordered eating and work engagement, a positive, fulfilling, affective-cognitive state of mind which has been positioned as the conceptual opposite of burnout. Thus, that was the aim of the present study. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, a sample of 701 Swedish women completed the 9-item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9) and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). They were divided into a Healthy Eating (HE) and a Disordered Eating (DE) group based on their EDE-Q scores. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test the association between disordered eating and work engagement. The Kruskal Wallis test was used to assess the associations between educational level, marital status and age group, and work engagement. RESULTS Neither the UWES scores nor the EDE-Q scores were found to have a normal distribution. Non-parametric testing showed that the DE group reported significantly lower work engagement than the HE group (p = 0.016). There were no significant associations between education, marital status or age (independent variables) and work engagement (dependent variable) (p = 0.826, 0.309, and 0.349, respectively). CONCLUSION These findings indicate that work engagement may play a role in disordered eating, and that there is a need for future research to consider the workplace environment as a potential source for altering disordered eating behaviors.","Willmer, Mikaela; Westerberg Jacobson, Josefin; Lindberg, Magnus",BMC women's health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-021-01429-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407786/,219

After finding the first positive cases, the question arose whether the virus had entered Hungary and caused infections before this date. Before March 4, 2020, except for the two above-mentioned samples, none of the 224 swab samples received specifically for SARS-CoV-2 tested positive. AIM The National Reference Laboratory for Respiratory Viruses of the National Public Health Center aimed to carry out a retrospective study of the swab and other samples taken for testing respiratory virus infections between January 1, and April 19, 2020 sent by sentinel physicians within the influenza surveillance for diagnostic purposes. METHOD For the study, we used swab samples taken weekly by sentinel physicians of the influenza surveillance service, and other samples received for diagnostic purposes. Tests were performed using real-time PCR. RESULTS All the 465 swab samples sent by sentinel physicians were found to be SARS-CoV-2 negative. Also, of the 551 samples collected for diagnostic reasons of other respiratory viruses, no SARS-CoV-2 positive was found among those taken before March 4.

Similarities with bacterial sepsis were observed; however, few studies specifically addressed differences of immune response between both conditions. Here, we report a longitudinal analysis of the immune response in coronavirus disease 2019 patients, its correlation with outcome, and comparison between severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients and septic patients. DESIGN Longitudinal, retrospective observational study. SETTING Tertiary-care hospital during the first 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in France. PATIENTS All successive patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection admitted to the emergency department, medical ward, and ICU with at least one available immunophenotyping performed during hospital stay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Between March and April 2020, 247 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 were included and compared with a historical cohort of 108 severe septic patients. Nonsevere coronavirus disease 2019 patients (n = 153) presented normal or slightly altered immune profiles. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (n = 94) immune profile differed from sepsis. Coronavirus disease 2019 exhibited profound and prolonged lymphopenia (mostly on CD3, CD4, CD8, and NK cells), neutrophilia, and human leukocyte antigen D receptor expression on CD14+ monocytes down-regulation. Surprisingly, coronavirus disease 2019 patients presented a unique profile of B cells expansion, basophilia, and eosinophilia. Lymphopenia, human leukocyte antigen D receptor expression on CD14+ monocytes down-regulation, and neutrophilia were associated with a worsened outcome, whereas basophilia and eosinophilia were associated with survival. Circulating immune cell kinetics differed between severe coronavirus disease 2019 and sepsis, lack of correction of immune alterations in coronavirus disease 2019 patients during the first 2 weeks of ICU admission was associated with death and nosocomial infections. CONCLUSIONS Circulating immune cells profile differs between mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Severe coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a unique immune profile as compared with sepsis. Several immune features are associated with outcome. Thus, immune monitoring of coronavirus disease 2019 might be of help for patient management.","de Roquetaillade, Charles; Mansouri, Sehmi; Brumpt, Caren; Neuwirth, Marie; Voicu, Sebastian; Le Dorze, Matthieu; Fontaine, Candice; Barthelemy, Romain; Gayat, Etienne; Megarbane, Bruno; Mebazaa, Alexandre; Chousterman, Benjamin Glenn",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34001691/,219

The aim was to compare acute strength of various endoscopic colonic closure techniques by assessing air leak pressures in a previously described ex vivo experimental apparatus. METHODS Standardized colonic perforations were created using fresh porcine colon and subsequently closed on a bench. Six techniques included surgical suture (gold standard), QuickClips, T-tags, over-the-scope-clip (OTSC) system, and two types of flexible stapler (Covidien). After closure, each specimen was fixed in the apparatus and pressure was gradually increased until air bubbles were seen. Leak pressure was the primary outcome parameter. Closure using the gold standard (first 15 experiments) resulted in a mean leak pressure of 86.9 mmHg (SD 7). Using a noninferiority design a sample size of 12 specimens for each closure technique was determined. RESULTS Mean colotomy leak pressures in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and difference (with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) between each technique and the gold standard were: QuickClips 85.1 (difference -1.8; 95% CI -7.0 to 3.9); T-tags 53.9 (difference -33.0; -39.0 to -27.0); OTSC 90.3 mmHg (difference 3.4; -6.1 to 12.9); 15-mm shaft stapler 98.5 mmHg (difference 9.7; 0.8 to 18.5) and 8-mm shaft stapler 96.6 mmHg (difference 11.6; 1.5 to 21.7).

Following that reverse TSP, WAS was performed to cut the septal tissue using a 0.010 microwire and RF wire. The atrial septum defect (ASD) was enlarged to a size of 15 mm. WAS with a reverse TSP could be a useful and safe method to enlarge ASD in infants with congenital heart diseases.","Nagatomo, Yusaku; Nagata, Hazumu; Yamamura, Kenichiro; Ohga, Shouichi",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.29514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33539042/,219
104746,Factors associated with the willingness of health care personnel to work during an influenza public health emergency: an integrative review.,2012,"BACKGROUND Medical students in China face severe depression and anxiety because of their difficult circumstances, such as the long length of schooling, academic pressure, and the stress of clinical practice. Although there have been many empirical studies about depression or anxiety in medical students in China, no previous studies have conducted a related systematic review about this topic in English. This analysis can convey the general findings from China to other areas of the world. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis of depression or anxiety in medical students and related determinants were conducted. Three Chinese and three English databases were searched for the review, with no restrictions on language. Articles published between January 1, 2000 and April 1, 2018 were included. RESULTS Twenty-one articles investigating a total of 35,160 individual Chinese medical students were included in this review. The prevalence of depression ranged from 13.10 to 76.21% with a mean of 32.74%, and the prevalence of anxiety ranged from 8.54 to 88.30% with a mean of 27.22%. Based on the meta-analysis, gender, grade level, residence, satisfaction with current major and monthly household income per capita were significantly associated with depression. Grade level and satisfaction with current major were significantly associated with anxiety. Other risk factors were identified and described using a narrative approach. CONCLUSION The mean prevalence of depression was 32.74% amongst medical students in China, whereas the mean prevalence of anxiety was 27.22%. The determinants of depression and anxiety included individual factors, social and economic factors, and environmental factors. More measures should be taken towards at-risk medical students based on the identified risk factors.","Mao, Ying; Zhang, Ning; Liu, Jinlin; Zhu, Bin; He, Rongxin; Wang, Xue",BMC medical education,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-019-1744-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31477124/,219
105648,Fransisca Handy Agung: improving adolescent health in Indonesia.,2021-01-30,"GOALS We sought to determine the incidence of jackhammer esophagus (JE) after lung transplantation (LT) and identify potential risk factors for the development of JE after LT. BACKGROUND JE is a rare esophageal motility disorder, and its pathophysiology remains unclear. Lung transplantation has been implicated as a potential risk factor for JE, but the incidence of JE after LT is unknown. STUDY A retrospective cohort of adult patients who underwent LT at 2 tertiary care centers over 7.5 years was reviewed. Analysis was performed on patients who underwent a high-resolution esophageal manometry (EM) study before and after LT. JE was defined according to the latest Chicago classification, version 3.0. RESULTS A total of 57 patients without JE identified on pre-LT EM also underwent an EM study after LT. Fifteen (25.4%) were found to have new JE after LT. Patients with newly diagnosed JE after LT were older (61.3±5.3 y vs. 51.6±15.6 y; P=0.02) and more often had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 47.6% vs. 16.6%; P=0.03) compared with those without COPD. There was a trend toward increased risk for JE among female individuals (60% vs. 33.3%; P=0.07) and those with shorter surgical anastomosis times (75.8±12.2 min vs. 84.4±14.3; P=0.06). There was no significant difference between body mass index, opioid use, pretransplant EM findings, surgical ischemic time, occurrence of gastroparesis, or measured post-LT outcomes between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS JE occurs not uncommonly in patients after LT. Older age and COPD pre-LT may be significant risk factors.","Cangemi, David J; Flanagan, Ryan; Bailey, Abbey; Staller, Kyle; Kuo, Braden",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcg.0000000000001254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393281/,219

108148,Prevalence of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Depression in General Population in India During COVID-19 Pandemic Home Quarantine.,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND The first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in March 2020 in Europe, which is normally the peak incidence period of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infections, implying cocirculation and potentially causing competition between them. METHODS We investigated differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes of HMPV infections in hospitalized patients before (January 2016-28 February, 2020) and HMPV and COVID-19 during part of the COVID-19 pandemic (28 February, 2020-1 April, 2020). RESULTS A total of 239 HMPV patients and 303 COVID-19 patients were included. Incidence of HMPV peaked in March. Despite a 324% increase in HMPV testing during the COVID-19 outbreak, incidence of HMPV remained stable. Clinical characteristics showed 25 (11%) ICU admissions and 14 (6%) deaths. History of myocardial infarction, higher age and lower BMI were independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. Clinical characteristics of HMPV-infected patients did not differ between the non-COVID-19 period and the examined COVID-19 period except for length of hospital stay (7 vs. 5 days). HMPV infection and COVID-19 shared many clinical features but HMPV was associated with female gender, elderly patients and chronic conditions (COPD and chronic heart failure). Clinical outcomes did not differ between the viruses during the COVID-19 period. CONCLUSIONS The clinical impact of HMPV infection did not change during the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of incidence and/or disease severity; hence, HMPV and SARS-CoV-2 are probably co-circulating independently. Despite the current clinical focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians should keep in mind that HMPV-infection may mimic COVID-19 and is also associated with serious adverse outcomes.","Jongbloed, Mandy; Leijte, Wouter T; Linssen, Catharina F M; van den Hoogen, Bernadette G; van Gorp, Eric C M; de Kruif, Martijn D",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2021.1887510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612055/,219

AIM To characterize patients with SARS-CoV2 disease who required hospitalization in the ICU and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in our hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective observational study was performed, which included the first 50 patients, aged 54 ± 13 years (58% men), with SARS-CoV2 disease, with ICU and IMV requirements between March 23 and June 2, 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory and imaging, therapies performed and IMV characteristics were registered. The most relevant outcomes observed were lethality, number of days in the ICU and connection to an IMV. RESULTS Ninety percent of patients were overweight or obese, 46% had hypertension and many had diabetes mellitus. They had elevated inflammatory parameters and typical patterns of COVID-19 in computed tomography. Most of the patients got protective lung ventilation with a high rate of use of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) and prone position. Antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir were administered according to the protocol of the institution. Lethality was 16% (8 cases) at the end of this study.

METHODS AND RESULTS Among 437 consecutive patients who presented with VAs for RFCA, twenty-six patients with acute successful RFCA at the SP-MA were included in this study. The ratio of the amplitude of the first positive peak (if present) versus the nadir in the unipolar electrogram (EGM) was 0.00-0.03 (0.00) at the acute successful RFCA site. The time interval between the QRS onset and the maximum descending slope (D-Max) in the unipolar EGM (QRS-Uni) was 18.8 ± 13.6 ms. With bipolar mapping, the ventricular QRS (V-QRS) interval was 3.75-17.3 (11) ms, 6 (23.1%) patients showed the earliest V-QRS interval of 0 ms, and the other 20 patients (76.9%) showed a V-QRS interval of 10-54 ms. The RFCA start-to-effect time was 14.1 ± 7.2 s in 23 patients (88.5%). In the remaining 3 patients (11.5%), the mean duration of successful RFCA was not well defined due to the infrequent nature of clinical VAs during RFCA. Early (within 3 days) and late (1-year) recurrence rates were 23.1% (6 patients) and 26.9% (7 patients), respectively. VAs disappeared 3 days later due to delayed RFCA efficacy in 2 patients (7.7%). No complications occurred during the RFCA procedure or the one-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS SP-MA VAs are a rare but distinct subgroup of VAs. Bipolar and unipolar EGM features can help to determine the optimal RFCA site, and the QRS-Uni interval may serve as a marker that could be used to guide RFCA.","Di, Chengye; Letsas, Konstantinos P; Gao, Peng; Wang, Qun; Wu, Yanxi; Lin, Wenhua",BMC cardiovascular disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-021-02205-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407753/,219

129427,Lessons learned from pharmacy learner and educator experiences during early stages of COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-05-06,"Rutin has many biological activities, but poor solubility and absorption limit its oral application. This study aimed to investigate the characterization of metastable rutin-ethanolate and its solubility and oral bioavailability. In this research, a soluble rutin/CH3CH2OH solvate (Form Π) was prepared by solvent crystallization. High-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatograph, and 1H-NMR showed that Form Π was formed by rutin and ethanol in a molar ratio of 1:1. The changes of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 1H-NMR spectrum and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation predicted hydrogen bond formation between 4'-O of rutin and -OH of ethanol. The results of morphology, solid state CP/MAS 13C-NMR, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that Form Π is a novel polymorph that differs from Form Ι (rutin trihydrate). Form Π can be stored for a long time under sealed and dry conditions at 40°C but would gradually transform into Form Ι under humid conditions. Although Form Π is a new metastable polymorph relative to Form Ι, Form Π has better solubility and faster dissolution rate. Moreover, the bioavailability of Form Π was 2.04 times higher than that of Form Ι. This outcome implied that Form Π would be a prospective raw material of oral preparation.","Liu, Yanjie; Zhao, Xiuhua; Zhang, Qian; Wang, Lingling; Li, Yuanyuan; Li, Yuanzuo",AAPS PharmSciTech,https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-020-01779-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839899/,219

133041,"Racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 hospitalizations by metropolitan status among Medicare beneficiaries, 1 January-31 December 2020.",2021-10-05,"BACKGROUND Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) may complicate monitoring of pulmonary mechanics owing to their impact on the respiratory system. However, recommendations for mechanical ventilation of patients with IAH/ACS and the interpretation of thoracoabdominal interactions remain unclear. Our study aimed to characterize the influence of elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on airway plateau pressure (PPLAT) and bladder pressure (PBLAD). METHODS Nine deeply anesthetized swine were mechanically ventilated via tracheostomy: volume-controlled mode at tidal volume (VT) of 10 mL/kg, frequency of 15, inspiratory-expiratory ratio of 1:2, and PEEP of 1 and 10 cm H2O (PEEP1 and PEEP10, respectively). A tracheostomy tube was placed in the peritoneal cavity, and IAP levels of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mm Hg were applied, using a continuous positive airway pressure system. At each IAP level, PBLAD and airway pressure measurements were performed during both PEEP1 and PEEP10. RESULTS PBLAD increased as experimental IAP rose (y = 0.83x + 0.5; R = 0.98; p < 0.001 at PEEP1). Minimal underestimation of IAP by PBLAD was observed (-2.5 ± 0.8 mm Hg at an IAP of 10-25 mm Hg). Applying PEEP10 did not significantly affect the correlation between experimental IAP and PBLAD. Approximately 50% of the PBLAD (in cm H2O) was reflected by changes in PPLAT, regardless of the PEEP level applied. Increasing IAP did not influence hemodynamics at any level of IAP generated. CONCLUSION With minimal underestimation, PBLAD measurements closely correlated with experimentally regulated IAP, independent of the PEEP level applied. For each PEEP level applied, a constant proportion (approximately 50%) of measured PBLAD (in cm H2O) was reflected in PPLAT. A higher safety threshold for PPLAT should be considered in the setting of IAH/ACS as the clinician considers changes in VT. A strategy of reducing VT to cap PPLAT at widely recommended values may not be warranted in the setting of increased IAP.","Cortes-Puentes, Gustavo A; Cortes-Puentes, Luis A; Adams, Alexander B; Anderson, Christopher P; Marini, John J; Dries, David J",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/ta.0b013e31829243a7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23694861/,219

140097,Learning from the Past to Face the Worst with Our Best.,2021-10-01,"CONTEXT Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. Most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, resulting in a very low 5-year survival. Screening may reduce the risk of death from lung cancer. OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review of the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). A multisociety collaborative initiative (involving the American Cancer Society, American College of Chest Physicians, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network) was undertaken to create the foundation for development of an evidence-based clinical guideline. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE (Ovid: January 1996 to April 2012), EMBASE (Ovid: January 1996 to April 2012), and the Cochrane Library (April 2012). STUDY SELECTION Of 591 citations identified and reviewed, 8 randomized trials and 13 cohort studies of LDCT screening met criteria for inclusion. Primary outcomes were lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included nodule detection, invasive procedures, follow-up tests, and smoking cessation. DATA EXTRACTION Critical appraisal using predefined criteria was conducted on individual studies and the overall body of evidence. Differences in data extracted by reviewers were adjudicated by consensus. RESULTS Three randomized studies provided evidence on the effect of LDCT screening on lung cancer mortality, of which the National Lung Screening Trial was the most informative, demonstrating that among 53,454 participants enrolled, screening resulted in significantly fewer lung cancer deaths (356 vs 443 deaths; lung cancer−specific mortality, 274 vs 309 events per 100,000 person-years for LDCT and control groups, respectively; relative risk, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73-0.93; absolute risk reduction, 0.33%; P = .004). The other 2 smaller studies showed no such benefit. In terms of potential harms of LDCT screening, across all trials and cohorts, approximately 20% of individuals in each round of screening had positive results requiring some degree of follow-up, while approximately 1% had lung cancer. There was marked heterogeneity in this finding and in the frequency of follow-up investigations, biopsies, and percentage of surgical procedures performed in patients with benign lesions. Major complications in those with benign conditions were rare. CONCLUSION Low-dose computed tomography screening may benefit individuals at an increased risk for lung cancer, but uncertainty exists about the potential harms of screening and the generalizability of results.","Bach, Peter B; Mirkin, Joshua N; Oliver, Thomas K; Azzoli, Christopher G; Berry, Donald A; Brawley, Otis W; Byers, Tim; Colditz, Graham A; Gould, Michael K; Jett, James R; Sabichi, Anita L; Smith-Bindman, Rebecca; Wood, Douglas E; Qaseem, Amir; Detterbeck, Frank C",JAMA,https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2012.5521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22610500/,219

Although recently progress has been made in identifying underlying genetic mutations, many questions still remain. Animal models of MDS have been produced by introduction of specific mutations. However, there is no spontaneous mouse model of MDS, and an animal model to simulate natural MDS pathogenesis is urgently needed. Methods In characterizing the genetically diverse mouse strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) we observed that one, designated JUN, had abnormal hematological traits. This strain was thus further analyzed for phenotypic and pathological identification, comparing the changes in each cell population in peripheral blood and in bone marrow. Results In a specific-pathogen free environment, mice of the JUN strain are relatively thin, with healthy appearance. However, in a conventional environment, they become lethargic, develop wrinkled yellow hair, have loose and light stools, and are prone to infections. We found that the mice were cytopenic, which was due to abnormal differentiation of multipotent bone marrow progenitor cells. These are common characteristics of MDS. Conclusions A mouse strain, JUN, was found displaying spontaneous myelodysplastic syndrome. This strain has the advantage over existing models in that it develops MDS spontaneously and is more similar to human MDS than genetically modified mouse models. JUN mice will be an important tool for pathogenesis research of MDS and for evaluation of new drugs and treatments.","Li, Weisha; Cao, Lin; Li, Mengyuan; Yang, Xingjiu; Zhang, Wenlong; Song, Zhiqi; Wang, Xinpei; Zhang, Lingyan; Morahan, Grant; Qin, Chuan; Gao, Ran",Animal models and experimental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/ame2.12168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179724/,219

METHODS The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey of 113 family physicians in Kansas between May 22, 2020 and June 25, 2020. The study participants completed an anonymous, 36-item survey assessing their concerns about being exposed to COVID-19 and levels of personal depression, anxiety, stress, and burnout in addition to demographic information. RESULTS There was a 45.6% response rate, with 50.4% (n = 57) of the respondents reporting manifestations of burnout. The physicians who personally treated any presumptive or confirmed COVID-19 patient, compared with those who did not, were more likely to report at least 1 manifestation of burnout, experience emotional exhaustion, and feel a higher level of personal stress. CONCLUSION Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic may be taking an emotional toll on family physicians in Kansas.

180733,Cognitive behavioral crisis intervention model for health care professionals in Pakistan,2021,"Viral infection triggers activation of the integrated stress response (ISR). In response to viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2, converting it from a translation initiator into a potent translation inhibitor and this restricts the synthesis of viral proteins. Phosphorylated eIF2 (eIF2-P) inhibits translation by binding to eIF2’s dedicated, heterodecameric nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B and conformationally inactivating it. We show that the NSs protein of Sandfly Fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) allows the virus to evade the ISR. Mechanistically, NSs tightly binds to eIF2B (KD = 43 nM), blocks eIF2-P binding, and rescues eIF2B GEF activity. Cryo-EM structures demonstrate that SFSV NSs and eIF2-P directly compete, with the primary NSs contacts to eIF2Bα mediated by five ‘aromatic fingers’. NSs binding preserves eIF2B activity by maintaining eIF2B’s conformation in its active A-State.","Schoof, Michael; Wang, Lan; Zachery Cogan, J; Lawrence, Rosalie; Boone, Morgane; Wuerth, Jennifer Deborah; Frost, Adam; Walter, Peter",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.07.447473,219
184864,[SICOVID: a cantonal COVID information system for public health decision-making].,2020-11-11,"Objective The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had devastating effects globally. These effects are likely to result in mental health problems at different levels. Although studies have reported the mental health burden of the pandemic on the general population and frontline health workers, the impact of the disease on the mental health of patients in COVID-19 treatment and isolation centres have been understudied in Africa. We estimated the prevalence of depression and anxiety and associated risk factors in hospitalized persons with COVID-19. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 489 patients with COVID-19 at the three government-designated treatment and isolation centres in Edo State, Nigeria. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) tool were used to assess depression and anxiety respectively. Binary logistic regression was applied to determine risk factors of depression and anxiety. Results Of the 489 participants, 49.1% and 38.0% had depressive and anxiety symptoms respectively. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and combination of both were 16.2%, 12.9% and 9.0% respectively. Moderate-severe symptoms of COVID-19, [≥]14 days in isolation, worrying about the outcome of infection and stigma increased the risk of having depression and anxiety. Additionally, being separated/divorced increased the risk of having depression and having comorbidity increased the risk of having anxiety. Conclusion A substantial proportion of our participants experienced depression, anxiety and a combination of both especially in those who had the risk factors we identified. The findings underscore the need to address these risk factors early in the course of the disease and integrate mental health interventions into COVID-19 management guidelines.","Okogbenin, E.

185126,COVID-19: Critical Role of Angiotensin 1-7 in ACE2 Modulation.,2020-06-01,"Introduction: Back and neck pain are the leading causes of disability worldwide. Doctors of chiropractic (DCs) are trained to manage these common conditions and can provide nonpharmacologic treatment aligned with international clinical practice guidelines. Although DCs practice in at least 90 countries, chiropractic care is often not available within integrated health care delivery systems. A lack of DCs in private practice, particularly in low-income communities, may also limit access to chiropractic care. Improved collaboration between medical providers and community-based DCs, or embedding DCs in medical settings such as hospitals or community health centers, may improve access to evidence-based care for musculoskeletal conditions. This scoping review aims to map studies of DCs working with or within medical settings. Methods and analyses: We will use the recommended six-step approach for scoping reviews. We will search three electronic data bases including Medline, Embase, and Web of Science. Two investigators will independently review all titles and abstracts to identify relevant records, screen the full-text articles of potentially admissible records, and systematically extract data from selected articles. We will include studies published in English from 1998 to 2020 describing medical settings that have established formal relationships with community-based DCs (e.g., shared medical record) or where DCs practice in medical settings. Data extraction and reporting will be guided by the Proctor Conceptual Model for Implementation Research, which has three domains: clinical intervention; implementation strategies; and outcome measurement. Stakeholders from diverse clinical fields will offer feedback on the implications of our findings via a web-based survey. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval will not be obtained for this review of published and publicly accessible data. Our results will be disseminated through conference presentations and a peer-reviewed publication. Our findings will form the basis of implementation strategies to support adoption of chiropractic care within integrated health care delivery systems.","Roseen, E.

Due to the improved prenatal diagnostic modalities, the diagnosis of cardiac disease is increasing in newborns. Fetal echocardiography is considered a good and accurate diagnostic method for congenital heart disease. Objective To study the common indications of fetal echocardiography and the detection of congenital heart disease in Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital. Method In this hospital-based, retrospective study, we reviewed medical records of 324 fetuses who were indicated for fetal echocardiography at Dhulikhel Hospital over 24 months period of time (September 1, 2017 to August 31, 2019). Result The mean age of pregnant women at presentation for fetal echocardiography was 30.7 ± 4.7 years. The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 28.9 ± 4.9 weeks. Among all the pregnant women, 208 (65%) presented during the second trimester and 112 (35%) presented during the third trimester. Maternal indications for fetal echocardiography were seen in48.12% cases, whereas fetal indications were seen in 42.81% cases. The most common indication was for maternal gestational diabetes (30.31%). Among the 324fetal echocardiography results, 65.43% cases had normal findings, echogenic intra-cardiac foci were seen in 18.82% and significant abnormal findings were seen in 15.74% of cases. Among all women having maternal indication for echocardiography, 34 (22.07%) fetus had some form of abnormal findings, whereas only 17 (12.40%) fetus with fetal indication showed abnormal findings (p < 0.05). Conclusion Indication of fetal echocardiography is increasing and can be a good diagnostic tool to improve prognosis and outcome of a newborn. It has become widely used in pediatric cardiology. Raising awareness is necessary regarding the importance of fetal echocardiography in the management and outcome of a newborn with cardiac anomalies.","Joshi, A; Shrestha, R P B; Shrestha, P S",Kathmandu University medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305747/,219
188650,How often do you wash your hands? A review of studies of hand-washing practices in the community during and after the SARS outbreak in 2003.,2007,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge for intensive care units (ICU) in part due to the failure to identify risks for patients early and the inability to render an accurate prognosis. Previous reports suggest a strong association between hypercoagulability and poor outcome. Factors related to hemostasis may, therefore, serve as tools to improve the management of COVID-19 patients. Aim The purpose of this report is to develop a model to determine whether it is possible to early identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thromboembolic complications (TCs). Methods We analyzed electronic health record data of 108 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the adult ICU of the Erasmus University Medical Center between February 27 and May 20, 2020. By training a decision tree classifier on 66% of the available data, a model for the prediction of TCs was developed. Results The median (interquartile range) age was 62 (53-70) years and 73% were male. Forty-three patients (40%) developed a TC during their ICU stay. Mortality was higher for patients in the TCs group compared to the control group (26% vs. 8%, P=0.03). Lactate dehydrogenase, standardized bicarbonate, albumin, and leukocytes were identified by the Decision Tree classifier as the most powerful predictors for TCs 2 days before the onset of the TC, with a sensitivity of 73% and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.7 on the test dataset. Conclusions Clinically relevant TCs frequently occur in critically ill COVID-19 patients. These can successfully be predicted using a decision tree model. Although this model could be of special importance to aid clinical decision making, its generalizability and clinical impact should be determined in a larger population. Relevance for patients Recently, severe TCs were observed in COVID-19 patients with progressive respiratory failure warranting ICU treatment. Timely identification of patients at risk of developing TCs is critical inasmuch as it would enable clinicians to initiate potentially salvaging therapeutic anticoagulation.","van de Sande, Davy; van Genderen, Michel E; Rosman, Babette; Diether, Maren; Endeman, Henrik; van den Akker, Johannes P C; Ludwig, Martijn; Huiskens, Joost; Gommers, Diederik; van Bommel, Jasper",Journal of clinical and translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501388/,219

Drowning is responsible for more deaths among children aged 1-4 years than any other cause except congenital anomalies. For persons aged ≤29 years, drowning is one of the top three causes of unintentional injury death (2). Previous research has identified racial/ethnic disparities in drowning rates. To describe these differences by age of decedent and drowning setting, CDC analyzed 12 years of combined mortality data from 1999-2010 for those aged ≤29 years. Among non-Hispanics, the overall drowning rate for American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) was twice the rate for whites, and the rate for blacks was 1.4 times the rate for whites. Disparities were greatest in swimming pools, with swimming pool drowning rates among blacks aged 5-19 years 5.5 times higher than those among whites in the same age group. This disparity was greatest at ages 11-12 years; at these ages, blacks drown in swimming pools at 10 times the rate of whites. Drowning prevention strategies include using barriers (e.g., fencing) and life jackets, actively supervising or lifeguarding, teaching basic swimming skills and performing bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The practicality and effectiveness of these strategies varies by setting; however, basic swimming skills can be beneficial across all settings.","Gilchrist, Julie; Parker, Erin M",MMWR.

200465,"The Impact of Covid-19 State Closure Orders on Consumer Spending, Employment, and Business Revenue",2021,"Mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM) causes acute encephalitis and acute and chronic demyelinating diseases in mice. Dendritic cells (DCs) are key cells in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and infection of these cells could potentially contribute to a dysregulated immune response; consistent with this, recent results suggest that DCs are readily infected by another strain of mouse hepatitis virus, the A59 strain (MHV-A59). Herein, we show that the JHM strain also productively infected DCs. Moreover, mature DCs were at least 10 times more susceptible than immature DCs to infection with MHV-JHM. DC function was impaired after MHV-JHM infection, resulting in decreased stimulation of CD8 T cells in vitro. Preferential infection of mature DCs was not due to differential expression of the MHV-JHM receptor CEACAM-1a on mature or immature cells or to differences in apoptosis. Although we could not detect infected DCs in vivo, both CD8(+) and CD11b(+) splenic DCs were susceptible to infection with MHV-JHM directly ex vivo. This preferential infection of mature DCs may inhibit the development of an efficient immune response to the virus.","Zhou, Haixia; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16474157/,219

In the United States, most human rabies cases are associated with rabid bats, whereas in developing countries, dogs are the most common reservoir and vector species. In March 2008, a case of imported human rabies in a recently arrived, undocumented Mexican immigrant was laboratory confirmed by public health officials in California. The rabies virus isolated from the patient was a previously uncharacterized variant most closely related to viruses found in Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis). The molecular and phylogenetic characterizations of this rabies virus variant have been described previously. This report summarizes the epidemiologic investigation and the ensuing public health response. A total of 20 persons, mostly household contacts, received postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) because of potential exposure to rabies virus from the patient.

COVID-19 patients are required to be isolated during treatment to reduce transmission. This can cause anxiety and depression, which in turn worsens the patient's illness. Providing supportive psychotherapy can help provide a feeling of safety, comfort and calm for patients. The choice of method in providing supportive psychotherapy can be done online/teleconsultation or internet-based. This clinical review aims to determine the effect of online teleconsultation or internet-based psychotherapy on COVID-19 patients. METHODS A systematic search was performed using online databases, such as PubMed, Cochrane, EBSCO/CINAHL and ProQuest. The identified articles were screened using eligibility criteria. There were 2 studies (Zhou et al, and Wei et al) which were analyzed critically using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. RESULTS Both studies showed that management of psychotherapy through teleconsultation or internet-based on COVID-19 patients can help relieve the patient's psychological symptoms. Zhou et al studied 63 suspected COVID-19 with 23.8% (n = 15) having a Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) score of 8 or more. There was a significant decrease in HADS-A nxiety (HADS-A) scores (p <0.01) and HADS-Depression (HADS-D) scores (p <0.01) in 15 patients, and from the overall HADS scores (p < 0.01). Wei et al. Showed 17-HAMD and HAMA scores in the online psychological intervention group also showed a significant reduction in symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to controls. CONCLUSION Psychotherapy through online teleconsultation or internet-based on COVID-19 patients can help relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression and teleconsultation and also effective in dealing with psychological complications in patients with COVID-19.","Shatri, Hamzah; Prabu, Oryza Gryagus; Tetrasiwi, Erpryta Nurdia; Faisal, Edward; Putranto, Rudi; Ismail, Raden Irawati",Acta medica Indonesiana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34611077/,219

212133,Spiritual Well-Being and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy,2021,"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of COVID-19 means that government and health services providers have little time to plan and design effective response policies. It is therefore important to quickly provide accurate predictions of how vulnerable geographic regions such as counties are to the spread of this virus. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop county-level prediction around near future disease movement for COVID-19 occurrences using publicly available data. METHODS: We estimated county-level COVID-19 occurrences for the period March 14 to 31, 2020, based on data fused from multiple publicly available sources inclusive of health statistics, demographics, and geographical features. We developed a three-stage model using XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, to quantify the probability of COVID-19 occurrence and estimate the number of potential occurrences for unaffected counties. Finally, these results were combined to predict the county-level risk. This risk was then used as an estimated after-five-day-vulnerability of the county. RESULTS: The model predictions showed a sensitivity over 71% and specificity over 94% for models built using data from March 14 to 31, 2020. We found that population, population density, percentage of people aged >70 years, and prevalence of comorbidities play an important role in predicting COVID-19 occurrences. We observed a positive association at the county level between urbanicity and vulnerability to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The developed model can be used for identification of vulnerable counties and potential data discrepancies. Limited testing facilities and delayed results introduce significant variation in reported cases, which produces a bias in the model.","Mehta, Mihir; Julaiti, Juxihong; Griffin, Paul; Kumara, Soundar",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,219

METHODS: An HCV progression Markov model was developed considering DAA eligibility and population data during the years 2015-2019. The period of time to recover the investment in DAAs was calculated as the cost saved by avoiding estimated clinical events for 1000 standardized treated patients. A delayed treatment scenario because of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was also developed. RESULTS: The estimated number of avoided hepatocellular carcinoma, decompensated cirrhosis and liver transplantations over a 20-year time horizon was: 1,057 in England; 1,221 in Italy; 1,211 in Romania; and 1,103 in Spain for patients treated during 2015-2016 and 640 in England; 626 in Italy; 739 in Romania; and 643 in Spain for patients treated during 2017-2019. The cost-savings ranged from  45 to  275 million. The investment needed to expand access to DAAs in 2015-2019 is estimated to be recovered in 6.5 years in England; 5.4 years in Italy; 6.7 years in Romania; and 4.5 years in Spain. A delay in treatment because of COVID-19 will increase liver mortality in all countries. CONCLUSION: Direct-acting antivirals have significant clinical benefits and can bring substantial cost-savings over the next 20 years, reaching a Break-even point in a short period of time. When pursuing an exit strategy from strict lockdown measures for COVID-19, providing DAAs should remain high on the list of priorities in order to maintain HCV elimination efforts.","Mennini, Francesco S; Marcellusi, Andrea; Robbins Scott, Sarah; Montilla, Simona; Craxi, Antonio; Buti, Maria; Gheorghe, Liana; Ryder, Stephen; Kondili, Loreta A",Liver int,,219

213128,"Health system redesign for equity in maternal and newborn health must be codesigned, country led, adapted to context and fit for purpose",2020,"BACKGROUND: Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of ovarian cancer management. In 2017, the authors implemented a multi-disciplinary surgical team comprising gynecologic oncologists as well as colorectal, hepatobiliary, and upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgeons to increase gross macroscopic resection rates. This report aims to describe changes in complete cytoreduction rates and morbidity after the implementation of a multi-disciplinary surgical team comprising gynecologic oncologists as well as colorectal, hepatobiliary, and upper GI surgeons in a tertiary gynecologic oncology unit. METHODS: The study used two cohorts. Cohort A was a retrospectively collated cohort from 2006 to 2015. Cohort B was a prospectively collated cohort of patients initiated in 2017. A multidisciplinary approach to preoperative medical optimization, intraoperative management, and postoperative care was implemented in 2017. The patients in cohort B with upper abdominal disease were offered primary cytoreduction with or without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Before 2017, the patients with upper abdominal disease received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cohort A). RESULTS: This study included 146 patients in cohort A (2006-2015) and 93 patients in cohort B (2017-2019) with stages 3 or 4 ovarian cancer. The overall complete macroscopic resection rate (CC0) increased from 58.9 in cohort A to 67.7% in cohort B. The rate of primary cytoreductive surgery (CRS) increased from 38 (55/146) in cohort A to 42% (39/93) in cohort B. The CC0 rate for the patients who underwent primary CRS increased from 49 in cohort A to 77% in cohort B. Major morbidity remained stable throughout both study periods (2006-2019). CONCLUSIONS: The study data demonstrate that implementation of a multidisciplinary team intraoperative approach and a meticulous approach to preoperative optimization resulted in significantly improved complete resection rates, particularly for women offered primary CRS.","Mulligan, Karen M; Glennon, Kate; Donohoe, Fionán; O039,; Brien, Yvonne; Mc Donnell, Brian C; Bartels, Helena C; Vermeulen, Carolien; Walsh, Tom; Shields, Conor; McCormack, Orla; Conneely, John; Boyd, William D; Mc Vey, Ruaidhrí; Mulsow, Jurgen; Brennan, Donal J",Ann. surg. oncol,,219

213891,An e-mental health intervention to support burdened people in times of the COVID-19 pandemic: CoPE It,2020,"A range of research reports that many gender and sexually diverse people drink alcohol at heavy levels. This study used 24 focus groups to explore shared understandings of alcohol use among gender and sexually diverse people living in New Zealand. An inductive, data-driven thematic analysis was employed to identify explanations for heavy drinking among gender and sexually diverse people. Three key explanations were articulated: alcohol is needed for socialising; drinking helps coping with stress; alcohol and drug treatment services are inadequate. These results demonstrate justifications for heavy drinking in certain contexts. This behaviour runs counter to public health approaches and messages that highlight low-risk levels of drinking or not drinking as desirable. Public health interventions should continue to address alcohol use at a whole population level but should be supplemented by policy and interventions that take into account the sociocultural contexts and structural conditions that encourage drinking among gender and sexually diverse people.","Adams, Jeffery; Asiasiga, Lanuola; Neville, Stephen",Glob Public Health,,219

216495,COVID-19 Pandemic Prevalence and Risk Factors for Depression Among Health Care Workers in South Asia,2021,"On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of global concern. Accordingly, the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), including medical face masks, has sharply risen compared with 2019. The new situation has led to a sharp increase in energy demand and the environmental impacts associated with these product systems. Hence, the pandemic's effects on the environmental consequences of various PPE types, such as medical face masks, should be assessed. In light of that, the current study aimed to identify the environmental hot-spots of medical face mask production and consumption by using life cycle assessment (LCA) and tried to provide solutions to mitigate the adverse impacts. Based on the results obtained, in 2020, medical face masks production using fossil-based plastics causes the loss of 2.03 × 103 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs);1.63 × 108 PDF*m2*yr damage to ecosystem quality;the climate-damaging release of 2.13 × 109 kg CO2eq;and 5.65 × 1010 MJ damage to resources. Besides, annual medical face mask production results in 5.88 × 104 TJ demand for exergy. On the other hand, if used makes are not appropriately handled, they can lead to 4.99 × 105 Pt/yr additional damage to the environment in 2020 as determined by the EDIP 2003. Replacement of fossil-based plastics with bio-based plastics, at rates ranging from 10 to 100%, could mitigate the product's total yearly environmental damage by 4–43%, respectively. Our study calls attention to the environmental sustainability of PPE used to prevent virus transmission in the current and future pandemics.","Tabatabaei, Meisam Hosseinzadeh-Bandbafha Homa Yang Yi Aghbashlo Mortaza Lam Su Shiung Montgomery Hugh Peng Wanxi",Journal of Cleaner Production,,219
216496,COVID-19 Pandemic Prevalence and Risk Factors for Depression Among Health Care Workers in South Asia,2021,"BACKGROUND: Elective orthopaedic surgery during the Covid-19 pandemic requires careful case prioritisation. We aimed to produce consensus-based guidelines on the prioritisation of revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures. METHOD: Twenty-three revision TKA scenarios were assigned priority (NHS England/Royal College of Surgeons scale) by the British Association for Surgery of the Knee (BASK) Revision Knee Working Group (n = 24). Consensus agreement was defined as &#8805;70% respondents (18/24) giving the same prioritisation. Two voting rounds were undertaken; procedures achieving <70% agreement were given their most commonly assigned priority. RESULTS: 18/23 procedures achieved &#8805;70% agreement. Three were P1a (surgery within <24 h); DAIR for sepsis, peri-prosthetic fracture (PPF) fixation and PPF-revision TKA. Three were P1b (<72 h); debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) for a stable patient, flap coverage for an open knee, and acute extensor mechanism rupture. Eight were P2 (<4 weeks), including aseptic loosening at risk of collapse, inter-stage patients with poor functioning spacers. Five were P3 (<3 months), including second stage revision for infection, revision for instability with limited mobility. Four were P4 (can wait >3 months) e.g. aseptic loosening. CONCLUSION: Sepsis and PPF surgery are the most urgent procedures. Although most procedures should be undertaken within one to three months (P2/3), these cases represent a small revision practice volume; P4 cases (e.g. aseptic loosening without risk of collapse) make up most surgeons' caseload. These recommendations are a guideline; patient co-morbidities, Covid-19 pathways, availability of support services and multi-disciplinary team discussion within the regional revision network will dictate prioritisation.","Kalson, N S; Mathews, J A; Toms, A D; Murray, J R D",Knee,,219

The present study focuses on the patient safety culture and staff well-being admit the COVID-19 pandemic. In a large metropolitan hospital group, 337 employees who had participated in the quality improvement interventions completed an anonymous questionnaire of patient safety culture and personal well-being. The multiple regression analyses indicated that managerial role, seniority, female gender and direct contact with a patient were significantly related to the positive attitude on overall or certain dimensions of safety culture. Multivariate analysis also found that dimensions of teamwork climate, safety climate, job satisfaction and stress recognition as patient safety culture predicted staff exhaustion. Finally, comparing with the available institutional historic data in 2018, the COVID group scored higher on the working condition dimension of patient safety culture, but lower on the stress recognition dimension. The COVID group also scored higher on exhaustion. In the post-pandemic era, there seems to be an improvement on certain aspect of the patient safety culture among hospital staff, and the improvement is more prevalent for managers. However, exhaustion is also a poignant problem for all employees. These findings can inform hospital decision-makers in planning and implementing future improvements of patient safety culture and promoting employee well-being and resilience. Our findings also reveal directions for future research.","Chen, Hsing Yu; Lu, Luo; Ko, Yi Ming; Chueh, Jui Wen; Hsiao, Shu Ya; Wang, Pa Chun; Cooper, Cary L",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,219

Respiratory and rectal swabs were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Sera were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and microneutralisation assay. Symptoms, viral shedding and antibody response were examined. Forty-five participants (92%) were considered cases based on either positive PCR or positive ELISA for immunoglobulin G. Forty-two percent of cases were asymptomatic. Only 15% of symptomatic cases reported fever. Serial respiratory and rectal swabs were positive for 10% and 5% of participants respectively about 3 weeks after median symptom onset. Cycle threshold values were high (range 31-45). Attempts to isolate live virus were unsuccessful. The presence of symptoms was not associated with demographics, comorbidities or antibody response. In closed settings, incidence of COVID-19 could be almost double that suggested by symptom-based screening.

226301,Attitudes of Lebanese adults regarding COVID-19 vaccination,2021,"PurposeClose-contact rates are thought to be a significant driving force behind the dynamics of transmission for many infectious respiratory diseases. Efforts to control such infections typically focus on the practice of strict contact-avoidance measures. Yet, contact rates and their relation to transmission, and the impact of control measures, are seldom quantified. Here, we quantify the response of contact rates, transmission and new cases of COVID-19 to public health contact-restriction orders, and the associations among these three variables, in the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC) and within its two most densely populated regional health authorities: Fraser Health Authority (FHA) and Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (VCHA). MethodsWe obtained time series for self-reported close-contact rates from the BC Mix COVID-19 Survey, new reported cases of COVID-19 from the BC Center for Disease Control, and transmission rates based on dynamic model fits to reported cases. Our study period was from September 13, 2020 to February 19, 2021, during which three public health contact-restriction orders were introduced (October 26, November 7 and November 19, 2020). We used segmented linear regression to quantify impacts of public health orders, Pearson correlation to assess the instantaneous relation between contact rates and transmission, and vector autoregressive modeling to study the lagged relations among the three variables. ResultsOverall, declines in contact rates and transmission occurred concurrently with the announcement of public health orders, whereas declines in new cases showed a reporting delay of roughly two weeks. The impact of the first public health order (October 26, 2020) on contact rates and transmission was more pronounced than that of the other two health orders. Contact rates and transmission on the same day were strongly correlated (correlation coefficients = 0.64, 0.53 and 0.34 for BC, FHA, and VCHA, respectively). Moreover, contact rates were a significant time-series driver of COVID-19 and explained roughly 30% and 18% of the variation in new cases and transmission, respectively. Interestingly, increases in transmission and new cases were followed by reduced rates of contact: overall, average daily cases explained about 10% of the variation in provincial contact rates. ConclusionWe show that close-contact rates were a significant driver of transmission of COVID-19 in British Columbia, Canada and that they varied in response to public health orders. Our results also suggest a possible feedback, by which contact rates respond to recent changes in reported cases. Our findings help to explain and validate the commonly assumed, but rarely measured, response of close contact rates to public health guidelines and their impact on the dynamics of infectious diseases.","Ringa, Notice; Otterstatter, Michael C; Iyaniwura, Sarafa A; Irvine, Mike A; Adu, Prince; Janjua, Naveed Z; David, Samara; Spencer, Michelle",,,219
227184,The Impact of COVID-19 on the Delivery of Critical Health Care: Experience From a Non-High-Income Country,2020,"Recent outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led a global pandemic cross the world. Most countries took two main interventions: suppression like immediate lockdown cities at epicenter or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both strategies have their apparent merits and limitations; it becomes extremely hard to conduct one intervention as the most feasible way to all countries. Targeting at this problem, this paper conducted a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR, it extended traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model by adding two key features: a direct connection between Exposed and Recovered populations, and separating infections into mild and critical cases. It defined parameters to classify two stages of COVID-19 control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan and London during January 2020 and March 2020. The simulated results showed that 1) Immediate suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduced the total exposed and infectious populations, but it has to be consistently maintained at least 90 days (by the middle of April 2020). Without taking this intervention, we predict the number of infections would have been 73 folders higher by the middle of April 2020. Its success requires efficient government initiatives and effective collaborative governance for mobilizing of corporate resources to provide essential goods. This mode may be not suitable to other countries without efficient collaborative governance and sufficient health resources. 2) In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period to balance the total infections and economic loss. While the total infectious populations in this scenario would be possibly 2 times than the one taking suppression, economic loss and recovery of London would be less affected. 3) Both in Wuhan and London cases, one important issue of fitting practical data was that there were a portion (probably 62.9% in Wuhan) of self-recovered populations that were asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. This finding has been recently confirmed by other studies that the seroprevalence in Wuhan varied between 3.2% and 3.8% in different sub-regions. It highlights that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of herd immunity. Early release of intervention intensity potentially increased a risk of the second outbreak.","Yang, Po; Qi, Jun; Zhang, Shuhao; Wang, Xulong; Bi, Gaoshan; Yang, Yun; Sheng, Bin; Yang, Geng",PLoS One,,219

The novel coronavirus disease abbreviated as COVID-19 is the ongoing health crisis which entered into human life in late December 2019. The ease of transmission between humans and the undetectability in early stage makes COVID-19 frightening and unprecedented. The disease is characterised by pneumonia progressing to breathing difficulty, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. Clinical studies suggest excessive release of inflammatory mediators leads to cytokine storm, a phenomenon which appears to be potentially life-threatening in COVID-19. Across the globe, when the world authorities are grappling to contain the virus, our review provides a glimpse on structure, pathophysiology of the virus and further sheds light on various clinical complications associated with the disease in order to open up/raise new horizons to explore various possible theoretical targets for COVID-19.

232821,"Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on children's physical activity levels in NSW, Australia",2020,"BACKGROUND: The availability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serologic testing has rapidly increased. Current assays use a variety of technologies, measure different classes of immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin combinations and detect antibodies directed against different portions of the virus. The overall accuracy of these tests, however, has not been well-defined. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology literature and construct best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing. This guideline is the fourth in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 guidelines developed by IDSA. OBJECTIVE: IDSA's goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests in a variety of settings. We also highlight important unmet research needs pertaining to the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for diagnosis, public health surveillance, vaccine development and the selection of convalescent plasma donors. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on eight diagnostic recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Information on the clinical performance and utility of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests are rapidly emerging. Based on available evidence, detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may be useful for confirming the presence of current or past infection in selected situations. The panel identified three potential indications for serologic testing including: 1) evaluation of patients with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 when molecular diagnostic testing is negative and at least two weeks have passed since symptom onset; 2) assessment of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children; and 3) for conducting serosurveillance studies. The certainty of available evidence supporting the use of serology for either diagnosis or epidemiology was, however, graded as very low to moderate.","Hanson, Kimberly E; Caliendo, Angela M; Arias, Cesar A; Englund, Janet A; Hayden, Mary K; Lee, Mark J; Loeb, Mark; Patel, Robin; Altayar, Osama; El Alayli, Abdallah; Sultan, Shahnaz; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Lavergne, Valéry; Morgan, Rebecca L; Murad, M Hassan; Bhimraj, Adarsh; Mustafa, Reem A",Clin. infect. dis,,219

the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) among a nationally representative sample of Canadians Intentions to follow government recommendations, physical distancing, and fear control responses (i e , negative and defensive reactions) were predicted using EPPM (perceived threat and efficacy) and demographic variables (age, gender, and education) Data were collected using a cross-sectional online survey through a third-party market research company The sample was composed of 1,055 adults (M age = 48 82, SD = 16 66;51 2% female) One multiple regression per dependent variable (i e , intentions to follow government recommendation, physical distancing, and fear control responses) was conducted Certain two-way and three-way interactions were also included in the models Older adults, females, and more educated individuals generally had higher intentions, engaged in more physical distancing, and had lower scores for fear control responses Also, consistent with the EPPM, the overall pattern suggested that people with high scores for both perceived threat and efficacy had the most positive profile (high intentions and physical distancing and low fear control) Perceived efficacy was a particularly strong predictor in analyses We recommend that public health interventions target males, younger people, and those who are less educated Furthermore, it is recommended that interventions increase both perceived threat and efficacy (especially efficacy) Although the design was cross-sectional, it was necessary to expedite the study in a time when it is sorely needed Future research

236361,Influence of Social Media Platforms on Public Health Protection Against the COVID-19 Pandemic via the Mediating Effects of Public Health Awareness and Behavioral Changes: Integrated Model,2020,"PURPOSE: In this study, the authors applied evidence-based medicine to decrease the utilization of routine chest radiography in adult intensive care units and used time-driven activity-based costing to demonstrate cost savings. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team was formed with representatives from radiology, surgery, internal medicine, and nursing. The process of performing a portable chest radiographic examination was mapped, and time trials were performed by the radiology technologists and radiology resident. This information was used to determine the cost of performing portable intensive care unit (ICU) chest radiographic studies. The clinical team changed resident education, ordering protocols, and workflows to discontinue the use of routine daily chest radiography, emphasizing that it should be ordered only in specific situations, such as on admission or after central line placement. In addition, as a balancing measure, the team tracked complications such as unplanned extubations and ventilator days. RESULTS: Changing ordering practices in the adult ICUs to align with established evidence-based guidelines resulted in a 37% decrease in the utilization of portable chest radiography between June and December, without a concomitant increase in unplanned extubations or ventilator days. In addition, a proportionate cost savings was realized, as demonstrated by the application of time-driven activity-based costing. CONCLUSIONS: This performance improvement initiative successfully increased the value of care delivered to ICU patients by aligning institutional clinical practice with evidence-based medicine. This resulted in decreased utilization and the cost associated with delivering care without a concomitant increase in complications.","Scott, Jinel; Waite, Stephen; Napolitano, Alexandra",J. Am.

While it is clear that inflammation plays a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of hypertension, several novel discoveries have been made within the past decade that have advanced the field and have provided new mechanistic insights. First, recent studies have identified a central role of sodium-induced immune cell activation in the pathogenesis of hypertension by altering the gut microbiome and formation of products of lipid oxidation known as isolevuglandins. Second, cytokine elaboration by the inflammasome leading to end-organ dysfunction and immune activation has been found to play a role in the genesis of hypertension. Third, novel techniques have identified previously uncharacterized immune cell populations that may play a functional role in these processes. Finally, the role of inflammation in hypertension may be an important mediator of severe COVID-19 infections. In this review, we discuss these recent advances in the study of inflammation and hypertension and highlight topics for future studies.","Patrick, David M; Van Beusecum, Justin P; Kirabo, Annet",,,219

Objective: To determine whether discontinuation compared with continuation of ACEIs or ARBs changed the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial of 659 patients hospitalized in Brazil with mild to moderate COVID-19 who were taking ACEIs or ARBs prior to hospitalization (enrolled: April 9-June 26, 2020; final follow-up: July 26, 2020). Interventions: Discontinuation (n = 334) or continuation (n = 325) of ACEIs or ARBs. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Secondary outcomes included death, cardiovascular death, and COVID-19 progression. Results: Among 659 patients, the median age was 55.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46.1-65.0 years), 14.7% were aged 70 years or older, 40.4% were women, and 100% completed the trial. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 6 days (IQR, 4-9 days) and 27.2% of patients had an oxygen saturation of less than 94% of room air at baseline. In terms of clinical severity, 57.1% of patients were considered mild at hospital admission and 42.9% were considered moderate. There was no significant difference in the number of days alive and out of the hospital in patients in the discontinuation group (mean, 21.9 days [SD, 8 days]) vs patients in the continuation group (mean, 22.9 days [SD, 7.1 days]) and the mean ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1.01). There also was no statistically significant difference in death (2.7% for the discontinuation group vs 2.8% for the continuation group; odds ratio [OR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.38-2.52]), cardiovascular death (0.6% vs 0.3%, respectively; OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 0.19-42.12]), or COVID-19 progression (38.3% vs 32.3%; OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.95-1.80]). The most common adverse events were respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (9.6% in the discontinuation group vs 7.7% in the continuation group), shock requiring vasopressors (8.4% vs 7.1%, respectively), acute myocardial infarction (7.5% vs 4.6%), new or worsening heart failure (4.2% vs 4.9%), and acute kidney failure requiring hemodialysis (3.3% vs 2.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 and who were taking ACEIs or ARBs before hospital admission, there was no significant difference in the mean number of days alive and out of the hospital for those assigned to discontinue vs continue these medications. These findings do not support routinely discontinuing ACEIs or ARBs among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 if there is an indication for treatment.

243154,Warning that a fifth of adults might need mental health support post pandemic,2020,"Through annual epidemics and global pandemics, influenza A viruses (IAVs) remain a significant threat to human health as the leading cause of severe respiratory disease. Within the last century, four global pandemics have resulted from the introduction of novel IAVs into humans, with components of each originating from avian viruses. IAVs infect many avian species wherein they maintain a diverse natural reservoir, posing a risk to humans through the occasional emergence of novel strains with enhanced zoonotic potential. One natural barrier for transmission of avian IAVs into humans is the specificity of the receptor-binding protein, hemagglutinin (HA), that recognizes sialic acid-containing glycans on host cells. HAs from human IAVs exhibit ""human-type"" receptor specificity, binding exclusively to glycans on cells lining the human airway where terminal sialic acids are attached in the &#945;2-6 configuration (NeuAc&#945;2-6Gal). In contrast, HAs from avian viruses exhibit specificity for ""avian-type"" &#945;2-3-linked (NeuAc&#945;2-3Gal) receptors, and thus require adaptive mutations to bind human-type receptors. Since all human IAV pandemics can be traced to avian origins, there remains ever-present concern over emerging IAVs with human-adaptive potential that might lead to the next pandemic. This concern has been brought into focus through emergence of SARS-CoV-2, aligning both scientific and public attention to the threat of novel respiratory viruses from animal sources. In this review we summarize receptor-binding adaptations underlying the emergence of all prior IAV pandemics in humans, maintenance and evolution of human-type receptor specificity in subsequent seasonal IAVs, and potential for future human-type receptor adaptation in novel avian HAs.","Thompson, Andrew J; Paulson, James C",J. biol. chem,,219

States' difficulties to provide adequate and comprehensive response to people's health needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic strengthened the impetus for UHC implementation. But while featured as the way to achieve justice in health, analyses of UHC-kind reform experiences since the 1990s show that it may be comprehended rather as a new facet of neoliberalism in the health policies' arena. Its insurance arrangements are aimed to finance packages of health goods and services for the poor, while states play mainly a role of public funds administrators, buying from public and private providers competing in the market. UHC contributes to health system fragmentation and segmentation, weakens public structures and opens new markets for corporations to capture public funds. COVID-19 pandemic subjected health systems to unforeseen stress, underscoring the crucial role that a well-funded public health system plays in people's lives. Assessing pandemic's challenges may be an opportunity to build more egalitarian health systems, based on dignity and not people's money. However, the unreflecting adoption of technocratic health paradigms and solutions may, instead, ultimately pave the way for further health financialisation and injustice.","López Cabello, Andrés",Glob Public Health,,219

The current situation of prevention and control is severe and urges guidance for clinicians, especially for medical systems. In the hope of providing a reference and recommendation for the prevention and control of the COVID-19, we carried out research to improve the quality of patient care and prevention during this epidemic. METHODS: All of the staff were trained rapidly to master personal protection in our department. We reviewed the patients' discharged records who underwent surgery in our department during January 1 to March 1, 2019, and January 1 to March 1, 2020. The management of the surgery patients and flow charts were described and analyzed. Post-operation outcomes of the patients include duration, complications, surgical site infection (SSI), system infection, re-operation, and mortality. Both chi-squared test and Student's t test were performed to determine the relationship between the two periods in terms of post-operation outcomes. RESULTS: Descriptive statistics analysis revealed that demographic of the patients between the two periods is similar. We had benefited from the strict flowcharts, smart robot, and protection equipment during the perioperative managements for orthopedic patients. With the help of the strict flow charts and smart equipment, post-operation outcomes of the patients revealed that the rates of the complications and re-operation had been reduced significantly (p < 0.05), while duration of operation, SSI, and system infection had no significant difference between two periods (p > 0.05). No patient and staff caught COVID-19 infection or mortality during the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that medical quality and efficiency were affected little with the help of strategies described above during the epidemic, which could be a reference tool for medical staff in routine clinical practice for admission of patients around the world. What is more, the provided strategies, which may evolve over time, could be used as empirical guidance and reference for orthopedic peers to get through the pandemic and ensure the normal operation of the hospital.","Zeng, Hui; Li, Guoqing; Weng, Jian; Xiong, Ao; Xu, Chang; Yang, Yifei; Wang, Deli",J Orthop Surg Res,,219
247753,"Organizational commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion: A strategic path forward",2021,"OBJECTIVES: This article seeks to demonstrate the impact of distributing boxes of art resources and guided activities for vulnerable parents and infants to do together at home. STUDY DESIGN: Designed in conjunction with the local arts centre and the psychology team at the University of Dundee, the art boxes were a response to planned face-to-face art interventions with families being cancelled due to COVID-19 restrictions. The aim of the art boxes is to encourage parents to make art together with their infants, fostering connection through playful, creative shared experiences. This research is currently being expanded to reach out to new families through referrals from health visitors, family nurses, and charity partners. METHODS: Data is being collected on how the art boxes are experienced by families using a mixed-methods approach. Families complete feedback cards (online, or using the stamped addressed card included in the box) rating their experience on quantitative scales and providing open comments. Visual data are gathered through parents sharing images with us on social media. An initial sample of 10 participants has been interviewed using semistructured interviews, allowing more in-depth qualitative understanding of their experiences. These preliminary findings are discussed here. RESULTS: The thematic analysis of initial interviews provided a rich picture of the disconnection families experienced during lockdown, why art boxes may be beneficial to parental well-being, and the mechanisms by which the boxes may help to develop connections for the parent and infant together. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings show parents reporting feeling more confident and undertaking new activities which they plan to continue. This was of particular importance during lockdown where parents report opportunities for different experiences being more limited. Parent's describe positive playful interactions and reported improvements to their own well-being from doing creative activities together with their child. Analysis of these initial interviews gives a framework of barriers and supports to connection which highlights how art boxes can facilitate connectedness between dyads with the potential to strengthen attachments.","Armstrong, V G; Ross, J",Public Health,,219

Treatment with proline significantly reduced voluntary food intake at 2h and 3h after oral administration, while glutamic acid showed a less pronounced satiating effect at 3h. The mRNA expression of taste receptor subunits tas1r1, tas1r2a, tas1r2b, and tas1r3 was measured in the epithelium overlying the bony basyhyal of the fish (analogous to the tetrapod tongue) at 10, 20 or 30 min following treatment. No significant changes were observed, except for a tas1r down-regulation by valine at 30 mins. Of the downstream taste signalling genes that were analysed in parallel, plcb2 and possibly trpm5 (non-significant trend) were down-regulated 20 min after proline and glutamic acid treatment. The signal originated in the oropharyngeal and/or gastric cavity presumably relays to the brain since changes in genes involved in the regulation of food intake occurred in hypothalamus 10-30 min after oral treatment with amino acids. In particular, proline induced changes consistent with an increased anorexigenic potential in the hypothalamus. We have therefore demonstrated, for the first time in fish, that the peripheral (pre-absorptive) detection of an amino acid (L-proline), presumably by taste-related mechanisms, elicits a satiety signal that in hypothalamus is translated into changes in cellular signalling and neuropeptides regulating food intake, ultimately resulting in decreased food intake.","Comesaña, Sara; Conde-Sieira, Marta; Velasco, Cristina; Soengas, José L; Morais, Sofia",J. exp. biol,,219

252931,Re:(In) visible impact of inadequate WaSH Provision on COVID-19 incidences can be not be ignored in large and megacities of India,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of 25 May 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused 347,192 deaths around the world. The current evidence showed that severely ill patients tend to have a high concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, compared to those who are moderately ill. The high level of cytokines also indicates a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Besides, excessive infiltration of pro-inflammatory cells, mainly involving macrophages and T-helper 17 cells, has been found in lung tissues of patients with COVID-19 by postmortem examination. Recently, increasing studies indicate that the ""cytokine storm"" may contribute to the mortality of COVID-19. Here, we summarize the clinical and pathologic features of the cytokine storm in COVID-19. Our review shows that SARS-Cov-2 selectively induces a high level of IL-6 and results in the exhaustion of lymphocytes. The current evidence indicates that tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, is relatively effective and safe. Besides, corticosteroids, programmed cell death protein (PD)-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition, cytokine-adsorption devices, intravenous immunoglobulin, and antimalarial agents could be potentially useful and reliable approaches to counteract cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.","Tang, Yujun; Liu, Jiajia; Zhang, Dingyi; Xu, Zhenghao; Ji, Jinjun; Wen, Chengping",Front Immunol,,219

The fast-track development of covid-19 vaccine brought some hope among health practitioners globally. The major challenge seems to be safety, efficacy, and acceptance of the vaccine. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among the community of the state of Odisha, India, to find out the concerns of safety and acceptance for the vaccine.Methods: A self-administered multiple-choice questionnaire containing 23 items with three sections was prepared in Google form and deployed following snow ball sampling method. The participants recruited were above 18 years of age residing in Odisha. The participation in the survey was completely voluntary. The survey was conducted during February 2021.Results and discussion: In total, 359 members participated in the survey. Majority of the respondent strongly agree/agree that covid-19 vaccine is safe for adults and children. Significant variation among all the groups was found regarding acquisition of higher immunity following infection rather by vaccination, effectiveness in infection prevention, safety in children, provision of mandatory vaccination by government, and public health protection following government guidelines.Conclusion: The major barrier to the covid-19 vaccination was found to be safety and awareness. But there is well acceptance to covid-19 vaccine among the community of Odisha, India, and further efforts to create awareness concerning safety and vaccination will be instrumental in the eradication of this infection.","Panda, Dibya Sundar; Giri, Ranjan Kumar; Nagarajappa, Anil Kumar; Basha, Sakeenabi",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,219

254125,Availability of Illegal Drugs During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Western Germany,2021,"Previously human society has faced various unprecedented pandemics in the history and viruses have majorly held the responsibilities of those outbreaks. Furthermore, due to amplified global connection and speedy modernization, epidemic outbreaks caused by novel and re­emergingviruses signify potential risk to community health. Despite, great advancements in immunization and drug discovery processes, still various viruses lack prophylactic vaccines and efficient antiviral therapies. Although, vaccine is prophylaxes option, but it can be not applied to infected patients, hence therapeutic interventions are urgently needed to control the ongoing global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic condition. To spot the novel antiviral therapy is of decisive importance and Mother Nature is an excellent source for such discoveries. In this article, we have implemented prompt high through-put virtual screening for vetting the best possible drug candidates from natural compounds' databases. Herein, we have implemented time tested rigorous multi-layered drug screening process to narrow down 66,969 natural compounds for the identification of potential lead(s). Druggability parameters, different docking approaches and neutralization tendency of the natural products were employed in this study to screen the best possible natural compounds from the digital libraries. The results of this study conclude that compounds PALA and HMCA are potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and can be further explored for experimental validation. Overall, the methodological approach reported in this article can be suitably used to find the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 in the burning situation of COVID-19 with less expenditure and a very short span of time.","Dhasmana, Anupam; Kashyap, Vivek Kumar; Dhasmana, Swati; Kotnala, Sudhir; Haque, Shafiul; Ashraf, Ghulam Md; Jaggi, Meena; Yallapu, Murali M; Chauhan, Subhash C",Curr. pharm. des,,219

261830,Cannabis and COVID-19: Reasons for Concern,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a widespread effect on the thoughts, emotions and behavior of millions of people all around the world. In this context, a large body of scientific literature examining the mental health impact of this global crisis has emerged. The majority of these studies have framed this impact in terms of pre-defined categories derived from psychiatric nosology, such as anxiety disorders, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. These constructs often fail to capture the complexity of the actual experiences of the individuals being studied;more specifically, they describe these experiences exclusively in terms of disease, while neglecting their potentially adaptive or ""salutogenic"" aspects. Similarly, discussion of psychological assistance for these individuals has largely been confined to a reiteration of ""evidence-based"" psychological or pharmacological techniques which can be delivered using remote access technology. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these approaches are likely to be of mixed efficacy. Conversely, ""negative emotions"" or distressing psychological experiences may actually be functional in the setting of a disaster or crisis, serving to minimize harm, maximize social coherence and compliance, and facilitate adherence to safety measures. The limitations of the ""conventional"" approach are, to a certain degree, inherent to the prevailing medical model of mental health. Beyond these considerations lies the concept of ""salutogenesis,"" a term which refers to the innate capacity of individuals to create and maintain health and well-being in the face of adversity. Using principles derived from the second wave of positive psychology (PP2.0), particularly its emphasis on the totality of human experience and the possibility of deriving meaning and character growth from suffering, this paper conceptually analyses the relevant aspects of salutogenesis and PP2.0, and proposes an alternate approach for addressing mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an approach, while acknowledging the utility of the conventional medical-psychotherapeutic model in specific cases, reduces the risk of medicalizing human experience, and provides individuals and communities with opportunities for growth and adaptation. The benefits of this proposal could potentially extend far beyond the current crisis, offering an opportunity for the field of psychiatry and mental health research to move away from a purely ""disease-centered"" model.","Rajkumar, R.

However, the location of this colony in an area without adequate sewage treatment, which receives domestic effluents, may indicate a modified bacterial profile. Further studies are needed, to better understand the host's natural microbiome, as well as on the bacterial isolates, in order to characterize any association with the contaminated water.

The traditional overuse of antibiotics in the animal feed industry plays a crucial role in the emergence of these pathogens that pose both economic and health problems. In addition, antibiotics have also recently experienced an increase to treat companion animal infections, promoting the emergence of MDR bacteria in pets, which can reach humans. Phages have been proposed as an alternative for antibiotics for the treatment of livestock and companion animal infections due to their multiple advantages as adaptative drugs, such as their ability to evolve, to multiply at the site of infections, and their high specificity. Moreover, phage-derived enzymes may also be an interesting approach. However, the lack of regulation for this type of pharmaceutical hinders its potential commercialization. In this review, we summarize the main recent studies on phage therapy in livestock and companion animals, providing an insight into current advances in this area and the future of treatments for bacterial infections.","Ferriol-González, Celia Domingo-Calap Pilar",Antibiotics,,219

A Position Paper,2021,"Background: The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis relies on quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-qPCR) from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, but NPSs present several limitations. The simplicity, low invasive and possibility of self-collection of saliva imposed these specimens as a relevant alternative for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, the discrepancy of saliva test results compared to NPSs made of its use controversial. Here, we assessed Salivettes®, as a standardized saliva collection device, and compared SARS-CoV-2 positivity on paired NPS and saliva specimens. Methods: A total of 303 individuals randomly selected among those investigated for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled, including 30 (9.9%) patients previously positively tested using NPS (follow-up group), 90 (29.7%) mildly symptomatic and 183 (60.4%) asymptomatic. Results: The RT-qPCR revealed a positive rate of 11.6% (n = 35) and 17.2% (n = 52) for NPSs and saliva samples, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of saliva samples were 82.9% and 91.4%, respectively, using NPS as reference. The highest proportion of discordant results concerned the follow-up group (33.3%). Although the agreement exceeded 90.0% in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, 17 individuals were detected positive only in saliva samples, with consistent medical arguments. Conclusion Saliva collected with Salivette® was more sensitive for detecting symptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections.","Melo Costa, M.; Benoit, N.; Dormoi, J.; Amalvict, R.; Gomez, N.; Tissot-Dupont, H.; Million, M.; Pradines, B.; Granjeaud, S.; Almeras, L.",Journal of Oral Microbiology,,219
277065,Effect of COVID-19 on maternal and neonatal services,2020,"As the novel SARS-CoV-2 continues to infect numerous individuals worldwide, one of the leading approaches in dealing with the global health crisis is vaccination against the COVID-19. Due to recent reports, vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca) may result in a vaccine-induced catastrophic thrombotic thrombocytopenia disorder. Thus, as of March 16 of 2021, vaccination programs in 18 countries had been suspended until further examination, including Sweden, Germany and France. This disorder presents as extensive thrombosis in atypical sites, primarily in the cerebral venous, alongside thrombocytopenia and the production of autoantibody against platelet-factor 4 (PF4). PF4 autoantibody has the ability to binds the human FcRÎ³IIA receptor of platelets and contribute to their aggregation. This rare adverse effect extremely resembles the clinical presentation of the classical immune-mediated HIT disorder, which occurs following exposure to heparin. Surprisingly, none of these patients had been pre-exposed to heparin before disease onset, leading to the hypothesis that a viral antigen from the vaccine had triggered the response. Importantly, COVID-19 had been associated with numerous autoimmune manifestations, including the production of pathogenic autoantibodies, new onset of autoimmune diseases and disorders. As the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination leads to the synthesis of specific SARS-CoV-2-proteins, they may trigger a production of PF4 autoantibody though molecular mimicry phenomena, while vaccination compounds lead to a rigorous bystander activation of immune cells. If existing, removing such homological sequences from the vaccine may eliminate this phenomenon. In contrast, it needs to be emphasized that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was found to be safe and efficacious against symptomatic COVID-19 in randomized controlled trials, which included 23,848 participants from the UK, Brazil and South Africa.","Dotan, Arad; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",J Autoimmun,,219

278013,Mental Health of Children Amid COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh: An Exploratory Observation,2021,"Ecological sensing and inflammation have evolved to ensure optima between organism survival and reproductive success in different and changing environments. At the molecular level, ecological sensing consists of many types of receptors located in different tissues that orchestrate integrated responses (immune, neuroendocrine systems) to external and internal stimuli. This review describes emerging data on taste and chemosensory receptors, proposing them as broad ecological sensors and providing evidence that taste perception is shaped not only according to sense epitopes from nutrients but also in response to highly diverse external and internal stimuli. We apply a biological anthropological approach to examine how ecological sensing has been shaped by these stimuli through human evolution for complex interkingdom communication between a host and pathological and symbiotic bacteria, focusing on population-specific genetic diversity. We then focus on how these sensory receptors play a major role in inflammatory processes that form the basis of many modern common metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and aging. The impacts of human niche construction and cultural evolution in shaping environments are described with emphasis on consequent biological responsiveness.","Giuliani, Cristina; Franceschi, Claudio; Luiselli, Donata; Garagnani, Paolo; Ulijaszek, Stanley","Adv. nutr.

281078,Internet and Pornography Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Presumed Impact and What Can Be Done,2021,"BACKGROUND: To understand which irregular corneal parameters determine the visual quality in keratoconus subjects. METHODS: The cross-sectional study examined the eyes of 44 subjects, graded from the first to third keratoconus stages by Amsler-Krumeich classification. We obtained measurements in two ways: (a) by projecting two perpendicular axes onto a cornea (first, through the central point of the cornea and keratoconus apex; second, as the perpendicular axis) to read the elevation values at points on these axes as parameters characterising the corneal surface; (b) by projecting circles with different diameters around the central part of the cornea (1, 2, and 3 mm) and reading elevation values at points equally displaced on these circles as parameters characterising an anterior surface slope. Irregular corneal shape parameters' correlations with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were determined in order to understand which corneal slope parameter has the strongest correlation with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. RESULTS: Parameters characterising the corneal surface's correlations with contrast sensitivity were from r = 0.25 (p = 0.03) at 3 cpd to r = 0.47 (p < 0.01) at 9 cpd for the highest elevation and from r = 0.33 (p = 0.09) at 5 cpd to r = 0.40 (p < 0.01) at 11 cpd for the lowest elevation in all subjects together, while for visual acuity the parameters were r = 0.30 (p < 0.01) for the highest elevation and r = 0.21 (p = 0.06) for the lowest elevation in all subjects together. The correlation between contrast sensitivity and the highest and lowest corneal point in all measured cornea was stronger for subjects with a peripheral corneal apex than for those with a central apex. In keratoconus subjects, contrast sensitivity displayed a strong correlation with slope in the central part of the cornea (with a radius of 1 mm) ranging from 0.48 (p < 0.01) at 3 cpd to 0.61 (p < 0.01) at 9 cpd. CONCLUSION: Contrast sensitivity has a higher correlation with corneal shape parameters than with visual acuity. Subjects with a peripheral corneal apex had stronger correlations with visual acuity and contrast sensitivity than did subjects with a central apex. In keratoconus subjects, the strongest correlation was for contrast sensitivity and elevation (slope) in the region within a 1 mm radius of the corneal centre in the opposite direction of the keratoconus apex (direction (ax) CB).","Liduma, Sanita; Luguzis, Artis; Krumina, Gunta",BMC Ophthalmol,,219
282514,Optimizing student pharmacists' contributions to patient care during a pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: In 2009, the Institute of Medicine published guidelines for implementation of Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) at the state level in the United States (US). Based in part on the then concern for H1N1 pandemic, there was a recognized need for additional planning at the state level to maintain health system preparedness and conventional care standards when available resources become scarce. Despite the availability of this framework, in the years since and despite repeated large-scale domestic events, implementation remains mixed. PROBLEM: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rejuvenates concern for how health systems can maintain quality care when faced with unrelenting burden. This study seeks to outline which states in the US have developed CSC and which areas of care have thus far been addressed. METHODS: An online search was conducted for all 50 states in 2015 and again in 2020. For states without CSC plans online, state officials were contacted by email and phone. Public protocols were reviewed to assess for operational implementation capabilities, specifically highlighting guidance on ventilator use, burn management, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, pediatric standards, and reliance on influenza planning. RESULTS: Thirty-six states in the US were actively developing (17) or had already developed (19) official CSC guidance. Fourteen states had no publicly acknowledged effort. Eleven of the 17 public plans had updated within five years, with a majority addressing ventilator usage (16/17), influenza planning (14/17), and pediatric care (15/17), but substantially fewer addressing care for burn patients (9/17). CONCLUSION: Many states lacked publicly available guidance on maintaining standards of care during disasters, and many states with specific care guidelines had not sufficiently addressed the full spectrum of hazard to which their health care systems remain vulnerable.","Margus, Colton; Sarin, Ritu R; Molloy, Michael; Ciottone, Gregory R",Prehosp Disaster Med,,219

283507,War in the time of COVID-19: humanitarian catastrophe in Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia,2021,"Background & objectives: Screening for hepatitis B prior to the initiation of chemotherapy in patients with cancer is recommended by all major hepatology and oncology societies. This study was aimed to determine the screening practices for hepatitis B among oncologists from India and their experience with hepatitis B reactivation. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among oncologists attending the Evidence-Based Medicine Conference at Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India. The questionnaire was developed in keeping with the recent guidelines for hepatitis B reactivation on chemotherapy, with questions regarding demographics, years in practice and hepatitis B screening practices and management. There was 78 per cent response rate to the questionnaire. Results: Most respondents were <35 yr of age (69%), with < five years of experience (39%), practicing in an academic institution (81%). Seventy four per cent respondents always screened their patients with cancer for hepatitis prior to chemotherapy, whereas 19 per cent in special settings and seven per cent never screened; 96 per cent respondents used hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as a screening test, while 17 per cent also used antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. Sixty one per cent respondents used entecavir or tenofovir for prophylaxis; 70 per cent continued prophylaxis till 6-12 months after completion of chemotherapy, while 21 per cent continued only till the end of chemotherapy. Interpretation & conclusions: More than 25 per cent of the oncologists were not screening their patients with cancer for viral hepatitis prior to cancer-directed therapy, and only 17 per cent of the oncologists used the recommended tests for screening. Better training of oncologists regarding viral hepatitis screening and management is needed.","Sundaram, Sridhar; Patil, Prachi; Sengar, Manju; Rathod, Raosaheb; Mehta, Shaesta",Indian J Med Res,,219

Neurological manifestations are being increasingly recognized, including febrile seizures, headache, dizziness, and myalgia, as well as encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, and acute peripheral nerve diseases. Cerebral vasculitis is rarely reported. We describe a case of SARS-CoV-2 interstitial pneumonia complicated by flaccid tetraplegia due to Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) associated with a cerebral vasculitis-like pattern. Case description: A 62-year-old man was hospitalized for cough, fever, and severe respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and invasive ventilation. The chest Computerized Tomography (CT) showed images related to interstitial pneumonia and the subsequent nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the hospitalization, there was a progressive deterioration of the senses associated with areflexic flaccid tetraplegia. The treatment with high doses of immunoglobulin G (IgG) led to the immediate improvement of the general conditions and a partial response in terms of recovery of the upper limb and of the distal lower limb movements.

288753,Effectiveness of digital interventions to improve household and community infection prevention and control behaviours and to reduce incidence of respiratory and/or gastro-intestinal infections: a rapid systematic review,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Terminal complement amplification is hypothesized to be a key contributor to the clinical manifestations of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Ravulizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to complement protein C5 and inhibits terminal complement activation, is being evaluated as a treatment for COVID-19-related severe pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in an ongoing phase 3 randomized controlled trial (ALXN1210-COV-305). To address the overactivation of terminal complement in severe COVID-19 compared to the diseases in which ravulizumab is currently approved, a modified dosing regimen was adopted. This analysis evaluates preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data to confirm the modified dosing regimen. METHODS: Weight-based ravulizumab doses were administered on days 1, 5, 10, and 15. Serum levels of ravulizumab and free C5 were measured before and after administration of ravulizumab and any time on day 22. Free C5 levels < 0.5 µg/mL indicate complete C5 inhibition. The pharmacokinetic target was defined as ravulizumab concentrations at the end of the dosing interval > 175 µg/mL, the concentration above which C5 is completely inhibited. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included in this evaluation. At baseline, mean C5 concentration was 240 ± 67 µg/mL. In all patients and at all individual timepoints after the first dose was administered, ravulizumab concentrations remained > 175 µg/mL and free C5 concentrations remained < 0.5 µg/mL. CONCLUSION: High levels of baseline C5 observed in patients with severe COVID-19 contribute to the growing body of evidence that suggests this disease is marked by amplification of terminal complement activation. Data from this preliminary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluation of 22 patients with severe COVID-19 show that the modified ravulizumab dosing regimen achieved immediate and complete terminal complement inhibition, which can be sustained for up to 22 days. These data support the continued use of this dosage regimen in the ongoing phase 3 study.

Traffic flow decreased by up to 80% during the lockdown and remained relatively low during the full relaxation (June and July). After the lockdown a significant shift from public transport to private vehicles (+21% in Barcelona) persisted due to the pervasive fear that using public transport might increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which need to be reverted as soon as possible. NO2 levels fell below 50% of the WHO annual air quality guidelines (WHOAQGs), but those of PM2.5 were reduced less than expected due to the lower contributions from traffic, increased contributions from agricultural and domestic biomass burning, or meteorological conditions favoring high secondary aerosol formation yields. Even during the lockdown, the annual PM2.5 WHOAQG was exceeded in cities within the NE and E regions with high NH3 emissions from farming and agriculture. Decreases in PM10 levels were greater than in PM2.5 due to reduced emissions from road dust, vehicle wear, and construction/demolition. Averaged O3 daily maximum 8-h (8hDM) experienced a generalized decrease in the rural receptor sites in the relaxation (June-July) with -20% reduced mobility. For urban areas O3 8hDM responses were heterogeneous, with increases or decreases depending on the period and location. Thus, after canceling out the effect of meteorology, 5 out of 11 cities experienced O3 decreases during the lockdown, while the remaining 6 either did not experience relevant reductions or increased. During the relaxation period and coinciding with the growing O3 season (June-July), most cities experienced decreases. However, the O3 WHOAQG was still exceeded during the lockdown and full relaxation periods in several cities. For secondary pollutants, such as O3 and PM2.5, further chemical and dispersion modeling along with source apportionment techniques to identify major precursor reduction targets are required to evaluate their abatement potential.","Querol, Xavier; Massagué, Jordi; Alastuey, Andrés; Moreno, Teresa; Gangoiti, Gotzon; Mantilla, Enrique; Duéguez, José Jaime; Escudero, Miguel; Monfort, Eliseo; Pérez García-Pando, Carlos; Petetin, Hervé; Jorba, Oriol; Vázquez, Víctor; de la Rosa, Jesús; Campos, Alberto; Muñóz, Marta; Monge, Silvia; Hervás, María; Javato, Rebeca; Cornide, María J",Sci Total Environ,,219

The aim of the present study is to test the feasibility and safety of a simple, reliable prescription of incremental HD in patients with incident DDKD and RKF. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This parallel-group, open-label randomised pilot trial will enrol 50 patients from 14 outpatient dialysis units. Participants will be randomised (1:1) to receive twice-weekly HD with adjuvant pharmacological therapy for 6 weeks followed by thrice-weekly HD (incremental HD group) or outright thrice-weekly HD (standard HD group). Age &#8805;18 years, chronic kidney disease progressing to DDKD and urine output &#8805;500 mL/day are key inclusion criteria; patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <30% and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis will be excluded. Adjuvant pharmacological therapy (ie, effective diuretic regimen, patiromer and sodium bicarbonate) will complement twice-weekly HD. The primary feasibility end points are recruitment rate, adherence to the assigned HD regimen, adherence to serial timed urine collections and treatment contamination. Incidence rate of clinically significant volume overload and metabolic imbalances in the first 3 months after randomisation will be used to assess intervention safety.

291991,From natural disaster to pandemic: A health-system pharmacy rises to the challenge,2020,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a life-threatening disease of pregnant women associated with severe hypertension, proteinuria, or multi-organ injuries. Mitochondrial-mediated placental oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PE. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be revealed. Here, we identify Rnd3, a small Rho GTPase, regulating placental mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). We showed that Rnd3 is down-regulated in primary trophoblasts isolated from PE patients. Loss of Rnd3 in trophoblasts resulted in excessive ROS generation, cell apoptosis, mitochondrial injury, and proton leakage from the respiratory chain. Moreover, Rnd3 overexpression partially rescues the mitochondrial defects and oxidative stress in human PE primary trophoblasts. Rnd3 physically interacts with the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³) and promotes the PPARÎ³-mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) cascade. Forced expression of PPARÎ³ rescues deficiency of Rnd3-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that Rnd3 acts as a novel protective factor in placental mitochondria through PPARÎ³-UCP2 signaling and highlight that downregulation of Rnd3 is a potential factor involved in PE pathogenesis.","Huang, Liping; Ma, Yanlin; Chen, Lu; Chang, Jiang; Zhong, Mei; Wang, Zhijian; Sun, Ying; Chen, Xia; Sun, Fei; Xiao, Lu; Chen, Jianing; Lai, Yingjun; Yan, Chuming; Yue, Xiaojing",FASEB J,,219

300314,"Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak Quarantine, Isolation, and Lockdown Policies on Mental Health and Suicide",2021,"Blood platelets are formed by fragmentation of long membrane extensions from bone marrow megakaryocytes in the blood flow. Using lattice-Boltzmann/immersed boundary simulations we propose a biological Rayleigh-Plateau instability as the biophysical mechanism behind this fragmentation process. This instability is akin to the surface tension-induced breakup of a liquid jet but is driven by active cortical processes including actomyosin contractility and microtubule sliding. Our fully three-dimensional simulations highlight the crucial role of actomyosin contractility, which is required to trigger the instability, and illustrate how the wavelength of the instability determines the size of the final platelets. The elasto-hydrodynamic origin of the fragmentation explains the strong acceleration of platelet biogenesis in the presence of an external flow, which we observe in agreement with experiments. Our simulations then allow us to disentangle the influence of specific flow conditions: While a homogeneous flow with uniform velocity leads to the strongest acceleration, a shear flow with a linear velocity gradient can cause fusion events of two developing platelet-sized swellings during fragmentation. A fusion event may lead to the release of larger structures which are observable as preplatelets in experiments. Together, our findings strongly indicate a mainly physical origin of fragmentation and regulation of platelet size in flow-accelerated platelet biogenesis.","Bächer, Christian; Bender, Markus; Gekle, Stephan",Proc.

300797,Organic contamination in online laser-based plant stem and leaf water isotope measurements for pre-extracted samples,2021,Superspreading phenomenon has been observed in many infectious diseases and contributes significantly to public health burden in many countries. Superspreading events have recently been reported in the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study uses a set of nine ordinary differential equations to investigate the impact of superspreading on COVID-19 dynamics. The model developed in this study addresses the heterogeineity in infectiousness by taking into account two forms of transmission rate functions for superspreaders based on clinical (infectivity level) and social or environmental (contact level). The basic reproduction number has been derived and the contribution of each infectious compartment towards the generation of new COVID-19 cases is ascertained. Data fitting was performed and parameter values were estimated within plausible ranges. Numerical simulations performed suggest that control measures that decrease the effective contact radius and increase the transmission rate exponent will be greatly beneficial in the control of COVID-19 in the presence of superspreading phenomena.,"Mushanyu, Josiah; Chukwu, Williams; Nyabadza, Farai; Muchatibaya, Gift",,,219

What is needed is a discussion that considers the subjective reality and resources as well as risks. OBJECTIVE: The study focused on the perspectives of older people. The aim was to shed light on their subjective experience of the corona pandemic. The questions were how they experienced the pandemic, the risks, consequences and protective measures, to what extent these affected their everyday life and how they dealt with it. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 12 guideline-based telephone interviews were conducted in May and June 2020 with 9 women and 3 men between 77 and 91 years of age, who lived in their own homes, had impaired health and needed help and care. The data were evaluated by structuring content analysis. RESULTS: The respondents were generally concerned about the corona pandemic but considered their own risk to be low. They saw themselves as hardly affected by the immediate consequences of the crisis or severely restricted in their everyday lives. They experienced insecurity in social life and fear of loneliness was central. Overall, they considered the protective measures to be appropriate but criticized early cancelling, family contact restrictions and dealing with the dying. CONCLUSION: A moderate degree of direct personal involvement, acceptance and adaptability characterized the experience and handling of the corona pandemic. Resources and skills in dealing with the crisis become visible.","Nikelski, Angela; Trompetter, Eva; Feldmann, Stefanie; Whittaker, Esther-Sarah; Boekholt, Melanie; Chikhradze, Nino; Kracht, Friederike; Lücker, Petra; Vollmar, Horst Christian; Thyrian, Jochen René; Kreisel, Stefan H",Z Gerontol Geriatr,,219

In a U.S. community sample (N = 236, 64% female;78% White;mean age = 30.3 years) assessed before COVID-19 and during the initial surge, we examined, prospectively, whether pandemic disruptions and a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) were associated with changes in depressive symptoms, stress, sleep, relationship satisfaction, and substance use over time and with concurrent anxiety and peritraumatic distress. Negative pandemic-related events were associated with significantly higher depressive symptoms and stress and lower satisfaction over time as well as higher concurrent anxiety and peritraumatic distress. ACEs were associated with more negative pandemic-related events, which, in turn, associated with higher peripandemic depressive symptoms, stress, anxiety, and peritraumatic distress. Findings underscore that COVID-19 disruptions are associated with greater distress and that childhood trauma is a key axis of differential risk.","Haydon, Katherine C.; Salvatore, Jessica E.",Clinical Psychological Science,,219

307912,Time to reimagine India's health system,2021,"Objectives: Triaging patients at admission to determine subsequent deterioration risk can be difficult. This is especially true of coronavirus disease 2019 patients, some of whom experience significant physiologic deterioration due to dysregulated immune response following admission. A well-established acuity measure, the Rothman Index, is evaluated for stratification of patients at admission into high or low risk of subsequent deterioration. Design: Multicenter retrospective study. Setting: One academic medical center in Connecticut, and three community hospitals in Connecticut and Maryland. Patients: Three thousand four hundred ninety-nine coronavirus disease 2019 and 14,658 noncoronavirus disease 2019 adult patients admitted to a medical service between January 1, 2020, and September 15, 2020. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Performance of the Rothman Index at admission to predict in-hospital mortality or ICU utilization for both general medical and coronavirus disease 2019 populations was evaluated using the area under the curve. Precision and recall for mortality prediction were calculated, high- and low-risk thresholds were determined, and patients meeting threshold criteria were characterized. The Rothman Index at admission has good to excellent discriminatory performance for in-hospital mortality in the coronavirus disease 2019 (area under the curve, 0.81-0.84) and noncoronavirus disease 2019 (area under the curve, 0.90-0.92) populations. We show that for a given admission acuity, the risk of deterioration for coronavirus disease 2019 patients is significantly higher than for noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients. At admission, Rothman Index-based thresholds segregate the majority of patients into either high- or low-risk groups;high-risk groups have mortality rates of 34-45% (coronavirus disease 2019) and 17-25% (noncoronavirus disease 2019), whereas low-risk groups have mortality rates of 2-5% (coronavirus disease 2019) and 0.2-0.4% (noncoronavirus disease 2019). Similarly large differences in ICU utilization are also found. Conclusions: Acuity level at admission may support rapid and effective risk triage. Notably, in-hospital mortality risk associated with a given acuity at admission is significantly higher for coronavirus disease 2019 patients than for noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients. This insight may help physicians more effectively triage coronavirus disease 2019 patients, guiding level of care decisions and resource allocation.","Beals, J. th Barnes J. J.; Durand, D.

Specifically, we provide an example of how HFE methodologies informed workflow redesigns implemented as part of COVID-19 pandemic preparations in an academic pediatric ambulatory clinic. We then identify key mechanisms and areas where HFE can contribute to and improve the effectiveness of a pandemic response: Just-in-time (JIT) training development, adapting workflows and processes, restructuring teams and tasks, developing effective mechanisms and tools for communication, engaging patient and families to follow the recommended practices (e.g., social distancing, revised hospital visitation policies), identifying and mitigating barriers to implementation of plans, and learning from failures and successes to improve both the current and future pandemic responses. We recommend integrating HFE approaches and tools across health care systems, state health organizations, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as they confront this pandemic.","Gurses, Ayse P; Tschudy, Megan M; McGrath-Morrow, Sharon; Husain, Amyna; Solomon, Barry S; Gerohristodoulos, Kylee A; Kim, Julia M",J.

Laboratory examinations were repeatedly measured during hospitalization for COVID-19 patients, which provide the possibility for the individualized early prediction of prognosis. However, previous studies mainly focused on risk prediction based on laboratory measurements at one time point, ignoring disease progression and changes of biomarkers over time. By using historical regression trees (HTREEs), a novel machine learning method, and joint modeling technique, we modeled the longitudinal trajectories of laboratory biomarkers and made dynamically predictions on individual prognosis for 1997 COVID-19 patients. In the discovery phase, based on 358 COVID-19 patients admitted between 10 January and 18 February 2020 from Tongji Hospital, HTREE model identified a set of important variables including 14 prognostic biomarkers. With the trajectories of those biomarkers through 5-day, 10-day and 15-day, the joint model had a good performance in discriminating the survived and deceased COVID-19 patients (mean AUCs of 88.81, 84.81 and 85.62% for the discovery set). The predictive model was successfully validated in two independent datasets (mean AUCs of 87.61, 87.55 and 87.03% for validation the first dataset including 112 patients, 94.97, 95.78 and 94.63% for the second validation dataset including 1527 patients, respectively).

Much attention has focused on how to resolve pressing issues surrounding resource allocation and competing public health ethics. While these are important discussions, the legal and ethical dilemmas of treatment decisions remain highly critical. The urgency to ensure that life and death affairs are in order is magnified due to the possibility of becoming infected with Covid-19. However, many people continue to face challenges in organising their future medical care and treatment. This article explores how the pandemic affects advance care planning through the lenses of law and ethics. The range of Covid-19 implications on advance care planning demonstrates a paradigm shift from a primarily elective function to an essential role in healthcare delivery. This renewed appreciation to advance care planning offers the opportunity to support and sustain the important role that it could play during ordinary and extraordinary times.","Chan, Hui Yun",Eur J Health Law,,219

This study was carried out to investigate the possible aggravating effect of smoking on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with pulmonary involvement. Materials and Methods: 114 adult patients who received inpatient treatment in our clinic with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia between 11 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 were retrospectively included in the study; in particular, they were evaluated in terms of smoking history, severity of disease, need for NIMV and ICU admission, and mortality during their hospitalization. Result: The mean age of the 114 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia was 51.14 ± 14.97 (range 16-81), and 77 (67.5%) were male. Of the patients, 19 (15.9%) were active smokers, 23 were ex-smokers (20.1%), 72 (63.1%) non-smokers. The effect of smoking on the severity of the disease, length of hospitalization, need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality were not statistically significant. Conclusions: The rate of active smoking in patients hospitalized with COVID- 19 is lower than the population average. In this study, no correlation was observed between smoking status and the severity, prognosis and mortality of the disease. Further studies with larger number of patients and case series are needed to better elucidate the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 and the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the effects of smoking on the natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ugur Chousein, Efsun Gonca; Çörtük, Mustafa; Cinarka, Halit; Tanriverdi, Elif; Turan, Demet; Yildirim, Binnaz Zeynep; Sezen, Celal Bugra; Özgül, Mehmet Akif",Tuberk Toraks,,219

320786,Comparative epidemiology between the 2009 H1N1 influenza and COVID-19 pandemics,2020,"Surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) are hybrid light-matter states in which light strongly couples to lattice vibrations inside the Reststrahlen band of polar dielectrics at mid-infrared frequencies. Antennas supporting localized surface phonon polaritons (LSPhPs) easily outperform their plasmonic counterparts operating in the visible or near-infrared in terms of field enhancement and confinement thanks to the inherently slower phonon-phonon scattering processes governing SPhPs decay. In particular, LSPhPs antennas have attracted considerable interest for thermal management at the nanoscale, where the emission strongly diverts from the usual far-field blackbody radiation due to the presence of evanescent waves at the surface. However, far-field measurements cannot shed light on the behavior of antennas in the near-field region. To overcome this limitation, we employ scattering-scanning near field optical microscopy (sSNOM) to unveil the spectral near-field response of 3C-SiC antenna arrays. We present a detailed description of the behavior of the antenna resonances by comparing far-field and near-field spectra, and demonstrate the existence of a mode with no net dipole moment, absent in the far-field spectra, but of importance for applications that exploit the heightened electromagnetic near fields. Furthermore, we investigate the perturbation in the antenna response induced by the presence of the AFM tip, which can be further extended towards situations where for example strong IR emitters couple to LSPhPs modes.","Mancini, Andrea; Gubbin, Christopher R; Berté, Rodrigo; Martini, Francesco; Politi, Alberto; Cortés, Emiliano; Li, Yi; De Liberato, Simone; Maier, Stefan A",ACS nano,,219

321889,Self-actualization towards positive well-being: combating despair during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have required medical educators to reimagine almost every aspect of undergraduate medical training, including curriculum delivery and assessments in a short timeline. In this personal view article, executive members of the University of Toronto medical student government and Faculty leads of pre-clerkship and clerkship education highlight five practical ways in which a student-Faculty partnership enabled the rapid and smooth adaptation of curricula during the COVID-19 pandemic. These included involving students as partners in decision making to contribute learner perspectives early, agile and collaborative meeting structures, frequent and consistent communication with the student body, providing learners with Faculty perspectives from the frontlines, and striking a balance in the level of feedback collected from students. These strategies may be of utility to medical administrators, educators, and student leaders in future crises affecting medical learners.","Mehta, Nishila; End, Christopher; Kwan, Jason C S; Bernstein, Stacey; Law, Marcus",Med Teach,,219

This review summarizes the current knowledge of the clinical patterns, cellular pathophysiology, and epidemiology of COVID-19 respiratory disease in children with specific attention toward factors that account for the maturation-related differences in disease severity. RECENT FINDINGS: Over the past 14 months, knowledge of the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of COVID-19 pneumonia has rapidly expanded. The decreased disease severity of COVID-19 pneumonia in children was an early observation. Differences in the efficiency of viral cell entry and timing of immune recognition and response between children and adults remain at the center of ongoing research. SUMMARY: The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 respiratory disease in children is well defined. The age-related differences protecting children from severe disease and death remain incompletely understood.","Steffes, Lea C; Cornfield, David N",Curr Opin Pediatr,,219

The present study aimed to explore the impact of the psychological symptoms on the occurrence of cognitive failures in a large sample of home-dwelling Italian individuals during quarantine/self-isolation for COVID-19. METHODS: We employed an online questionnaire using a virtual platform of Google Moduli. The questionnaire included an assessment of cognitive failures evaluated by the Perceived Memory and Attentional Failures Questionnaire (PerMAFaQ) and of resilience, coping style, depression, anger, and anxiety. RESULTS: The online questionnaire was completed by 4175 participants revealing that about 30% of participants complained of cognitive failures at least sometimes during quarantine/self-isolation, whereas some respondents reported very frequent cognitive failures. Moreover, resilience was found to mediate the relationships between depressive and anger symptoms and cognitive failures. Although no difference was found on PerMAFaQ among smart-workers, non-smart-workers, and those currently not at work, people not working at the moment complained of more frequent cognitive failures.

327687,Opinions on the current pandemic of COVID-19: Use functional food to boost our immune functions,2020,"Objective: Viral pneumonias cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The emergence of novel SARSCoV- 2 emphasizes the need for novel antiviral therapies. Dexamethasone (DXM) is one therapy that has recently been reported to confer benefit in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our lab has recently reported that CD8+ T cells were associated with fatal immunopathology causing mortality in a mouse model of severe Sendai paramyxovirus (SeV) pneumonia, and this fatal immunopathology could be prevented either by eliciting a robust, early antiviral response via inhalational treatment with Toll-like receptor agonists (Pam2-ODN) or by depletion of CD8+ T cells during late stage SeV pneumonia. Given the lympholytic effects of DXM, we tested our hypothesis that the reported survival advantage of DXM in severe viral pneumonia derives from CD8+ T cell- mediated immunopathology. Methods: Mice were intrapharyngeally infected with SeV with or without Pam2-ODN pretreatment, then observed for 14 days. Some mice were intraperitoneally injected with DXM (5mg/kg) every day starting day 0 or day 8 after infection. CD8+ T cells were assessed on day 10 after infection by flow cytometry of digested mouse lungs. Results: Treatment with DXM starting on day 8 enhanced mouse survival of SeV pneumonia, whereas mice treated with DXM from day -1 onward demonstrated increased susceptibility to SeV pneumonia. Mice treated with CD8+ T cell depleting antibody on day 8 displayed 100% survival. DXM treated mice displayed reduced CD8+ T cells in comparison to PBS treated SeV challenged mice, supporting our hypothesis. Consistent with our recent report, mice aerosolized with Pam2-ODN displayed 100% survival of SeV pneumonia with reduced CD8+ T cell lung influx on day 10. Conclusion: These data suggest that the survival benefit of DXM in severe viral pneumonia results from reduced CD8+ T cell-mediated immunopathology. Improved outcomes appear likely to be achieved by either use of broad immunosuppressive agents such as DXM or a targeted approach to deplete CD8+ T cells during late-stage pneumonia such as COVID19. These data also provide a preclinical model to test other immunosuppressive agents and optimize timing and dosing of such agents.","Wali, S.; Goldblatt, D.; Pantaleón García, J.; Tuvim, M.

331200,Editorial: Commonsensical public health measures prevail over transient health recommendations during COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major health problem with a high rate of spread. We aimed to investigate herein the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on depression and sexual dysfunction in patients with epilepsy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and sixteen epilepsy patients admitted to our hospital from October-November 2019 were evaluated for sexual functions and depression using the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) and Beck Depression Scale, respectively. These scales were re-applied in June 2020 and July 2020 to assess the impact of the outbreak on sexual function and depression in the same group of patients. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded and analyzed in SPSS. RESULTS: During the pandemic period, the total Beck Depression Scale values ââincreased significantly in the patients with epilepsy compared to the pre-pandemic period (p=0.048), and depressive symptoms showed an increasing trend (p=0.032). Although an increase in sexual dysfunction was also recorded, it was not statistically significant compared to the pre-pandemic period. In eight patients (6.9%), seizure frequency increased during the pandemic period. In the multivariate analysis, the only parameter that predicted the increase in seizure frequency was the number of drugs used. The Beck Depression Scale values were positively correlated with total male/female ASEX values, age, marital status, duration of illness, and seizure frequency. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak caused an increase in the tendency to depression in epilepsy patients and has also had a negative effect on sexual function. During public health outbreaks, clinicians should focus not only on seizure control in patients with epilepsy but also on their mental health.","Gul, Zeynep Bastug",Ann. med.-psychol,,219
331367,Coping With COVID-19: Mindfulness-Based Approaches for Mitigating Mental Health Crisis,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Several aspects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remain ambiguous, including its transmission, severity, geographic, and racial differences in mortality. These variations merit elaboration of local patterns to inform wider national policies. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, data of patients treated at a dedicated COVID hospital with moderate and severe illness during 8 wk of the pandemic were reviewed with attention to mortality in a competing risks framework. RESULTS: A total of 1147 patients were hospitalized, and 312 (27.2%) died in hospital. Those who died were older (56.5 vs 47.6 y; P < 0.0001). Of these, 885 (77.2%) had tested positive on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with 219 (24.2%) deaths (incidence rate, 1.9 per 100 person-days). Median time from onset of symptoms to death was 11 days. A competing risks analysis for in-hospital death revealed an adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio of 1.4 for each decade increase in age. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis provides broad patterns of disease presentation and mortality. Even COVID test-negative patients will receive treatment at dedicated facilities, and 33% presenting cases may die within the first 72 h, most with comorbid illness. This should be considered while planning distribution of services for effective health-care delivery.","Goel, Ashish; Raizada, Alpana; Agrawal, Ananya; Bansal, Kamakshi; Uniyal, Saurabh; Prasad, Pratima; Yadav, Anil; Tyagi, Asha; Rautela, R S",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,219

This pandemic viral infection has affected over 200 countries within a very short time and created a calamitous situation across the globe. As per WHO guidelines, the treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. This clinical protocol has not proven sufficient to save the lives of COVID-19 patients suffering from diabetes or having underlying liver diseases; hence there is utmost need to tackle this situation by other means such as Convalescent Plasma (CP) therapy. METHODS: A comprehensive literature survey was carriedout using Elsevier, PubMed, Taylor & Francis, Springer, Nature and Google search engines. RESULTS: The patients suffering from diabetes or liver dysfunction or any other underlying diseases are at greatest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. From the study, it is proved that plasma collected from the recovered patients of viral infection has considerable potential to treat the viral disease without the occurrence of adverse effects. CONCLUSION: The CP therapy can be a possible life saving alternative to treat critical COVID-19 patients having diabetes or underlying liver dysfunction. Hence, randomised clinical trials are recommended at the earliest to save the lives of infected individuals of COVID-19.","Pawar, Ashish Yashwantrao; Hiray, Apoorva Prashant; Sonawane, Deepak Devidas; Bhambar, Rajendra Sudhakar; Derle, Deelip Vishram; Ahire, Yogesh Suresh",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,219
343823,Pandemic inspires pharmacogenomics telehealth pilot project,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Understanding the impact of lockdown upon resistance training (RT), and how people adapted their RT behaviours, has implications for strategies to maintain engagement in similar positive health behaviours. Further, doing so will provide a baseline for investigation of the long-term effects of these public health measures upon behaviours and perceptions, and facilitate future follow-up study. OBJECTIVES: To determine how the onset of coronavirus (COVID-19), and associated 'lockdown', affected RT behaviours, in addition to motivation, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and intent to continue, in those who regularly performed RT prior to the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study using online surveys in multiple languages (English, Danish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Slovakian, Swedish, and Japanese) distributed across social media platforms and through authors' professional and personal networks. Adults (n = 5389; median age = 31 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 25, 38]), previously engaged in RT prior to lockdown (median prior RT experience = 7 years [IQR = 4, 12]) participated. Outcomes were self-reported RT behaviours including: continuation of RT during lockdown, location of RT, purchase of specific equipment for RT, method of training, full-body or split routine, types of training, repetition ranges, exercise number, set volumes (per exercise and muscle group), weekly frequency of training, perception of effort, whether training was planned/recorded, time of day, and training goals. Secondary outcomes included motivation, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and intent to continue RT. RESULTS: A majority of individuals (82.8%) maintained participation in RT during-lockdown. Marginal probabilities from generalised linear models and generalised estimating equations for RT behaviours were largely similar from pre- to during-lockdown. There was reduced probability of training in privately owned gyms (~ 59% to ~ 7%) and increased probability of training at home (~ 18% to ~ 89%); greater probability of training using a full-body routine (~ 38% to ~ 51%); reduced probability of resistance machines (~ 66% to ~ 13%) and free weight use (~ 96% to ~ 81%), and increased probability of bodyweight training (~ 62% to ~ 82%); reduced probability of moderate repetition ranges (~ 62-82% to ~ 55-66%) and greater probability of higher repetition ranges (~ 27% to ~ 49%); and moderate reduction in the perception of effort experienced during-training (r = 0.31). Further, individuals were slightly less likely to plan or record training during lockdown and many changed their training goals. Additionally, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and likelihood of continuing current training were all lower during-lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Those engaged in RT prior to lockdown these behaviours with only slight adaptations in both location and types of training performed. However, people employed less effort, had lower motivation, and perceived training as less effective and enjoyable, reporting their likelihood of continuing current training was similar or lower than pre-lockdown. These results have implications for strategies to maintain engagement in positive health behaviours such as RT during-restrictive pandemic-related public health measures.

Due to geographical challenges and limited resources, clinicians developed novel strategies for managing patients. The use of a dual oxygen concentrator system for mechanical ventilation is one of the innovations developed by retrieval team members from the Emergency Department (ED) of the Sabah Women and Children's Hospital. Due to conditions requiring isolation of patients suspected of or positive for COVID-19, high-risk patients were treated in an ED extension area that lacked central wall oxygen. Direct access to oxygen tanks became the only viable option, but ensuring a continuous supply was laborious. The novel setup described within this paper has been used on intubated patients in the ED extension area with moderate to high ventilator settings successfully. This simple setup, designed to meet the limited resources within a pandemic environment, needed only a turbine-driven ventilator, two oxygen concentrators, a 3-way connector, and three oxygen tubing. The application of this setup could potentially save more critically ill patients who are being managed in resource-limited conditions such as in smaller district hospitals or out in the field.","Cheah, Phee Kheng; Steven, Evelyn Marie; Ng, Khai Keam; Hashim, Muammar Iqbal; Abdul Kadir, Mohamed Hakimi; Roder, Nicholas Paul",Int J Emerg Med,,219

Treatment with GABA, which activates both GABAA-Rs and GABAB-Rs), and/or a GABAA-R-specific agonist inhibits disease progression in mouse models of type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and COVID-19. Little is known about the clinical potential of specifically modulating GABAB-Rs. Here, we tested lesogaberan, a peripherally restricted GABAB-R agonist, as an interventive therapy in diabetic NOD mice.

Surgical neuro-oncology care is a fundamental part of hospital services, making it susceptible to strategic changes amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An electronic search on several databases (PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar) from the beginning of the pandemic to the end of 2020, each paper was reviewed independently. The publication inclusion and exclusion criteria were done using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Eight studies were found to be eligible for our meta-analysis. Most of the studies were on a retrospective basis, except one which was retrospective and prospective. An overall of 951 glioma patients' were included for surgical admission from the beginning of the pandemic until 2020. Seventy-four patients' had mortality outcomes, and 250 patients had complications for both surgical admitted and non-surgical admitted purposes. Conclusions: To our knowledge, we made the first systematic review and meta-analysis regarding the management of glioma patients' during the pandemic of COVID-19. Our main findings are that the number of surgical admissions for glioma patients' did not significantly differ between COVID-19 negative and COVD-19 positive cases; however, surprisingly, we found that both overall complications and mortality outcomes were more significant COVID-19 negative patients' from the reported studies.","Azab, Mohammed A; Azzam, Ahmed Y",Brain Disord,,219

360092,Tackling Childhood Stunting in the Eastern Mediterranean Region in the Context of COVID-19,2020,"BackgroundStarting December 2020, Israel began a mass vaccination campaign against coronavirus administering the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine, which led to a sharp curtailing of the outbreak. After a period with almost no SARS-CoV-2 infections, a resurgent COVID-19 outbreak initiated mid June 2021. Possible reasons for the breakthrough were reduced vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant, and waning immunity. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent of waning immunity using Israels national-database. MethodsData on all PCR positive test results between July 11-31, 2021 of Israeli residents who became fully vaccinated before June 2021 were used in this analysis. Infection rates and severe COVID-19 outcomes were compared between individuals who were vaccinated in different time periods using a Poisson regression, stratifying by age group and adjusting for possible confounding factors. ResultsThe rates of both documented SARS-CoV-2 infections and severe COVID-19 exhibit a statistically significant increase as time from second vaccine dose elapsed. Elderly individuals (60+) who received their second dose in March 2021 were 1.6 (CI: [1.3, 2]) times more protected against infection and 1.7 (CI: [1.0, 2.7]) times more protected against severe COVID-19 compared to those who received their second dose in January 2021. Similar results were found for different age groups. ConclusionsThese results indicate a strong effect of waning immunity in all age groups after six months. Quantifying the effect of waning immunity on vaccine effectiveness is critical for policy makers worldwide facing the dilemma of administering booster vaccinations.","Goldberg, Yair; Mandel, Micha; Bar-On, Yinon M.; Bodenheimer, Omri; Freedman, Laurence S; Haas, Eric; Milo, Ron; Alroy-Preis, Sharon; Ash, Nachman; Huppert, Amit",,,219

The use of remote learning as an emergency measure has affected students, faculty, support staff, and administrators. The aim of this narrative review paper is to examine the challenges and opportunities faced by medical schools in implementing remote learning for basic science teaching in response to the COVID-19 crisis. We searched relevant literature in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using specific keywords, e.g., ""COVID-19 pandemic,"" ""preclinical medical education,"" ""online learning,"" ""remote learning,"" ""challenges,"" and ""opportunities."" The pandemic has posed several challenges to premedical education (e.g., suspension of face-to-face teaching, lack of cadaveric dissections, and practical/laboratory sessions) but has provided many opportunities as well, such as the incorporation of online learning in the curriculum and upskilling and reskilling in new technologies. To date, many medical schools have successfully transitioned their educational environment to emergency remote teaching and assessments. During COVID-19 crisis, the preclinical phase of medical curricula has successfully introduced the novel culture of ""online home learning"" using technology-oriented innovations, which may extend to post-COVID era to maintain teaching and learning in medical education. However, the lack of hands-on training in the preclinical years may have serious implications on the training of the current cohort of students, and they may struggle later in the clinical years. The use of emergent technology (e.g., artificial intelligence for adaptive learning, virtual simulation, and telehealth) for education is most likely to be indispensable components of the transformative change and post-COVID medical education.","Gaur, Uma; Majumder, Md Anwarul Azim; Sa, Bidyadhar; Sarkar, Sankalan; Williams, Arlene; Singh, Keerti",SN Compr Clin Med,,219

Several innovative approaches are in development to restrain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In particular, BCG, a vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), is being considered as an alternative therapeutic modality. BCG vaccine is known to induce both humoral and adaptive immunities, thereby activating both nonspecific and cross-reactive immune responses in the host, which combined could effectively resist other pathogens including SARS-CoV-2. Notably, some studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, case positivity, and mortality rate have been higher in countries that have not adopted BCG vaccination than in countries that have done so.

384552,Quality of care and maternal mortality in a tertiary-level hospital in Mozambique: a retrospective study of clinicopathological discrepancies,2020,"BACKGROUND: Domestic violence (DV) damages health and requires a global public health response and engagement of clinical services. Recent surveys show that 27% of married Palestinian women experienced some form of violence from their husbands over a 12 months' period, but only 5% had sought formal help, and rarely from health services. Across the globe, barriers to disclosure of DV have been recorded, including self-blame, fear of the consequences and lack of knowledge of services. This is the first qualitative study to address barriers to disclosure within health services for Palestinian women. METHODS: In-depth interviews were carried out with 20 women who had experienced DV. They were recruited from a non-governmental organisation offering social and legal support. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and translated into English and the data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Women encountered barriers at individual, health care service and societal levels. Lack of knowledge of available services, concern about the health care primary focus on physical issues, lack of privacy in health consultations, lack of trust in confidentiality, fear of being labelled 'mentally ill' and losing access to their children were all highlighted. Women wished for health professionals to take the initiative in enquiring about DV. Wider issues concerned women's social and economic dependency on their husbands which led to fears about transgressing social and cultural norms by speaking out. Women feared being blamed and ostracised by family members and others, or experiencing an escalation of violence. CONCLUSIONS: Palestinian women's agency to be proactive in help-seeking for DV is clearly limited. Our findings can inform training of health professionals in Palestine to address these barriers, to increase awareness of the link between DV and many common presentations such as depression, to ask sensitively about DV in private, reassure women about confidentiality, and increase awareness among women of the role that health services can play in DV.","Shaheen, Amira; Ashkar, Suzy; Alkaiyat, Abdulsalam; Bacchus, Loraine; Colombini, Manuela; Feder, Gene; Evans, Maggie",BMC Public Health,,219

This crisis is a critical public health concern, and it has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the pandemic has highlighted the important roles played by public interest journalism - including in addressing health equity issues. The pandemic has also highlighted the need to address structural weaknesses in the media industry, with concentration of media ownership and underfunding of public broadcasters leading to many communities being under-served and under-represented. The public health sector can make important contributions to developing and sustaining a robust, public interest journalism sector.

It is desirable to all of us to have the prospect of quickly predicting a turning point in the daily cases curve of the disease. In this work we face the problem of COVID-19 virus disease spreading by aiming mostly to create a reliable mathematical model describing this mechanism for an isolated society, for cities or even for a whole country. Drawing upon similar mechanisms appearing in the particle detector Physics, we concentrated to the so called, semi-gaussian function of n-degree. This approach can provide some very useful advantages in the data analysis of the daily reported cases of the infected people. Applying this model and fitting to the data, reported until the submission of this work, we have determined, among others, the mean infection time for a citizen in the society under study. We also applied and adopted this model to the reported cases in other countries and we have performed useful comparisons and conclusions.","Maltezos, S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05992v2.pdf,219
399136,Genomic Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2: Distribution of Clades in the Republic of Korea in 2020,2021,"We propose an epidemiological model using an adaptive dynamic three compartment (with four states) SIR(D) model. Our approach is similar to non-parametric curve fitting in spirit and automatically adapts to key external factors, such as interventions, while retaining the parsimonious nature of the standard SIR(D) model. Initial dynamic temporal estimates of the model parameters are obtained by minimising the aggregate residual sum of squares across the number of infections, recoveries, and fatalities, over a chosen lag period. Then a geometric smoother is applied to obtain the final time series of estimates. These estimates are used to obtain dynamic temporal robust estimates of the key feature of this pandemic, namely the""reproduction number"". We illustrate our method on the Indian COVID-19 data for the period March 14 - August 31, 2020. The time series data plots of the 36 states and union territories shows a clear presence of inter-regional variation in the prognosis of the epidemic. This is also bourne out by the estimates of the underlying parameters, including the reproduction numbers for the 36 regions. Due to this, an SIR(D) model, dynamic or otherwise, on the national aggregate data is not suited for robust local predictions. The time series of estimates of the model enables us to carry out daily, weekly and also long term predictions, including construction of predictive bands. We obtain an excellent agreement between the actual data and the model predicted data at the regional level. Our estimates of the current reproduction number turn out to be more than 2 in three regions (Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh) and between 1.5 and 2 in 13 regions. Each of these regions have experienced an individual trajectory, which typically involves initial phase of shock(s) followed by a relatively steady lower level of the reproduction number.","Bhattacharjee, Madhuchhanda; Bose, Arup",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05044v1.pdf,219

Previous data from Wuhan city showed that acute kidney injury (AKI), proteinuria and hematuria occurred frequently in patients with severe COVID-19. However, the prevalence of kidney injury in milder cases remains unclear. Methods: This retrospective study included two major consecutive cohorts of COVID-19 patients in Sichuan Province. Baseline characteristics, laboratory data including renal function, proteinuria and dipstick hematuria, and other laboratory parameters were collected. A subgroup of patients was followed up for 2-4 weeks to evaluate the short-term outcome of renal impairment. Results: Overall, 168 COVID-19-positive patients were included in the study. The majority of patients (79.7%) were diagnosed with mild or moderate disease. Half of patients presented with fever; however, in The Tibetan cohort, fever only occurred in 13.4% of patients. On hospital admission, proteinuria and dipstick hematuria were noted in 18.4% and 17.4% of patients, respectively, while AKI only occurred in one patient. Further analysis showed that severe or critical COVID-19 was associated with higher risk of proteinuria [relative risk (RR) 7.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.45-22.18, P = 3.8 × 10-4] and dipstick hematuria (RR 8.30, 95% CI 2.69-25.56, P = 2.3 × 10-4). Proteinuria, dipstick hematuria, or the combination of proteinuria and hematuria could significantly predict severe or critical severe COVID-19. Conclusions: Proteinuria and dipstick hematuria are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19 infection, especially in severe or critical cases.","Hong, Daqing; Long, Lin; Wang, Amanda Y; Lei, Yu; Tang, Yun; Zhao, Jia Wei; Song, Xiaofei; He, Yanan; Wen, Ergang; Zheng, Ling; Li, Guisen; Wang, Li",Clin Kidney J,,219

The thrombotic complications are common in COVID-19 patients which have been extensively addressed in various studies. The hemorrhagic complications, however, have received less attention. In this article, 4 cases of COVID-19 patients with hemorrhagic complications are presented. All 4 patients were hospitalized in ICU and received routine COVID-19 treatments such as heparin prophylaxis. During hospitalization, all four patients had rectus sheath hematoma and retroperitoneal hemorrhage. For controlling which, they underwent embolization. Embolization of the inferior epigastric artery and the anterior trunk of internal iliac artery was carried out under fluoroscopy-guided angiography. The active hemorrhage of the patients was controlled. Three patients recovered after the treatment and were discharged while one patient, unfortunately, died due to the severity of the pulmonary involvement, old age, and hemorrhage. First, the hemorrhage of these patients was considered to be the result of the hemorrhagic complications due to the use of heparin. But the hemorrhage volume was not justifiable with the symptoms and complications of prophylaxis dosage of heparin. The attention was gradually drawn to the coagulopathy of the COVID-19 patients. Further investigations are required to clarify the role of effective factors and complications of coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 and their appropriate treatment.

It is imperative therefore that we seek to understand community resilience and identify ways to enhance this, especially within our cities and communities. Therefore, great emphasis is now placed on how cities prepare for and recover from such disasters, and community resilience has emerged as a key consideration. Drawing upon research on the theory of resilience, this study seeks to identify the factors that influence community resilience and to analyze their causation toward helping to manage the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Seventeen factors from the five dimensions of social capital, economic capital, physical environment, demographic characteristics, and institutional factors are used to construct an index system. This is used to establish the structural level and importance of each factor. Data were collected using a questionnaire survey involving 12,000 members of key community groups in the city of Wuhan. An interpretative structural model (ISM) combining the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was then used to obtain the multi-level hierarchical structure composed of direct factors, indirect factors, and fundamental factors. The results show that the income level, vulnerability of the population, and the built environment are the main factors that affect the resilience of communities affected by COVID-19. These findings provide useful guidance toward the effective planning and design of urban construction and infrastructure. The results are expected to be useful to inform future decision-making and toward the long term, sustainable management of the risks posed by COVID-19.","Xu, Wenping; Xiang, Lingli; Proverbs, David; Xiong, Shu",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,219

The reasons remain to be fully elucidated. Objective: To compare and evaluate the effectiveness of case-based (including contact tracing and quarantine) and population-based (including social distancing and facial masking) interventions for COVID-19 in Taiwan. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study used a stochastic branching process model using COVID-19 epidemic data from Taiwan, an island nation of 23.6 million people, with no locally acquired cases of COVID-19 reported for 253 days between April and December 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Effective reproduction number of COVID-19 cases (the number of secondary cases generated by 1 primary case) and the probability of outbreak extinction (0 new cases within 20 generations). For model development and calibration, an estimation of the incubation period (interval from exposure to symptom onset), serial interval (time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair), and the statistical distribution of the number of any subsequent infections generated by 1 primary case was calculated. Results: This study analyzed data from 158 confirmed COVID-19 cases (median age, 45 years; interquartile range, 25-55 years; 84 men [53%]). An estimated 55% (95% credible interval [CrI], 41%-68%) of transmission events occurred during the presymptomatic stage. In our estimated analysis, case detection, contact tracing, and 14-day quarantine of close contacts (regardless of symptoms) was estimated to decrease the reproduction number from the counterfactual value of 2.50 to 1.53 (95% CrI, 1.50-1.57), which would not be sufficient for epidemic control, which requires a value of less than 1. In our estimated analysis, voluntary population-based interventions, if used alone, were estimated to have reduced the reproduction number to 1.30 (95% CrI, 1.03-1.58). Combined case-based and population-based interventions were estimated to reduce the reproduction number to below unity (0.85; 95% CrI, 0.78-0.89). Results were similar for additional analyses with influenza data and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness research study, the combination of case-based and population-based interventions (with wide adherence) may explain the success of COVID-19 control in Taiwan in 2020. Either category of interventions alone would have been insufficient, even in a country with an effective public health system and comprehensive contact tracing program. Mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic requires the collaborative effort of public health professionals and the general public.","Ng, Ta-Chou; Cheng, Hao-Yuan; Chang, Hsiao-Han; Liu, Cheng-Chieh; Yang, Chih-Chi; Jian, Shu-Wan; Liu, Ding-Ping; Cohen, Ted; Lin, Hsien-Ho",JAMA Intern Med,,219
418769,The Ethics of Health: Giovanni Berlinguer's Contribution to Building a Fairer Society,2020,"BACKGROUND: Two conflicting hypotheses as to how breast cancer (BC) accesses the systemic circulation dominated the 20th century and affected surgical treatment. We hypothesized that tumor lymphovascular invasion (LVI) at the primary tumor site favors lymphatic and not blood vessel, capillaries, and systemic metastases (Smets) are dependent upon regional lymph node (RLN) mets. METHODS: Data from BC patients undergoing RLN biopsy was professionally abstracted and maintained in a prospective, precisely managed, single-institution database. Associations of RLN, LVI, and Smets were estimated by univariate and multivariate backward logistic regression models and patient-affiliated demographic, clinicopathologic, treatment type, and molecular marker data. RESULTS: Of 3329 patients, followed 1-22 years (mean 7.8), 463 of 3329 (13.9%) showed LVI, 742 of 3329 (22.3%) had RLN mets, and 262 of 3329 (7.9%) had Smets. Smets occurred in 52 of 252 (21% with LVI+/RLN+); 116 of 2301 (5% with LVI-/RLN-); 65 of 465 (14% with LVI-/RLN+); and 17 of 207 (8% with LVI+/RLN-), p = 0.021 for association between LVI and Smets for RLN+ patients but not for RLN- patients (p = 0.051). Positive RLN, larger tumor size, and higher grade (all p < 0.001) were predictive of Smets by the multivariable model, whereas positive LVI was not. CONCLUSIONS: LVI predicts RLN mets in BC. RLN is critical to Smets from BC, whereas LVI on its own is not. Smets occur significantly more commonly when both LVI and RLN mets occur together. LVI is, thus, likely to be primarily lymphatic invasion, and rarely, blood vessel invasion, supporting the Halsted paradigm. LVI and RLN together predict clinical outcome better than either alone.","David Nathanson, S; Leonard-Murali, Shravan; Burmeister, Charlotte; Susick, Laura; Baker, Patricia",Ann. surg. oncol,,219

435694,"Mental Health Status of the General Public, Frontline, and Non-frontline Healthcare Providers in the Early Stage of COVID-19",2021,"The use of postprandial triglyceride (ppTG) as a cardiovascular disease risk indicator has gained recent popularity. However, the influence of different foods or food ingredients on the ppTG response has not been comprehensively characterized. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effects of foods or food ingredients on the ppTG response. PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases were searched for relevant acute (<24-h) randomized controlled trials published up to September 2018. Based on our selection criteria, 179 relevant trials (366 comparisons) were identified and systematically compiled into distinct food or food ingredient categories. A ppTG-lowering effect was noted for soluble fiber (Hedges' giAUC = -0.72; 95% CI: -1.33, -0.11), sodium bicarbonate mineral water (Hedges' gAUC = -0.42; 95% CI: -0.79, -0.04), diacylglycerol oil (Hedges' giAUC = -0.38; 95% CI: -0.75, -0.00), and whey protein when it was contrasted with other proteins. The fats group showed significant but opposite effects depending on the outcome measure used (Hedges' giAUC = -0.32; 95% CI: -0.61, -0.03; and Hedges' gAUC = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.26). Data for other important food groups (nuts, vegetables, and polyphenols) were also assessed but of limited availability. Assessing for oral fat tolerance test (OFTT) recommendation compliance, most trials were &#8805;4 h long but lacked a sufficiently high fat challenge. iAUC and AUC were more common measures of ppTG. Overall, our analyses indicate that the effects on ppTG by different food groups are diverse, largely influenced by the type of food or food ingredient within the same group. The type of ppTG measurement can also influence the response.","Lee, Delia Pei Shan; Low, Jasmine Hui Min; Chen, Jacklyn Ruilin; Zimmermann, Diane; Actis-Goretta, Lucas; Kim, Jung Eun","Adv. nutr.

The COVID-19 pandemic created significant uncertainty, with dire mortality predictions from early forecasts resulting in widespread government intervention and greater individual precaution that reduced the projected death toll. We analyze how life insurance companies changed pricing and offerings in response to COVID-19 using monthly data on term life insurance policies from Compulife. We estimate event-study models that exploit well-established variation in the COVID-19 mortality rate based on age and underlying health status. Despite the increase in mortality risk and significant uncertainty, the results generally indicate that life insurance companies did not increase premiums or decrease policy offerings due to COVID-19. Nonetheless, we find some evidence that premiums differentially increased for individuals with very high risk and that some policies were removed for the oldest of the old.","Harris, Timothy F; Yelowitz, Aaron; Courtemanche, Charles",,,219

439365,COVID-19 and comorbidities: Deleterious impact on infected patients,2020,"B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHLs) are often characterized by the development of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and/or relapse. During drug-induced apoptosis, Yin Yang 1 (YY1) transcription factor might modulate the expression of apoptotic regulators genes. The present study was aimed to: (1) examine the potential oncogenic role of YY1 in reversing drug resistance in B-NHLs; and (2) identify YY1 transcriptional target(s) that regulate the apoptotic pathway in B-NHLs. Predictive analyses coupled with database-deposited data suggested that YY1 binds the promoter of the BIRC5/survivin anti-apoptotic gene. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) analyses of several B-NHL repositories revealed a conserved positive correlation between YY1 and survivin, both highly expressed, especially in aggressive B-NHLs. Further validation experiments performed in Raji Burkitt's lymphomas cells, demonstrated that YY1 silencing was associated with survivin downregulation and sensitized the cells to apoptosis. Overall, our results revealed that: (1) YY1 and survivin are positively correlated and overexpressed in B-NHLs, especially in BLs; (2) YY1 strongly binds to the survivin promoter, hence survivin may be suggested as YY1 transcriptional target; (3) YY1 silencing sensitizes Raji cells to drug-induced apoptosis via downregulation of survivin; (4) both YY1 and survivin are potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of resistant/relapsed B-NHLs.","Vivarelli, Silvia; Falzone, Luca; Ligresti, Giovanni; Candido, Saverio; Garozzo, Adriana; Magro, Gaetano Giuseppe; Bonavida, Benjamin; Libra, Massimo",,,219

A full five years after the globally coordinated removal of serotype 2 oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV2) from trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) for use in national immunization programs, cVDPV2s did not die out. Since OPV2 cessation, responses to outbreaks caused by cVDPV2s mainly used serotype 2 monovalent OPV (mOPV2) from a stockpile. A novel vaccine developed from a genetically stabilized OPV2 strain (nOPV2) promises to potentially facilitate outbreak response with lower prospective risks, although its availability and properties in the field remain uncertain. Using an established global poliovirus transmission model and building on a related analysis that characterized the impacts of disruptions in GPEI activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we explore the implications of trade-offs associated with delaying outbreak response to avoid using mOPV2 by waiting for nOPV2 availability (or equivalently, delayed responses waiting for national validation of meeting the criteria for nOPV2 initial use). Consistent with prior modeling, responding as quickly as possible with available mOPV2 promises to reduce the expected burden of disease in the outbreak population and to reduce the chances for the outbreak virus to spread to other areas. Delaying cVDPV2 outbreak response (e.g., modeled as no response January-June 2021) to wait for nOPV2 can considerably increase the total expected cases (e.g., by as many as 1,300 cVDPV2 cases in the African region during 2021-2023) and increases the likelihood of triggering the need to restart widescale preventive use of an OPV2-containing vaccine in national immunization programs that use OPV. Countries should respond to any cVDPV2 outbreaks quickly with rounds that achieve high coverage using any available OPV2, and plan to use nOPV2, if needed, once it becomes widely available based on evidence that it is as effective but safer in populations than mOPV2.","Kalkowska, Dominika A; Pallansch, Mark A; Wassilak, Steven G F; Cochi, Stephen L; Thompson, Kimberly M",Vaccine,,219

We simulate stochastic SIR dynamics on social networks, which are based on observations in a hospital in Tokyo, to explore effective containment strategies against nosocomial infection. The observed networks have hierarchical and modular structure. We show that healthcare workers, particularly medical doctors, are main vectors of diseases on these networks. Intervention methods that restrict interaction between medical doctors and their visits to different wards shrink the final epidemic size more than intervention methods that directly protect patients, such as isolating patients in single rooms. By the same token, vaccinating doctors with priority rather than patients or nurses is more effective. Finally, vaccinating individuals with large betweenness centrality is superior to vaccinating ones with large connectedness to others or randomly chosen individuals, as suggested by previous model studies.

A cross-sectional study on perceived personal and comparative susceptibility for infectious diseases,2020,"The World Trade Organization is in decline. Its dispute settlement mechanism faces an existential crisis. The Doha Round is all but dead. With the Covid-19 pandemic wrecking economies and exacerbating the spiraling income and wealth inequality, the road ahead for the WTO looks precarious. While many factors have contributed to the decline of the WTO, most can be traced to its design flaws. With the adoption of the Marrakesh Agreement, the scope of the multilateral trade regime expanded. However, such expansion was pointedly selective. While business and corporate interests were protected through the incorporation of traditionally nontrade subjects, such as intellectual property and investment, labour and development issues were sidelined. In reality, the operative rules of the WTO are not only inconsistent with the standard justifications for trade liberalization but also with the organization's own stated goals. As a result, many came to view the WTO as an agent of neoliberalism spearheading the diversion of the wealth of nations into the wealth of corporations. Such single-minded pursuit of profit has not only undermined the legitimacy of the WTO but also has contributed to the creation a conducive environment for the rise of nationalism, populism, and protectionism, threatening the liberal international order.","Yigzaw, Destaw A.",The Estey Centre Journal of International Law and Trade Policy,,219

447082,Validity of methods used in medication Y-site mixing study,2021,"Introduction: Effective social support can have a critical influence on a mother's ability to initiate and continue breastfeeding. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created unprecedented barriers for breastfeeding mothers to obtain various types of support: emotional, instrumental, informational, and appraisal. However, no research has evaluated the influence the pandemic has had on breastfeeding supports. The purpose of this study was to explore perceptions of social support among breastfeeding mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional phenomenological approach was taken utilizing semistructured interviews (March-June 2020) with currently breastfeeding mothers (n = 29). Data were analyzed through a process of immersion and crystallization. Results: Mothers are still able to obtain each type of support, however, support has been negatively influenced by the pandemic. Mothers reported experiencing increased stress and isolation and had an immense desire to receive in-person support from peers, family, childcare providers, and lactation specialists. Furthermore, mothers of multiple children felt if they did not already have breastfeeding knowledge from previous experiences they would be unsuccessful in breastfeeding due to their current lack of support. Conversely, a majority of mothers felt the pandemic had positively influenced their breastfeeding journeys due to concerns of formula shortages and extended maternity leaves. Finally, mothers were concerned about safely expressing breast milk on their return to work. Conclusion: Mother's ability to obtain breastfeeding support has been negatively impacted by the pandemic due to the inability to engage with individuals in-person and the lack of access to childcare. First-time mothers may be at higher risk of early breastfeeding cessation due to lack of support. However, breastfeeding journeys have also been positively influenced by allowing mothers more time at home with their child. Resources are needed to support expressing breast milk in the workplace during COVID-19.","Snyder, Kailey; Worlton, Gwen",Breastfeed Med,,219

AREAS COVERED: We review the drug design landscape in the scientific and patent literature to design peptidomimetic and non-peptidomimetic protease inhibitors (PIs) targeting these proteins. EXPERT OPINION: The X-ray crystal structures of some of these proteases, alone and in complex with various inhibitors, were crucial for the discovery of effective such compounds, some of which also showed considerable antiviral activity and are considered preclinical candidates to fight these emerging infections, which in the case of Covid-19 already provoked an unprecedented worldwide pandemic.","Capasso, Clemente; Nocentini, Alessio; Supuran, Claudiu T",,,219

This study investigates the impact that family-work conflict, social isolation, distracting environment, job autonomy, and self-leadership have on employees' productivity, work engagement, and stress experienced when WFH during the pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data collected through an online questionnaire completed by 209 employees WFH during the pandemic. The assumptions were tested using hierarchical linear regression. RESULTS: Employees' family-work conflict and social isolation were negatively related, while self-leadership and autonomy were positively related, to WFH productivity and WFH engagement. Family-work conflict and social isolation were negatively related to WFH stress, which was not affected by autonomy and self-leadership. CONCLUSION: Individual- and work-related aspects both hinder and facilitate WFH during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Galanti, Teresa; Guidetti, Gloria; Mazzei, Eleonora; Zappalà, Salvatore; Toscano, Ferdinando",J. occup. environ. med,,219
447713,Roles for Health Care Professionals in Addressing Patient-Held Misinformation Beyond Fact Correction,2020,"Monitoring outcomes of health care providers, such as patient deaths, hospitalizations and readmissions to hospital, is important for assessing the quality of health care. Analyses based on random effects and fixed effects are commonly used to assess outcomes and identify providers with unusually poor (or good) outcomes. However, these approaches have shortcomings that can lead to unfair assessments of providers. One primary issue is that they do not consider variation between providers that is outside the providers' control, for example, due to unobserved patient characteristics that vary between providers. In this article, we review the existing fixed- and random-effects methods, and propose a smoothed empirical null approach that accounts for the total variation and adapts to different provider sizes. The linear model with random provider effects provides an illustration of the proposed empirical null method. This extends easily to other distributions to describe, for example, survival or binary outcomes. We also generalize the empirical null method to allow for some variation being due to quality of care. Methods are illustrated with numerical simulations and an example of a mortality measure in the Dialysis Facility Compare program.","Xia, Lu; He, Kevin; Li, Yanming; Kalbfleisch, John D.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07809v1.pdf,219
448693,COVID-19 and staff mental health: is there an evidence? An Italian field study,2020,"The microenvironment of pancreatic cancer adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly desmoplastic with distinct tumor-restraining and tumor-promoting fibroblast subpopulations. Re-education rather than indiscriminate elimination of these fibroblasts has emerged as a new strategy for combination therapy. Here, we studied the effects of global loss of pro-fibrotic non-coding regulatory microRNA-21 (miR-21) in K-Ras-driven p53-deleted genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC. Strikingly, loss of miR-21 accelerated tumor initiation via mucinous cystic neoplastic lesions and progression to locally advanced invasive carcinoma from which animals precipitously succumbed at an early age. The absence of tumor-restraining myofibroblasts and a massive infiltrate of immune cells were salient phenotypic features of global miR-21 loss. Stromal miR-21 activity was required for induction of tumor-restraining myofibroblasts in in-vivo isograft transplantation experiments. Low miR-21 expression negatively correlated with a fibroblast gene expression signature and positively with an immune cell gene expression signature in TCGA PDAC data set (n = 156) mirroring findings in the mouse models. Our results exposed an overall tumor suppressive function of miR-21 in in-vivo PDAC models. These results have important clinical implications for anti-miR-21-based inhibitory therapeutic approaches under consideration for PDAC and other cancer types. Mechanistic dissection of the cell-intrinsic role of miR-21 in cancer-associated fibroblasts and other cell types will be needed to inform best strategies for pharmacological modulation of miR-21 activity in order to remodel the tumor microenvironment and enhance treatment response in PDAC.

This study aimed to identify at Emergency Department (ED) admission the predictors of in-hospital mortality and suitable scores for death risk stratification among COVID-19 patients &#8805; 80 years old. METHODS: Single-centre prospective study conducted in the ED of an university hospital, referral center for COVID-19 in central Italy. We included 239 consecutive patients &#8805; 80 years old with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The primary study endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed on significant variables at univariate analysis to identify independent risk factor for death. Overall performance in predicting mortality of WHO severity scale, APACHE II score, NEWS score, and CURB-65 was calculated. RESULTS: Median age was 85 [82-89] and 112 were males (46.9%). Globally, 77 patients (32.2%) deceased. The presence of consolidations at chest x-ray and the hypoxemic respiratory failure were significant predictors of poor prognosis. Moreover, age &#8805; 85 years, dependency in activities of daily living (ADL), and dementia were risk factors for death, even after adjusting for clinical covariates and disease severity. All the evaluated scores showed a fairly good predictive value in identifying patients who could experience a worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients &#8805; 80 years old hospitalized with COVID-19, not only a worse clinical and radiological presentation of the disease, but also the increasing age, dementia, and impairment in ADL were strong risk factors for in-hospital death, regardless of disease severity.","Covino, Marcello; De Matteis, Giuseppe; Polla, Davide Antonio Della; Santoro, Michele; Burzo, Maria Livia; Torelli, Enrico; Simeoni, Benedetta; Russo, Andrea; Sandroni, Claudio; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Franceschi, Francesco",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,,219

Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs is still considered the reference diagnostic approach. Nonetheless, identification of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in upper respiratory tract specimens and/or saliva by means of rapid (antigen) immunoassays is emerging as a promising screening approach. These tests have some advantages compared to molecular analysis, such as point of care availability, no need of skilled personnel and dedicated instrumentation, lower costs and short turnaround time. However, these advantages are counterbalanced by lower diagnostic sensitivity compared to molecular testing, which would only enable to identifying patients with higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load. The evidence accumulated to-date has hence persuaded us to develop a tentative algorithm, which would magnify the potential benefits of rapid antigen testing in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.","Mattiuzzi, Camilla; Henry, Brandon M; Lippi, Giuseppe","Diagnosis (Berl., Internet)",,219

This is the case of the current outbreak of the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that has recently been declared “a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)” by the World Health Organization (WHO). The response to an influenza pandemic might generate remarkable stress and emotional turmoil to healthcare providers who work during the outbreak. Prior experience with disasters, pandemics, and major traumatic events indicates that enhanced support to healthcare professionals enabling them to become aware of their own emotions and effectively share their perspective and lived experience with patients can help them in remaining efficient and focused during these stressful events. This outbreak marks a vital moment where healthcare systems can endorse an “epidemic of empathy” aimed at bringing science and humanism together to benefit patients and consolidate citizens' trust in healthcare providers during this and future healthcare crisis.

479247,Effectiveness of a Family Support Intervention on Caregiving Burden in Family of Elderly Patients With Cognitive Decline After the COVID-19 Lockdown,2021,"The increase incidence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Salmonella has become a major global health concern. Polymyxin, an ancient polypeptide antibiotic, has been given renewed attention over recent years, resulting in resistance of Gram-negative bacteria to polymyxin, but its resistance mechanism is not completely clear. Thus, it is important to study its resistance mechanisms. In this study, an in vitro induced polymyxin-resistant strain of Salmonella typhimurium in the laboratory were constructed to investigate the mechanism of resistance of Salmonella to polymyxin. Gradual induction of Salmonella typhimurium ATCC13311 (AT) by concentration increment was used to screen for a highly polymyxin-resistant strain AT-P128. The broth dilution technique was used to compare the sensitivity of the two strains to different antimicrobial drugs. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were then identified by whole genome sequencing, and differences in gene expression between the two strains were compared by transcriptome sequencing and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Finally, for the first time, the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system was used to construct gene deletion mutants in Salmonella to knock out the phoP gene of AT-P128. The results showed that strain AT-P128 was significantly more resistant to amoxicillin, ceftiofur, ampicillin, fluphenazine, and chloramphenicol and significantly less resistant to sulfamethoxazole than the parental strain AT. The growth curve results showed no significant change in the growth rate between AT-P128 and AT. Motility and biofilm formation assays showed a significant decrease in AT-P128. Additionally, the WGS results showed that AT-P128 had mutations in 9 genes involving 14 SNPs. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR results showed increased expression of phoPQ. The loss of the phoP gene decreased AT-P128&#916;phoP resistance to polymyxin by 32-fold. These results suggested that polymyxin resistance affected the biology, genome components, and gene expression levels of Salmonella and that the PhoPQ two-component system played a key role in polymyxin resistance in Salmonella, providing insights into the diversity and complexity of polymyxin resistance in Salmonella.","Li, Lin; Li, Rui; Qi, Caili; Gao, Haixia; Wei, Qiling; Tan, Lei; Sun, Feifei",Vet Microbiol,,219

484584,KCDC risk assessments on the initial phase of the COViD-19 outbreak in Korea,2020,"BackgroundThe clinical presentation and disease severity in SARS-Cov-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic carriage to death There is little data regarding the timeframe of symptom onset to presentation to hospital, and disease outcomes Therefore, we aim to investigate differences between ‘early presenters’ (7 days) and their clinical and radiological outcomes MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, symptom onset, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics were collected from patient electronic medical records at University Hospital Southampton Foundation Trust with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection Logistical regression models were used to explore the relationships between these data and time of presentation to hospital ResultsBetween March and July 2020, symptom onset data was collected for 626 SARS-Cov-2 positive patients, 574 of whom had chest radiographs (CXR) Early presenters comprised 388 (62%) and 238 (38%) were late presenters Early presenters were significantly older (p&lt;0 001), more likely to have significant comorbidities – hypertension, thromboembolic and renal disease (p&lt;0 001) – and also significantly less likely to report cardinal symptoms of Covid-19;fever, cough, SOB, myalgia, fatigue/malaise, headache (p&lt;0 001) In the cohort overall, the presence of infiltrates was not predictive of adverse outcome (ICU admission, ventilation or death) (p=0 214) Although early presenters were less likely to have infiltrates on their CXR (58% vs 76 8%), (p&lt;0 001), the presence of CXR infiltrates in early presenters demonstrated an increased risk of adverse outcome (OR 1 90, 95% CI 1 11, 3 25) ConclusionWe have demonstrated that SARS-Cov-2 infection presents in an heterogenous manner that varies with symptom duration Atypical presentation of SARS-Cov-2 infection is more common earlier on in disease course, where viral shedding is likely to be higher, and this finding is of note in the context of national criteria for self-isolation and testing Late presentation is more likely to be associated with radiological change, but this does not reflect an increased likelihood of adverse outcome Patients who present early in their illness with radiological changes are at increased risk of adverse clinical outcome, suggesting that symptom onset and detection of CXR infiltrates are important for clinical assessment of severity at presentation to hospital in Covid-19","Sheard, N.; Williams, S.; Stuart, B.; Phan, H.; Borca, F.; Burke, H.; Freeman, A.",Thorax,,219

Considerable research has highlighted the importance of trust in ethically and effectively managing infectious diseases in the population; however, considerations of reciprocal trust remain limited in debates on pandemic response. This paper aims to broaden the perspective of good ethical practices in managing an infectious disease outbreak by including the role of reciprocal trust. A synthesis of the approaches drawn from South Korea and Taiwan reveals reciprocal trust as an important ethical response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reciprocal trust offers the opportunity to reconcile the difficulties arising from restrictive measures for protecting population health and individual rights.","Chan, Hui Yun",Asian Bioeth Rev,,219

AIM: The aim of this study was to collect information regarding the extent of online medication purchasing in the UAE and to assess the factors that motivating the purchase of medications from the internet. METHOD: A convenience sampling of people living in the UAE was used to conduct an online descriptive cross-sectional study. Respondents were solicited using the social media platforms WhatsApp and Facebook, whereby they were asked to fill in a validated web-based questionnaire. The number of people buying medications from online pharmacies was calculated using a percentage with 95% CIs. RESULTS: 131 respondents (31.2%) [95% CI: 26.7-35.6] stated that they purchased medication via the Internet after Covid-19 was classed as a pandemic. It was found that those respondents most likely to have purchased medication via the Internet were male, single, and older and with a high school education. CONCLUSION: More research should be conducted to investigate and compare the self-medication and associated risk factors between online pharmacies and community pharmacies. Moreover, regulatory bodies need to make and implement changes to the regulations that govern the sale and use of medications during COVID-19.","Jairoun, Ammar Abdulrahman; Al-Hemyari, Sabaa Saleh; Abdulla, Naseem Mohammed; El-Dahiyat, Faris; Jairoun, Maimona; Al-Tamimi, Saleh Karamah; Babar, Zaheer-Ud-Din",J Pharm Policy Pract,,219

499746,Formalizing the profession's commitment to preventing violence,2020,"OBJECTIVE: In this study we compare the amino acid and codon sequence of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using different statistics programs to understand their characteristics. Specifically, we are interested in how differences in the amino acid and codon sequence can lead to different incubation periods and outbreak periods. Our initial question was to compare SARS-CoV-2 to different viruses in the coronavirus family using BLAST program of NCBI and machine learning algorithms. RESULTS: The result of experiments using BLAST, Apriori and Decision Tree has shown that SARS-CoV-2 had high similarity with SARS-CoV while having comparably low similarity with MERS-CoV. We decided to compare the codons of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV to see the difference. Though the viruses are very alike according to BLAST and Apriori experiments, SVM proved that they can be effectively classified using non-linear kernels. Decision Tree experiment proved several remarkable properties of SARS-CoV-2 amino acid sequence that cannot be found in MERS-CoV amino acid sequence. The consequential purpose of this paper is to minimize the damage on humanity from SARS-CoV-2. Hence, further studies can be focused on the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 virus with other viruses that also can be transmitted during latent periods.","Huh, Jung Eun; Han, Seunghee; Yoon, Taeseon",BMC Res Notes,,219

507661,"Characterizing Weibo Social Media Posts From Wuhan, China During the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Content Analysis",2020,"BACKGROUND: Depression affects people feeling to be anxious, worried, and restless. They also lose interest in activities, concentrating and appetite, they finally may attempt suicide. Depression is the second chronic disease, as a source of the global burden of disease, after heart disease. Its prevalence elevated seven times during the COVID-19. AIM: The current study was designed to evaluate camphor neuroprotective role against rats' ciprofloxacin-induced depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Depression was induced by administration of ciprofloxacin (50 mg/kg; orally) for 21 days. Wister albino male rats were divided into five groups. Group I (normal control): rats were given normal saline. Group II: rats received camphor (10 mg/kg; i.p.) for 21 days. Group III (depression control): rats received ciprofloxacin only. Groups IV and V: rats received camphor (5 and 10 mg/kg; i.p.) for 21 days concurrent with ciprofloxacin. Behavior tests as forced swimming test, activity cage, and rotarod were estimated. Oxidative stress and antioxidant biomarkers as malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), catalase, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) besides inflammatory biomarkers as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) as well as neurotransmitters were determined. Finally, histopathological examination was done. RESULTS: Camphor increased catalase and Nrf-2 activities, decreased NO, MDA, TNF-&#945;, TLR4 serum levels, and elevating brain contents of serotonin, dopamine, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and P190-RHO GTP protein with normal neuronal cells of the frontal cortex. CONCLUSION: Camphor has neuroprotective effect via modulation of Nrf-2 and TLR4 against ciprofloxacin-induced depression in rats.","Salama, Abeer; Mahmoud, Hend Abd-AlHakim; Kandeil, Mohamed Ahmed; Khalaf, Marwa Mahmoud",Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,,219

In this prospective study, non-hematological cancer patients hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19 at our institution from 1st March to 30th April 2020, were evaluated daily for VTE complications during their hospital stay, and after discharge until 30th June 2020. Furthermore, Doppler ultrasound of lower limbs was routinely performed in asymptomatic patients based on D-dimer levels and current active cancer therapy. The primary outcome of this study was the cumulative incidence of VTE. Secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of bleeding and mortality. A total of 58 hospitalized non-hematological cancer patients and confirmed COVID-19 were identified. Median follow-up since initial symptoms of COVID-19 was 91 days (IQR 19-104). Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in three (5%) patients. Symptomatic catheter-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was observed in one patient. Doppler ultrasound of lower limbs was done in 11 asymptomatic patients, showing distal DVT in two of them (18%). The cumulative incidence of VTE on day 14 after admission was 10%, without new VTE events after hospital discharge and up to 90 days follow-up. No bleeding complication was observed. Seventeen patients (29%) died in the first 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Four patients died after discharge due to malignancy progression. The cumulative incidence of VTE in non-hematological cancer patients under active treatment was 10% at day 14 after admission, with no further new events in the following 12 weeks.","Paredes-Ruiz, Diana; Gómez-Cuervo, Covadonga; Gómez-Martín, Carlos; Sánchez-Guerrero, Ángel; González-Olmedo, Jesús; López-López, Flora; Bover-Larroya, Mateo; Yarza-Barrio, Ramón; Jara-Casas, Diego Dimas; Castelo-Laureiro, Alicia; Revilla-Ostolaza, Yolanda; Paz-Ares, Luis; Lumbreras-Bermejo, Carlos; Díaz-Pedroche, Carmen",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,219

METHODS: To this end, a population-based study, in the province of Udine (466,700 inhabitants, with age > 15 years old, Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy) was planned. The primary outcome was the prevalence of COVID-19 in the first two months of the outbreak. All the rheumatic patients treated with biologic agents or small molecules in the last 6 months in our province were included (N=1051). RESULTS: From February 29 to April 25, 2020, 4 adult patients (4/1051, i.e. 3.8/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.5-9.7/1000) were registered as swab test positive by PCR for COVID-19. Overall, a total of 47/1051 (4,5%) cases were tested for COVID-19 by PCR in the same period, and 15 of them due to symptoms compatible with COVID-19. In the general population, the prevalence was 937 cases/466700 (2/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.9-2.1/1000, p value=0.33, chi square test), and 20,179/466,700 (4.3%) swab tests for COVID-19 were performed.. CONCLUSION: The risk of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients under biologic agents or small molecules does not appear different from that observed in the general population. Patients should be informed to safely proceed with their treatment and follow the rules for self-protection to COVID-19.","Quartuccio, Luca; Valent, Francesca; Pasut, Enrico; Tascini, Carlo; Vita, Salvatore De",,,219

522042,A causal not casual approach to coronavirus disease 19. Tracing the roots of novel virus,2021,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide pandemic situations drive countries into high healthcare costs and dangerous conditions. Hospital occupancy rates and medical expenses increase dramatically. Real-time remote health monitoring and surveillance systems with IoT assisted eHealth equipment play important roles in such pandemic situations. To prevent the spread of a pandemic is as crucial as treating the infected patients. The COVID-19 pandemic is the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We propose a surveillance system especially for coronavirus pandemic with IoT applications and an inter-WBAN geographic routing algorithm. In this study, coronavirus symptoms such as respiration rate, body temperature, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate can be monitored and the social distance with 'mask-wearing status' of persons can be displayed with proposed IoT software (Node-RED, InfluxDB, and Grafana). RESULTS: The geographic routing algorithm is compared with AODV in outdoor areas according to delivery ratio, delay for priority node, packet loss ratio and bit error rate. The results obtained showed that the geographic routing algorithm is more successful for the proposed architecture. CONCLUSION: The results show that the use of WBAN technology, geographic routing algorithm, and IoT applications helps to achieve a realistic and meaningful surveillance system with better statistical data.","Savasci Sen, Seda; Cicioglu, Murtaza; Çalhan, Ali",J Biomed Inform,,219

522688,"COVID-19 and Lockdown: Impact on Mental Health Among the Residents of Assam, India",2020,"Clozapine is the only available treatment for refractory schizophrenia but its use involves frequent physical contact with healthcare workers for the purpose of mandatory blood monitoring. During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients taking clozapine will be self-isolating to reduce the risk of infection, not least because these patients are at high risk of serious illness and fatality because of high rates of diabetes, obesity and pulmonary disease and an increased risk of pneumonia. Problems may also arise because both clozapine-induced myocarditis and neutropenic sepsis share signs and symptoms with COVID-19 (fever, chest pain, dyspnoea, etc.). We recommend decreasing the frequency of physical contacts by extending the blood monitoring interval to 12 weeks in those patients taking clozapine for more than 1 year. To distinguish COVID-19 from clozapine-related physical adverse effects, we suggest an urgent antigen test alongside a full blood count. In those taking clozapine who develop COVID-19, we suggest continuing with clozapine whenever possible (even during ventilation), reducing the dose if necessary in line with blood assay results. Blood monitoring should continue but clozapine should only cease if there is a significant fall in neutrophils (COVID-19 is linked to lymphopenia but not neutropenia). To protect against the likelihood and severity of respiratory infection, we recommend the use of vitamin D in all clozapine patients. Initiation of clozapine is likely to remain problematic while the risk of infection remains, given the degree of physical contact required to assure safety.","Gee, Siobhan; Gaughran, Fiona; MacCabe, James; Shergill, Sukhi; Whiskey, Eromona; Taylor, David",Ther.

Methods Undergraduate students (N = 34) participated in a 4-week mindfulness curriculum embedded within a college course, while a control group (N = 35) taking a different course did not. Notably, the intervention coincided with the start of a state-wide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Despite the additional external stress, there was a significant main effect and a significant interaction between the intervention and time for state mindfulness, (the treatment group experienced increased state mindfulness). There was a significant main effect (higher for the control group) on coronavirus worry and a significant interaction between the intervention and time for perceived stress, with the treatment/control group experiencing decreased/increased stress over time. There was also a significant interaction between the intervention and time for sleep problems with the intervention group experiencing declines in sleep problems over time and also being more likely to experience optimal amounts of sleep over time. Conclusions The Koru intervention effectively increased state mindfulness, decreased stress, and improved sleep, suggesting that it is robust even under extremely stressful conditions. This study adds to the growing evidence that MBIs can play an important role in addressing rising concerns regarding the mental health of college students.","Smit, Brandon Stavrulaki Euthemia",Mindfulness,,219

This study describes COVID-19 morbidity and mortality by ethnic group, represented by Arab and Jewish localities in Israel, during the different waves of the outbreak and addresses sociocultural aspects of the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective national archive study was conducted in Israel. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Ministry of Health's database, including daily information on Arab, Jewish or mixed localities, from February 2020 to February 2021. RESULTS: During the first wave of the pandemic, the incidence of COVID-19 in Arab compared with Jewish localities was 67% lower and mortality was 85% lower, in addition to lower rates of severe disease requiring hospitalisation. During the second and third waves, these trends reversed, with the proportion of positive tests, incidence and mortality in Arab localities reaching and then surpassing rates in Jewish localities. By September 2020, COVID-19 mortality was twice as high in Arab compared with Jewish localities. CONCLUSIONS: After low morbidity during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, a surge in infections occurred in the Arab population during subsequent waves, to match and surpass the high incidence seen in the Jewish population. This unique pattern highlights the changing experiences of a minority group as the pandemic progressed and demonstrates how COVID-19 exacerbates existing disparities.","Saban, M.; Myers, V.; Peretz, G.; Avni, S.; Wilf-Miron, R.",Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.07.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350621002870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34487867/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350621002870,219

Already benefitting from an elegant detection mechanism, fast assay time, and low reaction temperature, these assays can be further advanced via integration with powerful, digital‐based detection. Thus motivated, the first digital CRISPR/Cas‐assisted assay—coined digitization‐enhanced CRISPR/Cas‐assisted one‐pot virus detection (deCOViD)—is developed and applied toward SARS‐CoV‐2 detection. deCOViD is realized through tuning and discretizing a one‐step, fluorescence‐based, CRISPR/Cas12a‐assisted reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay into sub‐nanoliter reaction wells within commercially available microfluidic digital chips. The uniformly elevated digital concentrations enable deCOViD to achieve qualitative detection in <15 min and quantitative detection in 30 min with high signal‐to‐background ratio, broad dynamic range, and high sensitivity—down to 1 genome equivalent (GE) µL(−1) of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA and 20 GE µL(−1) of heat‐inactivated SARS‐CoV‐2, which outstrips its benchtop‐based counterpart and represents one of the fastest and most sensitive CRISPR/Cas‐assisted SARS‐CoV‐2 detection to date. Moreover, deCOViD can detect RNA extracts from clinical samples. Taken together, deCOViD opens a new avenue for advancing CRISPR/Cas‐assisted assays and combating the COVID‐19 pandemic and beyond.","Park, Joon Soo; Hsieh, Kuangwen; Chen, Liben; Kaushik, Aniruddha; Trick, Alexander Y.; Wang, Tza‐Huei",Adv Sci (Weinh),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717855/; https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202003564,219

Endemic diseases such as chronic hepatitis, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections affect millions of individuals and widen health disparities. Additional concerns include health-care-associated and foodborne infections—both of which have been targets of broad prevention efforts, with success in some areas, yet major challenges remain. Although substantial progress in reduction of the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases has been made, continued cases and outbreaks of these diseases persist, driven by various contributing factors. Worldwide, emerging and reemerging infections continue to challenge prevention and control strategies while the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance needs urgent action. An important priority for control of infectious disease is to ensure that scientific and technological advances in molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics are well integrated into public health.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in lockdown measures limiting social contact. The UK public are worried about the impact of these measures on mental health outcomes. Understanding the prevalence and predictors of loneliness at this time is a priority issue for research. METHOD: The study employed a cross-sectional online survey design. Baseline data collected between March 23rd and April 24th 2020 from UK adults in the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study were analysed (N = 1964, 18–87 years, M = 37.11, SD = 12.86, 70% female). Logistic regression analysis examined the influence of sociodemographic, social, health and COVID-19 specific factors on loneliness. RESULTS: The prevalence of loneliness was 27% (530/1964). Risk factors for loneliness were younger age group (OR: 4.67–5.31), being separated or divorced (OR: 2.29), scores meeting clinical criteria for depression (OR: 1.74), greater emotion regulation difficulties (OR: 1.04), and poor quality sleep due to the COVID-19 crisis (OR: 1.30). Higher levels of social support (OR: 0.92), being married/co-habiting (OR: 0.35) and living with a greater number of adults (OR: 0.87) were protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of loneliness during the initial phase of lockdown were high. Risk factors were not specific to the COVID-19 crisis. Findings suggest that supportive interventions to reduce loneliness should prioritise younger people and those with mental health symptoms. Improving emotion regulation and sleep quality, and increasing social support may be optimal initial targets to reduce the impact of COVID-19 regulations on mental health outcomes.","Groarke, Jenny M.; Berry, Emma; Graham-Wisener, Lisa; McKenna-Plumley, Phoebe E.; McGlinchey, Emily; Armour, Cherie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970764/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239698,219

RESULTS: During March and April 2020, our team at the University Hospital of Zurich performed 3 out-of-centre ECMO implants at different peripheral hospitals. The implants were performed without any complications. The patients were transported by ambulance or helicopter. Good preparation and selection of the required supplies are the keys to success. The implant should be performed by a well-trained, seasoned ECMO team, because options are limited in most peripheral hospitals.

604280,"The Mental Health Impact of 2019-nCOVID on Healthcare Workers From North-Eastern Piedmont, Italy. Focus on Burnout",2021-05-11,"Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a severe adverse effect of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 COVID-19 vaccine (Vaxzevria) and COVID-19 vaccine Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S), and associated with unusual thrombosis. VITT is caused by anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies activating platelets through their FcγRIIa receptors. Antibodies activating platelets through FcγRIIa receptors have also been identified in COVID-19 patients. These findings raise concern that vaccination-induced antibodies against anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein cause thrombosis by cross-reacting with PF4. Immunogenic epitopes of PF4 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were compared using in-silico prediction tools and 3D-modelling. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and PF4 share at least one similar epitope. Reactivity of purified anti-PF4 antibodies from patients with VITT was tested against recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. However, none of the affinity-purified anti-PF4 antibodies from 14 VITT patients cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Sera from 222 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients from five European centers were tested by PF4/heparin ELISA and PF4-dependent platelet activation assays. We found anti-PF4 antibodies in 19 of 222 (8.6%) COVID-19 patient sera. However, only four showed weak to moderate platelet activation in the presence of PF4, and none of these patients developed thrombotic complications. Among 10 of 222 (4.5%) COVID-19 patients with thrombosis, none showed PF4-dependent platelet-activating antibodies. In conclusion, antibodies against PF4 induced by vaccination do not cross-react with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, indicating that the intended vaccine-induced immune response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is not the trigger of VITT. PF4-reactive antibodies found in COVID-19 patients of the present study were not associated with thrombotic complications.","Greinacher, Andreas; Selleng, Kathleen; Mayerle, Julia; Palankar, Raghavendra; Wesche, Jan; Reiche, Sven; Aebischer, Andrea; Warkentin, Theodore E.; Muenchhoff, Maximilian; Hellmuth, Johannes C.; Keppler, Oliver T.; Duerschmied, Daniel; Lother, Achim; Rieg, Siegbert; Gawaz, Meinrad Paul; Mueller, Karin Anne Lydia; Scheer, Christian S.; Napp, Matthias; Hahnenkamp, Klaus; Lucchese, Guglielmo; Vogelgesang, Antje; Flöel, Agnes; Lovreglio, Piero; Stufano, Angela; Marschalek, Rolf; Thiele, Thomas",Blood,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497121013707?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280256/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006497121013707; https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2021012938,219

We report the design and implementation of a hospital-onset COVID-19 infection (HOCI) surveillance system for an acute healthcare setting to target prevention interventions. METHODS: The study took place in a large teaching hospital group in London, UK. All patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 4(th) March and 14(th) April 2020 were included. Utilising data routinely collected through electronic healthcare systems we developed a novel surveillance system for determining and reporting HOCI incidence and providing real-time network analysis. We provided daily reports on incidence and trends over time to support HOCI investigation, and generated geo-temporal reports using network analysis to interrogate admission pathways for common epidemiological links to infer transmission chains. By working with stakeholders the reports were co-designed for end users. RESULTS: Real-time surveillance reports revealed: changing rates of HOCI throughout the course of the COVID-19 epidemic; key wards fuelling probable transmission events; HOCIs over-represented in particular specialities managing high-risk patients; the importance of integrating analysis of individual prior pathways; and the value of co-design in producing data visualisation. Our surveillance system can effectively support national surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Through early analysis of the novel surveillance system we have provided a description of HOCI rates and trends over time using real-time shifting denominator data. We demonstrate the importance of including the analysis of patient pathways and networks in characterising risk of transmission and targeting infection control interventions.","Price, James Richard; Mookerjee, Siddharth; Dyakova, Eleonora; Myall, Ashleigh; Leung, Wendy; Weiße, Andrea Yeong; Shersing, Yeeshika; Brannigan, Eimear Therese; Galletly, Tracey; Muir, David; Randell, Paul; Davies, Frances; Bolt, Frances; Barahona, Mauricio; Otter, Jonathan Ashley; Holmes, Alison H",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32634822/,219

The present research examined in a cohort study sample of young Swiss men how their gambling activities and gambling-related problems differed across the spectrum from offline to online gambling. Sample: A general-population based sample from the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF), consisting of 5,352 young Swiss men (mean age 28.26 years old). Measures: The spectrum from exclusively offline to almost exclusively online (>90% of gambling money spent online) gambling was measured using one question about the proportion of gambling money spent online. Total money gambled and time spent on gambling were also assessed. GD severity (range 0–9) was measured using items reflecting the nine DSM-5 GD criteria. The number of gambling-related problems (e.g., financial difficulties, range 0–10), other addictive disorders and mental health problems were also inquired about. Methods: We estimated a generalised linear model using a count model (negative binomial link function) for GD severity and gambling-related problems associated with the amounts and proportions of money gambled online and offline. Results: The number of GD criteria were associated with money gambled online (IRR [95%CI] = 2.81 [2.43, 3.24]) and offline (IRR = 2.68 [2.40, 3.00]). This was also found for the number of gambling-related problems (IRR = 2.43 [2.13, 2.79] and IRR = 2.89 [2.59, 3.23]). Compared with exclusively-offline gamblers, mixed gamblers (26–90% of money gambled online) showed the highest levels of GD symptoms and gambling-related problems, followed by the almost-exclusively-online gamblers (≥91% money gambled online) and, overall, these associations were still significant after adjustment for overall involvement in gambling (time spent and money gambled). Levels of other addictive disorders and mental health problems were higher among mixed gamblers than among offline-only gamblers, but levels among almost-exclusively-online gamblers were not. Conclusions: Symptoms of gambling disorder and gambling related problems are highest among gamblers engaging in both offline and online gambling. Prevention efforts need to target the combination of offline and online gambling.","Marmet, Simon; Studer, Joseph; Wicki, Matthias; Khazaal, Yasser; Gmel, Gerhard",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366934/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.703118,219

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Singapore implemented large-scale institutional isolation units called Community Care Facilities (CCFs) to combat the outbreak in the community by housing low-risk COVID-19 patients from April to August 2020. The CCFs were created rapidly by converting existing public spaces and used a protocolized system, augmented by telemedicine to enable a low health care worker–patient ratio (98 health care workers for 3200 beds), to operate these unique facilities. In the first month, a total of 3758 patients were admitted to 4 halls, 4929 in-house medical consults occurred, 136 patients were transferred to a hospital, 1 patient died 2 weeks after discharge, and no health care workers became infected.

608164,To wear or not to wear… that is the question! The need for ‘one voice’ in implementing health protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-06-30,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low back pain is one of the most common conditions occurring in the golfing population. Many approaches have been utilized throughout the years to address this condition including the concept of regional interdependence. The purpose of this case report is to describe the evaluation process and treatment approach of a golfer with low back pain using the principles of regional interdependence. CASE DESCRIPTION: A thirty-year-old male with right-sided low back pain was evaluated using a comprehensive approach including golf specific movement screening and a swing evaluation. The patient had mobility restrictions in his thoracic spine and hips that appeared to be contributing to a hypermobility in the lower lumbar spine. Based on the evaluation, he was placed into the treatment-based classification (TBC) of stabilization but would also benefit from mobilization/manipulation techniques. OUTCOMES: After seven visits over a four-week span, the patient’s mobility and core stability both improved and he was able to play golf and workout pain free. His outcome measures also improved, including the revised Oswestry Disability index from 26% disabled to 10%, the Fear Avoidance Behavior Questionnaire (FABQ) Work from 10/42 to 3/42, and the FABQ Physical Activity from 19/24 to 6/24. DISCUSSION: Evaluating and developing a plan of care to address low back pain in an avid golfer can be challenging as a variety of demands are placed on the spine during the movement. This case report describes the evaluation process and treatment approach to specifically target the demands that are required during the golf swing. Utilizing a targeted approach that includes golf specific movement screening and a swing evaluation can help guide the therapist in their treatment and improve the patient’s outcome.

609272,"A cross-sectional survey of a public, evidence-based multimodal program for cognitive health in older adults",2021-09-16,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread worldwide. In the absence of any antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies, the disease is spreading at an alarming rate. A possibility of a resurgence of COVID-19 in places where lockdowns have already worked is also developing. Thus, for controlling COVID-19, vaccines may be a better option than drugs. An mRNA-based anti-COVID-19 candidate vaccine has entered a phase 1 clinical trial. However, its efficacy and potency have to be evaluated and validated. Since vaccines have high failure rates, as an alternative, we are presenting a new, designed multi-peptide subunit-based epitope vaccine against COVID-19. The recombinant vaccine construct comprises an adjuvant, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), helper T-lymphocyte (HTL), and B-cell epitopes joined by linkers. The computational data suggest that the vaccine is non-toxic, non-allergenic, thermostable, with the capability to elicit a humoral and cell-mediated immune response. The stabilization of the vaccine construct is validated with molecular dynamics simulation studies. This unique vaccine is made up of 33 highly antigenic epitopes from three proteins that have a prominent role in host-receptor recognition, viral entry, and pathogenicity. We advocate this vaccine must be synthesized and tested urgently as a public health priority.","Kalita, Parismita; Padhi, AdityaK.; Zhang, Kam Y.J.; Tripathi, Timir",Microb Pathog,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401020305234?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401020305234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376359/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104236,219

To increase the evidence base supporting specific methods to measure social interaction, we compared data from self-reported contact surveys and wearable proximity sensors from a cohort of schoolchildren in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Although the number and type of contacts recorded by each participant differed between the two methods, we found good correspondence between the two methods in aggregate measures of age-specific interactions. Fewer, but longer, contacts were reported in surveys, relative to the generally short proximal interactions captured by wearable sensors. When adjusted for expectations of proportionate mixing, though, the two methods produced highly similar, assortative age-mixing matrices. These aggregate mixing matrices, when used in simulation, resulted in similar estimates of risk of infection by age. While proximity sensors and survey methods may not be interchangeable for capturing individual contacts, they can generate highly correlated data on age-specific mixing patterns relevant to the dynamics of respiratory virus transmission.","Grantz, K.

But is science up to the task? This is far from self‐evident. The demands on science in times of crisis run counter to the values of good, normal science. Crisis science needs to be fast, univocal, personalized, and direct, while normal science is slow, contentious, collective, and sensitive to complexity. Science can only play its atypical role if it is staged in the public arena. Some patterns of staging stand out: personalization, visualization, and connection to lived experiences. So far, the staging of science has been successful, but it is fragile. The COVID‐19 crisis shows the potential of well‐staged forms of alliance between science and policy, but when the general assumption is that scientists will “solve” societal “problems,” the staging of science has gone too far.","Van Dooren, Wouter; Noordegraaf, Mirko",Public Adm Rev,https://doi.org/10.1111/puar.13219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836435/,219
619343,COVID-19 transmission: a rapid systematic review of current knowledge,2021-04-29,"We recently reported the development of the first African green monkey (AGM) model for COVID-19 based on a combined liquid intranasal (i.n.) and intratracheal (i.t.) exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we followed up on this work by assessing an i.n. particle only route of exposure using the LMA mucosal atomization device (MAD). Six AGMs were infected with SARS-CoV-2; three animals were euthanized near the peak stage of virus replication (day 5) and three animals were euthanized during the early convalescence period (day 34). All six AGMs supported robust SARS-CoV-2 replication and developed respiratory disease. Evidence of coagulation dysfunction as noted by a transient increases in aPTT and circulating levels of fibrinogen was observed in all AGMs. The level of SARS-CoV-2 replication and lung pathology was not quite as pronounced as previously reported with AGMs exposed by the combined i.n. and i.t. routes; however, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in nasal swabs of some animals as late as day 15 and rectal swabs as late as day 28 after virus challenge. Of particular importance to this study, all three AGMs that were followed until the early convalescence stage of COVID-19 showed substantial lung pathology at necropsy as evidenced by multifocal chronic interstitial pneumonia and increased collagen deposition in alveolar walls despite the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 in any of the lungs of these animals. These findings are consistent with human COVID-19 further demonstrating that the AGM faithfully reproduces the human condition.","Cross, Robert W; Agans, Krystle N; Prasad, Abhishek N; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Woolsey, Courtney; Deer, Daniel J; Dobias, Natalie S; Geisbert, Joan B; Fenton, Karla A; Geisbert, Thomas W",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818211/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-50023/v2,219

Participants 15 adults with severe, long-term physical disabilities. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Themes associated with COVID related responses extracted from individual narratives. Results Length of interviews averaged one hour and forty minutes. Six themes emerged from the data. Overarching factors were fear, feelings of isolation, and a sense of being invisibility. These factors were experienced as a result of barriers to health and healthcare, home care assistance, and access to resources. Conclusions Findings expand existing knowledge and offer new insights into how the pandemic impacted physical and psychological health of adults with long-term physical disabilities and made visible the risks that they must contend with as a result of inadequate or insufficient accommodations. They help elucidate how race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status can differentially impact their lives and further marginalize populations that are “always already” vulnerable.

622369,"Cross-sectional survey on public health informatics workforce in China: issues, developments and the future",2015-04-19,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious disease caused by a coronavirus. Screening to detect a potential SARS infected person plays an important role in preventing the spread of SARS. The use of infrared thermal imaging cameras has been proposed as a noninvasive, speedy, cost effective and fairly accurate means for mass blind screening of potential SARS infected persons. Infrared thermography provides a digital image showing temperature patterns. This has been previously utilized in the detection of inflammation and nerve dysfunctions. It is believed that IR cameras can potentially be used to detect subjects with fever, the cardinal symptom of SARS, and avian influenza. The accuracy of the infrared system can, however, be affected by human, environmental, and equipment variables. It is also limited by the fact that the thermal imager measures the skin temperature and not the core body temperature. As known, the body determines a temperature as its so‐called “set point” at any one time during the body temperature regulation. Fever happens if the hypothalamus detects pyrogens and then raises the set point. The time course of a typical fever can be divided into three stages. When the fever initiates, the body attempts to raise its temperature but vasoconstriction occurs to prevent heat loss through the skin. With this reason, some individuals at this stage of fever (at the rising slope and immediately after fever begins or falling slope after the fever breaks) will not be detected by the scanner if it is not designed to detect subject at the plateau of the fever (with her/his high core temperature) in particular. This paper aims to study the effectiveness of infrared systems for its application in mass blind screening to detect subjects with elevated body temperature. For this application, it is critical for thermal imagers to be able to identify febrile from normal subjects accurately. Minimizing the number of false positive and false negative cases, improves the efficiency of the screening stations. False negative results should be avoided at all costs, as letting a SARS infected person through the screening process may result in potentially catastrophic results. Various statistical methods such as linear regression, Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis, and neural networks based classification were used to analyze the temperature data collected from various sites on the face on both the frontal and side profiles. Two important conclusions were drawn from the analysis: the best region on the face to obtain temperature readings and the optimal preset threshold temperature for the thermal imager. To conclude, the current research application will remain an interest and useful for reference by both local and overseas manufacturers of thermal scanners, users, and various government and private establishments. As elevation of body temperature is a common presenting symptom for many illnesses including infectious diseases, thermal imagers are useful tools for mass screening of body temperature not only for SARS but also during other public health crisis where widespread transmission of infection is a concern.","Ng, Eddie Y.‐K.",Med Phys,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15719959/,219
624460,Lessons Learned From an Analysis of the Emergency Medical Services’ COVID-19 Drive-Through Testing Facilities in Israel,2021-02-16,"Introduction: Globally, more people are spending time on the Internet and gaming since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Consequently, concerns about developing behavioral addiction of adolescents have been raised. Such risk could be greater for adolescents in South Korea where the majority of adolescents have access to the Internet and own a smartphone. In fact, statistics indicate that Korean youths are spending significantly more time on the Internet and gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies on the patterns of time spent on the Internet and Internet gaming show inconsistent results. The aim of this study is to investigate the latent profiles of the Internet and Internet game usage among adolescents in South Korea. Method: Data from a national survey on elementary and middle school students across South Korea were used. The sample consists of 3,149 respondents, and 2,984 responses were analyzed after removing missing responses. Latent profile analysis was performed to investigate the number of latent profiles for the Internet and Internet game usage time. To validate the profiles, differences in problematic gaming behavior, sex, and neuroticism were examined. Results: Seven profiles were found: Casual User, Moderate User, Smartphone User, Internet User, PC Internet Gamer, Heavy User, and Excessive User. Validation of the profiles indicated differences in problematic gaming behavior, sex, and neuroticism among selected profiles. Conclusion: This study presented different profiles of the Internet and Internet game usage among adolescents in South Korea. Profiles with higher game usage time scored higher in problematic game use compared to other profiles. Males were more likely to be in the profiles with high gaming time, and females were more likely to be in Internet and Smartphone User profiles. The results indicate that Internet and Internet gaming usage patterns could be classified by the type of device used and the content of the Internet.","Kim, Dongil; Lee, Junwon; Nam, JeeEun Karin",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630178/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.714301,219

Scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) has forced them to conserve and reuse some of their PPE. The efficacy of these practices in preventing transmission of COVID-19 from patients to first responders is unclear. There are limited data on the prevalence of antibodies specific for COVID-19 exposure in these front-line workers. AIM: Our objective was to determine the prevalence of positive immunoglobulin G antibody specific to COVID-19 among first responders in Lubbock, Texas. METHODS: Blood samples were collected on 683 asymptomatic first responders who work in Lubbock, Texas and the surrounding area, after informed consents were signed. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was measured using Abbott’s SARS-CoV-2 IgG Reagent Kit in combination with the SARS-CoV-2 IgG Calibrator Kit on the Abbott’s ARCHITECT i1000SR analyzer. RESULTS: The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was 0.73%, five of the 683 participants tested positive. Four of those who tested positive had no known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure without adequate PPE. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of IgG specific antibodies to COVID-19 was much lower than expected in our study population despite high sensitivity and specificity of the test reagent. The most likely explanations for this finding include limited exposure, inadequate time for a IgG response, possible clearance of COVID-19 infection locally by the respiratory tract IgA defense system without eliciting a systemic IgG response, and short persistence of IgG antibodies in mild or asymptomatic cases.","Iwuji, Kenneth; Islam, Ebtesam; Berdine, Gilbert; Nugent, Kenneth; Test, Victor; Tijerina, Amanda",J Prim Care Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33161808/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132720971390,219

METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluated 15 children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children and adolescents from a single institution in Adana, Turkey. RESULTS: The patients presented in a seasonal distribution, with 73.3%: (11/15) presenting in winter or spring. The majority of patients (13/15, 86.7%) had a history of acute febrile illness 2 to 40 days before presentation, and five children had serologic evidence of specific triggers: mycoplasma (2 children), influenza-A (H1N1) (1 child), or Epstein-Barr virus. All children were treated with a standard protocol of 3 to 5 days of intravenous administration of methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin for patients who continued to deteriorate. Oseltamivir and clarithromycin were administered in patients with influenza-A (H1N1) and mycoplasma according to the serology. In 13 patients, all neurologic signs and symptoms resolved after treatment. Only one patient was left with severe neurologic sequelae and another child had recurrent attacks and was ultimately diagnosed with possible multiple sclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: The present series demonstrates that acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children occurs predominantly in winter or spring and often follows an upper respiratory tract illness for those along the southern coast of Anatolia (Mediterranean region). Early treatment with immunomodulative agents is recommended and is likely to result in a favorable outcome or full recovery.

633547,Pandemics and prayer: The impact of cattle markets and animal sacrifices during the muslim Eid festival on COVID‐19 transmission and public health,2020-08-20,"Due to the unforeseen turn of events, our world has undergone another global pandemic from a highly contagious novel coronavirus named COVID-19. The novel virus inflames the lungs similarly to Pneumonia, making it challenging to diagnose. Currently, the common standard to diagnose the virus's presence from an individual is using a molecular real-time Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test from fluids acquired through nasal swabs. Such a test is difficult to acquire in most underdeveloped countries with a few experts that can perform the test. As a substitute, the widely available Chest X-Ray (CXR) became an alternative to rule out the virus. However, such a method does not come easy as the virus still possesses unknown characteristics that even experienced radiologists and other medical experts find difficult to diagnose through CXRs. Several studies have recently used computer-aided methods to automate and improve such diagnosis of CXRs through Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on computer vision and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), which some require heavy processing costs and other tedious methods to produce. Therefore, this work proposed the Fused-DenseNet-Tiny, a lightweight DCNN model based on a densely connected neural network (DenseNet) truncated and concatenated.

634506,The use of mobile phones for the prevention and control of arboviral diseases: a scoping review,2021-01-09,"The purpose of the study was to obtain an external coating based on nanoparticles of ZnO, carvacrol, and geraniol that could be active against viruses such as SARS-Co-V2. Additionally, the synergistic effect of the chosen substances in coatings was analyzed. The goal of the study was to measure the possible antibacterial activity of the coatings obtained. Testing antiviral activity with human pathogen viruses, such as SARS-Co-V2, requires immense safety measures. Bacteriophages such as phi 6 phage represent good surrogates for the study of airborne viruses. The results of the study indicated that the ZC1 and ZG1 coatings containing an increased amount of geraniol or carvacrol and a very small amount of nanoZnO were found to be active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is also important that a synergistic effect between these active substances was noted. This explains why polyethylene (PE) films covered with the ZC1 or ZG1 coatings (as internal coatings) were found to be the best packaging materials to extend the quality and freshness of food products. The same coatings may be used as the external coatings with antiviral properties. The ZC1 and ZG1 coatings showed moderate activity against the phi 6 phage that has been selected as a surrogate for viruses such as coronaviruses. It can be assumed that coatings ZG1 and ZC1 will also be active against SARS-CoV-2 that is transmitted via respiratory droplets.","Mizielińska, Małgorzata; Nawrotek, Paweł; Stachurska, Xymena; Ordon, Magdalena; Bartkowiak, Artur",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572073/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22041717,219

The viruses causing acute bronchiolitis in the community were hRSV (42%), rhinovirus (19.5%), coronavirus (8%), PIV (3.5%), and hMPV (2.5%). In 53.7% of the cases, hRSV infected infants (86.9%), 53.7% being less than 6 months of age. Of the hRSV cases, 48.2% were detected in November and December and 44.5% in January and February. The hRSV epidemic started the 1st or 2nd week of October but it varied from one year to another and from one region to another. hRSV acute bronchiolitis increased from 261 cases in epidemics from 1999–2003 to 341 cases from 2004–2009. Rhinoviruses gave acute bronchiolitis in 38.4% of cases. A rate of 54.6% of viruses was detected in September and October and 38.5% in March and April. A total of 34.2% of infected infants were under 6 months of age, 37.8% between 6 months and 2 years, and 19.5% were between 2 and 5 years old. hMPV epidemics coincided with hRSV epidemics, but they accounted for one-sixth the number of cases. HMPV infected infants (74%) who were older than those infected with hRSV, and the diagnosis was bronchiolitis (59%) and pneumonia (17%). PIV infections (about 100 cases per year) included PIV3 (62.7%), PIV1 (25.3%), and PIV2 (7.3%). PIV1 infections occurred every 2 years in the fall. PIV3 infections were observed every year during the fall and winter, with peaks of infections in the spring in the years without PIV1. There were acute cases of bronchiolitis in 29.8% of PIV3 infections and 18.3% in PIV1 infections.","Freymuth, F.; Vabret, A.; Dina, J.; Cuvillon-Nimal, D.; Lubin, C.; Vaudecrane, A.; Guillois, B.; Gouarin, S.; Petitjean, J.; Lafaix-Delaire, F.; Brouard, J.",Arch Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcped.2010.05.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929693X10002290; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929693X10002290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20558050/,219

METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals. The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). RESULTS: A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (p < 0.001). Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases. The sQO-NS scores were significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p = 0.001). Among the 18.2% of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7% were hyposmic or anosmic. The early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0%. Females were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions than males (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in European COVID-19 patients, who may not have nasal symptoms. The sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the international scientific community as important symptoms of the COVID-19 infection.

In this work, we explored the previously uncharted reactivity of bis-chloropiperidines (B-CePs) towards RNA. We characterized at the molecular level the different adducts induced by the fast reacting compound B-CeP 1 with RNA. Following an approach based on solution thermal melting coupled with ESI mass spectrometry (STHEM-ESI), we proved the ability of B-CePs to induce inter-molecular cross-links between guanines in double stranded RNA. These results open the possibility of using B-CePs as structural probes for investigating higher-order structures, such as the kissing loop complex established by the dimerization initiation site (DIS) of the HIV-1 genome. We confirmed the potential of B-CePs to reveal the identity of RNA structures involved in long-range interactions, expecting to benefit the characterization of samples that are not readily amenable to traditional high-resolution techniques, and thus promoting the elucidation of pertinent RNA systems associated with old and new diseases.","Sosic, Alice; Göttlich, Richard; Fabris, Dan; Gatto, Barbara",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125908/; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab468,219

Since its discovery in 2003, few studies have addressed bovine kobuvirus (BKoV; a species of Aichivirus B) infections. BKoV has been reported in Europe, Asia, and South America, suggesting a worldwide distribution. To investigate the presence of BKoV in Egypt, 36 fecal specimens from diarrheic calves in two different Egyptian provinces (Cairo and Sharkia) were screened by RT-PCR and 24 (66.7%) were found positive for BKoV. RNA from one of the positive samples (BKoV/Egy-1/KY407744) was subjected to next-generation sequencing to determine the complete BKoV genome sequence. When compared to the only recorded BKoV genome sequence (BKoV/U-1/AB084788), the studied strain showed 94 amino acid (aa) substitutions through its entire polyprotein (2463 aa), one nucleotide (nt) insertion and one nt deletion in the 2B gene and 4-nt deletions in the UTRs (2 each). Additionally, five VP1 and seven 3D sequences were obtained from other samples by using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. A discrepancy in the phylogenetic topography of VP1 and 3D was observed, where the Egyptian VP1 sequences were classified as a distinct cluster within the proposed lineage 1 (genotype A), which also contained strains from the UK, Brazil, and Japan. While, the 3D sequences from Cairo were related to those of Chinese strains unlike Sharkia ones that were more closer to Korean strains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detection and genomic characterization of BKoV in Egypt or indeed Africa.

OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate reproducibility of the Thermo Scientific SureTect Salmonella species PCR Assay in a collaborative study using a challenging matrix, cocoa powder. To extend the scope of the method. METHOD: In the collaborative study, the candidate method was compared to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration/Bacteriological Analytical Manual (FDA/BAM) Chapter 5 Salmonella reference method. The candidate method used two PCR thermocyclers, the Applied Biosystems™ QuantStudio™ 5 Real-Time PCR instrument (QS5) and the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR instrument (7500 Fast). Fourteen participants from 9 laboratories located within the United States and Europe were solicited for the collaborative study, with 12 participants submitting valid data. Three levels of contamination were evaluated for each matrix. Statistical analysis was conducted according to the probability of detection (POD) statistical model. In addition, 11 matrix studies were performed comparing the candidate method to the FDA/BAM Chapter 5 or U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook (USDA FSIS MLG) 4.10 Isolation and Identification of Salmonella from Meat, Poultry, Pasteurized Egg, and Siluriformes (Fish) Products and Carcass and Environmental Sponges reference method. Nine of these matrices were also compared to the EN ISO 6579–1:2017/Amd.1:2020(E) Microbiology of the food chain—Horizontal method for the detection, enumeration and serotyping of Salmonella—Part 1: Detection of Salmonella spp.—AMENDMENT 1: Broader range of incubation temperatures, amendment to the status of Annex D, and correction of the composition of MSRV and SC reference method. RESULTS: In the collaborative study, the difference in laboratory results indicate equivalence between the candidate method and reference method for the matrix evaluated and the method demonstrated acceptable inter-laboratory reproducibility as determined in the collaborative evaluation. False positive and false negative rates were determined for the matrix and produced values of < 2%. The two PCR thermocyclers (QS5, 7500 Fast) performed equivalently. There were no result differences between candidate method confirmations and reference method confirmations. In the pre-collaborative matrix extension, the results from the matrix studies showed a comparable performance between the candidate method and the tested reference methods. CONCLUSION: Based on the data generated, the method demonstrated acceptable inter-laboratory reproducibility data and statistical analysis. HIGHLIGHTS: Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some participants had to be trained remotely. Additionally, 375 g cocoa powder is known to be a challenging matrix for PCR methods. No unusual cross-contamination or false positive/negative data was reported, highlighting the ease of use, reproducibility, and robustness of the method.","Bastin, Benjamin; Thompson, Wesley; Benzinger, M Joseph; Crowley, Erin S; Leonte, Ana-Maria; Vandoros, Evangelos J; Thomas, Daniel; Hughes, Annette; Crabtree, David; Evans, Katharine; Sohier, Daniele",J AOAC Int,https://doi.org/10.1093/jaoacint/qsab122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34586389/,219

In Brazil, there are higher rates of incidence and a downward trend in mortality in regions of greater socioeconomic development. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of age, period, and birth cohort on breast cancer mortality in women aged 20 years and older in the states of the Northeast Region of Brazil, an area of high socioeconomic vulnerability, from 1980 to 2019. METHODS: The death records were extracted from the DATASUS Mortality Information System website (Department of National Health Informatics) from the Ministry of Health of Brazil. Estimable functions were used to estimate the age-period and cohort models (APC) using the Epi library from the R statistical software version 6.4.1. RESULTS: The average breast cancer mortality rate for the period was 20.45 deaths per 100,000 women. The highest coefficients per 100,000 women were observed in the states of Pernambuco (21.09 deaths) and Ceará (20.85 deaths), and the lowest in Maranhão (13.58 deaths) and Piauí (15.43 deaths). In all of the locations, there was a progressive increase in mortality rates in individuals over 40 years of age, with higher rates in the last five-year period (2015–2019). There was an increase in the risk of death for the five-year period of the 2000s in relation to the reference period (1995–1999) in the Northeast region and in the states of Alagoas, Bahia, Maranhão, Paraíba, and Piauí. In addition, there was an increased risk of death for women born after the 1950s in all locations. CONCLUSION: The highest mortality rates in all five-year periods analyzed were observed in states with greater socioeconomic development, with an increase in mortality rates in the 2000s, and a higher risk of death in the younger cohorts.","Dantas de Araújo Santos Camargo, Juliana; dos Santos, Juliano; Simões, Taynãna César; de Carvalho, Jovanka Bittencourt Leite; Silva, Glauber Weder dos Santos; Dantas, Eder Samuel Oliveira; Rodrigues, Weverton Thiago da Silva; Freire, Flávio Henrique Miranda de Araújo; Meira, Karina Cardoso",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34388198/,219
638619,Wounded healers: a call for spiritual care towards healthcare professionals in time of COVID-19 pandemic,2020-12-22,"Terminal sialic acids on cell surface glycoconjugates can carry 9-O-acetyl esters. For technical reasons, it has previously been difficult to determine their precise distribution on different cell types. Using a recombinant soluble form of the Influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase as a probe for 9-O-acetylated sialic acids, we demonstrate here their preferential expression on the CD4 T cell lineage in normal B10.A mouse lymphoid organs. Of total thymocytes, 8–10% carry 9-O-acetylation; the great majority of these are the more mature PNA(−), HSA(−), and TCR(hi) medullary cells. While low levels of 9-O-acetylation are seen on some CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) and CD8 single positive (SP) cells, high levels are present primarily on 80– 85% of CD4 SP cells. Correlation with CD4 and CD8 levels suggests that 9-O-acetylation appears as an early differentiation marker as cells mature from the DP to the CD4 SP phenotype. This high degree of 9-O-acetylation is also present on 90–95% of peripheral spleen and lymph node CD4 T cells. In contrast, only a small minority of CD8 T cells and B cells show such levels of 9-O-acetylation. Among mature peripheral CD4 T lymphocytes, the highly O-acetylated cells are Mel 14(hi), CD44(lo), and CD45R(exon B)(hi), features typical of naive cells. Digestions with trypsin and O-sialoglycoprotease (OSGPase) and ELISA studies of lipid extracts indicate that the 9-O-acetylated sialic acids on peripheral CD4 T cells are predominantly on O-linked mucintype glycoproteins and to a lesser degree, on sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides). In contrast, sialic acids on mucin type molecules of CD8 T cells are not O-acetylated; instead these molecules mask the recognition of O-acetylated gangliosides that seem to be present at similar levels as on CD4 cells. The 9-O-acetylated gangliosides on mouse T cells are not bound by CD60 antibodies, which recognize O-acetylated gangliosides in human T cells. Tethering 9-O-acetylated mucins with the Influenza C probe with or without secondary cross-linking did not cause activation of CD4 T cells. However, activation by other stimuli including TCR ligation is associated with a substantial decrease in surface 9-O-acetylation, primarily in the mucin glycoprotein component. Thus, 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on cell surface mucins is a novel marker on CD4 T cells that appears on maturation and is modulated downwards upon activation.","Krishna, Murli; Varki, Ajit",J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9166429/,219

In Maryland and Washington, DC, United States, more than 2500 cases were reported within 3 weeks of the first COVID-19 detection in March 2020. We aimed to use genomic sequencing to understand the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — in the region. We analyzed 620 samples collected from the Johns Hopkins Health System during March 11–31, 2020, comprising 28.6% of the total cases in Maryland and Washington, DC. From these samples, we generated 114 complete viral genomes. Analysis of these genomes alongside a subsampling of over 1000 previously published sequences showed that the diversity in this region rivaled global SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity at that time and that the sequences belong to all of the major globally circulating lineages, suggesting multiple introductions into the region. We also analyzed these regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes alongside detailed clinical metadata and found that clinically severe cases had viral genomes belonging to all major viral lineages. We conclude that efforts to control local spread of the virus were likely confounded by the number of introductions into the region early in the epidemic and the interconnectedness of the region as a whole.","Thielen, Peter M.; Wohl, Shirlee; Mehoke, Thomas; Ramakrishnan, Srividya; Kirsche, Melanie; Falade-Nwulia, Oluwaseun; Trovão, Nídia S.; Ernlund, Amanda; Howser, Craig; Sadowski, Norah; Morris, C.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 225 patients who attended the dental clinics of KAUH, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 2014. A standardized, confidential, anonymous, interviewing questionnaire was used. Knowledge about dental infections was assessed by 12 MCQs. The attitudes were assessed through answering seven statements on a three- point Likert scale. Patients’ self reported practices were also evaluated. Descriptive and inferential statistics were done. Results of the study revealed that 39.5%, 38.7% and 21.8% of the participants obtained poor, fair and satisfactory level of knowledge about infections and infection control in dentistry, respectively. Social media was the commonest source of information about dental infection. Participant's educational level was significantly associated with the level of knowledge about dental infection. Patients had positive attitudes towards infection control in dentistry. Regarding self-reported practice, only few participants would ask dentists about sterilization of dental instruments (9.3%), wearing face mask (13.3%) and gloves (16.4%) if they don’t do so. In conclusion, our participants had good attitudes towards infection control in dentistry. However, their knowledge and practice need improvements.

Predictably, as the virus becomes less prevalent, there will be a tremendous motivation to move forward with scheduling operations from both patient care and institutional perspectives. However, one can anticipate a pandemic-related increase in surgical morbidity and mortality above prepandemic levels, particularly in older or medically frail patients even if they did not have a novel coronavirus (i.e., COVID-19) infection. Therefore, now is the time to consider for patients awaiting surgery a wider adoption of prehabilitation—physical and psychological assessments that establish a baseline functional level, identify impairments, and provide interventions that promote physical and psychological health to reduce the incidence and/or severity of future impairments.","Silver, Julie K.",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,https://doi.org/10.1097/phm.0000000000001452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32324618/,219

Dentistry and oral and maxillofacial surgery (CMFS) are particularly affected due to direct exposure to the respiratory tract, as the reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, the impact of the COVID-19-pandemic on a dental and CMFS emergency services in Germany in 2020 was first time investigated and correlated with governmental restriction measures in public life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epidemiological data of a German University Hospital were analysed from a total of 8386 patients in 2019 and 2020. Parameters included information on demographics, time, weekday and reason for presentation, as well as diagnosis and therapy performed. Data from 2020 were compared with those from 2019, taking into account the nationwide periods of public life restrictions. RESULTS: In 2020, 22% fewer patients presented via dental and CMFS emergency service. In a monthly comparison, there were negative peaks of up to − 41% in November, but also a plus of 26% in July. The largest decreases were recorded during the lockdown periods in spring (− 33%) and winter (− 39%). Further, a threefold increase in actual emergencies and inpatient admissions revealed during these time periods (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the dental and CMFS emergency service in 2020 resulting in more severe cases. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study underlines the importance of maintaining an emergency service system and basic outpatient care in these specialities, which requires uniform recommendations from the medical-dental societies and politics.","Thiem, D.

644109,‘Rapid Counseling’ with single-session therapy for patients with COVID-19: An alternative treatment before doing mental health self-care strategy with meditation,2021-09-08,"Objectives: This study was designed to assess the effect of COVID-19 home quarantine and its lifestyle challenges on the sleep quality and mental health of a large sample of undergraduate University students in Jordan. It is the first study applied to the Jordanian population. The aim was to investigate how quarantine for several weeks changed the students' habits and affected their mental health. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a random representative sample of 6,157 undergraduate students (mean age 19.79 ± 1.67 years, males 28.7%) from the University of Jordan through voluntarily filling an online questionnaire. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) were used to assess sleep quality and depressive symptoms, respectively. Results: The PSQI mean score for the study participants was 8.1 ± 3.6. The sleep quality of three-quarters of the participants was negatively affected by the extended quarantine. Nearly half of the participants reported poor sleep quality. The prevalence of poor sleep quality among participants was 76% (males: 71.5% and females: 77.8%). Similarly, the prevalence of the depressive symptoms was 71% (34% for moderate and 37% for high depressive symptoms), with females showing higher prevalence than males. The overall mean CES-D score for the group with low depressive symptoms is 9.3, for the moderate group is 19.8, while it is 34.3 for the high depressive symptoms group. More than half of the students (62.5%) reported that the quarantine had a negative effect on their mental health. Finally, females, smokers, and students with decreased income levels during the extended quarantine were the common exposures that are significantly associated with a higher risk of developing sleep disturbances and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Mass and extended quarantine succeeded in controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus; however, it comes with a high cost of potential psychological impacts. Most of the students reported that they suffer from sleeping disorders and had a degree of depressive symptoms. Officials should provide psychological support and clear guidance to help the general public to reduce these potential effects and overcome the quarantine period with minimum negative impacts.","Saadeh, Heba; Saadeh, Maha; Almobaideen, Wesam; Al Refaei, Assem; Shewaikani, Nour; Al Fayez, Reem Qadan; Khawaldah, Hamzah; Abu-Shanab, Sobuh; Al-Hussaini, Maysa",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.605676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33664681/,219
644697,Physical Activity Drops During Summer Holidays for 6- to 9-Year-Old Children,2021-01-18,"PURPOSE: Although intraocular anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs) are effective as treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), the (economic) burden on the healthcare system is considerable. A treat-and-extend (T&E) regimen is associated with a lower number of injections without compromising the effectiveness and can therefore help optimise nAMD treatment. This study investigates the per-patient costs associated with nAMD treatment, when using aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab with a T&E regimen. METHODS: In this cost-minimisation model, the per-patient costs in the Netherlands were modelled using a healthcare payers’ perspective over a 3-year time horizon with the assumption that efficacy of treatments is similar. Additionally, the break-even price of the different anti-VEGFs was calculated relative to the cheapest option and injection frequency. RESULTS: The injection frequency varied from 14.2 for aflibercept to 27.4 for bevacizumab in 3 years. Nonetheless, bevacizumab remains the cheapest treatment option (€14,215), followed by aflibercept (€18,202) and ranibizumab (€31,048). The medication covers the majority of the per-patient costs for aflibercept and ranibizumab, while administration covers the majority of the per-patient costs for bevacizumab. The break-even prices of aflibercept and ranibizumab are respectively €507 and €60.58 per injection. Brolucizumab was included in the scenario analysis and was more expensive than aflibercept (€20,446). Brolucizumab should reduce to 13.8 injections over 3 years to be as costly as aflibercept. CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab is the cheapest anti-VEGF treatment. The list prices of all anti-VEGFs should reduce to be as costly as bevacizumab. Aflibercept is the second-choice treatment and so far brolucizumab is not.","Quist, S. W.; de Jong, L. A.; van Asten, F.; Knoester, P.; Postma, M. J.; Freriks, R.

This study aimed to describe GE and RTI outbreaks with infection and all-cause lethality rates according to the individual characteristics of nursing home residents. METHODS: Clinical and virological surveillance were conducted (2007 to 2018). Virus stratifications for the analysis were: outbreaks with positive norovirus or influenza identifications (respectively NoV+ or Flu+), episodes with no NoV or influenza identification or testing (respectively NoV- or Flu-). Associations between individual variables (sex, age, length of stay (LOS), autonomy status) and infection and lethality rates were tested with univariate and Mantel-Haenszel (MH) methods. RESULTS: 61 GE outbreaks and 76 RTI oubreaks (total 137 outbreaks) were recorded involving respectively 4309 and 5862 residents. In univariate analysis, higher infection rates and age were associated in NoV+, NoV-, and Flu+ contexts, and lower infection rates were associated with longer stays (NoV+ and NoV-). In MH stratified analysis (virus, sex (female/male)) adjusted for LOS (<4 or ≥4 years), the odds of being infected remained significant among older residents (≥86 years): NoV+/male (Odds ratio (OR(MH)): 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16–2.30) and Flu+/female and male (respectively OR(MH): 1.50, CI: 1.27–1.79 and 1.73, CI: 1.28–2.33). In univariate analysis, lower autonomy status (NoV+, Flu+ and Flu-) and increased age (Flu+) were associated with higher lethality. In MH adjusted analysis, significant OR(age) adjusted for autonomy was: Flu+/ ≥86 years compared with <86 years, 1.97 (1.19–3.25) and OR(autonomy) adjusted for age for the more autonomous group (compared with the less autonomous group) was: Flu+, 0.41 (0.24–0.69); Flu-, 0.42 (0.20, 0.90). CONCLUSION: The residents of nursing homes are increasingly elderly and dependent. The specific infection and lethality risks according to these two factors indicate that surveillance and infection control measures are essential and of high priority.","Gaspard, Philippe; Mosnier, Anne; Simon, Loic; Ali-Brandmeyer, Olivia; Rabaud, Christian; Larocca, Sabrina; Heck, Béatrice; Aho-Glélé, Serge; Pothier, Pierre; Ambert-Balay, Katia",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31550261/,219

Remote training was conducted via telephone using principles of cognitive rehabilitation and delivered by trained clinicians. We thematically analyzed trainer reflection notes and interviews with older adult participants. The main facilitators were technology training with exposure, and the main barrier was fear of technology. We describe how telephone-based training grounded in principles of cognitive rehabilitation can be used to remotely train older adults to use new technology and to help them maintain their community-based connections and engage in socialization. Fear of technology during the pandemic can cause significant impairment in social functioning for older adults, at least when the only method for socialization is technology mediated such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Empathically delivered remote training in an understanding manner can reduce fear and increase social and community connections in the era of physical distancing.","O'Connell, Megan E; Haase, Kristen R; Grewal, Karl S; Panyavin, Ivan; Kortzman, August; Flath, Meghan E; Cammer, Allison; Cosco, Theodore D; Peacock, Shelley",Clinical gerontologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2021.1943589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34233600/,219
651081,Political Intrusions into the International Health Regulations Treaty and Its Impact on Management of Rapidly Emerging Zoonotic Pandemics: What History Tells Us,2020-04-13,"The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, resulted in a pandemic. Here, we used recently released X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV-2 to predict its binding to ACE2 proteins from different animals, including pets, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the interaction sites of ACE2 proteins known to serve or not serve as receptor allows to define residues important for binding. From the 20 amino acids in ACE2 that contact S up to seven can be replaced and ACE2 can still function as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. These variable amino acids are clustered at certain positions, mostly at the periphery of the binding site, while changes of the invariable residues prevent S-binding or infection of the respective animal. Some ACE2 proteins even tolerate the loss or the acquisition of N-glycosylation sites located near the S-interface. Of note, pigs and dogs which are not or not effectively infected, respectively, have only a few changes in the binding site have relatively low levels of ACE2 in the respiratory tract. Comparison of the RBD of S of SARS-CoV-2 with viruses from bat and pangolin revealed that the latter contains only one substitution, whereas the bat virus exhibits five. However, ACE2 of pangolin exhibit seven changes relative to human ACE2, a similar number of substitutions is present in ACE2 of bats, raccoon, and civet suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not especially adapted to ACE2 of any of its putative intermediate hosts. These analyses provide new insight into the receptor usage and animal source/origin of SARS-COV-2. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is threatening people worldwide and there are no drugs or vaccines available to mitigate its spread. The origin of the virus is still unclear and whether pets and livestock can be infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 are important and unknown scientific questions. Effective binding to the host receptor ACE2 is the first prerequisite for infection of cells and determines the host range. Our analysis provides a framework for the prediction of potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. We found that ACE2 from species known to support SARS-CoV-2 infection tolerate many amino acid changes indicating that the species barrier might be low. However, the lower expression of ACE2 in the upper respiratory tract of some pets and livestock means more research and monitoring should be done to explore the animal source of infection and the risk of potential cross-species transmission. Finally, the analysis also showed that SARS-CoV-2 may not specifically adapted to any of its putative intermediate hosts.","Zhai, Xiaofeng; Sun, Jiumeng; Yan, Ziqing; Zhang, Jie; Zhao, Jin; Zhao, Zongzheng; Gao, Qi; He, Wan-Ting; Veit, Michael; Su, Shuo",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.084061,219

We examined the presence and temporal changes of the neutralizing activity of IgG fractions from 43 COVID-19-convalescent plasmas using cell-based assays with multiple endpoints. IgG fractions from 27 cases (62.8%) had significant neutralizing activity and moderately to potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell-based assays; however, no detectable neutralizing activity was found in 16 cases (37.2%). Approximately half of the patients (~ 41%), who had significant neutralizing activity, lost the neutralization activity within ~ 1 month. Despite the rapid decline of neutralizing activity in plasmas, good amounts of SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding antibodies were persistently seen. The longer exposure of COVID-19 patients to greater amounts of SARS-CoV-2 elicits potent immune response to SARS-CoV-2, producing greater neutralization activity and SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding antibody amounts. The dilution of highly-neutralizing plasmas with poorly-neutralizing plasmas relatively readily reduced neutralizing activity. The presence of good amounts of SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding antibodies does not serve as a surrogate ensuring the presence of good neutralizing activity. In selecting good COVID-19-convalescent plasmas, quantification of neutralizing activity in each plasma sample before collection and use is required.","Maeda, Kenji; Higashi-Kuwata, Nobuyo; Kinoshita, Noriko; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Tsuchiya, Kiyoto; Hattori, Shin-ichiro; Matsuda, Kouki; Takamatsu, Yuki; Gatanaga, Hiroyuki; Oka, Shinichi; Sugiyama, Haruhito; Ohmagari, Norio; Mitsuya, Hiroaki",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692457/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84733-5,219

An anonymous cross-sectional survey was sent to all 91 radiation oncology residency programs in the USA. The survey included questions related to demographics, changes in clinical duties and training, job prospects, and wellness indicators. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate factors associated with residents endorsing high satisfaction with their departments’ response to COVID-19. A total of 96 residents completed the survey from 67 US radiation oncology programs. In the multivariate logistic regression model, remote contouring (OR: 3.91 (95% CI: 1.11, 13.80), p = 0.03) and belief that one will be adequately trained to independently practice after completing residency (OR: 4.68 (1.12, 19.47), p = 0.03) were significantly associated with high resident satisfaction with their department’s response to COVID-19. Most residents indicated that hypofractionation was encouraged to a greater extent (n = 79, 82.3%), patients were triaged by disease risk (n = 67, 69.8%), and most agreed/strongly agreed that they have been provided with adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (n = 85, 88.5%). The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the training and wellness of radiation oncology residents. Our analysis suggests that radiation oncology programs might increase resident satisfaction with their department’s response to COVID-19 by enabling remote contouring and working with residents to identity and remedy possible concerns regarding their ability to independently practice post residency.

By identifying and critically synthesizing 42 recent peer-reviewed studies employing capsid integrity qPCR for viruses in the last decade (2009 to 2019) in the fields of food safety and environmental virology, we aimed to establish recommendations for the detection of infectious viruses. Intercalating dyes are effective measures of viability in PCR assays provided the viral capsid is damaged; viruses that have been inactivated by other causes, such as loss of attachment or genomic damage, are less well detected using this approach. Although optimizing specific protocols for each virus is recommended, we identify a framework for general assay conditions. These include concentrations of ethidium monoazide, propidium monoazide or its derivates between 10 and 200 uM; incubation on ice or at room temperature (20 to 25C) for 5 to 120 min; and dye activation using LED or high light (500 to 800 Watts) exposure for periods ranging from 5 to 20 min.

As a priority group of influenza vaccination, the elderly are at higher risk of influenza-associated severe symptoms and deaths, and they are more price-sensitive vaccine users with better cost-effectiveness of vaccination program. Therefore, a reasonable financing mechanism of influenza vaccination should be designed for the elderly to increase their vaccination rate. This study proposes three financing strategies of influenza vaccination for the elderly in China, trying to explore the distribution of vaccination costs among individuals, central government and local governments under different financing strategies, including the individual-central-local mechanism (strategy 1), the central-local mechanism (strategy 2), and the local payment mechanism (strategy 3). Strategy 1 is feasible and sustainable for most regions in the short term. Strategy 2 is conducive to further increasing the vaccine coverage rate of the elderly. Strategy 3 encourages local fiscal payments to help relieve the financial pressure of the central government. The results revealed a relatively heavy financial burden of influenza vaccination for the elderly, and it is recommended to promote the development of a multiparty co-payment mechanism gradually based on local conditions.","Lai, X Z; Peng, Z B; Qin, Y; Feng, L Z; Li, Z J; Feng, Z J; Fang, H",Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34275235/; https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20210205-00365,219

Global models and local linear models were used to estimate the impact of risk factors of the COVID-19, but these do not account for the nonlinear relationships between the risk factors and the COVID-19 death rate at various geographical locations. We proposed a local nonlinear nonparametric regression model named geographically weighted random forest (GW-RF) to estimate the nonlinear relationship between COVID-19 death rate and 47 risk factors derived from the US Environmental Protection Agency, National Center for Environmental Information, Centers for Disease Control and the US census.

Conversely, the use of steroids or steroids plus tocilizumab did not confer a higher risk of bacterial infections and improved survival rates. Bacterial infections occurred in 8.5% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic. They were not independently associated with increased mortality rates. Baseline COVID-19 severity rather than the incidence of bacterial infections seems to contribute to mortality. When indicated, the use of steroids or steroids plus tocilizumab might improve survival in this population.","Moreno-Torres, Víctor; de Mendoza, Carmen; de la Fuente, Sara; Sánchez, Enrique; Martínez-Urbistondo, María; Herráiz, Jesús; Gutiérrez, Andrea; Gutiérrez, Ángela; Hernández, Carlos; Callejas, Alejandro; Maínez, Carmen; Royuela, Ana; Cuervas-Mons, Valentín",Intern Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-021-02824-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34406633/,219

They are closely related to Internet of Things (IoT) systems, except that CPS focuses on the interaction between physical, networking and computation processes. Their integration with IoT led to a new CPS aspect, the Internet of Cyber-Physical Things (IoCPT). The fast and significant evolution of CPS affects various aspects in people’s way of life and enables a wider range of services and applications including e-Health, smart homes, e-Commerce, etc. However, interconnecting the cyber and physical worlds gives rise to new dangerous security challenges. Consequently, CPS security has attracted the attention of both researchers and industries. This paper surveys the main aspects of CPS and the corresponding applications, technologies, and standards. Moreover, CPS security vulnerabilities, threats and attacks are reviewed, while the key issues and challenges are identified. Additionally, the existing security measures are presented and analyzed while identifying their main limitations. Finally, several suggestions and recommendations are proposed benefiting from the lessons learned throughout this comprehensive review.","Yaacoub, Jean-Paul A.; Salman, Ola; Noura, Hassan N.; Kaaniche, Nesrine; Chehab, Ali; Malli, Mohamad",Microprocess Microsyst,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141933120303689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834204/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpro.2020.103201; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141933120303689?v=s5,219
663291,Opioid use disorder treatment disruptions during the early COVID-19 pandemic and other emergent disasters: a scoping review addressing dual public health emergencies,2021-07-28,"INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency and during this unprecedented situation, health care providers across the globe are at the frontline in the fight against this disease. Countries that have been severely hit by the pandemic are using pharmacists to help triage patients. In order to ensure the continuity of these services, it is of paramount importance that pharmacists be formally involved and engaged in the management of this pandemic. In response to the underlying knowledge deficit, this study was undertaken as the first of its kind in the entirety of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This study is a questionnaire based cross-sectional study that was carried out for a period of five months from March 2020 to July 2020 to assess the role of working pharmacists in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic under different health care settings across Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 398 responses were recorded, in which 51.1% of the respondents were not involved in any learning or awareness activities involving health care providers (HCPs) or patients. The majority of respondents (62.9%) were not involved in creating or evaluating therapeutic plans for COVID19 patients, and 55% were not involved in therapeutic mentoring of COVID19 patients. Only a very low percentage of respondents were participating in COVID19-related research within their institution. Only 37% of respondents reported being satisfied with their role and contribution in the management of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The present study reveals that pharmacists are underutilized in the management of COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia. As such, the findings emphasize the importance of enhancing the role and contribution of pharmacists in patient care management across all hospitals and especially under health care crisis conditions. The establishment of a crisis standard of care guideline for all HCPs, including pharmacists, would help in improving patient overall care under crisis conditions like the present COVID-19 pandemic.","Assiri, Abdullah; Iqbal, Mir Javid; Gramish, Jawaher; Assiri, Ahmed; Meraya, Abdulkarim; Alhossan, Abdulaziz; Khobrani, Moteb",Saudi Pharm J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsps.2020.12.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437172/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S131901642030284X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S131901642030284X,219

665024,"Health system capacity in Sydney, Australia in the event of a biological attack with smallpox",2019-06-14,"INTRODUCTION: Although a considerable proportion of Asians in the USA experience depression, anxiety and poor sleep, these health issues have been underestimated due to the model minority myth about Asians, the stigma associated with mental illness, lower rates of treatment seeking and a shortage of culturally tailored mental health services. Indeed, despite emerging evidence of links between psychosocial risk factors, the gut microbiome and depression, anxiety and sleep quality, very few studies have examined how these factors are related in Chinese and Korean immigrants in the USA. The purpose of this pilot study was to address this issue by (a) testing the usability and feasibility of the study’s multilingual survey measures and biospecimen collection procedure among Chinese and Korean immigrants in the USA and (b) examining how stress, discrimination, acculturation and the gut microbiome are associated with depression, anxiety and sleep quality in this population. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: This is a cross-sectional pilot study among first and second generations of adult Chinese and Korean immigrants in the greater Atlanta area (Georgia, USA). We collected (a) gut microbiome samples and (b) data on psychosocial risk factors, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance using validated, online surveys in English, Chinese and Korean. We aim to recruit 60 participants (30 Chinese, 30 Korean). We will profile participants’ gut microbiome using 16S rRNA V3-V4 sequencing data, which will be analysed by QIIME 2. Associations of the gut microbiome and psychosocial factors with depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance will be analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics, including linear regression. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at Emory University (IRB ID: STUDY00000935).

Through our recent work tracking the well-being of frontline workers in the UK and Ireland (the CV19 Heroes project), we have uncovered additional psychological factors that have not been accounted for in previous models of occupational stress or burnout. In recent months, frontline workers have worked to protect the community from the threat of SARS-CoV-2 and, simultaneously, have evaluated their perceptions of collective efforts of others as either congruent or incongruent with collective goals (e.g., lowered mortality and morbidity): we call this novel aspect solidarity appraisal. These frontline workers have been hailed as heroes, which we argue has led to the creation of an implicit psychological contract (the hero contract) between frontline workers and the public. Here, the heroes are willing to “go above and beyond” for the greater good, with the expectation that we (the public) do our part by adhering to public health guidelines. Where frontline workers perceive incongruence between the words and actions of others in working toward collective goals this drives negative affect and subsequent burnout. In this perspective article, we evaluate the cultural context of the pandemic in the UK and Ireland and suggest important socio-cultural factors that contribute to perceptions of solidarity, and how this may relate to burnout and worker welfare during and beyond the pandemic context.","Sumner, Rachel C.; Kinsella, Elaine L.",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.645504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113288/,219

Using a cross-sectional survey, the current paper aimed to examine self-reported changes in eating patterns and behaviour during the lockdown in the UK, and associations with BMI, demographic variables, eating styles, health anxiety, food insecurity and coping strategies. Participants (N = 620) were recruited online through social media advertising. The results showed that there were self-reported changes to food consumption during the lockdown across the sample. Increases in consumption of HED (high energy density) snack foods during the lockdown was associated with sex, pre-lockdown eating behaviour (emotional eating and uncontrolled eating), and Covid-specific health anxiety. Increases in positive eating practices such as eating more home prepared foods, and fruits and vegetables, were associated with adaptive coping strategies. Higher emotional eating (EE) during the lockdown was associated with a higher BMI, higher pre-lockdown EE and maladaptive coping strategies. Maladaptive coping strategies moderated the relationship between BMI and EE during the lockdown. In particular a higher BMI was associated with higher EE during the lockdown if an individual also had higher maladaptive coping strategies. These findings suggest that changes to eating behaviour may be part of a wider style of maladaptive or adaptive coping, particularly in those with a history of EE or uncontrolled eating. Preparing individuals to adopt more adaptive coping strategies during lockdown situations may be crucial to improving health during subsequent the lockdown events.","Coulthard, Helen; Sharps, Maxine; Cunliffe, Louise; van den Tol, Annemieke",Appetite,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33476651/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195666320317049; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666320317049; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.105082,219

Design and setting: Analysis of electronic health record data from the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales. Methods: We used hospital episode statistics for all adult patients undergoing surgery between 1st January 2020 and 31st December 2020. We identified surgical procedures using a previously published list of procedure codes. Procedures were stratified by urgency of surgery as defined by NHS England. We calculated the deficit of surgical activity by comparing the expected number of procedures from the years 2016-2019 with the actual number of procedures in 2020. We estimated the cumulative number of cancelled procedures by 31st December 2021 according patterns of activity in 2020. Results: The total number of surgical procedures carried out in England and Wales in 2020 was 3,102,674 compared to the predicted number of 4,671,338. This represents a 33.6% reduction in the national volume of surgical activity. There were 763,730 emergency surgical procedures (13.4% reduction), compared to 2,338,944 elective surgical procedures (38.6% reduction). The cumulative number of cancelled or postponed procedures was 1,568,664. We estimate that this will increase to 2,358,420 by 31st December 2021. Conclusions: The volume of surgical activity in England and Wales was reduced by 33.6% in 2020, resulting in over 1,568,664 cancelled operations.

The role of domestic livestock and the risk associated for humans in close contact remains unknown for many production animals. Determination of the susceptibility of pigs to SARS-CoV-2 is critical towards a One Health approach to manage the potential risk of zoonotic transmission. Here, pigs undergoing experimental inoculation are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 at low levels. Viral RNA was detected in group oral fluids and nasal wash from at least two animals while live virus was isolated from a pig. Further, antibodies could be detected in two animals at 11 and 13 days post infection, while oral fluid samples at 6 days post inoculation indicated the presence of secreted antibodies. These data highlight the need for additional livestock assessment to better determine the potential role domestic animals may contribute towards the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Pickering, Brad S.; Smith, Greg; Pinette, Mathieu M.; Embury-Hyatt, Carissa; Moffat, Estella; Marszal, Peter; Lewis, Charles E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.10.288548,219

The Obesity Society has critically evaluated data from published peer‐reviewed literature and briefing documents from Emergency Use Authorization applications submitted by Pfizer‐BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. We conclude that these vaccines are highly efficacious, and their efficacy is not significantly different in people with and without obesity, based on scientific evidence available at the time of publication. The Obesity Society believes there is no definitive way to determine which of these three COVID‐19 vaccines is “best” for any weight subpopulation (because of differences in the trial design and outcome measures in the phase 3 trials, elapsed time between doses, and regional differences in the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 variants [e.g., South Africa B.1.351 in Johnson & Johnson trial]). All three trials have demonstrated high efficacy against COVID‐19–associated hospitalization and death. Therefore, The Obesity Society encourages adults with obesity ≥18 years (≥16 years for Pfizer‐BioNTech) to undergo vaccination with any one of the currently available vaccines authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration as soon as they are able.","Butsch, W.

However, the relationship between specific antibody responses and severity of COVID-19 is less well understood. METHODS: To address this question and identify gaps in knowledge, we utilized the methodology of a scoping review to interrogate risk of infection and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with iatrogenic and inborn humoral immunodeficiency states based on existing literature. RESULTS: Among patients with iatrogenic B-cell depletion, particularly with agents targeting CD20, our analysis found increased risk of severe COVID-19 and death across a range of underlying disease states. Among patients with humoral inborn errors of immunity with COVID-19, our synthesis found that patients with dysregulated humoral immunity, predominantly common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 than patients with humoral immunodeficiency states due to X-linked agammaglobulinemia and other miscellaneous forms of humoral immunodeficiency. There were insufficient data to appraise the risk of COVID-19 infection in both populations of patients.

684189,Conducting Clinical Research During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Investigator and Participant Perspectives,2020-04-06,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing mortality rates of COVID-19 create an urgent need for treatments, which are currently lacking. Although vaccines have been approved by the FDA for emergency use in the U.S., patients will continue to require pharmacologic intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality as vaccine availability remains limited. The rise of new variants makes the development of therapeutic strategies even more crucial to combat the current pandemic and future outbreaks. Evidence from several studies suggests the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection plays a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Consequently, host immune factors are becoming more recognized as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for COVID-19. To develop therapeutic strategies to combat current and future coronavirus outbreaks, understanding how the coronavirus hijacks the host immune system during and after the infection is crucial. In this study, we investigated immunological patterns or characteristics of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may contribute to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. We analyzed large bulk RNASeq and single cell RNAseq data from COVID-19 patient samples to immunoprofile differentially expressed gene sets and analyzed pathways to identify human host protein targets. We observed an immunological profile of severe COVID-19 patients characterized by upregulated cytokines, interferon-induced proteins, and pronounced T cell lymphopenia, supporting findings by previous studies. We identified a number of host immune targets including PERK, PKR, TNF, NF-kB, and other key genes that modulate the significant pathways and genes identified in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we identified genes modulated by COVID-19 infection that are implicated in oncogenesis, including E2F transcription factors and RB1, suggesting a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to oncogenesis. Further clinical investigation of these targets may lead to bonafide therapeutic strategies to treat the current COVID-19 pandemic and protect against future outbreaks and viral escape variants.","Policard, Martine; Jain, Sidharth; Rego, Samantha; Dakshanamurthy, Sivanesan",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170221001714?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.198464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34058265/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170221001714,219

Compared to non-FMW, FMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3±3.8 vs 7.5±3.7; P<0.001; Cohen's d=0.47), AIS (6.9±4.3 vs 5.3±3.8; P<0.001; Cohen's d=0.38), anxiety (4.9±2.7 vs 4.3±2.6; P<0.001; Cohen's d= 0.22) and depression (4.1±2.5 vs 3.6±2.4; P=0.001; Cohen's d=0.21), and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances according to PSQI > 6 points (78.4% vs 61.0%; relative risk [RR]= 1.29; P<0.001) and AIS > 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%; RR=1.45; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: FMW have higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality than non-FMW. Further interventions should be administrated for FMW, aiming to maintain their healthy condition and guarantee their professional performance in the battle against COVID-19.","Qi, Jing; Xu, Jing; Li, Bo-Zhi; Huang, Jin-Sha; Yang, Yuan; Zhang, Zhen-Tao; Yao, Dong-Ai; Liu, Qun-Hui; Jia, Min; Gong, Dao-Kai; Ni, Xiao-Hong; Zhang, Qi-Mei; Shang, Fu-Rong; Xiong, Nian; Zhu, Chun-Li; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Xi",Sleep Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.05.023; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1389945720302264; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945720302264?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32502844/,219
