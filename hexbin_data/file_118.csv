242,242,242,Health workers' views on quality of prevention of mother-to-child transmission and postnatal care for HIV-infected women and their children,20.682106,2.6899989,2009-05-13,"BACKGROUND: Prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been considered as not a simple intervention but a comprehensive set of interventions requiring capable health workers. Viet Nam's extensive health care system reaches the village level, but still HIV-infected mothers and children have received inadequate health care services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. We report here the health workers' perceptions on factors that lead to their failure to give good quality prevention of mother-to-child transmission services. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with 53 health workers and unstructured observations in nine health facilities in Hanoi were conducted. Selection of respondents was based on their function, position and experience in the development or implementation of prevention of mother-to-child transmission policies/programmes. RESULTS: Factors that lead to health workers' failure to give good quality services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission include their own fear of HIV infection; lack of knowledge on HIV and counselling skills; or high workloads and lack of staff; unavailability of HIV testing at commune level; shortage of antiretroviral drugs; and lack of operational guidelines. A negative attitude during counselling and provision of care, treating in a separate area and avoidance of providing service at all were seen by health workers as the result of fear of being infected, as well as distrust towards almost all HIV-infected patients because of the prevailing association with antisocial behaviours. Additionally, the fragmentation of the health care system into specialized vertical pillars, including a vertical programme for HIV/AIDS, is a major obstacle to providing a continuum of care. CONCLUSION: Many hospital staff were not being able to provide good care or were even unwilling to provide appropriate care for HIV-positive pregnant women The study suggests that the quality of prevention of mother-to-child transmission service could be enhanced by improving communication and other skills of health workers, providing them with greater support and enhancing their motivation. Reduction of workload would also be important. Development of a practical strategy is needed to strengthen and adapt the referral system to meet the needs of patients.","Nguyen, Thu Anh; Oosterhoff, Pauline; Pham, Yen Ngoc; Hardon, Anita; Wright, Pamela",Hum Resour Health,118,5
2227,2227,2227,Critical role of ethics in clinical management and public health response to the West Africa Ebola epidemic,20.900743,3.0517325,2016-05-12,"The devastation caused by the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has brought to the fore a number of important ethical debates about how best to respond to a health crisis. These debates include issues related to prevention and containment, management of the health care workforce, clinical care, and research design, all of which are situated within the overarching moral problem of severe transnational disadvantage, which has very real and specific impacts upon the ability of citizens of EVD-affected countries to respond to a disease outbreak. Ethical issues related to prevention and containment include the appropriateness and scope of quarantine and isolation within and outside affected countries. The possibility of infection in health care workers impelled consideration of whether there is an obligation to provide health services where personal protection equipment is inadequate, alongside the issue of whether the health care workforce should have special access to experimental treatment and care interventions under development. In clinical care, ethical issues include the standards of care owed to people who comply with quarantine and isolation restrictions. Ethical issues in research include appropriate study design related to experimental vaccines and treatment interventions, and the sharing of data and biospecimens between research groups. The compassionate use of experimental drugs intersects both with research ethics and clinical care. The role of developed countries also came under scrutiny, and we concluded that developed countries have an obligation to contribute to the containment of EVD infection by contributing to the strengthening of local health care systems and infrastructure in an effort to provide fair benefits to communities engaged in research, ensuring that affected countries have ready and affordable access to any therapeutic or preventative interventions developed, and supporting affected countries on their way to recovery from the impact of EVD on their social and economic lives.","Folayan, Morenike O; Haire, Bridget G; Brown, Brandon",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,118,30
4372,4372,4372,What’s Public? What’s Private?: Policy Trade-offs and the Debate Over Mandatory Annual Influenza Vaccination for Health Care Workers,21.085161,2.713017,2008-05-01,"Policy decisions about public health services differ from those for personal health services. Both require trade-offs between such policy goals as liberty, security, efficiency, and equity. In public health, however, decisions about who will approve, pay for, and deliver services are often accompanied by decisions on when and how to compel individual behaviour. Policy becomes complex because different stakeholders interpret evidence differently: stakeholders may assign different weights to policy goals and may even define the same goals differently. In the debate over mandatory annual influenza vaccination for health care workers, for example, proponents as well as opponents of mandatory vaccination may convey arguments in security terms. Those in favour of mandatory vaccination emphasize subclinical infections and duty of care (public security) while those opposed emphasize risk of adverse events (personal security). Proponents assert less worker absenteeism (efficiency) while opponents stress coercion and alternate personal infection control measures (liberty and individual rights/responsibilities). Consequently, stakeholders talk past each other. Determining the place of mandatory influenza vaccination for health care workers thus demands reconciling policy trade-offs and clarifying the underlying disputes hidden in the language of the policy debate.","Mah, Catherine L.",Can J Public Health,118,30

Following infection with LDV, a strong activator of B cells, an early and transient IL-6 production was observed, that originated predominantly from macrophages. Whereas LDV-induced B lymphocyte proliferation appeared independent of IL-6, mice deficient for this cytokine showed a marked reduction in their total T-dependent IgG2a production when compared to their normal counterparts. By contrast, specific responses directed against either LDV or non-viral antigens administered at the time of infection were not decreased in the absence of IL-6. Similarly, polyclonal, but not anti-parasite IgG2a production triggered by T. gondii infection was strongly dependent on the presence of IL-6. Finally, T-independent total IgG3 secretion triggered by LPS was also markedly reduced in IL-6-deficient mice. These results suggest that IL-6 plays a major role in T-dependent and T-independent polyclonal Ig production following B lymphocyte activation by viruses, and parasites, but not in specific antibody responses induced by the same microorganisms.","Markine-Goriaynoff, Dominique; Nguyen, Trung D.; Bigaignon, Geoffroy; Van Snick, Jacques; Coutelier, Jean-Paul",Int Immunol,118,5

Binding of the PBL to the PK-15 targets used in the single cell cytotoxicity assay for NK activity was not affected by age or by IFN treatment. When newborn piglets were treated with a single intravenous dose at 2 days of age of 0.5 mg/kg of polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid complexed with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC), a synthetic IFN inducer, their IFN levels peaked at 6 h post-induction, and NK activity in their PBL peaked at 24 h post-induction at the level normally found in weaned piglets. The NK activity then declined until 7 days post-induction, when it increased again in a similar manner to that in untreated control piglets. Target-binding of the PBL was not affected by poly ICLC treatment of the piglets. Newborn piglets treated with poly ICLC and subsequently exposed to infection with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus showed a delay in onset of clinical signs of TGE compared with untreated control piglets. It was concluded that NK cells in newborn piglets can be activated by treatment of the piglets with poly ICLC, and that the presence of active NK cells is associated with some increase in resistance to challenge with TGE virus.","Lesnick, C.E.; Derbyshire, J.B.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,118,5

It has not been tested in the most common PH groups; 2 (left heart disease), 3 (lung disease), or 5 (other disorders). Further it has not been evaluated in the UK National Health Service (NHS) out-patient setting, or with long-term follow-up. The aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a supervised exercise rehabilitation intervention with psychosocial support compared to best practice usual care for people with PH in the community/outpatient setting. METHODS: This multi-centre, pragmatic, two-arm RCT with embedded process evaluation aims to recruit 352 clinically stable adults with PH (groups 1–5) and WHO functional class II-IV. Participants will be randomised to either the Supervised Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise Rehabilitation (SPHERe) intervention or control. The SPHERe intervention consists of 1) individual assessment and familiarisation sessions; 2) 8-week, twice-weekly, supervised out-patient exercise training; 3) psychosocial/motivational support and education; 4) guided home exercise plan. The control intervention consists of best practice usual care with a single one-to-one practitioner appointment, and general advice on physical activity. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 4 months (post-intervention) and 12 months by researchers blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome is the incremental shuttle walk test at 4 months. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life (HRQoL), time to clinical worsening and health and social care use. A purposive sample of participants (n = 20 intervention and n = 20 control) and practitioners (n = 20) will be interviewed to explore experiences of the trial, outcomes and interventions. DISCUSSION: The SPHERe study is the first multi-centre clinical RCT to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of a supervised exercise rehabilitation intervention compared to usual care, delivered in the UK NHS, for people in all PH groups. Results will inform clinicians and commissioners as to whether or not supervised exercise rehabilitation is effective and should be routinely provided for people with PH.

We investigated the role of sub-types of inhibitory neuron activity on the regulation of CBF using optogenetics, laser Doppler flowmetry and different transgenic mouse models (parvalbumin (PV), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SOM) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)). Whisker stimulation was used to verify that typical CBF responses were obtained in all mice. Photo-stimulation of SOM-cre and NOS-cre mice produced significant increases in CBF that were similar to whisker responses. In NOS-cre mice, CBF responses scaled with the photo-stimulus pulse duration and frequency. In SOM-cre mice, CBF increases were followed by decreases. In VIP-cre mice, photo-stimulation did not consistently produce significant changes in CBF, while slower increases in CBF that peaked 14–18 s after stimulation onset were observed in PV-cre mice. Control experiments performed in non-expressing regions showed no changes in CBF. These findings suggest that dysfunction in NOS or SOM neurons can have a significant impact on vascular responses that are detected by brain imaging methods like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).","Krawchuk, Michael B; Ruff, Catherine F; Yang, Xiaoling; Ross, Sarah E; Vazquez, Alberto L",J Cereb Blood Flow Metab,118,5

A ten-day online randomized controlled trial with the use of smartphone apps, engaging participants in mindfulness exercises, self-monitoring and mood tracking, was implemented amongst UK university students (n = 143). Participants were asked to complete online pre- and post-intervention assessments. Results indicated high effect sizes in reduction of smartphone distraction and improvement scores on a number of self-reported secondary psychological outcomes. The intervention was not effective in reducing habitual behaviours, nomophobia, or time spent on social media. Mediation analyses demonstrated that: (i) emotional self-awareness but not mindful attention mediated the relationship between intervention effects and smartphone distraction, and (ii) online vigilance mediated the relationship between smartphone distraction and problematic social media use. The present study provides preliminary evidence of the efficacy of an intervention for decreased smartphone distraction and highlights psychological processes involved in this emergent phenomenon in the smartphone literature. Online interventions may serve as complementary strategies to reduce distraction levels and promote insight into online engagement. More research is required to elucidate the mechanisms of digital distraction and assess its implications in problematic use.","Throuvala, Melina A.; Griffiths, Mark D.; Rennoldson, Mike; Kuss, Daria J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,118,5

However, agents specifically designed to treat rotavirus infection have not been developed yet. In this study, the anti-rotavirus and anti-inflammatory effects of genipin, a chemical compound found in the fruit of Gardenia jasminoides, were evaluated. Genipin had an antiviral effect against the human rotavirus Wa and SA-11 strains in vitro, and it inhibited two distinct stages of the viral replication cycle: attachment and penetration (early stage) in pre-treatment and assembly and release (late stage) in post-treatment. Additionally, genipin downregulated nitric oxide synthase and pro-inflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and rotavirus-infected Caco-2 cells. Oral administration of genipin before and after viral infection with the murine rotavirus epidemic diarrhea of infant mice strain led to a reduced duration of diarrhea and faecal viral shedding and to decreased destruction of the enteric epithelium. Genipin could have potential as a natural compound with preventive and therapeutic effects against infection and colitis caused by rotavirus.","Kim, Jong-Hwa; Kim, Kiyoung; Kim, Wonyong",Sci Rep,118,5

To investigate the differences in pathogenesis and epigenetic mechanisms between the two strains, differential expression and correlation analyses of the microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA in swine testicular (ST) cells infected with YN15, YN144, and mock were performed on three comparison groups (YN15 vs Control, YN144 vs Control, and YN15 vs YN144). The mRNA and miRNA expression profiles were obtained using next-generation sequencing (NGS), and the differentially expressed (DE) (p-value < 0.05) mRNA and miRNA were obtained using DESeq R package. mRNAs targeted by DE miRNAs were predicted using the miRanda algortithm. 8039, 8631 and 3310 DE mRNAs, and 36, 36, and 22 DE miRNAs were identified in the three comparison groups, respectively. 14,140, 15,367 and 3771 DE miRNA–mRNA (targeted by DE miRNAs) interaction pairs with negatively correlated expression patterns were identified, and interaction networks were constructed using Cytoscape. Six DE miRNAs and six DE mRNAs were randomly selected to verify the sequencing data by real-time relative quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).

The acceptance, intention to use, and learning outcomes of GC remain unclear in Taiwan. We sought to identify the technology acceptance level and factors affection the intention to use GC. We also explored how integrating GC into traditional teaching affects learning satisfaction and academic achievement among nursing students in Taiwan. METHODS: In this randomized controlled study, based on a technology acceptance framework, 74 nursing students were randomly assigned in clusters to experimental (n = 39) and control (n = 35) groups during the spring semester of 2018. In Weeks 3–18, each member of the experimental group received one hour of traditional and GC teaching per week. The control group received two hours of traditional teaching per week. Both groups were asked to complete questionnaires to evaluate learning satisfaction and academic achievement during weeks 10 (mid-semester) and 18 (end-of-semester). The experimental group additionally completed technology acceptance questionnaires in both situations. FINDINGS: In the experimental group, the overall end-of-semester technology acceptance score was high (141.8 out of 155); their perceived ease of use, intention to use, and technology acceptance scores increased significantly compared to mid-semester (p<0.05). At the end-of-semester, perceived playfulness and perceived usefulness explained 63.5% of the variance in intention to use. Regardless of whether the assessment was administered mid-semester or at the end-of-semester, the experimental group had higher learning satisfaction and academic achievement scores than the control group. However, the degree of progress on learning satisfaction and academic achievement demonstrated no significant between-group differences. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental group demonstrated high acceptance of GC. Playfulness and usefulness positively influenced nursing students’ intention to use GC. Blended learning—in combination with GC and traditional methods—resulted in similar learning satisfaction and academic achievement when compared to traditional learning. More research is needed to explore the effectiveness of blended learning through the GC platform with different courses and ethnic groups.","Huang, Tzu-Hao; Liu, Fen; Chen, Li-Chen; Tsai, Ching-Ching",PLoS One,118,5

Transcriptional orchestrators of this recovery process represent an appealing target for treatment design. We previously identified Prdm (positive regulatory domain-containing protein) 16 as an arterial-specific endothelial transcription factor but its in vivo role in arteries remains completely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To unravel the role of Prdm16 in arteries under physiological and pathological conditions, more specifically during peripheral artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Within the vasculature, Prdm16 expression was strictly confined to arterial endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Heterozygous loss of Prdm16 caused a modest reduction of the inner arterial diameter and smooth muscle cell coating without compromising vasomotor function. Upon femoral artery ligation, Prdm16(+/−) mice featured significantly impaired flow recovery to ischemic limbs. This impairment was recapitulated in mice with a Prdm16 deletion specifically in endothelial cells (EC-Prdm16(−/−)) but not smooth muscle cells. Structural collateral remodeling was normal in both Prdm16(+/−) and EC-Prdm16(−/−) mice, but significant endothelial dysfunction postligation was present in EC-Prdm16(−/−) mice as evidenced by impaired endothelial-dependent relaxation. Upon ligation, endothelial Prdm16 deficiency altered the expression of genes encoding endothelial cell function regulators, many related to nitric oxide bioavailability and Ca(2+) homeostasis. Accordingly, Prdm16 overexpression in cultured endothelial cells affected both total cellular Ca(2+) levels and store-operated Ca(2+) entry. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that Prdm16 is indispensable for arterial flow recovery under pathological challenge not because it affects structural remodeling but due to its role in maintaining endothelial function. It, therefore, represents an appealing target for designing novel therapeutic strategies for no-option patients with peripheral artery disease.","Craps, Sander; Van Wauwe, Jore; De Moudt, Sofie; De Munck, Dorien; Leloup, Arthur J.A.; Boeckx, Bram; Vervliet, Tim; Dheedene, Wouter; Criem, Nathan; Geeroms, Carla; Jones, Elizabeth A.V.; Zwijsen, An; Lambrechts, Diether; Fransen, Paul; Beerens, Manu; Luttun, Aernout",Circ Res,118,5

A reliable interactive tool describing cancer epidemiology in children and adolescents has been nonexistent in the Czech Republic until recently. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to develop a new web portal entitled the Czech Childhood Cancer Information System (CCCIS), which would provide information on childhood cancer epidemiology in the Czech Republic. METHODS: Data on childhood cancers have been obtained from the Czech National Cancer Registry. These data were validated using the clinical database of childhood cancer patients and subsequently combined with data from the National Register of Hospitalised Patients and with data from death certificates. These validated data were then used to determine the incidence and survival rates of childhood cancer patients aged 0 to 19 years who were diagnosed in the period 1994 to 2016 (N=9435). Data from death certificates were used to monitor long-term mortality trends. The technical solution is based on the robust PHP development Symfony framework, with the PostgreSQL system used to accommodate the data basis. RESULTS: The web portal has been available for anyone since November 2019, providing basic information for experts (ie, analyses and publications) on individual diagnostic groups of childhood cancers. It involves an interactive tool for analytical reporting, which provides information on the following basic topics in the form of graphs or tables: incidence, mortality, and overall survival. Feedback was obtained and the accuracy of outputs published on the CCCIS portal was verified using the following methods: the validation of the theoretical background and the user testing.

However, relatively little is known about the origins of and therapy for cardiac disease in pet rabbits. Dyspnea, murmurs, and arrhythmias are common clinical signs in rabbits with cardiac disease. However, rabbits with congestive heart failure may hide signs of illness until the disease has become severe. Unique physiologic characteristics (e.g., obligate nasal breathing and limited collateral circulation to the myocardium) predispose rabbits to collapse from stress and oxygen deprivation; therefore, oxygen supplementation and stabilization are priorities for the rabbit presenting in cardiorespiratory distress. The diagnostic workup for cardiac disease in rabbits is very similar to that for traditional pets and involves radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. Cardiomyopathy and valvular degeneration are relatively common forms of cardiac disease in rabbits, while congenital anomalies are rare. Use and dosing of therapeutic agents is extrapolated from dogs and cats. Spontaneous arteriosclerosis is prevalent in rabbits, with an historical incidence of up to 40% in large breeds.","J.

In the present work, a differential photoacoustic spectrometer (D-PAS) was developed for simultaneous, online measurements of aerosol optical absorption and NO(2) concentration. A novel photoacoustic resonator was designed and employed in the D-PAS for controlling a large flow rate, improving response time, and keeping the flow noise at a low level. The detection limits of 1.0 Mm(−1) and 0.87 ppb for aerosol absorption and NO(2) concentration measurements were achieved with a lock-in amplifier time constant of 1 s. The D-PAS accuracy was demonstrated by performing a long-time, continuous measurement of aerosol, and NO(2) in ambient air.

The chapter describes evolution of the PPP concept in the country and provides analysis of gaps and deficiencies in the current PPP policy and legislation. Five stages have been identified in the evolution of the government PPP policy: Stage One—PPP legal framework for foreign investors only (1991–1993); Stage Two—Lack of PPP-specific legal framework and “pilot” projects (1994–2005); Stage Three—The formation of legal and institutional frameworks (2006–2015); Stage Four—Active PPP deployment: the focus being on quantity (2016–2018); and Stage Five—Adjustments to the PPP framework: stricter requirements (2019–present). In addition to discussing what has been accomplished at each stage, the chapter delineates policy goals, provides assessment of progress, and identifies implications for further PPP policy development. The chapter suggests that focusing on the deployment of a larger number of adequately designed infrastructure PPPs at the national level is preferred, while the number of local-level small-scale PPPs should decrease.","Chikanayev, Shaimerden",Kazakhstan&#x02019;s Developmental Journey,118,1

COVID-19 posed challenges in terms of analgesia choice for reductions and altered follow-up arrangements. This study aimed to assess variance from the care pathway. METHOD: We performed a retrospective case note analysis of all emergency presentations with acute traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations at the MTC in Bristol from 01/04/2019-31/05/2019 to the same period in 2020 to analyse the effects of COVID-19 on management of these injuries. RESULTS: We identified 32 patients in 2019, and 24 in 2020. Entonox usage fell, in favour of Penthrox. Use of conscious sedation (requiring full PPE) remained around 20%. Pre- and post-reduction imaging was near 100% throughout. Referral to follow-up was 88% in 2019 but 38% in 2020. Those assessed in clinic during COVID-19, fewer were mobilised early or referred to outpatient physiotherapy compared to 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Acute management of anterior shoulder dislocations during COVID-19 was challenged by choice of suitable analgesia that limits AGPs, and limiting access to ’face-to-face’ follow-up. A key concern was a significant decrease in patient follow-up, thus limiting the access to optimal aftercare such as physiotherapy and further imaging.","Donovan, R; Abdelmalek, A; Crowther, M; Packham, I",Br J Surg,118,1

Alternately, immunologic response can be induced de novo against pediatric gliomas with mRNA cancer vaccines. Messenger RNA represents a paradigm shift in vaccinology (i.e. COVID-19) given its flexibility, commercialization, and propensity to confer rapid protection with only a single vaccine. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a new mRNA platform with an optimized backbone for insertion of both personalized and/or “off the shelf’ (i.e. H3K27M) transcripts for rapid induction of anti-tumor activity against pediatric gliomas. APPROACH: We synthesized an mRNA backbone with optimized 5’ and 3’ UTRs for delivery of gene transcripts pertinent to pediatric brain tumors using a lipid-nanoparticle (NP) delivery vehicle. This vaccine utilizes a novel engineering design that layers tumor derived mRNA into a lipid-nanoparticle (NP) “onion-like” or multi-lamellar package. RESULTS: We demonstrate immunogenicity of RNA-NPs delivering either personalized glioma mRNA or H3K27M mRNA. RNA-NPs localize to myeloid cells in murine KR158b brain tumors and activate dendritic cells that supplant regulatory intratumoral myeloid populations inducing antigen-recall response with long-term survivor benefit. Our optimized mRNA backbone yielded significantly improved anti-tumor efficacy compared with commercial backbones. We have shown this approach can be refined for co-delivery of immunomodulatory RNAs (i.e. GM-CSF) and/or delivery of siRNAs targeting immunoregulatory axes (PD-L1) in murine brain tumors (GL261). We have since established safety of RNA-NPs in acute/chronic murine GLP toxicity studies without cross-reactivity to normal-brain, and launched a large-animal canine brain tumor trial which demonstrated RNA-NPs to be feasible, safe and immunologically active. CONCLUSION: RNA-NPs reprogram the brain tumor microenvironment while inducing a glioma-specific immune response. We have since received FDA-IND approval for first-in-human trials (IND#BB-19304) in pediatric patients with high-grade gliomas (PNOC020 study, NCT04573140).","Mendez-Gomez, Hector; McGuiness, James; grippin, Adam; Weidert, Frances; Carrera-Justiz, Sheila; Mitchell, Duane; Sayour, Elias",Neuro Oncol,118,1

We reviewed the long-term mental health consequences of three major nuclear power plant accidents: the Three Mile Island (TMI, 1979), Chernobyl (1986), and Fukushima (2011) nuclear disasters. We examined the relevant prospective cohort studies and before-and-after studies that covered more than two timepoints, searching four databases (PubMed, Ichushi, PsyArticles, and PTSDPub). We identified a total of 35 studies: TMI, n = 11; Chernobyl, n = 6; and Fukushima, n = 18. The smaller numbers of early-phase studies (within 6 months) of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters may also indicate the chaotic situation at those timepoints, as large-scale interviews were conducted in the early phase after the TMI disaster. Although the patterns of effects on mental health outcomes were diverse, more than half of the participants in the studies we evaluated were categorized into low or under-threshold symptom groups in all three disasters. Across the three disasters, the radiation exposure level estimated by the proximity and stigma were the common risk factors for mental health outcomes. Our findings will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the worst nuclear accidents in history on the affected individuals’ mental health, and our results illustrate the longitudinal consequences of such disasters.","Oe, Misari; Takebayashi, Yui; Sato, Hideki; Maeda, Masaharu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,118,1

60355,60355,60355,Hunting with lead: association between blood lead levels and wild game consumption.,20.916426,2.808022,2009,"BACKGROUND sBIS, the variability of the Bispectral Index (BIS), sEMG, the variability of facial electromyogram power (EMG), and the Composite Variability Index (CVI) are 3 new measures of electroencephalogram and EMG variability. CVI is a single measure of the combined variability in BIS and EMG. We investigated whether increases in these variables are associated with intraoperative somatic responses. METHODS This multicenter study included 120 patients undergoing elective, noncardiac surgery from 4 different sites. General anesthesia was maintained using propofol and remifentanil at 2 of the sites and sevoflurane and remifentanil at the 2 other sites. Propofol or sevoflurane was adjusted to maintain BIS between 45 and 60. Clinicians were blinded to CVI (v2.0) at all times, and remifentanil infusions were adjusted at the discretion of the clinician. The times of all intraoperative somatic events, defined as movement, grimacing, or eye opening, were recorded. Offline, the maintenance phase of each case was divided into consecutive, nonoverlapping, 10-minute segments. Segments were identified as containing a somatic event or containing no events. For each segment, mean sBIS, sEMG, and CVI and the heart rate (HR) range and mean arterial blood pressure range were calculated. To quantify how effectively each variable discriminated between somatic event segments and nonevent segments, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each variable. Finally, we observed the time course of sBIS, sEMG, CVI, and the HR range before each somatic event and characterized the earliest time before the somatic event at which each variable was able to discriminate between the somatic events and a specified set of nonevents. RESULTS The analysis included 33 somatic event segments and 829 nonevent segments from 105 surgical cases. The areas under the ROC curve (±SE) for sBIS, sEMG, and CVI were 0.83 ± 0.04, 0.92 ± 0.02, and 0.89 ± 0.03, respectively. The areas under the ROC curve for HR range and mean arterial blood pressure range were 0.77 ± 0.03 and 0.68 ± 0.05, respectively. CVI, sBIS, and sEMG all demonstrated higher average values before upcoming somatic events when compared with nonevents. HR range only showed a difference within a few seconds before the somatic event. CONCLUSION sBIS, sEMG, and CVI, measures of electroencephalogram and EMG variability, increased when intraoperative somatic events occurred. sBIS, sEMG, and CVI discriminated between 10-minute segments that contained a somatic event and those segments that did not contain an event better than changes in HR and mean arterial blood pressure. Furthermore, CVI increases before somatic events began earlier than HR changes and may provide caregivers with an early warning of potentially inadequate antinociception.","Mathews, Donald M; Clark, Laura; Johansen, Jay; Matute, Emilio; Seshagiri, Chandran V",Anesthesia and analgesia,118,1

We retrospectively investigated treatment outcomes of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with both pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. METHODS Among 362 consecutive secondary spontaneous pneumothorax patients treated at our hospital from 2003 to 2012, 58 with emphysema-dominant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (all elderly men with a smoking history) were enrolled and divided into 2 groups based on computed tomography images: emphysema alone (n = 51) and coexisting emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis (n = 7). The clinical characteristics and mortality were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the recurrence rate after nonsurgical treatment. No patient died of pneumothorax-related complications, but one of 2 with pulmonary fibrosis who underwent surgery died of a postoperative respiratory complication. The mortality rate from respiratory failure during follow-up was significantly higher in the group with pulmonary fibrosis (6/7) than in the group without pulmonary fibrosis (11/51, p = 0.002). The median survival was 0.8 years in the group with pulmonary fibrosis vs. and 5.4 years in the group without pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS The coexistence of pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema on computed tomography images may represent a predictor of respiratory mortality in elderly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Because of the potential risk of respiratory failure, we recommend nonsurgical treatment for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with these radiological features.","Ota, Hideki; Kawai, Hideki; Matsuo, Tsubasa",Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals,118,1

DESIGN National cross-sectional study of current HNC surveillance practice. SETTING UK HNC outpatient departments. PARTICIPANTS HNC patients reviewed for post-treatment surveillance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Compliance with UK multidisciplinary guidelines, and rates of cancer recurrence detection by time, clinic type and symptoms. RESULTS Data were analysed from 5,123 consultations across 89 UK centres. 30% of consultations were in dedicated multidisciplinary clinics, with input from Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) available on the day in 23% of all consultations. Recurrence was suspected in 344 consultations and investigated with MRI in 29.6% (n=102) and PET-CT in 14.2% (n=49). Patient education regarding recurrence symptoms, and smoking and alcohol advice, was provided in 20.4%, 6.2%, and 5.3% of cases, respectively. Rates of recurrence detected were 35% in expedited appointments and 5.2% in planned follow-ups (p=0.0001). Of the expedited appointments, 63% were initiated by patients and 37% by clinicians. Recurrence was higher in those with new symptoms (7.1% versus 2.2%). The strongest predictors of recurrence were dyspnoea (positive predictive value (PPV)=16.2%), neck pain (PPV=10.4%) and mouth/throat pain (PPV=9.2%). CONCLUSIONS Dedicated multidisciplinary clinics comprise a minority of consultations for HNC surveillance in the UK, with low availability of AHPs. PET-CT and MRI were underutilised for the investigation of suspected recurrence. There may be scope for greater emphasis on patient education and consequent patient-initiated symptom driven follow-up.","Ellis, Matthew; Garas, George; Hardman, John; Khan, Maha; Mehanna, Hisham; Smith, Matthew E; Tikka, Theofano; Ubayasiri, Kishan; Williams, Richard",Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,118,16

Interestingly, as micro-vascular dysfunction typically precedes the onset of retinal vascular and even some neurodegenerative diseases, the ability to visualize and quantify hemodynamic changes (e.g. decreased flow or occlusion) in retinal vessels may serve as a useful diagnostic indicator of disease progression and as a therapeutic outcome measure in response to treatment. Nevertheless, the ability to precisely and accurately quantify retinal hemodynamics remains an unmet challenge in ophthalmic research.

Presently, COVID-19 is an unprecedented worldwide biohazard, and a nosocomial outbreak can occur in any hospital at any time. Therefore, we reviewed the literature regarding hospital preparedness, the initial management of COVID-19, and the surveillance of healthcare workers (HCWs) to find information that would be generally useful for physicians when confronted with COVID-19. In terms of hospital preparedness, each hospital should develop an incident management system and establish a designated multidisciplinary medical team. To initiate case management, COVID-19 should be suspected based on patient symptoms and/or high-risk history and then should be confirmed by viral testing, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Although some patients will become critically ill, the guidelines for respiratory failure and septic shock for non-COVID-19 cases can be followed for supportive treatment. Antiviral medications should be carefully selected because the available information is confused by the large volume of preprint literature and unreliable data. HCWs who have come into contact with patients with COVID-19 can generate new in-hospital clusters of COVID-19 cases. Quarantine following contact tracking with risk stratification is effective in preventing transmission, and the essentials of medical surveillance include monitoring different types of symptoms, delegation of supervision, and continuation of surveillance regardless of the RT-PCR results. Preparation for COVID-19 is recommended before the first COVID-19 case is encountered.","Kaito, Daiki; Matsumura, Kazuki; Yamamoto, Ryo",The Keio journal of medicine,118,1

COVID-19 patients are among those indicative for heparin treatment. Increased heparin administration among COVID-19 patients increased heparin induced-thrombocytopenia's risk with/without thrombocytopenia. Case presentation: We present a 71-year-old male patient who came to the emergency room (ER) with a COVID-19 clinical manifestation followed by positive PCR nasopharyngeal swab result. He was assessed to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as shown by rapid progression of hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrate. He was then treated with moxifloxacin, remdesivir, dexamethasone, unfractionated heparin (UFH) pump, and multivitamins. During admission, his respiratory symptoms got worse, so he transferred to the ICU for NIV support. On the ninth day of admission, he had gross hematuria followed by a rapid fall of platelet count. We used two different scoring systems (4Ts and HEP scoring system) to confirm the diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Following the discontinuation of UFH injection, the thrombocyte continued to rise, and hematuria disappeared. Conclusion: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is associated with an increased risk of severe disease and mortality among COVID-19 patients. The differential diagnosis of HIT could be difficult as thrombocytopenia can also be caused by the progression of infection. We use two scoring systems (4Ts and HEP scoring) in order to help us managing the patient. These could improve the outcomes, thus avoiding morbidity and mortality.","Wardhani, Louisa Fadjri Kusuma; Dewi, Ivana Purnama; Suwanto, Denny; Ambari, Ade Meidian; Ardiana, Meity",F1000Research,118,1

Efforts to minimize this injury are typically limited by the need to preserve adequate gas exchange. In the most severe forms of the syndrome, extracorporeal life support is increasingly being deployed for severe hypoxemia or hypercapnic acidosis refractory to conventional ventilator management strategies. Data from a recent randomized controlled trial, a post-hoc analysis of that trial, a meta-analysis, and a large, international, multicenter observational study, all suggest that extracorporeal life support, when combined with lower tidal volumes and airway pressures than the current standard of care, may improve outcomes compared with conventional management in patients with the most severe forms of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. These findings raise important questions not only about the optimal ventilator strategies for patients receiving extracorporeal support, but how various mechanisms of lung injury in the acute respiratory distress syndrome may potentially be mitigated by ultra-lung-protective ventilation strategies when gas exchange is sufficiently managed with the extracorporeal circuit. Additional studies are needed to more precisely delineate the best strategies for optimizing invasive mechanical ventilation in this patient population.","Abrams, Darryl; Schmidt, Matthieu; Pham, Tài; Beitler, Jeremy R; Fan, Eddy; Goligher, Ewan C; McNamee, James J; Patroniti, Nicolò; Wilcox, M Elizabeth; Combes, Alain; Ferguson, Niall D; McAuley, Danny F; Pesenti, Antonio; Quintel, Michael; Fraser, John; Hodgson, Carol L; Hough, Catherine L; Mercat, Alain; Mueller, Thomas; Pellegrino, Vin; Ranieri, V Marco; Rowan, Kathy; Shekar, Kiran; Brochard, Laurent; Brodie, Daniel",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,118,1

Over the past 4 years, considerable international experience has been gained with this approach. Most published reports focus on TAMIS for local excision of rectal neoplasia, but there are other important applications such as transanal mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. This comprehensive review details the progress with TAMIS since its inception. Robotic transanal surgery is a natural evolution of TAMIS still in its early infancy, which is also reviewed. A comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge was performed. Since the inception of TAMIS in 2009, 33 retrospective studies and case reports, and 3 abstracts have been published on TAMIS for local excision of rectal neoplasms, which represents a combined n = 390 TAMIS procedures performed worldwide using eight different types of TAMIS platforms. A total of 152 lesions were excised for benign disease including adenomas and high-grade dysplasias (39 %), 209 for malignancy for carcinomas in situ and adenocarcinomas (53.5 %). Twenty-nine (7.5 %) of TAMIS resections were for other pathology, of which the majority (23/29) were neuroendocrine lesions. The remaining resections were for mucocele, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, melanoma, and fibrosis. Robotic-TAMIS has also been reported, however, data are extremely limited as there are only 7 case reports (combined n = 11) in the published literature. Success with Robotic-TAMIS has been demonstrated with various patient positions and by use of a special glove port.

In this systematic review, we aim to identify and evaluate the literature documenting the outcomes associated with non-pharmacological interventions to improve nighttime sleep among long-term care residents. METHODS The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guided searches of five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) for articles reporting results of experimental or quasi-experimental studies conducted in long-term care settings (nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, or group homes) in which nighttime sleep was subjectively or objectively measured as a primary outcome. We categorized each intervention by its intended use and how it was administered. RESULTS Of the 54 included studies evaluating the effects of 25 different non-pharmacological interventions, more than half employed a randomized controlled trial design (n = 30); the others used a pre-post design with (n = 11) or without (n = 13) a comparison group. The majority of randomized controlled trials were at low risk for most types of bias, and most other studies met the standard quality criteria. The interventions were categorized as environmental interventions (n = 14), complementary health practices (n = 12), social/physical stimulation (n = 11), clinical care practices (n = 3), or mind-body practices (n = 3). Although there was no clear pattern of positive findings, three interventions had the most promising results: increased daytime light exposure, nighttime use of melatonin, and acupressure. CONCLUSIONS Non-pharmacological interventions have the potential to improve sleep for residents of long-term care facilities. Further research is needed to better standardize such interventions and provide clear implementation guidelines using cost-effective practices.","Capezuti, Elizabeth; Sagha Zadeh, Rana; Pain, Kevin; Basara, Aleksa; Jiang, Nancy Ziyan; Krieger, Ana C",BMC geriatrics,118,23

OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of freshly isolated adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (A-SVF) and bone marrow cells (BMC) cells in achieving spinal fusion in a rat model. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs) offer advantages as a clinical cell source compared to bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs), including larger available tissue volumes and reduced donor site morbidity. While pre-clinical studies have shown that ex vivo expanded ASCs can be successfully used in spinal fusion, the use of A-SVF cells better allows for clinical translation. METHODS A-SVF cells were isolated from the inguinal fat pads, while BMC were isolated from the long bones of syngeneic 6-8-week-old Lewis rats and combined with Vitoss (Stryker) bone graft substitute for subsequent transplantation. Posterolateral spinal fusion surgery at L4-L5 was performed on 36 female Lewis rats divided into 3 experimental groups: [1] Vitoss bone graft substitute only (VO group); [2] Vitoss + 2.5x10 A-SVF cells/side; and, [3] Vitoss + 2.5x10 BMC/side. Fusion was assessed eight weeks post-surgery via manual palpation, micro-computed tomography (μCT) imaging, and histology. RESULTS μCT imaging analyses revealed that fusion volumes and μCT fusion scores in the A-SVF group were significantly higher than in the VO group; however, they were not significantly different between the A-SVF group and the BMC group. The average manual palpation score was highest in the A-SVF group compared with the BMC and VO groups. Fusion masses arising from cell-seeded implants yielded better bone quality than non-seeded bone graft substitute. CONCLUSIONS In a rat model, A-SVF cells yielded a comparable fusion mass volume and radiographic rate of fusion to BMC when combined with a clinical-grade bone graft substitute. These results suggest the feasibility of using freshly isolated A-SVF cells in spinal fusion procedures.

We here propose a refined approach for clinicogenetic diagnosis by including protein modeling and provide for confirmed SCA-PRKCG a comprehensive phenotype description from a German multi-center cohort, including standardized 3D MR imaging. METHODS This cross-sectional study prospectively obtained neurological, neuropsychological, and brain imaging data in 33 PRKCG variant carriers. Protein modeling was added as a classification criterion in variants of uncertain significance (VUS). RESULTS Our sample included 25 cases confirmed as SCA-PRKCG (14 variants, thereof seven novel variants) and eight carriers of variants assigned as VUS (four variants) or benign/likely benign (two variants). Phenotype in SCA-PRKCG included slowly progressive ataxia (onset at 4-50 years), preceded in some by early-onset nonprogressive symptoms. Ataxia was often combined with action myoclonus, dystonia, or mild cognitive-affective disturbance. Inspection of brain MRI revealed nonprogressive cerebellar atrophy. As a novel finding, a previously not described T2 hyperintense dentate nucleus was seen in all SCA-PRKCG cases but in none of the controls. INTERPRETATION In this largest cohort to date, SCA-PRKCG was characterized as a slowly progressive cerebellar syndrome with some clinical and imaging features suggestive of a developmental disorder. The observed non-ataxia movement disorders and cognitive-affective disturbance may well be attributed to cerebellar pathology. Protein modeling emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool for variant classification and the newly described T2 hyperintense dentate sign could serve as a supportive diagnostic marker of SCA-PRKCG.","Schmitz-Hübsch, Tanja; Lux, Silke; Bauer, Peter; Brandt, Alexander U; Schlapakow, Elena; Greschus, Susanne; Scheel, Michael; Gärtner, Hanna; Kirlangic, Mehmet E; Gras, Vincent; Timmann, Dagmar; Synofzik, Matthis; Giorgetti, Alejandro; Carloni, Paolo; Shah, Jon N; Schöls, Ludger; Kopp, Ute; Bußenius, Lisa; Oberwahrenbrock, Timm; Zimmermann, Hanna; Pfueller, Caspar; Kadas, Ella-Maria; Rönnefarth, Maria; Grosch, Anne-Sophie; Endres, Matthias; Amunts, Katrin; Paul, Friedemann; Doss, Sarah; Minnerop, Martina",Annals of clinical and translational neurology,118,5

In attempts to ameliorate poorer student outcomes, some states have investigated the impact of mental health on those enrolled in higher education as well as the needs for supports and services for those impacted (e.g., Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission [OHECC], Office of Academic Policy and Authorization, 2018). However, despite these initiatives, limited empirical research is available related to the lived experiences of individuals with mental health challenges in higher education settings; including the supports and barriers they may experience while navigating these complex settings. This study begins to address this knowledge gap by using qualitative content analysis to examine and compare key stakeholder lived experiences related to mental health challenges in higher education, including the similarities and differences regarding service and support needs, determinants to usage (support and barriers), and recommendations for future research and improving the continuum of care.

The study aimed to evaluate the hygienic condition of post-handwashing facilities in public washrooms at different timeslots, particularly those near food courts and restaurants located in shopping malls. METHODS This observational study was conducted in 12 public washrooms that ranged from low-end, middle-end, to high-end category on three different timeslots including baseline, T1 (immediate post-cleaning) and T2 (one-hour post-cleaning, with counting the footfall). Hand-touch surfaces with a high risk of recontamination after handwashing, which included paper tower dispensers, air drying outlets, and exit door handles, were evaluated by the surface adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence method (ATP-value). ATP-values <500 relative light units (RLUs) were considered a good hygiene. Cleaning schedules and footfalls of each sampled washroom were obtained by direct observations. RESULTS The overall mean ATP value of washroom was 785 RLU (N = 108); the ATP values of female and male washrooms at T2 were 203 and 3,718 RLUs, respectively. The highest ATP value was found on the exit door handles of male washrooms (range=13 to 26,695 RLUs, mean=3,229 RLU). Regarding passed/failed hygiene conditions, there were significant differences in the proportion of exit door handles between genders (p=0.018) and timeslots (p=0.007) as well as that of paper towel button/screw between timeslots (p=0.025). CONCLUSION Attention should be paid at the exit door handles of male washrooms, where are high risks of cross and re-contamination.","Cheung, Matthew Man Fai; Suen, Lorna Kwai Ping; Au, Jessie Kit Ling; Lam, Simon Ching",American journal of infection control,118,11

Patients with breast cancer lesions that express IGF-1R may benefit from treatment with anti-IGF-1R antibodies. IGF-1R expression can be visualized using radiolabeled R1507, a monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-1R. However, antibodies clear slowly from the circulation, resulting in low tumor-to-background ratios early after injection. Therefore, we aimed to accelerate targeting of IGF-1R using radiolabeled R1507 F(ab')2 and Fab fragments. In vitro, immunoreactivity, binding affinity and internalization of R1507 IgG, F(ab')2 and Fab were determined using the triple negative IGF-1R-expressing breast cancer cell line SUM149. In vivo, pharmacokinetics of (111)In-labeled R1507 IgG, F(ab')2 and Fab were studied in mice bearing subcutaneous SUM149 xenografts. SPECT/CT images were acquired and the biodistribution was measured ex vivo. The in vitro binding characteristics of radiolabeled R1507 IgG and F(ab')2 were comparable, whereas the affinity of Fab fragments was significantly lower (Kd: 0.6 nM, 0.7 nM and 3.0 nM for R1507 IgG, F(ab')2 and Fab, respectively). Biodistribution studies showed that the maximum tumor uptake of (111)In-R1507 IgG, F(ab')2 and Fab was 31.8% ID/g (72 h p.i.), 10.0% ID/g (6 h p.i.), and 1.8% ID/g (1 h p.i.), respectively. However, maximal tumor-to-blood ratios for F(ab')2 (24 h p.i.: 7.5) were more than twice as high as those obtained with R1507 (72 h p.i.: 2.8) and Fab (6 h p.i.: 2.8). Injection of an excess of unlabeled R1507 significantly reduced tumor uptake, suggesting that the uptake of R1507 IgG and F(ab')2 was specific for IGF-1R, while the major fraction of the tumor uptake of Fab was nonspecific. IGF-1R-expressing xenografts were visualized with (111)In-F(ab')2 SPECT/CT as early as 6 h p.i., while with R1507 IgG, the tumor could be visualized after 24 h. No specific targeting was observed with (111)In-Fab. (111)In-F(ab')2 fragments showed improved targeting of IGF-1R expressing tumors. Tumor-to-blood ratios were twice as high as those obtained with (111)In-R1507, and adequate tumor targeting on SPECT/CT images was observed as early as 6 h p.i. For individualization and optimization of IGF-1R targeted therapy, (111)In-F(ab')2 may be the tracer of choice.","Heskamp, Sandra; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M; Molkenboer-Kuenen, Janneke D M; Bouwman, Wilbert H; van der Graaf, Winette T A; Oyen, Wim J G; Boerman, Otto C",Molecular pharmaceutics,118,11

Studies reporting personal exposure concentrations of air pollutants in WFS during fire suppression or prescribed burn activities have been geographically limited to the western and southeastern United States. The objective of this study is to characterize exposure concentrations of air pollutants in WFS emissions among wildland firefighters who conducted prescribed burns in the Midwest. Between 2016 and 2019, a total of 35 firefighters (31 males and 4 females, age of 35.63 ± 9.31 years) were recruited to participate in this study. Personal particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) exposure concentrations were measured during prescribed burns. The level of black carbon (BC) in WFS particulates was determined using the light transmission technique, while trace metal composition was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed geometric means for PM2.5, CO, and BC concentrations were 1.43 ± 0.13 mg/m3, 7.02 ± 0.69 ppm, and 58.79 ± 5.46 μg/m3, respectively. Although no occupational exposure limits (OELs) were exceeded by 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) exposure concentration observed in the firefighters, a total of 28 personal CO exposure concentrations were above the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) Ceiling (200 ppm) for CO. PM2.5 and CO concentrations were about 2-7 times higher in the Midwest than the other regions. Firefighters who performed holding had higher CO exposure concentrations compared to firefighters who performed lighting (p < 0.01), while lighters were exposed to higher level of BC in the smoke particulates (p < 0.01), possibly due to the domination of exposure by different combustion sources and stages. The levels of trace metals in WFS particulates were well below the corresponding OELs and no task-related difference was observed except for manganese. Our results suggest that wildland firefighters in the midwestern region have higher WFS exposures while working at prescribed burns compared to those western and southeastern United States.","Wu, Chieh-Ming; Song, Chi Chuck; Chartier, Ryan; Kremer, Jacob; Naeher, Luke; Adetona, Olorunfemi",Environmental research,118,27

Rheumatic manifestations, such as a seronegative non-erosive polyarthritis have been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics and the prevalence of rheumatic features in thyroiditis patients, and to ascertain whether the association with systemic autoimmune disorders improved the arthritis manifestations. METHODS In total, 180 thyroiditis patients were enrolled. Major clinical and demographic characteristics have been recorded. Patients underwent a rheumatological clinical assessment and extra-articular manifestations allowing for a differential diagnosis with systemic autoimmune diseases and spondyloarthropathy. Presence of systemic autoimmune diseases was recorded. RESULTS A total of 8.33% of thyroiditis patients shown a peripheral inflammatory arthritis (P = 0.002). Female gender (P = 0.042) and thyroid peroxidase (TPOAbs) positivity (P = 0.001) were more frequent. In total, 37 patients had systemic autoimmune diseases (P = 0.0003). A significant high prevalence of coeliac disease and Addison disease was found (P = 0.034 and P = 0.049, respectively). In patients with coeliac disease, the articular manifestations were more frequent (21.21%) (P = 0.001) and the risk to develop joint involvement was 2.96. CONCLUSION Although we found an articular involvement in about one-third of thyroiditis patients, the prevalence of inflammatory arthropathy was only 8.33%. The prevalence of other coexisting autoimmune disorders was 34.26% with a significant prevalence of coeliac disease (7.41%). Thyroiditis patients with coeliac disease have an articular involvement more frequently than those without. In these patients, we have found a high risk of developing arthritis than patients with only thyroiditis, suggesting cumulative autoimmune effects in the developing articular involvement.","Lupoli, Gelsy Arianna; Tasso, Marco; Costa, Luisa; Caso, Francesco; Scarpa, Raffaele; Del Puente, Antonio; Peluso, Rosario",Rheumatology,118,13

We report the clinical application of this technique and present preliminary data that show TAMIS to be an effective tool for resection of both malignant and benign lesions of the rectum. METHODS Over a 3-month period (May-July 2009) all patients with rectal lesions who were candidates for conventional transanal excision were offered the option to undergo TAMIS resection. Patients with biopsy-proven malignant lesions were required to undergo endorectal ultrasound preoperatively to determine tumor stage. To perform TAMIS, a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port (SILS Port, Covidien) is introduced into the anal canal by applying steady manual pressure. Once seated in position, endoscopic access to the rectal vault is gained and pneumorectum is established. With this access, ordinary laparoscopic instruments, including graspers, thermal energy devices, and needle drives, are used to perform the transanal excisions. RESULTS Six patients, aged 43-85 years old (mean = 59.8), underwent TAMIS resection of rectal lesions. The average distance from the anal verge was 9.3 cm and the mean tumor diameter confirmed by pathology measured 2.93 cm. There were no conversions from TAMIS to conventional transanal excision. While the average operating time was 86 min, four of the six TAMIS resections (67%) were completed in less than 1 h. The mean set-up time was only 1.9 min and this may be one reason that the mean operative time was considerably less than the average operative time for TEM surgery (120-140 min). In short-term follow-up, there was no morbidity or mortality observed. CONCLUSIONS TAMIS is a feasible alternative to TEM, providing its benefits at a fraction of the cost.","Atallah, Sam; Albert, Matthew; Larach, Sergio",Surgical endoscopy,118,1

As the number of laparoscopic appendectomies performed by surgical trainees has increased, we are trying to check the stability of, which is controversial, and the learning curve associated with a laparoscopic appendectomy. METHODS We studied the demographics, histologic diagnoses, operative time, the number of complicated cases, and hospital duration of one hundred and three patients who underwent an open appendectomy (group A, 53) or a laparoscopic appendectomy (group B, 50) retrospectively through a review of their medical records. The learning curve for the laparoscopic appendectomy was established through the moving average and ANOVA methods. RESULTS There were no differences in the operative times (A, 64.15 ± 29.88 minutes; B, 58.2 ± 20.72 minutes; P-value, 0.225) and complications (A, 11%; B, 6%; P-value, 0.34) between group A and group B. Group B was divided into group C who underwent the operation in the early period (before the learning curve) and group D who underwent the operation in the later period (after the learning curve). The average operative time for group C was 66.83 ± 21.55 minutes, but it was 45.25 ± 10.19 minutes for group D (P-value < 0.0001). Although this difference was statistically significant, no significant difference in the complication rate was observed between the two groups.

These patients often require specialized testing not available from commercial manufacturers and are therefore dependent on the laboratory to create, validate, and perform these assays. Recent paradigm-shifting legislation could alter the way that LDTs are operationalized and regulated. RECENT FINDINGS On March 5th, 2020 the Verifying Accurate and Leading-Edge In-Vitro Clinical Tests Development Act (VALID) was introduced in the US Congress. This statute would overhaul existing regulatory framework by unifying the oversight of LDTs and commercial in-vitro diagnostic tests (IVDs) through the FDA. If enacted, LDTs would be subject to regulatory requirements like those found in commercial submissions for market review. Stakeholders continue to discuss the details and scope of the proposed legislation in the setting of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic, where LDTs are integral to the national COVID-19 response. SUMMARY Congressional lawmakers have introduced legislation to alter the regulatory framework governing LDTs. Moving forward, a balance must be struck to ensure the availability of safe and accurate testing without delays or overregulation that could be harmful to patients. The downstream implications of how VALID and other legislation will impact laboratories, clinicians, and patients warrant close examination.","Clark, Andrew E; Levy, Jaclyn; Lee, Francesca M",Current opinion in infectious diseases,118,8

However, this method has not yet been validated in clinical trials. The aim of this study was to compare the short-term outcomes of transanal and laparoscopic (lap) TME. METHODS From October 2013 to January 2015, consecutive patients undergoing transanal or laparoscopic TME for biopsy-proven mrT1-4aN0-2M0 rectal cancer were included in a prospective database. Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2 and higher and patients undergoing partial mesorectal excision were excluded. This analysis focused on short-term surgical outcomes. RESULTS From October 2013 to January 2015, 22 taTME procedures and 23 laparoscopic TME procedures were performed. Patient characteristics were comparable between groups, but more patients in the taTME group underwent neoadjuvant (chemo) radiotherapy (87 vs. 48 %, p = 0.006). Median operative time was 320 min in the taTME group and 305 min in the lapTME group. There was one conversion in each group, but the transanal procedure was converted to laparoscopic resection. Transanal specimen extraction was performed in 86 versus 48 % patients in taTME and lapTME groups accordingly (p = 0.021). There was no post-operative mortality and post-operative morbidity in the taTME and lapTME groups was similar (27 vs. 26 %). One patient in the taTME group had positive circumferential resection margins. Oncologic results from resected specimens were comparable. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience demonstrates comparable short-term results for taTME and lap TME. Further investigation is necessary to assess long-term functional and oncologic outcomes.","Rasulov, A O; Mamedli, Z Z; Gordeyev, S S; Kozlov, N A; Dzhumabaev, H E",Techniques in coloproctology,118,1

Vertical transmission is an area of interest among researchers studying infectious diseases, including prion disease, and these investigations require efficient methods for evaluating the effects of maternal infection on reproductive performance. Ultrasonographic examination is a well-established tool for diagnosing pregnancy and assessing fetal health in many animal species(1-7), including several species of farmed cervids(8-19), however this technique has not been described in Reeves' muntjac deer. Here we describe the application of transabdominal ultrasound to detect pregnancy in muntjac does and to evaluate fetal growth and development throughout the gestational period. Using this procedure, pregnant animals were identified as early as 35 days following doe-buck pairing and this was an effective means to safely monitor the pregnancy at regular intervals. Future goals of this work will include establishing normal fetal measurement references for estimation of gestational age, determining sensitivity and specificity of the technique for diagnosing pregnancy at various stages of gestation, and identifying variations in fetal growth and development under different experimental conditions.","Walton, Kelly D; McNulty, Erin; Nalls, Amy V; Mathiason, Candace K",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,118,16

Prior to identifying that the cat was male, both ureters were transected approximately 4 mm from the renal pelves. Initial management involved a left-sided Boari flap neoureterocystostomy, cystonephropexy and right ureteronephrectomy. Thirty-six hours later, the cat developed uroabdomen due to leakage from the neoureterocystostomy site. At a tertiary referral institution, the ureter was reconstructed via end-to-end anastomosis and a left-sided subcutaneous ureteral bypass (SUB) device was placed in the event the anastomosis failed. Five weeks after SUB placement, the cat was dysuric and stranguric. A urine culture was negative and clinical signs were attributed to sterile cystitis secondary to device placement. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 22 mg/dl and creatinine was 1.2 mg/dl. Contrast pyelography confirmed device patency, but no contrast was identified through the ureteral anastomosis. At 12 months, BUN and creatinine were 1.5 mg/dl and 25 mg/dl, respectively, and a subclinical urinary tract infection was identified (Enterococcus faecalis). Antibiotic therapy was not prescribed in order to prevent multidrug resistance. At 42 months, BUN was 38 mg/dl and creatinine was 2.0 mg/dl. The cat had occasional and intermittent signs of pollakiuria and stranguria but was otherwise doing well. Relevance and novel information To our knowledge, this is the first case report to describe the use of a SUB device for management of traumatic proximal ureteral injury in a cat with one kidney. The case outcome provides valuable information about the direct effect of the SUB device and the presence of chronic Enterococcus species infection on long-term renal function.","Sapora, Joseph A; Hardie, Robert J; Evans, Natashia",JFMS open reports,118,1

Betacoronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are not thought to be seasonal. METHODS We examined climate data from cities with significant community spread of COVID-19 using ERA-5 reanalysis, and compared to areas that are either not affected, or do not have significant community spread. FINDINGS To date, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has established significant community spread in cities and regions along a narrow east west distribution roughly along the 30-50o N' corridor at consistently similar weather patterns consisting of average temperatures of 5-11oC, combined with low specific (3-6 g/kg) and absolute humidity (4-7 g/m3). There has been a lack of significant community establishment in expected locations that are based only on population proximity and extensive population interaction through travel. INTERPRETATION The distribution of significant community outbreaks along restricted latitude, temperature, and humidity are consistent with the behavior of a seasonal respiratory virus. Additionally, we have proposed a simplified model that shows a zone at increased risk for COVID-19 spread. Using weather modeling, it may be possible to predict the regions most likely to be at higher risk of significant community spread of COVID-19 in the upcoming weeks, allowing for concentration of public health efforts on surveillance and containment.","Sajadi, Mohammad M; Habibzadeh, Parham; Vintzileos, Augustin; Shokouhi, Shervin; Miralles-Wilhelm, Fernando; Amoroso, Anthony",SSRN,118,16

DESIGN Observational cohort study. SETTING Acute-care university hospital. PATIENTS The study included 963 adult patients hospitalized over a 4-year surveillance period. METHODS Annual surveillance timelines were defined according to epidemiological criteria related to the circulation of RSV and influenza viruses in the general population. Patients were screened following a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) case definition at the emergency department and were enrolled for molecular assay targeting influenza/RSV viruses after oral informed consent. Epidemiological and clinical data were recorded prospectively, microbiological investigations, antimicrobial management, and outcome data were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS An influenza or RSV virus was documented in 316 of 963 patients (33%). Optimization of antimicrobial management (AM) was achieved in 162 of 265 patients (61%) with a positive viral diagnosis and no bacterial infection at admission (AM treatment not initiated, n = 111; discontinued, n = 51). In contrast, only 128 of 462 patients (28%) with negative microbiological investigations did not have AM treatment initiated (n = 116) or had such treatment discontinued (n = 12). Early, targeted antiviral treatment was prescribed in 235 of 253 patients (93%) confirmed with influenza. Epidemiological, clinical, and outcome data were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION Epidemiological surveillance associated with influenza/RSV molecular diagnosis in adults hospitalized for severe winter respiratory infections dramatically enhanced antimicrobial management.","Bourgeois, Marc; Ausselet, Nathalie; Gerard, Veronique; de Canniere, Louis; Scius, Nathan; Michaux, Isabelle; Huang, Te-Din; Bogaerts, Pierre; Vandamme, Charlotte; Bihin, Benoît; Delaere, Benedicte",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,118,20

We therefore studied ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in lung tissue samples of patients with and without diabetes that were collected between 2002 and 2020 from patients undergoing lobectomy for lung tumors. For RT-PCR analyses, samples from 15 subjects with diabetes were compared to 91 randomly chosen control samples. For immunohistochemical staining, samples from 26 subjects with diabetes were compared to 66 randomly chosen control samples. mRNA expression of ACE2 was measured by quantitative RT-PCR.

Pulmonary ACE2 mRNA expression was not different between subjects with or without diabetes. In contrast, protein levels of ACE2 were significantly increased in both alveolar tissue and bronchial epithelium of patients with diabetes as compared with control subjects, independent of smoking, COPD, BMI, RAAS-inhibitor use and other potential confounders. To conclude, we show increased bronchial and alveolar ACE2 protein expression in patients with diabetes.

This forced students on a core emergency medicine (EM) rotation at McMaster University to immediately cease all in-person activities. An urgent need for a virtual curriculum emerged. Methods A virtual curriculum consisting of asynchronous case-based learning on Slack, ask-me-anything webinars, and online e-modules was created to fill the need. We describe a program evaluation using the RE-AIM framework and a social networking analysis of participants. Results Medical students (n = 23) and 11 facilitators (five residents, six faculty members) participated in this pilot study. Faculty members sent a mean (±SD) of 115 (±117) messages (n = 6), and mean (±SD) message counts for students and residents were 49.96 (±25; n = 23) and 39 (±38; n = 5), respectively. A total of 62,237 words were written by the participants, with a mean of 1,831 per person. Each message consisted of a mean (±SD) of 25 words (±29). Students rapidly acquitted themselves to digital technology. Using the RE-AIM framework we highlight the feasibility of a virtual curriculum, discuss demands on faculty time, and reflect on strategies to engage learners.

Results showed a significant positive linear relationship between the population density and cases, deaths, and case-fatality rate. No correlation with the ageing index was shown. Furthermore, we found a significant positive correlation between the number of medical supplies and population density, cases, and deaths.

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been shown to acutely impair neurogenesis. To further investigate the relationship between sustained IL-1β expression and adult neurogenesis, a mouse model with an IL-1β excisionally activated transgene, IL-1β(XAT), was utilized. Upon exposure to Cre recombinase, IL-1β overexpression in this model results in chronic neuroinflammation, which persists up to 12 months and causes glial activation, cellular recruitment, and deficits in learning and memory. We hypothesized that adult neurogenesis would be reduced by sustained hippocampal IL-1β overexpression and rescued by voluntary running, which has been shown to enhance neurogenesis. Hippocampal inflammation in the IL-1β(XAT) model severely impaired doublecortin (DCX) positive cells at 1 and 3 months after IL-1β induction. Furthermore, BrdU labeling demonstrated a shift in cell lineage from neuronal to astroglial in the context of sustained hippocampal IL-1β overexpression. Deletion of the IL-1 receptor prevented the decrease in DCX(+) cells. Voluntary running did not attenuate the effects of IL-1β expression demonstrated by DCX staining. These results suggest that chronic neuroinflammation severely impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis and voluntary running is not beneficial as a therapy to rescue these effects.","Wu, Michael D; Hein, Amy M; Moravan, Michael J; Shaftel, Solomon S; Olschowka, John A; O'Banion, M Kerry","Brain, behavior, and immunity",118,29

The 3D structures allow desired plasmonic patterns on their inner cylindrical walls forming the nanofluidic channels. The nanocylinders bridge nanoplasmonics and nanofluidics by achieving electromagnetic field enhancement and fluid confinement simultaneously. This hybrid system enables rapid diffusion of targeted species to the larger spatial hotspots in the 3D plasmonic structures, leading to enhanced interactions that contributes to a higher sensitivity. This concept has been demonstrated by characterizing an optical response of the 3D plasmonic nanostructures using Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which shows enhancement over a 22 times higher intensity for hemoglobin fingerprints with nanocylinders compared to 2D nanostructures.","Dai, Chunhui; Lin, Zihao; Agarwal, Kriti; Mikheal, Carol; Aich, Anupam; Gupta, Kalpna; Cho, Jeong-Hyun",Nano letters,118,2

Therefore, we compared the complications and technical effectiveness of renal RFA guided by ultrasound alone versus combined CT and ultrasound guidance. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed outcomes and complications of percutaneous renal RFA in two groups of patients for whom RFA was guided by either ultrasound alone (group 1) or combined CT and ultrasound (group 2). The sole factor in determining the method of guidance was preablation imaging. All other technical factors were consistent between the two groups. RESULTS There were 28 masses in 27 patients in group 1 and 32 masses in 29 patients in group 2. There was an overall major complication rate of 3.3% (2/60). Major complications occurred equally in group 2 (3.1% [1/32]) compared with group 1 (3.6% [1/28]). Overall ablative effectiveness was 93% (26/28) in group 1 and 84% (27/32) in group 2. There was no statistical difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION In proper hands, sonography guidance alone is a safe and effective method for performance of renal RFA in preselected cases and can decrease CT utilization. The use of CT is reserved for situations in which pretreatment RFA imaging suggests difficulty in ultrasound mass visualization or when the mass is in close proximity to structures that may be injured by thermal ablation.","McGahan, John P; Loh, Shaun; Fitzgerald, Evan; Koppie, Theresa; Evans, Christopher P; Dall'Era, Marc; Li, Chin-Shang",AJR.

We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on a tertiary referral centre for spinal surgery in England. Methods An 82-day study period from 20th March 2020 to 10th June 2020 was used, and all spinal surgical patients were followed up prospectively, comparing patients from the same date range in 2019. We assessed rate of COVID transmission, 30-day mortality rates, complication rates and length of hospital stay in a large tertiary Teaching hospital in England. Results Seventy-eight patients were operated on during the COVID-19 pandemic period, with a 30-day mortality rate of 4.2%. Two of these deaths were attributable to COVID-19 (2.56%). The mean length of stay was 10.8 days. Neither the 30-day mortality rate or the length of stay was statistically significant compared to the 2019 control period.

OBJECTIVE NFATc2 has been described to associate with IRF4 to induce interleukin-4, and to be inhibited by T-bet. Here, we analyzed the role of NFATc2 in asthmatic children and adults. METHODS PBMCs were isolated from the blood of control of asthmatics subjects. Some PBMCs were analyzed untreated and some cultured with and without phytohemagglutinin. Then, RNA was extracted from the cells and cytokines were measured in the supernatants via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or multiplex analysis. RNA was then reverse-transcribed and NFATc1, NFATC2, IRF4, and T-bet mRNA were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. In addition, in peripheral blood cells, NFATc2 expression was analyzed, in a population of asthmatic children and adults from the Asthma BRIDGE study. RESULTS In addition to NFATc1 and NIP45, also NFATc2 was found upregulated in PBMCs and peripheral blood cells from asthmatic children and adults with allergic asthma. Moreover, NFATc1 directly correlated with lymphocytes number whereas NFATc2 correlated with peripheral eosinophilia in asthma. CONCLUSIONS In addition to NFATc1 and NIP45, NFATc2 was found upregulated in asthma. Moreover, NFATc1 mRNA correlated with lymphocytes both in control and asthma, and NFATC1 and NFATc2 mRNA showed a direct correlation with eosinophils in controls but not in asthma, indicating that NFATc1 is associated with lymphocytes and not eosinophils in asthma.

Additional measures are needed to understand variation in non-EBF practices and inform intervention priorities. We collected infant feeding data prospectively at seven time points to 6 months post-partum from a cohort of vulnerable women (n = 151) registered at two Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program sites in Toronto, Canada. Four categories of breastmilk feeding intensity were defined. Descriptive analyses included the (i) proportion of participants in each feeding category by time point, (ii) use of formula and non-formula supplements to breastmilk, (iii) proportion of participants practising EBF continuously for at least 3 months; and (iv) frequency of transitions between feeding categories. All participants initiated breastmilk feeding with 70% continuing for 6 months. Only 18% practised EBF for 6 months, but 48% did so for at least 3 continuous months. The proportion in the EBF category was highest from 2 to 4 months post-partum. Supplemental formula use was highest in the first 3 months; early introduction of solids and non-formula fluids further compromised EBF at 5 and 6 months post-partum. Most participants (75%) transitioned between categories of breastmilk feeding intensity, with 35% making two or more transitions. Our data show high levels of breastmilk provision despite a low rate of EBF for 6 months. Inclusion of similar analyses in future prospective studies is recommended to provide more nuanced reporting of breastmilk feeding practices and guide intervention designs.","Mildon, Alison; Francis, Jane; Stewart, Stacia; Underhill, Bronwyn; Ng, Yi Man; Rousseau, Christina; Di Ruggiero, Erica; Dennis, Cindy-Lee; O'Connor, Deborah L; Sellen, Daniel W",Maternal & child nutrition,118,19

AIMS Many argue for the need to recognize the entanglement of gender/sex in humans and the myriad ways that gender experience becomes biology; translating this theory into practice in human biology research is essential. Biological anthropology is well poised to contribute to these societal conversations and debates. To do this effectively, a reconsideration of our own conceptions of gender/sex, gender identity, and sexuality is necessary. METHODS In this article, we discuss biological variation associated with gender/sex and propose ways forward to ensure we are engaging with gender/sex diversity. We base our analysis in the concept of ""biological normalcy,"" which allows consideration of the relationships between statistical distributions and normative views. We address the problematic reliance on binary categories, the utilization of group means to represent typical biologies, and document ways in which binary norms reinforce stigma and inequality regarding gender/sex, gender identity, and sexuality. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS We conclude with guidelines and methodological suggestions for how to engage gender/sex and gender identity in research. Our goal is to contribute a framework that all human biologists can use, not just those who work with gender or sexually diverse populations. We hope that in bringing this perspective to bear in human biology, which novel ideas and applications will emerge from within our own discipline.","DuBois, L Zachary; Shattuck-Heidorn, Heather",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,118,1

The purpose of this study was to investigate the healing and analgesic properties of sNAG in a rat rotator cuff injury and repair model. 144 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a transection and repair of their left supraspinatus tendons. Half of the animals received a sNAG membrane on the tendon-to-bone insertion site. Animals were further subdivided, receiving 1 or 3 days of analgesics. Animals were sacrificed 2, 4, or 8 weeks post-injury. Animals sacrificed at 4 and 8 weeks underwent longitudinal in vivo ambulatory assessment. Histological properties were assessed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and mechanical properties at 4 and 8 weeks. In the presence of analgesics, tendons receiving the sNAG polymer had significantly increased max load and max stress at 4 weeks, but not at 8 weeks. Ambulatory improvements were observed at 14 days in stride length and speed. Therefore, sNAG improves tendon-to-bone healing in a rat rotator cuff detachment and repair model.","Nuss, C A; Huegel, J; Boorman-Padgett, J F; Choi, D S; Weiss, S N; Vournakis, J; Soslowsky, L J",Annals of biomedical engineering,118,6

Given the recent outbreaks of contagious infectious diseases worldwide, including Ebola virus and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, there is urgent need for further research to determine optimal PPE use in high-risk settings. This review intends to provide a general understanding of PPE and to provide guidelines for appropriate use based on current evidence. RECENT FINDINGS Although previous studies have focused on the efficacy of PPE in preventing transmission of pathogens, recent studies have examined the dangers to HCWs during removal of PPE when risk of contamination is highest. Access to adequate PPE supplies is crucial to preventing transmission of pathogens, especially in resource-limited settings. Adherence to appropriate PPE use is a challenge due to inadequate education on its usage, technical difficulties, and tolerability of PPE in the workplace. Future projects aim at ameliorating this situation, including redesigning PPE which is crucial to improving the safety of HCWs. SUMMARY PPE remains the most important strategy for protecting HCW from potentially fatal pathogens. Further research into optimal PPE design and use to improve the safety of HCWs is urgently needed.","Honda, Hitoshi; Iwata, Kentaro",Current opinion in infectious diseases,118,19

The underlying molecular mechanism, however, is ill defined. In this study, we report the generation of mice deficient in IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (Ifit2) and demonstrate that Ifit2 is a critical signaling intermediate for LPS-induced septic shock. Ifit2 expression was significantly upregulated in response to LPS challenge in an IFN-α receptor- and IFN regulatory factor (Irf)9-dependent manner. Also, LPS induced secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) was significantly enhanced in the presence of Ifit2. In accordance, Ifit2-deficient mice exhibited significantly reduced serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-α and reduced mortality in an endotoxin shock model. Investigation of the underlying signal transduction events revealed that Ifit2 upregulates Irf3 phosphorylation. In the absence of Irf3, reduced Ifn-β mRNA expression and Ifit2 protein expression after LPS stimulation was found. Also, Tnf-α and Il-6 secretion but not Tnf-α and Il-6 mRNA expression levels were reduced. Thus, IFN-stimulated Ifit2 via enhanced Irf3 phosphorylation upregulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. It thereby amplifies LPS-induced cytokine production and critically influences the outcome of endotoxin shock.","Siegfried, Alexandra; Berchtold, Susanne; Manncke, Birgit; Deuschle, Eva; Reber, Julia; Ott, Thomas; Weber, Michaela; Kalinke, Ulrich; Hofer, Markus J; Hatesuer, Bastian; Schughart, Klaus; Gailus-Durner, Valérie; Fuchs, Helmut; Hrabe de Angelis, Martin; Weber, Friedemann; Hornef, Mathias W; Autenrieth, Ingo B; Bohn, Erwin",Journal of immunology,118,24

However, the details and complexities of establishing such a program in the United States are unknown. We describe the steps involved in setting up the first MSU in the United States. METHODS Implementation included establishing leadership, fund-raising, purchase and build-out, knitting a collaborative consortium of community stakeholders, writing protocols to ensure accountability, radiation safety, purchasing supplies, licensing, insurance, establishing a base station, developing a communication plan with city Emergency Medical Services, Emergency Medical Service training, staffing, and designing a research protocol. RESULTS The MSU was introduced after ≈1 year of preparation. Major obstacles to establishing the MSU were primarily obtaining funding, licensure, documenting radiation safety protocols, and establishing a smooth communication system with Emergency Medical Services. During an 8 week run-in phase, ≈2 patients were treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator per week, one-third within 60 minutes of symptom onset, with no complications. A randomized study to determine clinical outcomes, telemedicine reliability and accuracy, and cost effectiveness was formulated and has begun. CONCLUSION The first MSU in the United States has been introduced in Houston, TX.

We conducted a multicenter surveillance study to investigate recent trends in species distribution and antifungal susceptibility patterns among IC-associated Candida spp. in Beijing, China, from 2016 to 2017. Materials and Methods A total of 1496 non-duplicate Candida isolates, recovered from blood and other sterile body fluids of IC patients, were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry combined with ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing. Broth microdilution-based susceptibility testing using six antifungal agents was also conducted. Results Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species (49.9%), followed by Candida tropicalis (15.5%), Candida glabrata (14.7%) and Candida parapsilosis (14.2%). No significant differences in species distribution were observed when compared with a 2012-2013 dataset. Overall, the rates of susceptibility to fluconazole and voriconazole were high among C. albicans (98% and 97.2%, respectively) and C. parapsilosis species complex (91.1% and 92%, respectively) isolates but low among C. tropicalis (81.5% and 81.1%, respectively) isolates. In addition, the rate of azole resistance among C. tropicalis isolates increased significantly (1.8-fold, P<0.05) compared with that observed in 2012-2013, while micafungin resistance rates were <5% for all tested Candida species. Conclusion Our results suggest that species distribution has remained stable among IC-associated Candida isolates in Beijing. Resistance to micafungin was rare, but increased azole resistance among C. tropicalis isolates was noted. Our study provides information on local epidemiology that will be important for the selection of empirical antifungal agents and contributes to global assessments of antifungal resistance.","Guo, Li-Na; Yu, Shu-Ying; Xiao, Meng; Yang, Chun-Xia; Bao, Chun-Mei; Yu, Yan-Hua; Ye, Li-Yan; Yang, Yang; Zhang, Ge; Liu, Jie; Liang, Guo-Wei; Min, Rong; Zhu, Yu; Lei, Hong; Liu, Yu-Lei; Liu, Lin-Juan; Hu, Yun-Jian; Hsueh, Po-Ren; Xu, Ying-Chun",Infection and drug resistance,118,33

While the analogous event in China appears to be under control at the moment, the outbreaks in western countries are still at an early stage of development. Italy, at present, is playing a major role in understanding the transmission dynamics of these new infections and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures in a western social context. METHODS We combined a quarantined model with early-stage development data in Italy (during the period February 20th-March 30th) to predict longer-term progression (from March 30th, till June 25th, 2020 in a long-term view) with different control measures. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies leading to faster confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 infections, we made use of time-dependent contact and diagnosis rates to estimate when the effective daily reproduction ratio can fall below 1. Within the same framework, we analyze the possible secondary infection event after relaxing the isolation measures. OUTCOMES AND INTERPRETATION We study two simplified scenarios compatible with the observation data and the effects of two stringent measures on the evolution of the epidemic. On one side, the contact rate must be kept as low as possible, but it is also clear that, in a modern developed country, it cannot fall under certain minimum levels and for a long time. The complementary parameter tuned is the transition rate of the symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined class, a parameter [Formula: see text] I connected with the time t I = 1/δI [Formula: see text] needed to perform diagnostic tests. Within the conditions of the outbreak in Italy, this time must fall under 12-8 h in order to make the reproduction number less than 1 to minimize the case numbers. Moreover, we show how the same parameter plays an even more important role in mitigating the effects of a possible secondary infection event.","Traini, Marco Claudio; Caponi, Carla; Ferrari, Riccardo; De Socio, Giuseppe Vittorio",Infectious diseases,118,16

The mechanism by which conformational changes of this S glycoprotein can be triggered by pH 8.0 has not yet been determined. Here, we show that MHV-A59 S protein is triggered by pH 8.0 at 37°C to induce receptor-independent syncytium (RIS) formation on 293T cells, and that the conformational changes in S proteins triggered by pH 8.0 are very similar to those triggered by receptor binding. We systemically mutated each of 15 histidine residues in S protein and found that H209 is essential for pH 8.0-triggered RIS formation, while H179, H441, H643, and H759 also play important roles in this process. Replacement of H209 with Ala had no effect on receptor binding, but in murine 17Cl.1 cells mutant H209A MHV-A59 showed delayed growth kinetics and was readily outcompeted by wild-type virus when mixed together, indicating that the H209A mutation caused a defect in virus fitness. Finally, the H209A mutation significantly increased the thermostability of S protein in its prefusion conformation, which may raise the energy barrier for conformational change of S protein required for membrane fusion and lead to a decrease in virus fitness in cell culture. Thus, MHV-A59 may have evolved to lower the stability of its S protein in order to increase virus fitness.IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses enter cells through fusion of viral and cellular membranes, and the process is mediated by interactions between viral envelope proteins and their host receptors. In the prefusion conformation, viral envelope proteins are metastable, and activation to the fusion conformation is tightly regulated, since premature activation would lead to loss of viral infectivity. The stability of viral envelope proteins greatly influences their activation and virus fitness. Here, we report that, similar to the A82V mutation in Ebola glycoprotein, in the S glycoprotein of murine coronavirus MHV-A59, the histidine residue at position of 209 significantly affects the thermal stability of the S protein, determines whether S protein can be activated at 37°C by either pH 8.0 alone or by receptor binding, and affects viral fitness in cell culture. Thus, the spike glycoprotein of MHV-A59 has evolved to retain histidine at position 209 to optimize virus fitness.","Li, Pei; Shan, Yiwei; Zheng, Wangliang; Ou, Xiuyuan; Mi, Dan; Mu, Zhixia; Holmes, Kathryn V; Qian, Zhaohui",Journal of virology,118,22

METHODS We collected the data of imported COVID-19 cases from March 1st to April 10th, 2020 published on the official websites of Health Commission of Guangdong Province and local government of the cities in Guangdong Province for epidemiological analysis. Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze the distribution patterns of the interval between entry of mainland China and diagnosis of the imported cases, and multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the factors influencing the interval. RESULTS A total of 179 imported cases were reported in Guangdong by April 10th, 2020. The average interval between entry of mainland China and diagnosis was 4.21 days with a median of 2 days. The interval was between 1 and 3 days in 69.8% of the cases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a negative result of the initial nucleic acid test (OR=5.205, 95% CI: 1.100-24.640, P=0.038) and interval between entry of mainland China and a positive diagnosis >2 days (OR=85.654, 95%CI: 24.569-298.615, P < 0.001) were risk factors for the finding delay. CONCLUSIONS The results of initial nucleic acid detection and the interval between entry of mainland China and a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 are the major contributing factors of delayed case detection. This finding suggests that strict quarantine and detection measures should be carried out for the personnel entering China to accurately and quickly identify the cases.","Cheng, Lin; Xu, Huilan",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,118,16

Objectives To examine differences in COVID-19 hospital mortality rates between Black and White patients and to assess whether the mortality rates reflect differences in patient characteristics by race or by the hospitals to which Black and White patients are admitted. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study assessed Medicare beneficiaries admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 to 1188 US hospitals from January 1, 2020, through September 21, 2020. Exposure Hospital admission for a diagnosis of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary composite outcome was inpatient death or discharge to hospice within 30 days of admission. We estimated the association of patient-level characteristics (including age, sex, zip code-level income, comorbidities, admission from a nursing facility, and days since January 1, 2020) with differences in mortality or discharge to hospice among Black and White patients. To examine the association with the hospital itself, we adjusted for the specific hospitals to which patients were admitted. We used simulation modeling to estimate the mortality among Black patients had they instead been admitted to the hospitals where White patients were admitted. Results Of the 44 217 Medicare beneficiaries included in the study, 24 281 (55%) were women; mean (SD) age was 76.3 (10.5) years; 33 459 participants (76%) were White, and 10 758 (24%) were Black. Overall, 2634 (8%) White patients and 1100 (10%) Black patients died as inpatients, and 1670 (5%) White patients and 350 (3%) Black patients were discharged to hospice within 30 days of hospitalization, for a total mortality-equivalent rate of 12.86% for White patients and 13.48% for Black patients. Black patients had similar odds of dying or being discharged to hospice (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99-1.12) in an unadjusted comparison with White patients. After adjustment for clinical and sociodemographic patient characteristics, Black patients were more likely to die or be discharged to hospice (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19). This difference became indistinguishable when adjustment was made for the hospitals where care was delivered (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94-1.10). In simulations, if Black patients in this sample were instead admitted to the same hospitals as White patients in the same distribution, their rate of mortality or discharge to hospice would decline from the observed rate of 13.48% to the simulated rate of 12.23% (95% CI for difference, 1.20%-1.30%). Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study found that Black patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had higher rates of hospital mortality or discharge to hospice than White patients after adjustment for the personal characteristics of those patients. However, those differences were explained by differences in the hospitals to which Black and White patients were admitted.","Asch, David A; Islam, Md Nazmul; Sheils, Natalie E; Chen, Yong; Doshi, Jalpa A; Buresh, John; Werner, Rachel M",JAMA network open,118,5

Protected Mealtimes is a complex, inter-professional ward-based intervention that was first introduced in the United Kingdom to address this issue. Now implemented internationally, the approach still remains in key policy documents including the National Health Service Essence of Care. This review aims to synthesize the nutrition, satisfaction and quality of life patient/resident outcomes that arise from the implementation of Protected Mealtimes in hospitals and residential aged care facilities and to consider fidelity issues that have been reported in previous research. A defined search strategy was implemented in seven databases to identify full text papers of original research that evaluated Protected Mealtimes implementation. After screening, data were extracted from eight studies (7 quantitative and 1 qualitative study) that were conducted in hospitals. There was no research identified from the aged care sector. There were few positive outcomes that resulted from Protected Mealtimes implementation, many fidelity issues with the intervention were reported. It is apparent that Protected Mealtimes provide few, if any, benefits for hospitalized patients. It is a complex, multi-pronged initiative that has limited fidelity and limited outcomes. As such, we recommend that disinvestment by policy makers for hospitals should be considered, with the implementation of other evidence based mealtime initiatives. We provide no recommendation for disinvestment in the aged care sector, since the approach has not been evaluated against any of the eligible outcomes of this review.","Porter, Judi; Hanna, Lauren",Risk management and healthcare policy,118,1

We reviewed the academic scholarship describing fiscal and social costs involved in the development of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Because many ovarian cancer survivors outlive their disease through initial and, perhaps, multiple treatment courses, these women and their treatments provide context for our discussion on financial toxicity. 16 (27%) of 60 articles discuss financial toxicity incurred by women with ovarian cancer; none described financial toxicity associated with regulatory agency-approved or experimental therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Fiscal costs of radiopharmaceutical dose and schedule and social costs of individual productivity loss or asset expenditure arose as primary financial toxicities. The development of radiopharmaceuticals for women with ovarian cancer remains a high priority for the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program.

It examined potential treatment targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to be used for a ""treat-to-target"" clinical management strategy using an evidence-based expert consensus process. METHODS A Steering Committee of 28 IBD specialists developed recommendations based on a systematic literature review and expert opinion. Consensus was gained if ≥75% of participants scored the recommendation as 7-10 on a 10-point rating scale (where 10=agree completely). RESULTS The group agreed upon 12 recommendations for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The agreed target for UC was clinical/patient-reported outcome (PRO) remission (defined as resolution of rectal bleeding and diarrhea/altered bowel habit) and endoscopic remission (defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0-1). Histological remission was considered as an adjunctive goal. Clinical/PRO remission was also agreed upon as a target for CD and defined as resolution of abdominal pain and diarrhea/altered bowel habit; and endoscopic remission, defined as resolution of ulceration at ileocolonoscopy, or resolution of findings of inflammation on cross-sectional imaging in patients who cannot be adequately assessed with ileocolonoscopy. Biomarker remission (normal C-reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin) was considered as an adjunctive target. CONCLUSIONS Evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for selecting the goals for treat-to-target strategies in patients with IBD are made available.

OBJECTIVE To report our institutional experience with spinal tumor embolization and review the present literature. METHODS Clinical records from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2012 were reviewed and analyzed. Angiograms were used to calculate the percentage reduction in tumor vascularity, and relevant clinical and operative data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Thirty-seven patients underwent preoperative spinal tumor embolization (24 metastatic and 13 primary lesions) and were included in the study. One complication resulted in transient lower extremity weakness and was attributed to post-embolization swelling, which fully resolved after surgical resection. The transient neurological complication rate was 1/37 (3%) and the permanent rate was 0/37 (0%). The average surgical estimated blood loss (EBL) was 1946 mL (100-7000 mL) and the average operative time was 330 min (range 164-841 min). After embolization, tumor blush was reduced by 83% on average. Average pre- and postoperative modified Rankin Scale scores were 2.10 and 1.36, respectively (p=0.03). Cases in which tumor blush was decreased by ≥90% (classes 1 or 2) after embolization had significantly less operative blood loss than those cases in which <90% (classes 3 or 4) was achieved (mean EBL 1391 vs 2296 mL, respectively, p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS Spinal tumor embolization is a safe procedure, is associated with few complications, and may improve surgical outcomes by limiting intraoperative blood loss and reducing operative time.","Awad, Al-Wala; Almefty, Kaith K; Ducruet, Andrew F; Turner, Jay D; Theodore, Nicholas; McDougall, Cameron G; Albuquerque, Felipe C",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,118,17

Work-related TBI (wrTBI) is particularly concerning. Despite overall work-related injury claims decreasing, the proportion of claims that are wrTBI have increased, suggesting prevention and support of wrTBI requires ongoing attention. OBJECTIVES This review aimed to provide updated information on the burden and risk factors of wrTBI among the working adult population. METHODS Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched using a combination of TBI, work, and epidemiology text words and medical subject headings. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion. Meta-analyses were conducted to estimate prevalence and mortality of wrTBI and a narrative synthesis was conducted to provide additional context. RESULTS Pooled proportions meta-analyses estimate that 17.9% of TBIs were work-related and 6.3% of work-related injuries resulted in TBI, with 3.6% of wrTBI resulting in death. Populations of wrTBI were predominantly male (76.2%) and were 40.4 years of age, on average. The most commonly reported industries for wrTBI were education and training, healthcare and social assistance, construction, manufacturing, and transportation. Falls, being struck by an object or person, motor vehicle collisions, and assaults were the most commonly reported mechanisms of wrTBI. CONCLUSIONS A better understanding of the epidemiology of wrTBI can inform prevention and management strategies.

CD4+ T cell accumulation and TH1 skewing are reduced in the CNS but not spleens of infected CXCR3-/- mice. Adoptive transfer of WT, but not CXCR3-/- CD4+ T cells, into CXCR3-/- mice phenocopies the pathology of infected WT mice.

PRRSV non-structural protein 2 (Nsp2) was suggested previously as a potential interferon (IFN) antagonist. This study focused on Nsp2 to investigate its inhibitory mechanism of IFN induction. It was demonstrated that Nsp2 strongly inhibited IFN-β production by antagonizing activation of the IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) pathway induced by the Sendai virus (SeV). Further studies revealed that the cysteine protease domain (PL2) of Nsp2 was necessary for IFN antagonism. Additionally, both full-length Nsp2 and the PL2 protease domain of Nsp2 were found to inhibit SeV-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF-3. These findings suggest that Nsp2 is likely to play an important role in subversion of IRF-3-dependent innate antiviral defences, providing a basis for elucidating the mechanisms underlying PRRSV pathogenesis.","Li, Hongxia; Zheng, Zhenhua; Zhou, Peng; Zhang, Bing; Shi, Zhengli; Hu, Qinxue; Wang, Hanzhong",The Journal of general virology,118,1

Oral metronidazole has high bioavailability (>95%) and intravenous metronidazole should be reserved for patients not suitable for oral preparations. METHODS AND MATERIALS This full cycle audit evaluated the type of metronidazole preparation prescribed in adult emergency surgical patients requiring first-line empirical antimicrobial therapy for intra-abdominal infections. The criterion for audit was the proportion of patients who were prescribed intravenous metronidazole when the oral route was available. The first cycle included all consecutive eligible patients between 20 April and 14 May 2020. After an intervention phase educating prescribers about the similar pharmacokinetic properties of oral and intravenous metronidazole, clinical practice was reaudited between 22 June and 16 July 2020. Data were collected by case note and drug chart review. RESULTS A total of 54 patients were included in the first audit cycle. Of these, 11 (20.4%) were prescribed oral metronidazole and 43 (79.6%) were prescribed intravenous metronidazole. In the majority of cases (35/43, 81.4%), intravenous metronidazole was prescribed in the absence of clear contraindications to the oral preparation. Of the 61 patients included in the reaudit cycle, 23 (37.7%) were prescribed oral metronidazole and 38 (62.3%) were prescribed intravenous metronidazole. The proportion of patients prescribed intravenous metronidazole despite being suitable for oral preparation decreased from 81.4% in the first cycle to 34.2% (13/38) in the reaudit cycle (risk ratio 0.42, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.67, p<0.0001). Prescribing oral metronidazole when suitable saved up to £10.53/day per patient. CONCLUSION This full cycle audit led to a significant improvement in the use of oral metronidazole in suitable patients, as well as a considerable reduction in healthcare costs.","Sgrò, Alessandro; Wu, Diana A; Yalamarthi, Satheesh",Postgraduate medical journal,118,1

METHODS Children undergoing elective surgery in this single-blind randomized study were allocated into the closed-loop (auto) or manual (manual) group. Primary outcome was the percentage of time with the BIS in the range 40 to 60 (BIS40-60). Secondary outcomes were the percentage of deep (BIS<40) anesthesia and drug consumption. Data are presented as median (interquartile range) or number (%). RESULTS Twenty-three patients (12 [10 to 14] yr) were assigned to the auto group and 19 (14 [7 to 14] yr) to the manual group. The closed-loop controller was able to provide induction and maintenance for all patients. The percentage of time with BIS40-60 was greater in the auto group (87% [75 to 96] vs. 72% [48 to 79]; P = 0.002), with a decrease in the percentage of BIS<40 (7% [2 to 17] vs. 21% [11 to 38]; P = 0.002).

We provide a discussion on what is being done across the United States in attempts to reduce the growing health inequities. As the next generation of public health leaders, we believe that only by investing in these issues can we begin to address the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Asfaw, Eliyas K; Guo, Emily S; Jang, Sarah S; Komarivelli, Swathi R; Lewis, Katherine A; Sandler, Claire B; Mehdipanah, Roshanak",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,118,28

Dysregulation of normal Receptor Tyrosine Kinase function by mutation or other activity-altering event can be oncogenic or can impact the transformed malignant cell so it becomes particularly resistant to stress challenge, have increased proliferation, become evasive to immune surveillance, and may be more prone to metastasis of the tumor to other organ sites. The TAM family of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK) are emerging as important components of malignant cell survival in many cancers. The TAM kinases are important regulators of cellular homeostasis and proper cell differentiation in normal cells as receptors for their ligands GAS6 and Protein S. They also are critical to immune and inflammatory processes. In malignant cells, the TAM kinases can act as ligand independent co-receptors to mutant Receptor Tyrosine Kinases and in some cases (e.g. FLT3-ITD mutant) are required for their function. They also have a role in immune checkpoint surveillance. At the time of this review, the Covid-19 pandemic poses a global threat to world health. TAM kinases play an important role in host response to many viruses and it is suggested the TAM kinases may be important in aspects of Covid-19 biology. This review will cover the TAM kinases and their role in these processes.","Post, Sean M; Andreeff, Michael; DiNardo, Courtney; Khoury, Joseph D; Ruvolo, Peter P",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

We have used CTA to assess arterial stenosis and occlusion in an ischemic stroke population arriving at a tertiary stroke center within 24 hours of symptom onset in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of occlusive disease pattern, and to determine the proportion of eligible candidates for endovascular treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data from consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to a single center between 2003 and 2012, collected in the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne data base, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with a diagnostic CTA within 24 hours of symptom onset were selected. Relevant extra- and intracranial pathology, defined as stenosis of ≥50% and occlusions, were registered and classified into 21 prespecified segments. RESULTS Of the 2209 included patients (42.1% women; median age, 72 years), 1075 (48.7%) had pathology in and 308 (13.9%) had pathology outside the ischemic territory. In the 50,807 arterial segments available for revision, 1851 (3.6%) abnormal segments were in the ischemic (symptomatic) territory and another 408 (0.8%) were outside it (asymptomatic). In the 1211 patients with ischemic stroke imaged within 6 hours of symptom onset, 40.7% had symptomatic large, proximal occlusions potentially amenable to endovascular therapy. CONCLUSIONS CTA in patients with acute ischemic stroke shows large individual variations of occlusion sites and degrees. Approximately half of such patients have no visible occlusive disease, and 40% imaged within 6 hours show large, proximal segment occlusions amenable to endovascular therapy. These findings show the importance of early noninvasive imaging of extra- and intracranial arteries for identifying occlusive disease, planning recanalization strategies, and designing interventional trials.","Rotzinger, D C; Mosimann, P J; Meuli, R A; Maeder, P; Michel, P",AJNR.

METHODS This cross-sectional study evaluated the impact of SARS-COVID-19 disease on Italian neurosurgeons stratified by gender [44 (49.9%) males and 49 (52,1%) females] enrolled through a questionnaire-based online survey. RESULTS Ninety-three Italian neurosurgeons were included in this study. The percentage of female participants was 52,1%(49) and 53%(50) were younger than 40 years. Men were significantly more affected than women by complications (14 versus 3), while there was no gender difference in the Covid infection rate. Furthermore the social impact of the Pandemia was the same between men and women. CONCLUSIONS Our analysis did not show significant differences between the two genders in the susceptibility, and mortality from COVID-19.

Laboratory-based diagnostic tests utilized real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on throat samples. This study evaluated the diagnostic value to analyzing throat and sputum samples in order to improve accuracy and detection efficiency. Methods Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by the RT-PCR assay. Results The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using the RT-PCR assay (p = 0.001). Conclusions The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens were significantly higher than those from throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.","Lin, Chenyao; Xiang, Jie; Yan, Mingzhe; Li, Hongze; Huang, Shuang; Shen, Changxin",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,118,1

The Sondell, SB-SDS, TnBP and the high/low permeation methods were used to decellularize donor nerves. Nerves without any treatment were as the control group. The histological results were evaluated by HE staining andtoluidine blue (TB) staining. The proliferation activity of L929 cells was detected by CCK-8 assay. The adhesion of Schwann cells was observed and quantified by SEM. Balb/c mice were used to evaluate the cellular and humoral immunogenicity of the nerve scaffolds. The rat sciatic nerve defect model was applied to observe the repair effect of acellular nerve scaffold in vivo. To SB-SDS group，it remained the original state of the nerves, with no observed nucleus and axons, the neurotoxicity grade detected by CCK-8 being almost 0, and it kept the largest number of Schwann cells adhered to the acellular nerve and the better morphology. Further, it showed that the selected SB-SDS rats acellular nerve scaffold could promote the nerve repair of the rats by HE staining and TB staining. We could conclude that the acellular nerve matrix prepared by the SB-SDS method effectively removes the cellular components in the nerve tissue and retains the main components of the extracellular matrix of the nerve tissue, whose rats decellularized nerve scaffold could promote the sciatic nerve repair better.","Han, Li-Wei; Xu, Gang; Guo, Mei-Yu; Chang, Yv-Ang; Zhang, Yu; Zhao, Yan-Tao; Li, Zhong-Hai",Synapse,118,25

MATERIALS AND METHODS Procedural data of ACS patients admitted between 10 March and 10 April 2020 were compared with those of the same period of 2019. RESULTS We observed a 23.4% reduction in ACS admissions during 2020, with a decrease for both ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (-5.6%) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (-34.5%), albeit not statistically significant (P = 0.2). During the first 15 days of the examined periods, the reduction in ACS admissions reached 52.5% (-25% for STEMI and -70.3% for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, P = 0.04). Among STEMI patients, the rate of those with a time delay from symptoms onset longer than 180 min was significantly higher during the lockdown period (P = 0.01). Radiograph exposure (P = 0.01) was higher in STEMI patients treated in 2020 with a slightly higher amount of contrast medium (P = 0.1) and number of stents implanted (P = 0.1), whereas the number of treated vessels was reduced (P = 0.03). Percutaneous coronary intervention procedural success and in-hospital mortality were not different between the two groups and in STEMI patients (P NS for all). CONCLUSION During the early phase, the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with a lower rate of admissions for ACS, with a substantial impact on the time delay presentation of STEMI patients, but apparently without affecting the in-hospital outcomes.","Fileti, Luca; Vecchio, Sabine; Moretti, Carolina; Reggi, Alessandra; Aquilina, Matteo; Balducelli, Marco; Santarelli, Andrea; Grosseto, Daniele; Piovaccari, Giancarlo; Rubboli, Andrea",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,118,20

However, cognitive decline may be a complication following all types of AIH. This systematic review will summarize longitudinal observational studies documenting cognitive changes following AIH in the majority admitted population and conduct meta-analysis (MA) to assess the quantitative effect of AIH on post-hospitalization cognitive decline (PHCD). METHODS We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Selection criteria were defined to identify studies of older age adults exposed to AIH with cognitive measures. 6566 titles were screened. 46 reports were reviewed qualitatively, of which seven contributed data to the MA. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS The qualitative review suggested increased cognitive decline following AIH, but several reports were particularly vulnerable to bias. Domain-specific outcomes following AIH included declines in memory and processing speed. Increasing age and the severity of illness were the most consistent risk factors for PHCD. PHCD was supported by MA of seven eligible studies with 41,453 participants (Cohen's d = -0.25, 95% CI [-0.02, -0.49] I2 35%). CONCLUSIONS There is preliminary evidence that AIH exposure accelerates or triggers cognitive decline in the elderly patient. PHCD reported in specific contexts could be subsets of a larger phenomenon and caused by overlapping mechanisms. Future research must clarify the trajectory, clinical significance, and etiology of PHCD: a priority in the face of an aging population with increasing rates of both cognitive impairment and hospitalization.","Chinnappa-Quinn, Lucia; Makkar, Steve Robert; Bennett, Michael; Lam, Ben C P; Lo, Jessica W; Kochan, Nicole A; Crawford, John D; Sachdev, Perminder S",International psychogeriatrics,118,31

The objective of this work is to assess whether implantation of a prophylactic prosthetic mesh during laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection contributed to reduce the incidence of parastomal hernia. METHODS Rectal cancer patients undergoing elective laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection with permanent colostomy were randomized to placement of a large-pore lightweight mesh in the intraperitoneal/onlay position by the laparoscopic approach (study group) or to the control group (no mesh). Parastomal hernia was defined radiologically by a CT scan performed after 12 months of surgery. The usefulness of subcutaneous fat thickness measured by CT to discriminate patients at risk of parastomal hernia was assessed by ROC curve analysis. RESULTS Thirty-six patients were randomized, 19 to the mesh group and 17 to the control group. Parastomal hernia was detected in 50 % of patients in the mesh group and in 93.8 % of patients in the control group (P = 0.008). The AUC for thickness of the subcutaneous abdominal was 0.819 (P = 0.004) and the optimal threshold 23 mm. Subcutaneous fat thickness ≥23 mm was a significant predictor of parastomal hernia (odds ratio 15.7, P = 0.010), whereas insertion of a mesh was a protective factor (odds ratio 0.06, P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS Use of prophylactic large-pore lightweight mesh in the intraperitoneal/onlay position by a purely laparoscopic approach reduced the incidence of parastomal hernia formation. Subcutaneous fat thickness ≥23 mm measured by CT was an independent predictor of parastomal hernia.","López-Cano, M; Lozoya-Trujillo, R; Quiroga, S; Sánchez, J L; Vallribera, F; Martí, M; Jiménez, L M; Armengol-Carrasco, M; Espín, E",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,118,1

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of their extended healthspans are poorly understood. To address this question we carried out an eight-year longitudinal study of ageing in long-lived bats (Myotis myotis). We deep-sequenced ~1.7 trillion base pairs of RNA from 150 blood samples collected from known aged bats to ascertain the age-related transcriptomic shifts and potential microRNA-directed regulation that occurred. We also compared ageing transcriptomic profiles between bats and other mammals by analysis of 298 longitudinal RNA sequencing datasets. Bats did not show the same transcriptomic changes with age as commonly observed in humans and other mammals, but rather exhibited a unique, age-related gene expression pattern associated with DNA repair, autophagy, immunity and tumour suppression that may drive their extended healthspans. We show that bats have naturally evolved transcriptomic signatures that are known to extend lifespan in model organisms, and identify novel genes not yet implicated in healthy ageing. We further show that bats' longevity profiles are partially regulated by microRNA, thus providing novel regulatory targets and pathways for future ageing intervention studies. These results further disentangle the ageing process by highlighting which ageing pathways contribute most to healthy ageing in mammals.","Huang, Zixia; Whelan, Conor V; Foley, Nicole M; Jebb, David; Touzalin, Frédéric; Petit, Eric J; Puechmaille, Sébastien J; Teeling, Emma C",Nature ecology & evolution,118,1

Complex rib and vortex patterns can be dynamically modulated by changing the frequency and magnitude of tube oscillation and the viscosity of liquid. Highly complex rib patterns and synchronous vortices can be generated in serially connected microfluidic chambers. Similar dynamic patterns can be generated using whole or diluted blood samples without damaging the sample. This method offers unique opportunities for studying complex fluids and soft materials, chemical synthesis of various compounds, and mimicking harmonic flows in biological systems using compact, tunable, and low-cost devices.","Thurgood, Peter; Suarez, Sergio Aguilera; Pirogova, Elena; Jex, Aaron R; Peter, Karlheinz; Baratchi, Sara; Khoshmanesh, Khashayar",Small,118,1

We also sought to describe the association of common genetic mutations and immunotherapy with BM development in advanced melanoma. METHODS Using our institution's tumor registry, we identified patients with initial diagnoses of stage III and stage IV melanoma. In this cohort, we obtained BM incidence at diagnosis and follow-up, characterized the metastatic brain lesions and primary tumor's genetic profile. RESULTS During the follow-up period, 22.9% of patients with an initial diagnosis of stage III developed BM. In this cohort, the median time for BM occurrence was 20 months; [95% CI (14-29)]. Likewise, 37.7% of patients with Stage IV melanoma presented with BM at the time of diagnosis, and 22.7% of remaining patients developed BM at follow-up over a median duration of 6 months [95% CI (4-11)]. Therefore, suggesting an overall incidence of 51.9% in stage IV melanoma. Next, we observed that the incidence of BM development during the follow-up period significantly decreased from 2012 to 2017 (p < 0.001). Lastly, we found a significantly higher frequency of mutational BRAF in the primary tumor of patients with BM (68.7% vs. 31.2%; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS While the overall incidence of BM remains high, the decreasing incidence of BM over the follow-up period is promising. Similar BM incidence in patients with an initial diagnosis of stage III or stage IV warrants appropriate imaging surveillance regimen for stage III patients.","Sandhu, Mani Ratnesh S; Chiang, Veronica L; Tran, Thuy; Yu, James B; Weiss, Sarah; Goldberg, Sarah; Aboian, Mariam; Kluger, Harriet M; Mahajan, Amit",Journal of neuro-oncology,118,33

Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire regarding depressive and anxiety symptoms in either Arabic or German. Measurement invariance was only present to a certain extent. Questionnaires were most informative on different spectrums of the latent traits for the two groups. Network analysis demonstrated that symptom interrelations of depressive and anxiety symptoms differed across residents and refugees. This was especially true for core symptoms of common nosological systems, such as losing interest or feeling depressed. Surprisingly, traumatic events in the past were not central in refugees' anxiety networks. Core symptoms of nosological systems seem to be differently pronounced in refugees and residents, which has important implications for our understanding of mental health symptoms in refugees.","Schlechter, Pascal; Wilkinson, Paul O; Knausenberger, Judith; Wanninger, Katharina; Kamp, Svea; Morina, Nexhmedin; Hellmann, Jens H",Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,118,1

AIM To compare circular-stapled and linear-stapled GJ in LRYGB in terms of operative time and postoperative complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective case-control study compared the perioperative and postoperative outcomes of LRYGB with a circular-stapled (LRYGB-CS) versus linear-stapled (LRYGB-LS) gastrojejunostomy. All patients, operated on in two academic referral care centers for bariatric surgery, were enrolled from April 2013 to June 2016. 457 patients were included (255 and 202 respectively in the LRYGB-CS and LRYGB-LS groups). After matching the groups for age, sex, body mass index, arterial hypertension, and presence of type 2 diabetes in a 1 : 1 ratio, 99 patients were enrolled in each. RESULTS The total operative time was longer in the LRYGB-LS group (140 vs. 85 min, p < 0.001). The postoperative hemorrhage and wound infection rates were lower in the LRYGB-LS group (2.1% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.021, and 1.0% vs. 9.3%, p = 0.011). The readmission rates were comparable (8.2% vs. 6.1%, p = 0.593). There was no significant difference in the incidence of gastrojejunostomy leakage, stricture, port-site hernia, or marginal ulcer.

However, there are no evidence-based guidelines for the management of these disease during the pandemic, despite increasing concerns in patients and neurologists. Currently, there is no evidence of an elevated risk of morbidity and aggravation of COVID-19 in patients with these diseases, irrespective of whether they receive treatment. To prevent relapse or aggravation of the underlying diseases due to COVID-19, all patients should perform general preventive measures, such as social distancing, frequent hand washing, and respiratory hygiene. In patients undergoing immunotherapy, current treatment should be continued to prevent exacerbation of symptoms; however, exceptions to this include high-risk patients for COVID-19, such as the elderly, those with comorbidities including cardiac and respiratory diseases, those taking therapy with immunosuppressive agents, and those with deteriorating symptoms of COVID-19.","Nakamura, Masashi; Nakashima, Ichiro",Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,118,1

Aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the pandemic period in the need of surgical emergencies. METHODS Between January 1st and May 31st 2020 all the consecutive general surgery emergencies performed by the Careggi University hospital emergency surgery unit were prospectively recorded and compared to the same period of 2019. Demographic and clinical data were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS The number of surgical procedures decreased only in the month of March 2020 (compared to 2019), while in April the total numer of emergency surgical procedures was similar. Only appendectomy, complicated hernia repair and colonic resection were significantly reduced (40%, 48% and 33% respectively). The number of small intestine excision, cholecystectomy and lysis of peritoneal adhesions remained stable throughout the entire period. No statistically significant differences were found considering age, sex, Emergency Surgery Score, mortality, ICU postoperative admission and time between admission and surgery, even when analyzed with multivariate analysis for every single surgical procedure, suggesting a comparable disease severity and comorbility patterns. Mortality in COVID patients was 25%, compared to 7% of no-covid patients. CONCLUSIONS The COVID pandemic has caused major changes in daily clinical practice, especially in areas such as Emergency. This has led to a temporary reduction and changes in the flow of patients to the emergency room, with implications also for emergency surgical activities.","Martellucci, Jacopo; Damigella, Andrea; Bergamini, Carlo; Alemanno, Giovanni; Pantalone, Desiré; Coratti, Andrea; Muiesan, Paolo; Cianchi, Fabio; Prosperi, Paolo",Minerva chirurgica,118,1

Case series suggest that patients with COVID-19 have more severe strokes; however, no large series have compared stroke outcomes with contemporary non-COVID-19 patients. Purpose was to analyze the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in stroke care and to evaluate stroke outcomes according to the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS Retrospective multicenter cohort study including consecutive acute stroke patients admitted to 7 stroke centers from February 25 to April 25, 2020 (first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Madrid). The quality of stroke care was measured by the number of admissions, recanalization treatments, and time metrics. The primary outcome was death or dependence at discharge. RESULTS A total of 550 acute stroke patients were admitted. A significant reduction in the number of admissions and secondary interhospital transfers was found. COVID-19 was confirmed in 105 (19.1%) patients, and a further 19 patients were managed as suspected COVID-19 (3.5%). No differences were found in the rates of reperfusion therapies in ischemic strokes (45.5% non-COVID-19, 35.7% confirmed COVID-19, and 40% suspected COVID-19; P=0.265). However, the COVID-19 group had longer median door-to-puncture time (110 versus 80 minutes), which was associated with the performance of chest computed tomography. Multivariate analysis confirmed poorer outcomes for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratios, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.12-3.76] and 3.56 [95% CI, 1.15-11.05], respectively). CONCLUSIONS This study confirms that patients with COVID-19 have more severe strokes and poorer outcomes despite similar acute management. A well-established stroke care network helps to diminish the impact of such an outbreak in stroke care, reducing secondary transfers and allowing maintenance of reperfusion therapies, with a minor impact on door-to-puncture times, which were longer in patients who underwent chest computed tomography.","Fuentes, Blanca; Alonso de Leciñana, María; García-Madrona, Sebastián; Díaz-Otero, Fernando; Aguirre, Clara; Calleja, Patricia; Egido, José A; Carneado-Ruiz, Joaquín; Ruiz-Ares, Gerardo; Rodríguez-Pardo, Jorge; Rodríguez-López, Ángela; Ximénez-Carrillo, Álvaro; de Felipe, Alicia; Ostos, Fernando; González-Ortega, Guillermo; Simal, Patricia; Gómez Escalonilla, Carlos I; Gómez-Porro-Sánchez, Pablo; Desanvicente, Zayrho; Reig, Gemma; Gil-Núñez, Antonio; Masjuán, Jaime; Díez-Tejedor, Exuperio",Stroke,118,17

There is no consensus on how best to secure the airway in this group of patients. We conducted a feasibility study of awake tracheal intubation using a King Vision® videolaryngoscope with a channelled blade in a cohort of 25 patients, with a periglottic tumour requiring diagnostic or radical surgery. We used 10% and 4% lidocaine to topicalise the airway and midazolam and remifentanil for sedation. We recorded the success rate, number of attempts, time to obtain glottic view, time to intubation and complications. Twenty-three of the 25 patients (92%, 95%CI 75-98%) were intubated with the awake videolaryngoscope-assisted technique, with 17/23 (74%, 95%CI 54-87%) intubations achieved at the first attempt. Five patients required two and one patient, three attempts at intubation. Two patients (8%, 95%CI 2-25%) could not tolerate the procedure due to inadequate topical anaesthesia. Median (IQR [range]) times to obtain glottic view and to intubate were 19 (17-22 [10-30]) s and 49 (42-71 [33-107]) s, respectively. Traces of blood in the airway were observed in 4/25 (16%, 95%CI 6-35%) patients. Although airway management in this group of patients was expected to be difficult, successful awake intubation with the King Vision videolaryngoscope was achieved in the majority of patients within less than a minute. This study highlights a number of potential advantages of awake videolaryngoscope-assisted intubation over other awake methods of securing the airway in patients with upper airway obstruction due to periglottic mass.","Markova, L; Stopar-Pintaric, T; Luzar, T; Benedik, J; Hodzovic, I",Anaesthesia,118,1

Therefore, it is standard policy for a loan officer to provide a textual loan assessment to mitigate limited data availability. In turn, this statement is analysed by a credit expert alongside any available standard credit data. In our paper, we exploit recent advances from the field of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), including the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, to extract information from 60 000 textual assessments provided by a lender. We consider the performance in terms of the AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve) and Brier Score metrics and find that the text alone is surprisingly effective for predicting default. However, when combined with traditional data, it yields no additional predictive capability, with performance dependent on the text's length. Our proposed deep learning model does, however, appear to be robust to the quality of the text and therefore suitable for partly automating the mSME lending process. We also demonstrate how the content of loan assessments influences performance, leading us to a series of recommendations on a new strategy for collecting future mSME loan assessments.","Stevenson, Matthew; Mues, Christophe; Bravo, Cristi'an",,118,1

We find that the existing videoconferencing systems vary in terms of geographic scope, which in turns determines streaming lag experienced by users. We also observe that streaming rate can change under different conditions (e.g., number of users in a session, mobile device status, etc), which affects user-perceived streaming quality.

This trend has been accelerated with current work-from-home orders due to COVID-19. Even though virtual collaboration has, in the past, been the focus of multiple studies, there are some surprising gaps in our knowledge. For instance, there are few empirical studies examining the impact of virtual devices and tools on creative problem-solving. While there is a substantial body of research on electronic brainstorming and the use of virtual tools for idea generation, less is known about earlier processes such as problem construction or later processes such as idea evaluation and idea selection. Furthermore, as a dynamic process, creativity and innovation is heavily influenced by the people engaged in the process and their collaborative environment, yet there is a gap in the literature regarding the type of virtual tools used in the process (i.e., audio + video vs. audio alone, or the use of file-sharing technologies). In this paper, we will review the current literature on virtual teams, virtual meetings, and creativity. We will then explore theoretical frameworks such as media richness theory that can help us understand how virtuality and virtual tools may influence team creativity across the dynamic range of the creative problem-solving process. Finally, given the limited research in the domain of virtual team creativity we provide questions to help guide future research. Research questions will help identify those areas where virtual teams may be beneficial for creativity and areas where virtual teams may be likely to perform less effectively on creative tasks. © 2021 Roni Reiter-Palmon et al., published by Sciendo 2021.","Reiter-Palmon, R.; Kramer, W.; Allen, J.

The selected MAb recognizes a highly conserved viral epitope and does not lead to the selection of neutralization escape mutants. The sequences of MAb 6A.C3 kappa and gamma 1 modules were identified as subgroup V and subgroup IIIC, respectively. The chimeric immunoglobulin genes encoding the variable modules from the murine MAb and constant modules of human gamma 1 and kappa chains were constructed by reverse transcriptase PCR. Chimeric immunoglobulins were stably or transiently expressed in murine myelomas or COS cells, respectively. The secreted recombinant antibodies had radioimmunoassay titers (i.e., the highest dilution giving a threefold increase over the background) higher than 10(3) and reduced the infectious virus more than 10(4)-fold. Recombinant dimeric immunoglobulin A (IgA) showed a 50-fold enhanced neutralization of TGEV relative to a recombinant monomeric IgG1 which contained the identical antigen binding site. Stably transformed epithelial cell lines which expressed either recombinant IgG or IgA TGEV-neutralizing antibodies reduced virus production by > 10(5)-fold after infection with homologous virus, although a residual level of virus production (< 10(2) PFU/ml) remained in less than 0.1% of the cells. This low-level persistent infection was shown not to be due to the selection of neutralization escape mutants.

ACE2 is abundant in human kidney and heart and has been implicated in renal and cardiac function through its ability to hydrolyze Angiotensin II. Although ACE2 and ACE are both type I integral membrane proteins and share 61% protein sequence similarity, they display distinct modes of enzyme action and tissue distribution. This study characterized ACE2 at the plasma membrane of non-polarized Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKII) epithelial cells and compared its cellular localization to its related enzyme, ACE, using indirect immunofluorescence, cell-surface biotinylation, Western analysis, and enzyme activity assays. This study shows ACE2 and ACE are both cell-surface proteins distributed evenly to detergent-soluble regions of the plasma membrane in CHO cells. However, in polarized MDCKII cells under steady-state conditions the two enzymes are differentially expressed. ACE2 is localized predominantly to the apical surface ( approximately 92%) where it is proteolytically cleaved within its ectodomain to release a soluble form. Comparatively, ACE is present on both the apical ( approximately 55%) and basolateral membranes ( approximately 45%) where it is also secreted but differentially; the ectodomain cleavage of ACE is 2.5-fold greater from the apical surface than the basolateral surface. These studies suggest that both ACE2 and ACE are ectoenzymes that have distinct localization and secretion patterns that determine their role on the cell surface in kidney epithelium and in urine.","Warner, Fiona J; Lew, Rebecca A; Smith, A Ian; Lambert, Daniel W; Hooper, Nigel M; Turner, Anthony J",The Journal of biological chemistry,118,17

This has been attributed to the ability of mature oligodendrocytes and/or their precursor cells to divide and regenerate in response to signals in demyelinating lesions. To determine whether oligodendrocyte precursor cells exist in the adult human CNS, we have cultured white matter from patients undergoing partial temporal lobe resection for intractable epilepsy. These cultures contained a population of process-bearing cells that expressed antigens recognized by the O4 monoclonal antibody, but these cells did not express galactocerebroside (a marker for oligodendrocytes), glial fibrillary acidic protein (a marker for astrocytes), or vimentin. Selective elimination of O4-positive (O4+) cells by complement-mediated lysis resulted in inhibition of oligodendrocyte development in vitro. Since O4+ cells have an antigenic phenotype reminiscent of the rat adult oligodendrocyte-type 2 astrocyte progenitor and appear to develop into oligodendrocytes rather than type 2 astrocytes with time in culture, we call them ""pre-oligodendrocytes."" Neither pre-oligodendrocytes nor oligodendrocytes incorporated 3H-thymidine in response to rat astrocyte-conditioned medium, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). However, IGF-1 increased the relative abundance of oligodendrocytes to pre-oligodendrocytes, while bFGF had the opposite effect. Cells with the antigenic phenotype of pre-oligodendrocytes were also identified in tissue prints of adult human white matter. We propose that, in human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, pre-oligodendrocytes may divide and/or migrate in response to signals present in demyelinated lesions and thus facilitate remyelination.","Armstrong, R C; Dorn, H H; Kufta, C V; Friedman, E; Dubois-Dalcq, M E",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,118,28

PBCNST incidence rates in Kentucky are significantly higher than in the United States as a whole, and are even higher among Kentucky's Appalachian children. To understand and eventually eliminate such disparities, population-based research is needed to gain a thorough understanding of the epidemiology and etiology of the disease. This multi-institutional population-based retrospective cohort study is designed to identify factors associated with the high incidence of PBCNST in Kentucky, leveraging the infrastructure provided by the Kentucky Cancer Registry, its Virtual Tissue Repository (VTR), and the National Institutes of Health Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center (DRC). Spatiotemporal scan statistics have been used to explore geographic patterns of risk measured by standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals. The VTR is being used to collect biospecimens for the population-based cohort of PBCNST tissues that are being sequenced by Center for Data Driven Discovery in Biomedicine (D3b) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) with support from the Kids First DRC. After adjusting for demographic factors, we assess their potential relationship to environmental factors. We have identified regions in north-central and eastern Appalachian Kentucky where children experienced a significant increased risk of developing PBCNST from 1995-2017 (SIR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.34-1.62). The VTR has been successful in the collection of a population-based cohort of 215 PBCNST specimens. Timely establishment of legal agreements for data sharing and tissue acquisition proved to be challenging which has been somewhat mitigated by the adoption of national agreement templates. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severely limited the generation of sequencing results due to laboratory shutdowns.

The full genome of a novel RNA virus was derived, identifying the first sequence-confirmed picornavirus in a marine mammal. The phylogenetic position of the tentatively named seal picornavirus 1 (SePV-1) as an outlier to the grouping of parechoviruses was found consistently in alignable regions of the genome. A mean protein sequence identity of only 19.3 to 30.0% was found between the 3D polymerase gene sequence of SePV-1 and those of other picornaviruses. The predicted secondary structure of the short 506-base 5'-untranslated region showed some attributes of a type IVB internal ribosome entry site, and the polyprotein lacked an apparent L peptide, both properties associated with the Parechovirus genus. The presence of two SePV-1 2A genes and of the canonical sequence required for cotranslational cleavage resembled the genetic organization of Ljungan virus. Minor genetic variants were detected in culture supernatants derived from 8 of 108 (7.4%) seals collected in 2000 to 2002, indicating a high prevalence of SePV-1 in this hunted seal population. The high level of genetic divergence of SePV-1 compared to other picornaviruses and its mix of characteristics relative to its closest relatives support the provisional classification of SePV-1 as the prototype for a new genus in the family Picornaviridae.","Kapoor, A; Victoria, J; Simmonds, P; Wang, C; Shafer, R W; Nims, R; Nielsen, O; Delwart, E",Journal of virology,118,1

In this study we used quantitative RT-PCR to determine the mRNA expression of both cAAP and mAAP in resting and activated peripheral T cells and also in CD4+, CD8+, Th1, Th2 and Treg (CD4+ CD25+) subpopulations. Both mAAP and cAAP mRNAs were expressed in all cell types investigated, and in response to activation their expression appeared to be upregulated in CD8+ cells, but downregulated in Treg cells. In CD4+ cells, mAAP and cAAP mRNAs were affected in opposite ways in response to activation. The cAAP-specific inhibitor, PAQ-22, did not affect either cAAP or mAAP expression in activated CD4+ or CD8+ cells, whereas in activated Treg cells it markedly upregulated the mRNA levels of both aminopeptidases.

Mutations in myocilin exon 3 correlate with age of onset and severity of POAG. Myocilin has been under investigation in experimentally induced glaucoma in rats, mice, and monkeys, however no animal model of inherited POAG exists except in beagles. Our aim was to determine whether canine myocilin more closely resembles human myocilin than does myocilin from other species. METHODS Canine myocilin was cloned and sequenced from beagle ocular tissues and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, a well characterized canine cell line. Immunohistochemistry was performed on beagle tissues and cultured canine ocular primary cells. RT-PCR was employed to analyze genes expressed by tissues and cells. Myocilin protein synthesized by MDCK and canine optic nerve head cells (ONH) was analyzed by metabolic radioisotope labeling. Immunoprecipitation, enzymatic digestion, and Triton X-114 phase separation were performed to determine the carbohydrate content and the hydrophobicity of canine myocilin, respectively. RESULTS Canine ONH astrocytes cultured from a beagle eye expressed myocilin and markers of type 1B astrocytes observed also in human ONH cells in culture. The sequence of canine myocilin showed close similarity with the human sequence but lacked the additional upstream coding region found only in human and rat. Myocilin was labeled with (3)H palmitic acid. This label co-eluted with (35)S label in hydroxylapatite chromatography despite purification by phase separation in Triton X-114, immunoprecipitation with myocilin-specific sera, and denaturing conditions of heat, SDS, and reducing agent. CONCLUSIONS Canine myocilin revealed no striking sequence differences from myocilin of other species. Mutations in myocilin of glaucomatous beagles may suggest a similar pattern of involvement in inherited POAG. This represents the first report of lipid associated with the myocilin protein. Many lipid-modified proteins reside in lipid rafts. This modification of myocilin with lipids supports the unusual secretion properties and may suggest a function of myocilin in sorting, cell signaling and communication between the extracellular matrix and the cell membranes.","Ricard, Cynthia S; Mukherjee, Amrita; Silver, Frankie-Lynn; Wagenknecht, Philip L",Molecular vision,118,1

Frontline health care workers, including community pharmacy personnel, are at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this observational study was to report the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from a sample of North Dakota community pharmacy personnel. METHODS: This observational study was conducted in 2 cities in North Dakota with the highest COVID-19 rates at the time of investigation. Community pharmacy personnel were tested for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies using a rapid antibody test. In addition to antibody testing, participants completed a questionnaire reporting on demographics, previous COVID-19 exposure, previous COVID-19 symptoms, and personal protection equipment (PPE) practices. RESULTS: A total of 247 pharmacy personnel from 29 pharmacies were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The timing and use of PPE varied by location. Among the 247 community pharmacy personnel, 14.6% tested positive for IgM, IgG, or both. Survey data revealed a statistically significant association (P < 0.05) between a positive antibody test and direct contact with an individual who tested positive for COVID-19 (odds ratio: 2.65 [95% CI: 1.18-5.95]), but there were no statistically significant effects related to the workplace, including PPE use, personnel role, or the number of hours worked.

Students were temporarily suspended from campus and clinical sites, requiring prompt changes in structure to their didactic and clinical learning. This article describes the rapid adjustments that one midwifery and women's health nurse practitioner education program created using both synchronous and asynchronous simulation experiences to promote student learning and ongoing engagement. Flexibility and reflexivity were needed by faculty and students alike in the face of the multiple changes wrought by the pandemic. Curricular changes were made simultaneously in many courses. Objective structured clinical examinations simulate telehealth experiences that assess knowledge, clinical reasoning, and professional behaviors via a scripted scenario and an actor patient. On-call simulations mimic telephone triage and provide students the opportunity to build listening, assessment, and management skills for prenatal and intrapartum scenarios. Students are provided equipment and virtual instruction in an intrauterine device insertion session, which promotes skill acquisition and self-confidence. Trigger films are used to visualize real-life or scripted clinical encounters, leading to discussion and decision-making, particularly in the affective domain. Bilateral learning tools, similar to case studies, provide students an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and critical thinking with a mechanism for faculty feedback. Web-based virtual clinical encounter learning tools using patient avatars prompt additional student learning. Suturing skills introduced in live remote group sessions are augmented with video-guided individual practice. This article describes each of these adapted and innovative simulation methods and shares lessons learned during their development and implementation.","Bradford, Heather M; Farley, Cindy L; Escobar, Melicia; Heitzler, Ella T; Tringali, Tanya; Walker, Kelly C",J Midwifery Womens Health,118,33

We developed a novel SARS-CoV-2 MCDA assay and compared its speed and sensitivity to loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and rt-PCR. Two MCDA assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 N gene and ORF1ab were designed. The fastest time to detection and sensitivity of MCDA was compared to LAMP and rt-PCR using DNA standards and transcribed RNA. For the N gene, MCDA was faster than LAMP and rt-PCR by 10 and 20 min, respectively with fastest time to detection at 5.2 min. rt-PCR had the highest sensitivity with the limit of detection at 10 copies/µl compared with MCDA (100 copies/µl) and LAMP (500 copies/µl). For ORF1ab, MCDA and LAMP had similar speed with fastest time to detection at 9.7 and 8.4 min, respectively. LAMP was more sensitive for ORF1ab detection with 50 copies/µl compared to MCDA (500 copies/µl). In conclusion, different nucleic acid amplification methods provide different advantages. MCDA is the fastest nucleic acid amplification method for SARS-CoV-2 while rt-PCR is the most sensitive.

This is because most of the universities postponed the physical attendance at universities and used technology tools to keep the communication among the academic staff and students. ICT allows for the rapid search, access, and retrieval of information and collaboration between employees, while ICT infrastructure refers to the equipment, software, communication systems, and the human component such as experience, skills, command, principles. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of ICT and ICT infrastructure on Knowledge Sharing among academic staff. The study was conducted at nine Iraqi public universities located in Baghdad and the sample was the academic staff at these universities. The study employed the stratified sample method to ensure equal distribution among the nine universities, and the data was collected using the questionnaire. Structural equation modelling was utilized to analyze 267 valid questionnaires. After testing the measurement model and ensuring the model fit, the study examined the structural model to find the results. The result showed that ICT and ICT infrastructure had positive and significant impact on Knowledge Sharing among the academic staff at Iraqi public universities. However, the result indicated the Knowledge Sharing was highly impacted by ICT infrastructure. The government and universities should enhance and improve the ICT infrastructure that would provide a great benefit to the Iraqi universities' reputation as well as the universities' rank. © 2020 IEEE.","Jameel, A.

This situation is suitable for vision transformer architecture that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data using pre-training. However, the direct use of existing vision transformer that uses the corpus generated by the ResNet is not optimal for correct feature embedding. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel vision Transformer by using the low-level CXR feature corpus that are obtained to extract the abnormal CXR features. Specifically, the backbone network is trained using large public datasets to obtain the abnormal features in routine diagnosis such as consolidation, glass-grass opacity (GGO), etc. Then, the embedded features from the backbone network are used as corpus for vision transformer training. We examine our model on various external test datasets acquired from totally different institutions to assess the generalization ability. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieved the state-of-art performance and has better generalization capability, which are crucial for a widespread deployment.","Park, Sangjoon; Kim, Gwanghyun; Oh, Yujin; Seo, Joon Beom; Lee, Sang Min; Kim, Jin Hwan; Moon, Sungjun; Lim, Jae-Kwang; Ye, Jong Chul",,118,22

Also, frequencies of atrial fibrillation, axis change, ST-segment/T-wave change, fragmented QRS, premature atrial/ventricular contraction was found to be higher in the cardiac injury group. Moreover, non-survivors had longer QRS intervals, more frequent ST-segment/T-wave changes and isolated S1Q3T3 pattern than surviving patients. Laboratory results showed median values of hs-TnT at the admission of 4.95 ng/L (IQR, 3-12.35) with concentrations markedly higher in the non-surviving patients vs survivors. Hs-TnT value along with age and respiratory rate was found to be an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Comorbidities were more frequently reported in non-surviving and cardiac injury groups than those surviving and without cardiac injury. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 patients, both elevated hs-TnT and ECG abnormalities, suggesting cardiac involvement, on admission portends an ominous prognosis and indicates at higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Prioritised treatment and more aggressive therapeutic strategies could be planned to avoid the occurrence of death in these patients.","Omar, Timor; Karakayali, Muammer; Perincek, Gökhan",Acta Cardiol,118,24

The risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with cancer seems to be higher, especially as they are more likely to present with an immunocompromised condition, either from cancer itself or from the treatments they receive. A major consideration in the delivery of cancer care during the pandemic is to balance the risk of patient exposure and infection with the need to provide effective cancer treatment. Many aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection currently remain poorly characterized and even less is known about the course of infection in the context of a patient with cancer. As SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, the risk of infection directly affects the cancer patient being treated, other cancer patients in close proximity, and health care providers. Infection at any level for patients or providers can cause considerable disruption to even the most effective treatment plans. Lung cancer patients, especially those with reduced lung function and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are more likely to have increased risk and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 as one of its common manifestations is as an acute respiratory illness. The purpose of this manuscript is to present a practical multidisciplinary and international overview to assist in treatment for lung cancer patients during this pandemic, with the caveat that evidence is lacking in many areas. It is expected that firmer recommendations can be developed as more evidence becomes available.","Dingemans, Anne-Marie C; Soo, Ross A; Jazieh, Abdul Rahman; Rice, Shawn J; Kim, Young Tae; Teo, Lynette L S; Warren, Graham W; Xiao, Shu-Yuan; Smit, Egbert F; Aerts, Joachim G; Yoon, Soon Ho; Veronesi, Giulia; De Cobelli, Francesco; Ramalingam, Suresh S; Garassino, Marina C; Wynes, Murry W; Behera, Madhusmita; Haanen, John; Lu, Shun; Peters, Solange; Ahn, Myung-Ju; Scagliotti, Giorgio V; Adjei, Alex A; Belani, Chandra P",J Thorac Oncol,118,5

With a proven vaccine at least a year from being fully tested for safety and efficacy, there may be an opportunity to rapidly repurpose existing drugs in order to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and improve outcomes for patients already infected with COVID-19. At present, more than 40 different drugs are being explored for efficacy against COVID-19, including antivirals and immune modulating compounds. Unfortunately, many of these drugs are associated with side effects that limit their use to the most severe cases and thereby prevent their use as prophylactics. This commentary describes drug formulation strategies that can be used to maintain the efficacy of these drugs through controlled release, targeted delivery, and non-viral nucleic acid delivery. If successful, these approaches could enable the expanded use of drugs to reduce the mortality of this devastating disease and equip healthcare providers with the tools to accelerate our recovery from this pandemic and improve our response to the next outbreak of a novel pathogenic virus.

METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 31 healthy controls were included in this prospective and observational study. Individuals with COVID-19 formed the patient group, and healthy individuals formed the control group. Conjunctival impression cytology (CIC), TBUT, Schirmer II test, and ocular surface disease index were evaluated in all participants. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed regarding the mean age and gender between the groups (P=0.786 and P=0.122, respectively). The mean TBUT and Schirmer II test results did not differ between the two groups (P=0.496 and P=0.447, respectively). The CIC results revealed decreased density and cell size of goblet cells and moderate to high enlargement, squamous changes, and increased nucleocytoplasmic ratio in nongoblet epithelial cells in the COVID-19 group compared with the control group. Based on the Nelson classification in CIC samples, 60.6% of the COVID-19 group and 19.4% of the control group had changes consistent with grade 2 or above. The presence of neutrophils in CIC was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (P<0.001), whereas the presence of lymphocyte was similar between the two groups (P=0.247). CONCLUSION: This study revealed the pathological conjunctival alterations in patients with COVID-19 and demonstrated that pathological ocular surface alterations may present even at the beginning of COVID-19 without clinically significant ocular manifestation.","Bozkurt, Erdinç; Özates, Serdar; Muhafiz, Ersin; Yilmaz, Fatma; Caliskan, Okan",Eye contact lens,118,22

Hypertension is of particular interest because it is common in adults and there are concerns related to the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in patients with hypertension infected with COVID-19. Levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein that facilitates entry of coronavirus into cells, may increase in patients using RAS inhibitors. Thus, chronic use of RAS inhibition could potentially lead to a more severe and fatal form of COVID-19. In this review, we provide a critical review to the following questions: (1) Does hypertension influence immunity or ACE2 expression favoring viral infections? (2) Are the risks of complications in hypertension mediated by its treatment? (3) Is aging a major factor associated with worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19 and hypertension? RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the potential involvement of immune responses in the pathogenesis of hypertension, there is no evidence supporting that hypothesis that hypertension or RAS inhibitors contributes to unfavorable outcomes in viral infections. Future investigations adopting a strict protocol for confirming hypertension status as well as assessing associated comorbidities that may influence outcomes are necessary. From the therapeutic perspective, recombinant ACE2 may serve as a potential therapy, but relevant studies in humans are lacking. Definitive evidence regarding the use of RAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 is needed; 5 randomized trials examining this issue are currently underway. There is no current scientific support for claiming that hypertension or its treatment with RAS inhibitors contribute to unfavorable outcomes in COVID-19.","Drager, Luciano F; Pio-Abreu, Andrea; Lopes, Renato D; Bortolotto, Luiz A",Curr Hypertens Rep,118,24

Several systemic involvements have been reported in Covid-19 patients. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the cerebrovascular hemodynamics in patients with Covid-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample of this study was conducted on 20 patients hospitalized in our clinic diagnosed with Covid-19 via PCR modality and 20 healthy volunteers of similar age and sex. Bilateral middle cerebral arteries were investigated with Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography. Basal serebral blood flow velocities and vasomotor reactivity rates were determined and compared as statistically. RESULTS: When patient and control groups were compared, the mean blood flow velocity was found to be higher in Covid-19 patients than the healthy volunteers and it was statistically significant (p = 0.00). The mean vasomotor reactivity rates values were found to be lower in Covid-19 group than the healthy group and also it was statistically significant (p = 0.00). CONCLUSION: An increase in cerebral basal blood velocity and a decrease in vasomotor reactivity rates in patients with Covid-19 can be considered as an indicator of dysfunction of cerebral hemodynamics in central nervous system and this can be evaluated as a result of endothelial dysfunction.","Sonkaya, AlI Riza; ÖztÜrk, BIlgIn; KaradaS, Ömer",,118,23

PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases and Google Scholar were searched up to 26 November 2020. All retrospective and prospective cohort, cross-sectional, case-control, and randomized controlled trial studies that investigated the relation between 25(OH)D and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 severity were included. Thirty-nine studies were included in the current systematic review. In studies that were adjusted (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.53; I2: 44.2%) and nonadjusted for confounders (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.44, 2.13; I2: 33.0%) there was a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the vitamin D deficiency (VDD) group. Fifteen studies evaluated associations between VDD and composite severity. In the studies that were adjusted (OR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.65, 4.01; I2 = 0.0%) and nonadjusted for confounders (OR: 10.61; 95% CI: 2.07, 54.23; I2 = 90.8%) there was a higher severity in the VDD group. Analysis of studies with crude OR (OR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.13, 6.05; I2: 47.9%), and adjusted studies that used the Cox survival method (HR: 2.35; 95% CI: 1.22, 4.52; I2: 84%) indicated a significant association of VDD with mortality, while in adjusted studies that used logistic regression, no relation was observed (OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.75; I2: 76.6%). The results of studies that examined relations between VDD and intensive care unit (ICU) admission, pulmonary complications, hospitalization, and inflammation were inconsistent. In conclusion, although studies were heterogeneous in methodological and statistical approach, most of them indicated a significant relation between 25(OH)D and SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 composite severity, and mortality. With regard to infection, caution should be taken in interpreting the results, due to inherent study limitations. For ICU admission, inflammation, hospitalization, and pulmonary involvement, the evidence is currently inconsistent and insufficient.","Kazemi, Asma; Mohammadi, Vida; Aghababaee, Sahar Keshtkar; Golzarand, Mahdieh; Clark, Cain C T; Babajafari, Siavash","Adv. nutr.

Many classes were converted into e-learning formats. Teaching at the bedside (BST) seemed unfeasible under the circumstances. BST and clinical reasoning as its major outcome is introduced at the beginning of semester 5, henceforth all BST refers to this first presentation. Project outline: To ensure proficiency of current 5th semester students in future BST sessions, the introduction could not be cancelled albeit teaching with patients was. Knowing that the practical learning objectives of bedside teaching cannot be mirrored in online formats, a compensating module to teach the concept of BST and clinical reasoning had to be designed. Summary of work: To facilitate an understanding of the concept of bedside teaching with a focus on clinical reasoning we developed paper cases and a survey in Microsoft Forms following the history and examination path used in live BST with the addendum of clinical reasoning tables. For the first paper case, a personal feedback was provided for the clinical reasoning tables. A sample solution was provided later for self-feedback on the whole case. The first case was completed by 87, the second by 40 of 336 students. Response to individual feedback was positive. Students still missed hands-on training in history taking and examination with patients. Discussion: Paper cases cannot fully substitute BST. However, given the prime directive during the pandemic to protect our patients, this module engaged around one third of the cohort. The review of uploaded clinical reasoning tables gave proof to the sufficient students' grasp of clinical reasoning. Conclusion: Albeit not an exhaustive substitute for BST, this online module seems a feasible way to convey clinical reasoning strategies to students.","Djermester, Pia; Gröschke, Christian; Gintrowicz, Robert; Peters, Harm; Degel, Antje",GMS J Med Educ,118,1

According to the WHO situation report at April 17, there were 22,â073 HCWs contracted the infection. Whether the infection control policy and practice in the hospital setting can protect the HCWs is an important issue. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional serology study in a tertiary care hospital in Taiwan to explore the sero-prevalence rate among HCWs. The participants are enrolled on a voluntary basis. A structured questionnaire was collected to gather the epidemiology character and risk factors for potential exposure. ELISA tests as Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche) were used to detect antibody responses. If any of the tests was positive, a western blot assay was used for confirmation. RESULTS: There were 194 HCWs participated during July 1 to Aug. 31, 2020. The mean age was 36.3 ± 10.4. More than half of the participants had possible hospital associated risk for COVID-19 exposure (110/192, 57.3%) and 64 had possible community risk for COVID-19 exposure (64/194, 33.0%).

This research sought to examine whether intolerance of uncertainty and coping responses influence the degree of distress experienced by the U.K. general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a cross-sectional online questionnaire design, participants were recruited (N = 842) using snowball sampling over a 10-day period in the early ""lockdown"" phase of the pandemic. Around a quarter of participants demonstrated significantly elevated anxiety and depression, with 14.8% reaching clinical cutoff for health anxiety. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance indicated those in ""vulnerable"" groups were significantly more anxious (p < .001), and also more anxious in relation to their health (p < .001). Mediation modeling demonstrated maladaptive coping responses partially mediated the predictive relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological distress. Mental health difficulties have become significantly raised during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, particularly for the vulnerable. Findings support emerging research suggesting the general public is struggling with uncertainty, more so than normal. Vulnerable groups are more anxious about their health, but not more intolerant of uncertainty than the nonvulnerable. Finally, this study indicated two modifiable factors that could act as treatment targets when adapting interventions for mental health during the COVID-19 global health crisis.

Accordingly, it has been hypothesized to have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal BCG childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate, thus allowing us to estimate the BCG's effect without the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. METHODS: Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after 1975, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 1·0005 (CI95: [0·8130-1·1881]) and 1·2046 (CI95: [0·7532-1·6560]), allowing us to reject fairly modest effects of universal BCG vaccination. We can reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by 19% and the number of hospitalizations by 25%. CONCLUSIONS: While the effect of a recent vaccination must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19 among middle-aged individuals.","de Chaisemartin, Clément; de Chaisemartin, Luc",Clin Infect Dis,118,28

Telemedicine should be vigorously promoted to reduce the risk of infections and to offer medical assistance to restricted patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand physicians' attitudes toward and perspectives of telemedicine during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to provide support for better implementation of telemedicine. METHODS: We surveyed all physicians (N=148), from October 17 to 25, 2020, who attended the clinical informatics PhD program at West China Medical School, Sichuan University, China. The physicians came from 57 hospitals in 16 provinces (ie, municipalities) across China, 54 of which are 3A-level hospitals, two are 3B-level hospitals, and one is a 2A-level hospital. RESULTS: Among 148 physicians, a survey response rate of 87.2% (129/148) was attained. The average age of the respondents was 35.6 (SD 3.9) years (range 23-48 years) and 67 out of 129 respondents (51.9%) were female. The respondents come from 37 clinical specialties in 55 hospitals located in 14 provinces (ie, municipalities) across Eastern, Central, and Western China. A total of 94.6% (122/129) of respondents' hospitals had adopted a telemedicine system; however, 34.1% (44/129) of the physicians had never used a telemedicine system and only 9.3% (12/129) used one frequently (&#8805;1 time/week). A total of 91.5% (118/129) and 88.4% (114/129) of physicians were willing to use telemedicine during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Physicians considered the inability to examine patients in person to be the biggest concern (101/129, 78.3%) and the biggest barrier (76/129, 58.9%) to implementing telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is not yet universally available for all health care needs and has not been used frequently by physicians in this study. However, the willingness of physicians to use telemedicine was high. Telemedicine still has many problems to overcome.","Liu, Jialin; Liu, Siru; Zheng, Tao; Bi, Yongdong",JMIR Med Inform,118,5

The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has also enjoyed widespread adoption, mostly for its ability to add ""sensing"" and ""actuation"" capabilities to existing CPS infrastructures. However, attention must be paid to the impact of IoT protocols on the dependability of CPS infrastructures. We address the issues of CPS dependability by using an epidemic model of the underlying dynamics within the CPS' IoT subsystem (CPS-IoT) and an interference-aware routing reconfiguration. These help to efficiently monitor CPS infrastructure-avoiding routing oscillation, while improving its safety. The contributions of this paper are threefold. Firstly, a CPS orchestration model is proposed that relies upon: (i) Inbound surveillance and outbound actuation to improve dependability and (ii) a novel information diffusion model that uses epidemic states and diffusion sets to produce diffusion patterns across the CPS-IoT. Secondly, the proposed CPS orchestration model is numerically analysed to show its dependability for both sensitive and non-sensitive applications. Finally, a novel interference-aware clustering protocol called ""INMP"", which enables network reconfiguration through migration of nodes across clusters, is proposed. It is then bench-marked against prominent IoT protocols to assess its impact on the dependability of the CPS.","Bagula, Antoine; Ajayi, Olasupo; Maluleke, Hloniphani",Sensors (Basel),118,24

In New South Wales (NSW), the most populous state in Australia, COVID-19 case numbers have to date been relatively low. However, that does not mean the state's healthcare system has been unaffected. Preparations to create sufficient capacity to accommodate a COVID-19 surge resulted in widespread deferment of scheduled medical procedures and appointments. Patterns of healthcare-seeking behaviour changed, with a reluctance to visit healthcare settings. The aim of this study was to quantify the changes in activity seen in the NSW health system in the first half of 2020. METHODS: Healthcare data were drawn from multiple sources, including primary care, ambulance, emergency departments and inpatient settings. Volumes of healthcare activity in 2020, overall, by urgency of cases and by reasons for care were compared with the figures for the same period in 2019. Changes in the modality of care provision were also examined. RESULTS: In March to June 2020, compared with the same period in 2019, primary care face-to-face consultations decreased by 22.1%, breast screening activity by 51.5%, ambulance incidents by 7.2%, emergency department visits by 13.9%, public hospital inpatient episodes by 14.3%, and public hospital planned surgical activity by 32.6%. CONCLUSION: There were substantial declines in a wide range of healthcare activities across the NSW health system between March and June 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although activity levels were recovering by September 2020, they had not yet returned to 'normal'. The implications of these changes - and the indirect impact of COVID-19 - require further study.","Sutherland, Kim; Chessman, Julia; Zhao, Jiaying; Sara, Grant; Shetty, Amith; Smith, Sharon; Went, Allan; Dyson, Sophie; Levesque, Jean-Frédéric",Public Health Res.

Among the peculiar characteristics of their biological vision are that they have two types of foveae; one shallow fovea used in their binocular vision, and a deep fovea for monocular vision. The deep fovea allows these birds to see objects at long distances and to identify them as possible prey. Inspired by the biological functioning of the deep fovea a model called DeepFoveaNet is proposed in this paper. DeepFoveaNet is a convolutional neural network model to detect moving objects in video sequences. DeepFoveaNet emulates the monocular vision of birds of prey through two Encoder-Decoder convolutional neural network modules. This model combines the capacity of magnification of the deep fovea and the context information of the peripheral vision. Unlike algorithms to detect moving objects, ranked in the first places of the Change Detection database (CDnet14), DeepFoveaNet does not depend on previously trained neural networks, neither on a huge number of training images for its training. Besides, its architecture allows it to learn spatiotemporal information of the video. DeepFoveaNet was evaluated in the CDnet14 database achieving high performance and was ranked as one of the ten best algorithms. The characteristics and results of DeepFoveaNet demonstrated that the model is comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms to detect moving objects, and it can detect very small moving objects through its deep fovea model that other algorithms cannot detect.","Guzman-Pando, Abimael; Chacon-Murguia, Mario I",IEEE Trans Image Process,118,5

There are at least three subtypes: cytokine release syndrome (CRS), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and sepsis. METHODS: A retrospective study comprising 276 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. All patients were tested for ferritin, interleukin-6, D-Dimer, fibrinogen, calcitonin, and C-reactive protein. According to the diagnostic criteria, three groups of patients with different subtypes of cytokine storm syndrome were identified: MAS, CRS or sepsis. In the MAS and CRS groups, treatment results were assessed depending on whether or not tocilizumab was used. RESULTS: MAS was diagnosed in 9.1% of the patients examined, CRS in 81.8%, and sepsis in 9.1%. Median serum ferritin in patients with MAS was significantly higher (5894 vs. 984 vs. 957 ng/mL, p < 0.001) than in those with CRS or sepsis. Hypofibrinogenemia and pancytopenia were also observed in MAS patients. In CRS patients, a higher mortality rate was observed among those who received tocilizumab, 21 vs. 10 patients (p = 0.043), RR = 2.1 (95% CI 1.0-4.3). In MAS patients, tocilizumab decreased the mortality, 13 vs. 6 patients (p = 0.013), RR = 0.50 (95% CI 0.25-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab therapy in patients with COVID-19 and CRS was associated with increased mortality, while in MAS patients, it contributed to reduced mortality.","Oliynyk, Oleksandr; Barg, Wojciech; Slifirczyk, Anna; Oliynyk, Yanina; Gurianov, Vitaliy; Rorat, Marta",Viruses,118,13

It is shown that the accurate prediction of the hyperfine structure of the RaF molecule requires to take into account the finite magnetization distribution inside the radium nucleus. For atoms, this effect is known as the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) effect. Its magnitude depends on the model of the nuclear magnetization distribution which is usually not well known. We show that it is possible to express the nuclear magnetization distribution contribution to the hyperfine structure constant in terms of one magnetization distribution dependent parameter: BW matrix element for $1s$-state of the corresponding hydrogen-like ion. This parameter can be extracted from the accurate experimental and theoretical electronic structure data for an ion, atom, or molecule without the explicit treatment of any nuclear magnetization distribution model. This approach can be applied to predict the hyperfine structure of atoms and \textit{molecules} and allows one to separate the nuclear and electronic correlation problems. It is employed to calculate the finite nuclear magnetization distribution contribution to the hyperfine structure of the $^{225}$Ra$^+$ cation and $^{225}$RaF molecule. For the ground state of the $^{225}$RaF molecule, this contribution achieves 4\%.","Skripnikov, Leonid V.",,118,4

Although predominantly a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, corona virus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19) results in multi-organ damage that impairs cardiopulmonary (CP) function and reduces cardiorespiratory fitness. Superimposed on the CP consequences of COVID-19 is a marked reduction in physical activity that exacerbates CP disease (CPD) risk. CP exercise testing (CPET) is routinely used in clinical practice to diagnose CPD and assess prognosis; assess cardiovascular safety for rehabilitation; and delineate the physiological contributors to exercise intolerance and exertional fatigue. As such, CPET plays an important role in clinical assessments of convalescent COVID-19 patients as well as research aimed at understanding the long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to the ventilatory expired gas analysis involved with CPET, the procedure is considered an aerosol generating procedure. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken by health care providers and exercise physiologists performing these tests. This paper provides recommendations for CPET testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. These recommendations include indications for CPET; pre-screening assessments; precautions required for testing; and suggested decontamination protocols. These safety recommendations are aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission during CPET.","Mihalick, Virginia L; Canada, Justin M; Arena, Ross; Abbate, Antonio; Kirkman, Danielle L",Prog. cardiovasc. dis,118,16

TRIAL DESIGN: This is a pilot phase 2, multicentre 2-arm (1:1 ratio) open-label randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis (defined as SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive nasopharyngeal swab) will be recruited from four participating isolation and treatment centres in Nigeria: two secondary care facilities (Infectious Diseases Hospital, Olodo, Ibadan, Oyo State and Specialist State Hospital, Asubiaro, Osogbo, Osun State) and two tertiary care facilities (Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Osun State and Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, Ogun State). These facilities have a combined capacity of 146-bed COVID-19 isolation and treatment ward. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR test within two days before randomisation and initiation of treatment, age bracket of 18 and 75 years, symptomatic, able to understand study information and willingness to participate. Exclusion criteria include the inability to take orally administered medication or food, known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, pregnant or lactating, current or recent (within 24 hours of enrolment) treatment with agents with actual or likely antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, concurrent use of agents with known or suspected interaction with study drugs, and requiring mechanical ventilation at screening. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants in the intervention group will receive 1000 mg of nitazoxanide twice daily orally and 300/100 mg of atazanvir/ritonavir once daily orally in addition to standard of care while participants in the control group will receive only standard of care. Standard of care will be determined by the physician at the treatment centre in line with the current guidelines for clinical management of COVID-19 in Nigeria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures are: (1) Time to clinical improvement (defined as time from randomisation to either an improvement of two points on a 10-category ordinal scale (developed by the WHO Working Group on the Clinical Characterisation and Management of COVID-19 infection) or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first); (2) Proportion of participants with SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative result at days 2, 4, 6, 7, 14 and 28; (3) Temporal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 viral load on days 2, 4, 6, 7, 14 and 28 quantified by RT-PCR from saliva of patients receiving standard of care alone versus standard of care plus study drugs. RANDOMISATION: Allocation of participants to study arm is randomised within each site with a ratio 1:1 based on randomisation sequences generated centrally at Obafemi Awolowo University. The model was implemented in REDCap and includes stratification by age, gender, viral load at diagnosis and presence of relevant comorbidities. BLINDING: None, this is an open-label trial. NUMBER TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): 98 patients (49 per arm).

According to the California Department of Public Health pregnant women were 9.6-folds more likely to be hospitalized during the 2009 influenza outbreak when compared to non-pregnant women in reproductive age. In contrast, it was reported that of 16,749 COVID-19 patients that were hospitalized in the UK, the probability for pregnant women to require in-patient care due to infection by SARS-CoV-2 was 0.95 versus non-pregnant women. Therefore 9.6/0.95 = 10.10, which brings us to the conclusion that pregnant women are 10.10-folds less likely to be hospitalized for a SARS-CoV-2 infection than for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy could be the factor that is protecting these patients against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two independent papers that used informatic simulation proved that folic acid reduced the replication of this virus. One of them showed that folic acid inhibits the furin protease which the virus needs in order to enter its host cell, while the other one explained that folic acid inactivates protease 3CL pro , a protein that the virus needs to replicate. Nonetheless the probability that folic acid blocks two different proteins is very low, therefore the mechanism by which folic acid has apparently protected pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been determined.","Acosta-Elias, Jesus; Espinosa-Tanguma, Ricardo",Front Pharmacol,118,23

The first such interaction is the recognition of viral envelope proteins by surface receptors that normally fulfil other physiological roles, a hijacking mechanism perfected over the course of evolution. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has successfully adopted this strategy using its spike glycoprotein to dock on the membrane-bound metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The crystal structures of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins alone or in complex with their receptors or other ligands were recently solved at an unprecedented pace. This accomplishment is partly due to the increasing availability of data on other coronaviruses and ACE2 over the past 18 years. Likewise, other key intervening actors and mechanisms of viral infection were elucidated with the aid of biophysical approaches. An understanding of the various structurally important motifs of the interacting partners provides key mechanistic information for the development of structure-based designer drugs able to inhibit various steps of the infective cycle, including neutralizing antibodies, small organic drugs, and vaccines.

All were health professionals (four medical doctors), five were female, with a median age of 43.5 years, and three had comorbidities. All patients were confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR in naso and/or oropharyngeal swab samples. Among the reported cases, three (50%) underwent RT-PCR testing in the period between the two symptomatic episodes, with negative results. The time elapsed between the onset of symptoms in the two episodes ranged from 53 to 70 days (median, 56.5 days). In the first episode, the main symptoms described were fever (4/6), myalgia (3/6), sore throat (3/6), and cough (3/6). Meanwhile, during the second episode, fever (4/6) and weakness (3/6) predominated. Most of the cases progressed without complications, although one individual presented hypoxemia (minimum SatO2 of 90%) in both episodes, and two, only in the second, one of which required intensive care unit admission, progressing with improvement after medication and receiving noninvasive ventilatory support. We report cases with recurrence of symptoms compatible with COVID-19, with positive RT-PCR results, that could represent the occurrence of viral reactivation or reinfection. The true nature of this phenomenon should be better clarified in future studies.","Fernandes Valente Takeda, Christianne; Moura de Almeida, Magda; Gonçalves de Aguiar Gomes, Ricristhi; Cisne Souza, Tatiana; Alves de Lima Mota, Matheus; Pamplona de Góes Cavalcanti, Luciano; Baima Colares, Jeová Keny",Am J Trop Med Hyg,118,16

Research has indicated that yoga has promising potential in reducing stress in the workplace. However, there are very few studies exploring the impact of online streamed yoga on stress management for people-WFH. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility and outcome of an online streamed yoga intervention on stress and wellbeing of people-WFH during COVID-19. METHODS: A six-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) yoga intervention was designed with yoga (nâ=â26) and a wait-list control group (nâ=â26). A mixed two-way ANOVA was used to assess changes in standardised outcome measures at baseline and post-intervention. Likert and open-ended questions assessed enjoyment, acceptability and perceived benefits of the program, which were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Compared with the control, the yoga group reported significant improvements in perceived stress, mental wellbeing, depression and coping self-efficacy, but not stress and anxiety. Participants experienced physical and mental health benefits and reported high acceptability and enjoyment of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: An online yoga intervention can help people WFH manage stress and enhance wellbeing and coping abilities.","Wadhen, Vipin; Cartwright, Tina",Work,118,16

Features of this newly recognized condition may include fever, hypotension, severe abdominal pain and cardiac dysfunction, evidence of inflammation, and single or multi organ dysfunction in the absence of other known infections. Children emerge to have mild symptoms compared to adults, perhaps due to reduced expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptor (the target of SARS-CoV-2) gene, trained innate immunity, and a young and fit immune system. Some of these children may share features of Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome or cytokine storm syndrome. They can deteriorate rapidly and may need intensive care support as well.

This study evaluated the role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) cytology in the diagnosis of UGIT-MTs and impact of rapid onsite evaluation (ROSE). METHODS: We retrospectively search our electronic database between January 2001 and August 2019 for cases that underwent EUS-FNA for a submucosal/or intramural upper GI tract mass forming lesions. Data pertinent to immunostain expression in UGIT-MTs was also collected. RESULTS: We identified 139 cases, of which 72 cases had subsequent surgical resection. The cytologic diagnoses included nondiagnostic, negative, atypical, suspicious for neoplasm and positive for neoplasm (PFN) in 11, 7, 11, 10, and 100 cases, respectively. Diagnosis of PFN was rendered in 51 of 69 cases with ROSE (74%) and in 49 of 70 cases without ROSE (70%). However, the cases with ROSE had a higher percentage of cases being precisely classified than without ROSE (86% vs 61%, P < .05). On comparison of cytologic cases with cell block (CB) (n = 118) and without CB (n = 21), ROSE was performed in 67 (57%) and 2 (10%) cases, respectively (P < .01). All the cases with diagnosis of PFN were confirmed on subsequent surgical resection. CONCLUSION: EUS-FNA has a diagnostic yield of 72% for UGIT-MTs. ROSE could improve diagnostic performance by further classifying MTs, probably via securing adequate lesional material for cell block for additional ancillary testing and precise diagnosis.","Gilani, Syed M; Muniraj, Thiruvengadam; Aslanian, Harry R; Cai, Guoping",Diagn. cytopathol,118,1

Mounting evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via the air; however, this has not yet been demonstrated. Here we quantitatively analyze virion accumulation by accounting for aerosolized virion emission and destabilization. Reported superspreading events analyzed within this framework point towards aerosol mediated transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Virion exposure calculated for these events is found to trace out a single value, suggesting a universal minimum infective dose (MID) via aerosol that is comparable to the MIDs measured for other respiratory viruses; thus, the consistent infectious exposure levels and their commensurability to known aerosol-MIDs establishes the plausibility of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

There are three primary criticisms of the doctrine: first, that any “dormant” or “negative” component of the Commerce Clause is not supported by the text, structure, or history of the Constitution;second, that to recognize a specific ban on extraterritorial legislation is to misread core Commerce Clause cases;and third, that, even if there is a sound basis for a ban on extraterritorial legislation, such a prohibition is no longer needed because in today’s modern economy regulated entities can comply easily with diverse state regulations. Despite these textual, jurisprudential, and practical criticisms, courts continue to invoke the doctrine to restrict the traditional police powers of the state. Recently, courts used the doctrine to block Maryland from ensuring that live-saving prescription drugs are affordable and New York from requiring that opioid manufacturers contribute to a fund for addiction treatment. To make matters worse, the courts’ use of the doctrine is inconsistent, if not incoherent. Indeed, there are three live circuit splits on the existence and meaning of the doctrine. A new model is needed. This Article proposes that the extraterritoriality doctrine be collapsed into a Due Process inquiry. Doing so will give courts a familiar availment standard to deploy, will restore the authority of the states to set the terms of access to their market, and will respect the ability of market actors to weigh whether the proposed terms are worth the prospects of market entry.

At present, the law of COVID-19 spread in cities is not clear. Cities have long been difficult areas for epidemic prevention and control because of the high population density, high mobility of people, and high frequency of contacts. This paper analyzed case information for 417 patients with COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China. The nearest neighbor index method, kernel density method, and the standard deviation ellipse method were used to analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of the COVID-19 spread in Shenzhen. The factors influencing that spread were then explored using the multiple linear regression method. The results show that: (1) The development of COVID-19 epidemic situation in Shenzhen occurred in three stages. The patients showed significant hysteresis from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization and then to diagnosis. Prior to 27 January, there was a relatively long time interval between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization for COVID-19; the interval decreased thereafter. (2) The epidemic site (the place where the patient stays during the onset of the disease) showed an agglomeration in space. The degree of agglomeration constantly increased across the three time nodes of 31 January, 14 February, and 22 February. The epidemic sites formed a ""core area"" in terms of spatial distribution and spread along the ""northwest-southeast"" direction of the city. (3) Economic and social factors significantly impacted the spread of COVID-19, while environmental factors have not played a significant role.","Liu, Shirui; Qin, Yaochen; Xie, Zhixiang; Zhang, Jingfei",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),118,26

Among these is a novel form of coagulopathy that includes exceptionally high levels of D-dimer. D-dimer is a marker of poor prognosis, but does this also imply a causal relationship? These spectacularly raised D-dimer levels may actually signify the failing attempt of the fibrinolytic system to remove fibrin and necrotic tissue from the lung parenchyma, being consumed or overwhelmed in the process. Indeed, recent studies suggest that increasing fibrinolytic activity might offer hope for patients with critical disease and severe respiratory failure. However, the fibrinolytic system can also be harnessed by coronavirus to promote infectivity and where antifibrinolytic measures would also seem appropriate. Hence, there is a clinical paradox where plasmin formation can be either deleterious or beneficial in COVID-19, but not at the same time. Hence, it all comes down to timing.","Medcalf, Robert L; Keragala, Charithani B; Myles, Paul S",J. thromb. haemost,118,16

METHODS: This was a prospective case series of consecutive pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 27 March 2020 and 24 January 2021. We collected information regarding deep throat saliva or nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results, serial cycle threshold (Ct) values at and after diagnosis, demographic, clinical and outcome data, and neonatal NPS RT-PCR results. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of IgG and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was performed in maternal and cord blood serum samples obtained at delivery. Correlation of maternal Ct values, infection-to-delivery interval, infection duration and viral load area under the curve (AUC) with gestational age (GA) at diagnosis, maternal and cord serum IgG concentrations and transplacental transfer ratio of IgG were evaluated using Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: Twenty pregnant women who consented to participate and who had delivered their babies by 31 January 2021 were included in the study, comprising 14 who had recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and six with active infection at delivery. The median GA at clinical manifestation was 32.7 (range, 11.9-39.4) weeks. The median infection-to-delivery interval and infection duration were 41.5 (range, 2-187) days and 10.0 (range, 1-48) days, respectively. The median GA at delivery was 39.1 (range, 32.4-40.7) weeks and the median seroconversion interval was 14 (range, 1-19) days. Of 13 neonates born to seropositive mothers with recovered infection at delivery, 12 tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. All neonatal NPS samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 and all cord sera tested negative for IgM. The median transplacental transfer ratio of IgG was 1.3 (interquartile range, 0.9-1.6). There was a negative correlation between infection-to-delivery interval and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations in maternal (r = -0.6693, P = 0.0087) and cord (r = -0.6554, P = 0.0068) serum and a positive correlation between IgG concentration in maternal serum and viral load AUC (r = 0.5109, P = 0.0310). A negative correlation was observed between transfer ratio and viral load AUC (r = -0.4757, P = 0.0409). CONCLUSIONS: In pregnant women who have recovered from COVID-19, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations at delivery increased with increasing viral load during infection and decreased with increasing infection-to-delivery interval. The median transplacental transfer ratio of IgG was 1.3 and it decreased with increasing viral load during infection. © 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.","Poon, L C; Leung, B W; Ma, T; Yu, F N Y; Kong, C W; Lo, T K; So, P L; Leung, W C; Shu, W; Cheung, K W; Moungmaithong, S; Wang, C C",Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol,118,16

Assigning blame to a virus takes attention away from the structural contradictions and instabilities of capitalism that would have led to a crash in any case. This narrative also helps justify non-evidence-based public health policies, including lockdowns, travel bans, closed schools and factories, and forced quarantines of large populations rather than individuals and clustered groups who harbor the infection. Advantages of such drastic measures happen primarily in countries that did not prepare adequately, that did not respond quickly enough with more focused measures to test and isolate people infected with the virus, and that have health care systems either organized by capitalist principles or suffering cutbacks and privatization as a result of capitalist economic ideologies, such as austerity. Authoritarian tactics purportedly intended to protect public health pave the way to antidemocratic rule, militarism, and fascism. These harsh policies also exert their most adverse effects on poor, minority, incarcerated, immigrant, and otherwise marginalized populations, who already suffer from the worsening economic inequality that global, financialized capitalism has fostered.","Waitzkin, Howard",Int J Health Serv,118,6

The country recently pledged to achieve ambitious emissions reduction targets, however, high-resolution datasets for provincial level CO2 emissions in China are still lacking. This study provides daily CO2 emission datasets for China's 31 provinces, including for the first time, the province of Tibet. The inventory covers the emissions from three industrial sectors (power, industry and ground transport) during 2019 to 2020, with its temporal resolution at a daily level. In addition, the variations in CO2 emissions for seasonal, weekly and holiday periods have been uncovered at a provincial level for the first time. This new data was added to further analyze the impact that weekends and holidays have on China's CO2 emissions. Over weekend periods, carbon emissions are shown to reduce by around 3%. Spring Festival meanwhile, has the greatest impact on the reduction of China's CO2 emissions.

These COVID-19 cardiac complications were associated with respiratory symptoms. However, our case illustrates that COVID-19 myopericarditis with cardiac tamponade can present without respiratory symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old Caucasian British woman was admitted with fever, diarrhoea and vomiting. She developed cardiogenic shock and Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) found a pericardial effusion with evidence of cardiac tamponade. A nasopharyngeal swab showed a COVID-19 positive result, despite no respiratory symptoms on presentation. A pericardial drain was inserted and vasopressor support required on intensive treatment unit (ITU). The drain was removed as she improved, an antibiotic course was given and she was discharged on day 12. CONCLUSIONS: Our case demonstrates that patients without respiratory symptoms could have COVID-19 and develop cardiac complications. These findings can aid timely diagnosis of potentially life-threatening COVID-19 myopericarditis with cardiac tamponade.","Cairns, Lauren; Abed El Khaleq, Yazeed; Storrar, Will; Scheuermann-Freestone, Michaela",J Med Case Rep,118,29

In this context, autopsies are important to confirm the disease, determine associated conditions, and study the pathophysiology of this novel disease. The aim of this study was to assess the systemic involvement of COVID-19. In order to follow biosafety recommendations, we used ultrasound-guided minimally invasive autopsy (MIA-US), and we present the results of 10 initial autopsies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used MIA-US for tissue sampling of the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, spleen, brain, skin, skeletal muscle and testis for histology, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA. All patients showed exudative/proliferative diffuse alveolar damage. There were intense pleomorphic cytopathic effects on the respiratory epithelium, including airway and alveolar cells. Fibrinous thrombi in alveolar arterioles were present in eight patients, and all patients showed a high density of alveolar megakaryocytes. Small thrombi were less frequently observed in the glomeruli, spleen, heart, dermis, testis, and liver sinusoids. The main systemic findings were associated with comorbidities, age, and sepsis, in addition to possible tissue damage due to the viral infection, such as myositis, dermatitis, myocarditis, and orchitis. CONCLUSIONS: MIA-US is safe and effective for the study of severe COVID-19. Our findings show that COVID-19 is a systemic disease causing major events in the lungs and with involvement of various organs and tissues. Pulmonary changes result from severe epithelial injury and microthrombotic vascular phenomena.

The objective of study is to describe the complementary medical and psychological care of patients with COVID-19 in the endocrinology department after a stay in intensive care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive observational study of patients transferred from the intensive care unit to the endocrinology service following a COVID-19 infection during the period from 17 April 2020 to May 26, 2020. Clinical characteristics of the patients and complications related to COVID-19 infection were studied; a nutritional assessment using the MNA nutritional status assessment questionnaire; psychological assessment using quality-of-life questionnaires (Hamilton depression and anxiety, HAD, SF36, PCLS); a treatment satisfaction questionnaire (TQCMII) and an assessment of patient autonomy by the ADL score. RESULT: Our study included 41 patients with an average age of 55 years (19-85 years), a sex ratio M/F of 1.05, 43.9% were diabetic, 34.1% hypertensive, 4.9% asthmatic and 5% obese, and 51.2% were severe and critical cases. The average ICU stay is 8.42 days, requiring intubation in 12.2% of cases. All patients were treated with the Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin, vitamin C, zinc and corticosteroid protocol, 14.6% had undernutrition and 65.9% had a risk of undernutrition. The average BMI was 25.34 kg/m2 (17-42), 61% had experienced weight loss, which was greater than 8 kg in 26.1% of cases, 12.2% of patients were not autonomous, 12.2% had moderate depression, 2.4% severe depression, 14.6% mild to moderate anxiety, 12.2% severe anxiety and 29.3% suffered acute post-traumatic stress disorder.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate urological patient satisfaction with teleconsultation during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, prospective, cross-sectional, non-interventional study carried out by telephone survey during the period considered as the peak of the pandemic (March-April 2020). A quality survey composed of 11 questions on urological care provided by physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted, selecting a representative sample of patients attended by teleconsultation. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were contacted by telephone to answer a survey on the quality of teleconsultation. The distribution of patients surveyed among the specialized consultations was homogeneous with the number of consultations cited in the period; 18% of them required assistance from family members. Sixty percent of patients avoided going to a medical center during the pandemic. Of the surveyed patients, 42% had cancelled diagnostic tests, 59% had cancelled medical consultations, 3.5% had cancelled treatments and 1% had cancelled interventions. Ten percent reported a worsening of urological symptoms during confinement. According to physicians, consultations were effectively delivered in 72% of cases, with teleconsultation being carried out by their usual urologist in 81%. Teleconsultation overall satisfaction level was 9 (IQI8-10), and 61.5% of respondents consider teleconsultation as a «health care option¼ after the healthcare crisis. CONCLUSION: Teleconsultation has been evaluated with a high level of satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering continuous care to urological patients during the healthcare crisis. The perceived quality offers a field of optional telematic assistance in selected patients, which should be re-evaluated in a period without confinement measures.","Leibar Tamayo, A; Linares Espinós, E; Ríos González, E; Trelles Guzmán, C; Álvarez-Maestro, M; de Castro Guerín, C; Fernández-Pascual, E; Girón de Francisco, M; Gómez de Vicente, J M; Gómez Rivas, J; Mainez Rodriguez, J A; Pérez-Carral, J R; Garcia-Matres, M J; Martinez-Piñeiro, L",Actas Urol Esp,118,16

The most important of these effects was exceeding the capacity of the healthcare infrastructures, and the related inability to meet the need for various medical equipment especially within the first months of the crisis following the emergence and rapid spreading of the virus. Urgent global demand for the previously unavailable personal protective equipment, sterile disposable medical supplies as well as the active molecules including vaccines and drugs fueled the need for the coordinated efforts of the scientific community. Amid all this confusion, the rapid prototyping technology, 3D printing, has demonstrated its competitive advantage by repositioning its capabilities to respond to the urgent need. Individual and corporate, amateur and professional all makers around the world with 3D printing capacity became united in effort to fill the gap in the supply chain until mass production is available especially for personal protective equipment and other medical supplies.

They were in short supply in the early days of COVID-19, resulting in significant risk to health care workers. Now they are highly politicized with battles about mask-wearing protocols breaking out in public. Although masks have obtained a new urgency and ubiquity in the context of COVID-19, people have thought about both the literal and metaphorical role of masks in medicine for generations. In this paper, we discuss three such metaphors-the masks of objectivity, of infallibility, and of benevolence-and their powerful role in medicine. These masks can be viewed as inflexible barriers to communication, contributing to the traditional authoritarian relationship between doctor and patient and concealing the authenticity and vulnerability of physicians. COVID masks, by contrast, offer a more nuanced and morally complex metaphor for thinking about protecting people from harm, authentic and trustworthy communication, and attention to potential inequities both in and beyond medical settings. We highlight the morally relevant challenges and opportunities that masks evoke and suggest that there is much to be gained from rethinking the mask metaphor in medicine.","Grubbs, Lindsey; Geller, Gail",J Med Humanit,118,16

Although some lives are considered sacred, others are deliberately sacrificed. This article draws on the theoretical work of Foucault and scholars who further developed his concept of biopolitics. While biopolitics aims to ameliorate the health of populations, Foucault never systematically accounted for the unequal value of lives. In the name of saving the biological lives of people who use drugs (PWUD) during the pandemic, the harm reduction movement has emphasized the need for safe supply, decriminalization, and housing; governments have started implementing these measures, which were previously rejected as utopian and unrealistic. Paradoxically, the use of drugs itself, and therefore the increased risk of death from overdose or other medical sequelae, is the only way PWUD can achieve enough visibility to be recognized as a life worth saving. The humanitarian rationale of harm reduction concerns itself with the biological life and stipulates social and political rights in the name of its sacredness. This is what anthropologist Fassin and others called biolegitimacy-the recognition of life reduced to its physiological, biological essence.","Larocque, Catherine; Foth, Thomas",Nurs Inq,118,22

Most countries with significant outbreaks have introduced social distancing or ""lockdown"" measures to reduce viral transmission. So the key question now is when, how and to what extent these measures can be lifted.Publicly available data on daily numbers of newly confirmed cases and mortality were used to fit regression models estimating trajectories, doubling times and the reproduction number (R0) of the disease, before and under the control measures. These data ran up to 21 May 2020, and were sufficient for analysis in 89 countries.The estimates of R0 before lockdown based on these data were broadly consistent with those previously published: between 2.0 and 3.7 in the countries with the largest number of cases available for analysis (USA, Italy, Spain, France and UK). There was little evidence to suggest that the restrictions had reduced R far below 1 in many places, with France having the most rapid reductions: R0 0.76 (95% CI 0.72-0.82) based on cases, and 0.77 (95% CI 0.73-0.80) based on mortality.Intermittent lockdown has been proposed as a means of controlling the outbreak while allowing periods of increased freedom and economic activity. These data suggest that few countries could have even 1â week per month unrestricted without seeing resurgence of the epidemic. Similarly, restoring 20% of the activity that has been prevented by the lockdowns looks difficult to reconcile with preventing the resurgence of the disease in most countries.","Lonergan, Mike; Chalmers, James D",Eur. respir. j,118,1

We aimed to characterise registered clinical trials assessing drugs or plasma treatments for COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analysis of clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 that were registered in the USA or in countries contributing to the WHO's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Relevant trial entries of drugs or plasma were downloaded on 26 March 2020, deduplicated, verified with reviews of major medical journals and WHO websites and independently analysed by two reviewers. MAIN OUTCOMES: Trial intervention, sponsorship, critical design elements and specified outcomes RESULTS: Overall, 201 clinical trials were registered for testing the therapeutic benefits of 92 drugs or plasma, including 64 in monotherapy and 28 different combinations. Only eight (8.7%) products or combinations involved new molecular entities. The other test therapies had a wide range of prior medical uses, including as antivirals, antimalarials, immunosuppressants and oncology treatments. In 152 trials (75.7%), patients were randomised to treatment or comparator, including 55 trials with some form of blinding and 97 open-label studies. The 49 (24.4%) of trials without a randomised design included 29 single armed studies and 20 trials with some comparison group. Most trial designs featured multiple endpoints. Clinical endpoints were identified in 134 (66.7%) of trials and included COVID-19 symptoms, death, recovery, required intensive care and hospital discharge. Clinical scales were being used in 33 (16.4%) trials, most often measures of oxygenation and critical illness. Surrogate endpoints or biomarkers were studied in 88 (42.3%) of trials, primarily assays of viral load. Although the trials were initiated in more than 17 countries or regions, 100 (49.8%) were registered in China and 78 (37.8%) in the USA. Registered trials increased rapidly, with the number of registered trials doubling from 1 March to 26 March 2020. CONCLUSIONS: While accelerating morbidity and mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic has been paralleled by early and rapid clinical investigation, many trials lack features to optimise their scientific value. Global coordination and increased funding of high-quality research may help to maximise scientific progress in rapidly discovering safe and effective treatments.","Mehta, Hemalkumar B; Ehrhardt, Stephan; Moore, Thomas J; Segal, Jodi B; Alexander, G Caleb",BMJ Open,118,16

In addition, the two assays were specific and showed no cross-reactivity with Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus, and other common human respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens. Also, both assays were highly reproducible across different operators and instruments.

METHODS: This study simulated the impact that remdesivir could have had on the Spanish National Health System (SNHS) capacity (bed occupancy) and the number of deaths that could have been prevented, based on two scenarios: a real-life scenario (without remdesivir) and an alternative scenario (with remdesivir). It considered the clinical results of the ACTT-1 trial in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pneumonia who required supplemental oxygen. The occupancy rates in general wards and ICUs were estimated in both scenarios. RESULTS: Remdesivir use could have prevented the admission of 2587 patients (43.75%) in the ICUs. It could have also increased the SNHS capacity in 5656 general wards beds and 1700 ICU beds, showing an increase in the number of beds available of 17.53% (95% CI 3.98%-24.42%) and 23.98% (95% CI 21.33%-28.22%), respectively, at the peak of the occupancy rates. Furthermore, remdesivir use could have prevented 7639 deaths due to COVID-19, which implies a 27.51% reduction (95% CI 14.25%-34.07%). CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir could have relieved the pressure on the SNHS and could have reduced the death toll, providing a better strategy for the management of COVID-19 during the first wave.","Soriano, Alejandro; Montejano, Rocío; Sanz-Moreno, José; Figueira, Juan Carlos; Grau, Santiago; Güerri-Fernández, Robert; Castro-Gómez, Antonio; Pérez-Román, Inés; Hidalgo-Vega, Álvaro; González-Domínguez, Almudena",Adv Ther,118,6

This puts them at higher risk of acquiring the infection than other individuals in the community. Defining immunity status among health care workers is therefore of interest since it helps to mitigate the exposure risk. This study was conducted between May 20th and 30th, 2020. Eighty-five hospitals across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were divided into 2 groups: COVID-19 referral hospitals are those to which RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were admitted or referred for management (Case-hospitals). COVID-19 nonaffected hospitals where no COVID-19 patients had been admitted or managed and no HCW outbreak (Control hospitals). Next, seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among HCWs was evaluated; there were 12,621 HCWs from the 85 hospitals. There were 61 case-hospitals with 9379 (74.3%) observations, and 24 control-hospitals with 3242 (25.7%) observations. The overall positivity rate by the immunoassay was 299 (2.36%) with a significant difference between the case-hospital (2.9%) and the control-group (0.8%) (P value <0.001). There was a wide variation in the positivity rate between regions and/or cities in Saudi Arabia, ranging from 0% to 6.31%. Of the serology positive samples, 100 samples were further tested using the SAS2pp neutralization assay; 92 (92%) samples showed neutralization activity. The seropositivity rate in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is low and varies across different regions with higher positivity in case-hospitals than control-hospitals. The lack of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in 8% of the tested samples could mean that assay is a more sensitive assay or that neutralization assay has a lower detection limits; or possibly that some samples had cross-reaction to spike protein of other coronaviruses in the assay, but these were not specific to neutralize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","Alserehi, Haleema Ali; Alqunaibet, Ada Mohammed; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Alshukairi, Abeer Nizar; Alanazi, Khalid Hamdan; Bin Saleh, Ghada Mohammed; Alshehri, Amer Mohammed; Almasoud, Abdulrahman; Hashem, Anwar M; Alruwaily, Amaal Rabie; Alaswad, Rehab Habeeb; Al-Mutlaq, Hind Mohammed; Almudaiheem, Abdulllah Ali; Othman, Fatmah Mahmoud; Aldakeel, Sumyah Abdullah; Abu Ghararah, Mouath Rashid; Jokhdar, Hani Abdulaziz; Algwizani, Abdullah Rshoud; Almudarra, Sami Saeed; Albarrag, Ahmed Mohammed",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,118,1

This Slovenian nationwide population study is the first longitudinal 6-month serosurvey using probability-based samples across all age categories. METHODS: Each participant supplied two blood samples: 1316 samples in April 2020 (first round) and 1211 in October/November 2020 (second round). The first-round sera were tested using Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (ELISA) and, because of uncertain estimates, were retested using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S). The second-round sera were concomitantly tested using Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S. RESULTS: The populations of both rounds matched the overall population (n = 3000), with minor settlement type and age differences. The first-round seroprevalence corrected for the ELISA manufacturer's specificity was 2.78% (95% highest density interval [HDI] 1.81%-3.80%), corrected using pooled ELISA specificity calculated from published data 0.93% (95% CI 0.00%-2.65%), and based on Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S results 0.87% (95% HDI 0.40%-1.38%). The second-round unadjusted lower limit of seroprevalence on 11 November 2020 was 4.06% (95% HDI 2.97%-5.16%) and on 3 October 2020, unadjusted upper limit was 4.29% (95% HDI 3.18%-5.47%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Slovenia increased four-fold from late April to October/November 2020, mainly due to a devastating second wave. Significant logistic/methodological challenges accompanied both rounds. The main lessons learned were a need for caution when relying on manufacturer-generated assay evaluation data, the importance of multiple manufacturer-independent assay performance assessments, the need for concomitant use of highly-specific serological assays targeting different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in serosurveys conducted in low-prevalence settings or during epidemic exponential growth and the usefulness of a Bayesian approach for overcoming complex methodological challenges.","Poljak, Mario; Ostrbenk Valencak, Anja; Strumbelj, Erik; Maver Vodicar, Polona; Vehovar, Vasja; Resman Rus, Katarina; Korva, Misa; Knap, Natasa; Seme, Katja; Petrovec, Miroslav; Zupan, Blaz; Demsar, Janez; Kurdija, Slavko; Avsic Zupanc, Tatjana",Clin Microbiol Infect,118,1

The specific incidence of thrombotic events in each of the clinical scenarios within the broad spectrum of severity of COVID-19, is not clearly established, and this has not allowed the implementation of thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulation for routine care in COVID-19. Patients admitted in a semi-critical unit treated initially with NIS, especially Continuous-Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), were included in the study. The cumulative incidence of pulmonary embolism was analyzed and compared between patients with good response to NIS and patients with clinical deterioration that required orotracheal intubation. 93 patients were included and 16% required mechanical ventilation (MV) after the NIS. The crude cumulative incidence of the PE was 14% (95%, CI 8-22) for all group. In patients that required orotracheal intubation and MV, the cumulative incidence was significantly higher [33% (95%, CI 16-58)] compared to patients that continued with non-invasive support [11% (CI 5-18)] (Log-Rank, p = 0.013). Patients that required mechanical ventilation were at higher risk of PE for a HR of 4.3 (95%CI 1.2-16).

We attempted a structure-based approach utilizing a combination of epitope prediction servers and Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to develop a multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine that involves the two subunits of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (S1 and S2) coupled with a substantially effective chimeric adjuvant to create stable vaccine constructs. The designed constructs were evaluated based on their docking with Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 4. Our findings provide an epitope-based peptide fragment that can be a potential candidate for the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

This study aimed to explore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by identifying patterns related to post-traumatic symptoms by considering personality and defensive styles. Specifically, it was hypothesized that neuroticism was negatively associated with impact of event, as opposed to extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness traits. The mediation role of mature, neurotic, and immature defenses in these relationships was also investigated. This study involved 557 Italian individuals (71.3% women, 28.7% men; Mage = 34.65, SD = 12.05), who completed an online survey including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Forty Item Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40) and Ten Item Personality Inventory. Results showed a nonsignificant effect for extraversion and openness on impact of event. The negative influence of neuroticism was instead confirmed in a partial parallel mediation involving significant effects from immature and neurotic defenses in the indirect path. Finally, agreeableness and conscientiousness delineated two protective pathways regarding impact of event, determining two total parallel mediation models in which both these personality traits were negatively associated with immature defensive styles, and conscientiousness was also positively related to mature defenses.

Digital Afterlife is fast becoming a challenge for our increasingly connected society. Moreover, the situation got worse with the COVID-19 pandemic. The on-going research is to address the disparity in the Global South, specifically in countries like Indonesia, India and The Philippines compared to the Global North for Digital Afterlife services such as policies and digital mourning services. By addressing the research question, 'What services and policy frameworks are available for Digital Afterlife in the Global South during COVID-19?', we aim to find the multitude of ways people in the Global South are managing their digital footprints. Our preliminary findings show that some considerable research and death related digital services and innovation have taken place during the pandemic. However, overwhelming majority of these works are western-centric and mainly dealing with post-mortem personal asset management. Cultural nuances, socio-economic perspectives, religion, political climate, regional infrastructures are mostly sidelined. We found significant disparity in Digital Afterlife product and service designs, which got worse during the global pandemic. Our goal is to collect further in-depth data within the three big ICT powerhouses of global south (Indonesia, India and The Philippines), identify the challenges as well as the innovations around Digital Afterlife.We envision proposing a set of recommendations, based on our findings, for developing a more inclusive and equitable digital space in this pandemic-stricken world.","Mostafa, Mashiat; Hussain, Faheem",,118,24

Here, we investigated the impact of agavins intake on gut microbiota modulation and their metabolites as well as their effect on metabolic endotoxemia and low-grade inflammation in mice fed high-fat diet. Mice were fed with a standard diet (ST) and high-fat diet (HF) alone or plus an agavins supplement (HF+A) for ten weeks. Gut microbiota composition, fecal metabolite profiles, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and systemic effects were analyzed. Agavins intake induced substantial changes in gut microbiota composition, enriching Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Prevotella, Allobaculum, and Akkermansia genus (LDA > 3.0). l-leucine, l-valine, uracil, thymine, and some fatty acids were identified as possible biomarkers for this prebiotic supplement. As novel findings, agavins supplementation significantly decreased LPS and pro-inflammatory (IL-1&#945;, IL-1ß, and TNF-&#945;; p < 0.05) cytokines levels in portal vein. In addition, lipid droplets content in the liver and adipocytes size also decreased with agavins consumption. In conclusion, agavins supplementation mitigate metabolic endotoxemia and low-grade inflammation in association with gut microbiota regulation and their metabolic products, thus inducing beneficial responses on metabolic disorders in high-fat diet-fed mice.","Huazano-García, Alicia; Silva-Adame, María Blanca; Vázquez-Martínez, Juan; Gastelum-Arellanez, Argel; Sánchez-Segura, Lino; López, Mercedes G",,118,21

Leveraging both historical sources and contemporary documentary sources, I demonstrate how the currents of exploitation, marginalisation, pathologisation and saviourism rooted in coloniality are manifested via these events. I also discuss responses to coloniality, focussing on the misuse and co-optation of pan-Africanist rhetoric. In particular, I argue that the scandal surrounding Covid-Organics is a reflection of endogenised coloniality, whereby local elites entrench and benefit from inequitable power structures at the intersubjective (rather than trans-national) scale.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Nationwide cohort. PATIENT(S): Reproductive endocrinology and infertility fellowship applicants and PDs participating in the 2020 application cycle. INTERVENTION(S): Anonymous survey sent to applicants and PDs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Descriptive study evaluating the experience and satisfaction of applicants and PDs with WBIs. RESULT(S): Forty-six percent of applicants and eligible PDs responded to our survey. Most applicants and PDs responded that WBIs were adequate for conveying a sense of a program's strengths, faculty, diversity, clinical training, and research opportunities, but less than half responded that WBIs were adequate in providing a sense of the program's clinical site and facilities. After WBIs, both applicants (73%) and PDs (86%) were able to rank with confidence. The cost of WBIs was significantly lower for both applicants (median: $100) and programs (median: $100) than the costs previously reported for in-person interviews. The applicants interviewed at more programs than they would have if the interviews were on-site, and Zoom was the highest rated platform used. Most applicants and PDs responded that WBIs were an adequate substitute, and that they should continue after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Furthermore, most of the PDs were planning to continue to use WBIs in some capacity. CONCLUSION(S): Both applicants and PDs had favorable experiences with and perceptions of WBIs, and most endorse the continued use of this interview modality.

However, the vaccine candidate requires protection from degradation and precise delivery to the target cells. This can be achieved by employing different types of drug and vaccine delivery strategies, among which, nanotechnology-based systems seem to be more promising.

N-acetylcysteine, being a nutraceutical precursor of an important antioxidant glutathione, can perform several biological functions in mammals and microbes. It has consequently garnered a growing interest as a potential adjunctive therapy for coronavirus disease. Here, we review evidence concerning the effects of N-acetylcysteine in respiratory viral infections based on currently available in vitro, in vivo, and human clinical investigations. The repurposing of a known drug such as N-acetylcysteine may significantly hasten the deployment of a novel approach for COVID19. Since the drug candidate has already been translated into the clinic for several decades, its established pharmacological properties and safety and side-effect profiles expedite pre clinical and clinical assessment for the treatment of COVID-19. In vitro data have depicted that N-acetylcysteine increases antioxidant capacity, interferes with virus replication, and suppresses expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cells infected with influenza viruses or respiratory syncytial virus. Furthermore, findings from in vivo studies have displayed that, by virtue of immune modulation and anti-inflammatory mechanism, N-acetylcysteine reduces the mortality rate in influenza-infected mice animal models. The promising in vitro and in vivo results have prompted the initiation of human subject research for the treatment of COVID-19, including severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Albeit some evidence of benefits has been observed in clinical outcomes of patients, precision nanoparticle design of N-acetylcysteine may allow for greater therapeutic efficacy.","Wong, K.

A Call for Local Actions for Global Impact,20.662296,2.6822913,2021,"This paper examines the socially optimal lockdown and travel (social activity) restriction policies for communicable virus including COVID-19. In our simple model, we exploit the remarkable similarity in the structure of external costs causing market failure between the socially optimal choices of the COVID-19 pandemic case and the socially optimal urban traffic congestion level. By identifying this similarity, the results obtained from our simple model allow for future pandemic researchers to use the well-established research methodologies for designing socially optimal traffic levels and associated policy tools to find the socially optimal lockdown and travel restrictions. The key results obtained from our COVID-19 model are: (1) individuals do not internalize the external cost of infection risks they impose on others and health care system when making their own travel (social-activity) decisions; In order to induce individual travel decision makers to internalize this external cost, the government actions are necessary; The travel restrictions via lockdown or monetary penalty is one form of such actions; (2) the existence of external cost implies that the socially optimal length of lockdown is always longer than the privately optimal length of the lockdown period; (3) the strictness of the travel restriction and the amount of violation penalty should be higher in the areas with high population density and in larger cities because the external cost of spreading virus by a traveler would be higher. The monetary penalty in this model resembles the classical Pigouvian tax, which should increase with the city's population, people density, and economic prosperity; (4) when a government subsidizes or fully covers medical expenses of COVID-19 patients, stricter travel restrictions with heavier penalties are required. This is to avoid crowding out of the health care system.","Oum, Tae Hoon; Wang, Kun",Transp. Policy,118,15

The desirable microfluidic structure was photo-patterned in a poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) film deposited on glass substrate to produce a low-relief master. Then, this template was used to generate a high-relief pattern in stiffened PDMS (S-PDMS) by increasing of curing agent /monomer ratio (1:5) followed by thermal aging in a laboratory oven (200°C for 24 h). The S-PDMS masters were used to replicate microfluidic devices in PMMA based on soft embossing at 220-230°C and thermal sealing at 140°C. Both embossing and sealing stages were performed by using binder clips. The proposed protocol has ensured the replication of microfluidic devices in PMMA with great fidelity (> 94%). Examples of ME devices, droplet generator devices and spot test array were successfully demonstrated. For testing ME devices, a mixture containing inorganic cations was selected as model and the achieved analytical performance did not reveal significant difference from commercial PMMA devices. Water droplets were successfully generated in an oil phase at rate of ca. 60 droplets/min (fixing the continuous phase flow rate at 100 µL/h) with size of ca. 322 ± 6 µm. Glucose colorimetric assay was performed on spot test devices and good detectability level was achieved. The obtained results for two artificial serum samples revealed good agreement with the certified concentrations. Based on the fabrication simplicity and great analytical performance, the proposed soft-embossing protocol may emerge as promising approach for manufacturing PMMA devices.

Several companies have switched their entire workforce to temporary telecommuting and remote work. Like other employee-characters, there is believed to be a change in employee engagement as well. This research seeks to examine and statistically assess factors that can impact the employee engagement level. We collected data from 208 employees who are working from home in India with online questionnaire. Engagement scores have been calculated using UWES-14 (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale). We examined the impact of total 10 variables using multiple regression analysis. Our regression results suggest that proper virtual tools, contact by the organization leaders, mental health checkup and virtual training increases the employee engagement. Female employees are found to be more engaged than male employees while working from home. The number of kids are found to have negative impact on employee engagement. This implies that if the number of kids increases, the virtual employee engagement decreases. Our results could not find any significant impact of virtual teamwork, marital status, and entertainment tools on employee engagement. Based on the research results, this study make few recommendations. First, organizations should facilitate the improvement of virtual tools such as internet speed and personal computer configuration. Second, the salary employees should not be decreased. Third, the top organization leaders should have frequent contact with the employees, increase virtual training, and should encourage the employees to undergo the regular mental health checkup.","Chaudhary, Vijesh Mohanty Smrutirekha Malik Poonam Apsara Saleth Mary A.; Pai Maroor, Jnaneshwar Nomani M.

The present research aimed to assess the level of misconceptions and the factors associated with it among the older FDMNs in Bangladesh. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: A selected Rohingya camp situated in Cox's Bazar, a southeastern district of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: Information was collected from 416 conveniently selected FDMNs who were aged 60 years and above. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was misconceptions related to the spread, prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Information on 14 different locally relevant misconceptions was gathered, each was scored as one, and obtained a cumulative score, ranging from 0 to 14, with a higher score indicating a higher level of misconceptions. A multiple linear regression model explored the factors associated with misconceptions. RESULTS: The participants had an average of five misconceptions. The most prevalent misconceptions were: everyone should wear personal protective equipment when outside (84.6%) and its prevention by nutritious food (62.5%) and drinking water (59.3%). Other notable misconceptions included the spread of COVID-19 through mosquito bites (42%) and its transmissions only to the non/less religious person (31.4%). In regression analyses, memory or concentration problems, communication frequency with social networks, pre-existing conditions and receiving information from health workers were significantly associated with higher COVID-19 misconceptions. These misconceptions were less likely among those overwhelmed by COVID-19, having COVID-19 diagnosed friends or family members and receiving information from friends and family. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that misconceptions were prevalent among the older FDMNs in Bangladesh. The associations have important implications for programmes to prevent and manage COVID-19 in these settings. Health workers need to be adequately trained to provide clear communication and counter misconceptions.","Mistry, Sabuj Kanti; Ali, A R M Mehrab; Yadav, Uday Narayan; Ghimire, Saruna; Hossain, Md Belal; Saha, Manika; Reza, Sompa; Bakshi, Progati; Bhuiyan, Abu Toha M R H; Harris, Mark",BMJ Open,118,6

The age-related prevalence of PD, combined with increased vulnerability due to age-related comorbidities, makes PD patients protection a priority. Methodology: We reviewed potentials and limitations of teleneurology in PD and suggested a specific battery of tests, including patient-reported outcomes, smartphone applications, and neurological examination through telemedicine. Conclusions: These tools can provide full neurological consultations, with the engagement of both patients and caregivers, and can support clinicians in defining whether patients need to access diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Telemedicine will also carry a value in the future, within conventional health care, to support clinicians in decision making, enabling more efficacious follow-up, reducing burden for caregivers, and delivering neurological expertise to local realities. These advantages are very important when there is physical distance between patients and neurologists, and when patients are not recommended to attend in-person consultations.","Miele, Giuseppina; Straccia, Giulia; Moccia, Marcello; Leocani, Letizia; Tedeschi, Gioacchino; Bonavita, Simona; Lavorgna, Luigi",Telemed. j. e. health,118,22

This study describes the direct and indirect impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on an urban major-hospital ED. METHODS: Data regarding all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting from February 1 to March 31, 2020, were prospectively collected, while data regarding non-COVID patients presenting within the same period in 2019 were retrospectively retrieved. RESULTS: ED attendance dropped by 37% in 2020. Two-thirds of this reduction occurred early after the identification of the first autochthonous COVID-19 case in Lombardy, before lockdown measures were enforced. Hospital admissions of non-COVID patients fell by 26%. During the peak of COVID-19 attendance, the ED faced an extraordinary increase in: patients needing oxygen (+239%) or noninvasive ventilation (+725%), transfers to the intensive care unit (+57%), and in-hospital mortality (+309%), compared with the same period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak determined an unprecedented upsurge in respiratory failure cases and mortality. Fear of contagion triggered a spontaneous, marked reduction of ED attendance, and, presumably, some as yet unknown quantity of missed or delayed diagnoses for conditions other than COVID-19.","Franchini, Stefano; Spessot, Marzia; Landoni, Giovanni; Piani, Cecilia; Cappelletti, Chiara; Mariani, Federica; Mauri, Simona; Taglietti, Maria Vittoria; Fortunato, Manuela; Furlan, Federico; Guglielmi, Barbara; Setti, Eleonora; Di Napoli, Davide; Borghi, Giovanni; Pascucci, Federico; Ujlaki-Formenti, George; Sannicandro, Riccardo; Moro, Matteo; Colombo, Sergio; Dagna, Lorenzo; Castagna, Antonella; Tresoldi, Moreno; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; Ambrosio, Alberto; Ciceri, Fabio; Zangrillo, Alberto; Carlucci, Michele; Faccincani, Roberto",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,118,10

In a quasi-experimental online study, 3624 German-speaking participants evaluated a list of rewarding activities between 9 April and 26 April 2020. A subsample of 2561 (71%) additionally engaged in an imagination task. Depression, anxiety, socioeconomic variables and COVID-19 related burdens were assessed as moderators. There was an increase in PA (total sample d = .13; subsample: d = .27) and a decrease in NA (total sample d = -0.68; subsample: d = -0.71; all p < .001). The effects rose with higher levels of depression and anxiety (all p < .001). Furthermore, living with family enhanced the effects on NA, while additionally having to take care of children reduced them.

We estimate the viral dynamics using viral copy number at first detection combined with considerations arising from aerosol transmission. We take into account the recent findings that infected vaccinated adults may have live viral loads at the same level as infected unvaccinated adults. Our estimates suggest that twice weekly testing, which was adequate for the original strains of SARS-CoV-2 will be insufficient on its own to contain the spread of the Delta variant of concern. We exclude consideration of contact tracing since the rapidity of the onset of viral titre in the case of the Delta variant suggests that unless contact tracing and quarantine are performed very rapidly (ie. much less than a day), these mitigations will be of minimal impact in reducing transmission. These crude estimates do not take into account heterogeneity of susceptibility, social activity, and compliance, nor do they include the additional reduction in transmission that could be achieved by masking and social distancing. In the setting of a large public university, these considerations suggest that risk-targeted testing of vaccinated students, staff and faculty combined with surveillance testing of all unvaccinated individuals is the most efficient way to reduce transmission of COVID-19.","Elbanna, Ahmed; Goldenfeld, Nigel",,118,13

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all end of year applied knowledge multiple choice question (MCQ) tests at one UK medical school were switched from on campus to remote assessments. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of student experience with remote exam delivery and compared test performance in remote versus invigilated campus-based forms of similar assessments for Year 4 and 5 students across two academic years. RESULTS: Very few students experienced technical or practical problems in completing their exam remotely. Test anxiety was reduced for some students but increased for others. The majority of students preferred the traditional setting of invigilated exams in a computer lab, feeling this ensured an even playing field for all candidates. Mean score was higher for Year 4 students in the remotely-delivered versus campus-based form of the same exam (76.53% [SD 6.57] vs. 72.81% [6.64]; t438.38 = 5.94, p = 0.001; d = 0.56), whereas candidate performance was equivalent across both forms for Year 5 students.

There is an opportunity for decision makers to learn from past policies that facilitated recovery from other disease outbreaks, crises, and natural disasters that have had a devastating effect on economies around the world. To support the development of the United Nations Research Roadmap for COVID-19 Recovery, this review examined and synthesized peer-reviewed studies and gray literature that focused on macroeconomic policy responses and multilateral coalition strategies from past pandemics and crises to provide a map of the existing evidence. We conducted a systematic search of academic and gray literature databases. After screening, we found 22 records that were eligible for this review. The evidence found demonstrates that macroeconomic and multilateral coalition strategies have various impacts on a diverse set of countries and populations. Although the studies were heterogeneous in nature, most did find positive results for macroeconomic intervention policies that addressed investments to strengthen health and social protection systems, specifically cash and unconventional/nonstandard monetary measures, in-kind transfers, social security financing, and measures geared toward certain population groups.","Embrett, Mark; Bielska, Iwona A; Manis, Derek R; Cooper, Rhiannon; Agarwal, Gina; Nartowski, Robert; Moore, Emily; Lopatina, Elena; Conway, Aislinn; Clark, Kathryn",Int J Health Serv,118,10

On the international level, a multi-centered study is being worked on to validate the Post-COVID-19 functional Status scale (PCFS) for different nations, thus allowing to visualize the needs for a multi-disciplinary approach and planning intervention plans. The objective of this study was to perform a linguistic validation and cross-cultural adaptation of the PCFS for people infected with COVID-19 for the Chilean population. METHODS: It corresponds to a cross-sectional study of the scale validation. The study was performed in two phases: 1. Forward-translation, reverse-translation. 2. Apparent cross-validity adaptation. For the apparent validity analysis, 29 people who had been hospitalized in HDS with a COVID-19 infection diagnosis and at the time of the interview were in their homes. RESULTS: In phase 1 forward-translation, an item required semantical changes. The reverse-translation versions were similar, and the most relevant doubts were resolved in a consensus meeting. In phase 2, the pilot study confirmed adequate understanding and scale applicability. CONCLUSIONS: Using a systematic and rigorous methodology allows us to obtain a Spanish PCFS scale version for Chile, which is conceptually and linguistically equivalent to the original instrument and adequate to assess the functional status of the people infected with COVID-19.","Lorca, Alejandra; Torres, Rodrigo; Ribeiro, Ivana L; Benavente, Paulina; Pizarro, Marta; San Cristobal, Belgica; Ugarte, Javiera; Laura, Cristobal; Huanchicay, Camila; Mamani, Alexandra",Am. j. phys. med. rehabilit,118,33

SARS-COV-2) as well as charged aerosols through the concept of electrostatic charge negotiation. (Fusion for the opposite types of charges and repulsion for the similar types of charges). Reviewing the works of different authors, regarding charges, surface charge densities ({\sigma}), charge mobility ({\mu}) and electrostatic potentials of different aerosols under varied experimental conditions, a similar intensive study has also been carried out to investigate the electron donating and accepting (hole donating) properties of the spike proteins (S-proteins) of different RNA and DNA viruses, including SARS-COV-2. Based upon the above transport properties of electrons of different particles having different dimensions, a mathematical model has been established to find out the penetration potential of those particles under different electrostatic fields. An intensive study have been carried out to find out the generation of electrostatic charges due to the surface emission of electrons (SEE), when a conducting material like silk, nylon or wool makes a friction with the Gr IV elements like Germanium or Silicon, it creates an opposite layer of charges in the outer conducting surface and the inner semiconducting surface separated by a dielectric materials. This opposite charge barriers may be considered as Inversion layers (IL). The electrostatic charges accumulated in the layers between the Gr IV Ge is sufficient enough to either fuse or repel the charges of the spike proteins of the RNA, DNA viruses including SARS-Cov-2 (RNA virus) or the aerosols.","Rakshit, Kausik; Chatterjee, Sudip; Bandyopadhyay, Durjoy; Sarkar, Somsekhar",,118,24

The pioneering work on the ""Fetal Programming Hypothesis"" focused on pregnant women exposed to a great famine that occurred in the Netherlands at the end of World War II. The intrauterine environment of the babies during that famine caused them to low birthweight and determined the appearance of cardiovascular diseases in themselves when they reached adulthood, a risk that was transmitted even to the following generation. In addition to the general stress that a pregnant woman may suffer as a result of the death of a family member, suffering a war or natural disaster such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, there is another specific type of stress that refers exclusively to the pregnancy process;this is the pregnancy specific-stress. Pregnancy-specific stress is capable of sensitively predicting negative maternal and neonatal outcomes. This type of stress refers to the specific stress of pregnant women related to medical problems, the health of the newborn, the changes that the pregnancy will produce in their social relationships, prematurity, physical changes of pregnancy and fear of labor and birth. The objective of this article was to offer an updated information on pregnancy-specific stress and its consequences for maternal and neonatal health. Thus, we also proposed to offer strategies that midwives and psychologists can use to reduce pregnancy-specific stress levels.

Respiratory examination revealed minimal basal cracklesbilaterally. Her heart sounds were normal, and there was no carotid orsubclavian bruit. Radial, ulnar, brachial, subclavian and temporalpulses were intact and symmetrical. The abdomen was soft, but tenderover the right upper quadrant and epigastrium. Nailfolds were normal, and there was no livedo reticularis and no vasculitic rash.

ANA screen, AntiENA screen, ANCA screen, Crithidia Lucillae (dsDNA), RF, Anti-CCPAntibodies, Complement C3 and C4 were all negative. No steroidtreatment was commenced. The patient then self-discharged againstmedical advice and was reviewed as an out-patient. CT scan wasreviewed by a vascular radiologist who confirmed the suspicion ofaortitis. Subsequently, a 5-Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron EmissionTomography (FDG PET) CT scan showed no evidence of active, ongoing large vessel vasculitis. A short, linear focus of mild increasedFDG uptake associated with some calcification within the left lateralabdominal aortic wall was more typical of atheromatous disease thanvasculitis. LMWH was switched to long-term warfarin. She has nowfully recovered from COVID and has remained well. Repeat Antiphospholipid screen taken more than 12 weeks later showed apositive IgM ACL (40.2 U/mL), and negative IgG ACL and B2GP1.Once again LAC was not tested as the patient has continued warfarin.IgM ACL positivity following COVID-19 infection has been reported byseveral other centres.ConclusionOur understanding of the significance of positive antiphospholipidantibodies and COVID-19 infection is evolving.

Mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) might be used for risk assessment. This study investigates MR-proADM for RRT prediction in ICU patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We analysed data of consecutive patients with COVID-19, requiring ICU admission at a university hospital in Germany between March and September 2020. Clinical characteristics, details on AKI, and RRT were assessed. MR-proADM was measured on admission. RESULTS: 64 patients were included (49 (77%) males). Median age was 62.5y (54-73). 47 (73%) patients were ventilated and 50 (78%) needed vasopressors. 25 (39%) patients had severe ARDS, and 10 patients needed veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 29 (45%) patients required RRT; median time from admission to RRT start was 2 (1-9) days. MR-proADM on admission was higher in the RRT group (2.491 vs. 1.23 nmol/l; p = 0.002) and showed the highest correlation with renalSOFA. ROC curve analysis showed that MR-proADM predicts RRT with an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.543-0.828; p = 0.019). In multivariable logistic regression MR-proADM was an independent predictor (OR: 3.813, 95% CI 1.110-13.102, p<0.05) for RRT requirement. CONCLUSION: AKI requiring RRT is frequent in ICU patients with COVID-19. MR-proADM on admission was able to predict RRT requirement, which may be of interest for risk stratification and management.","Roedl, Kevin; Jarczak, Dominik; Fischer, Marlene; Haddad, Munif; Boenisch, Olaf; de Heer, Geraldine; Burdelski, Christoph; Frings, Daniel; Sensen, Barbara; Karakas, Mahir; Kluge, Stefan; Nierhaus, Axel",Biomarkers,118,1

We aimed to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence system using chest x-rays and clinical data to predict disease severity and progression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We did a retrospective study in multiple hospitals in the University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia, PA, USA, and Brown University affiliated hospitals in Providence, RI, USA. Patients who presented to a hospital in the University of Pennsylvania Health System via the emergency department, with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and with an available chest x-ray from their initial presentation or admission, were retrospectively identified and randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets (7:1:2). Using the chest x-rays as input to an EfficientNet deep neural network and clinical data, models were trained to predict the binary outcome of disease severity (ie, critical or non-critical). The deep-learning features extracted from the model and clinical data were used to build time-to-event models to predict the risk of disease progression. The models were externally tested on patients who presented to an independent multicentre institution, Brown University affiliated hospitals, and compared with severity scores provided by radiologists. FINDINGS: 1834 patients who presented via the University of Pennsylvania Health System between March 9 and July 20, 2020, were identified and assigned to the model training (n=1285), validation (n=183), or testing (n=366) sets. 475 patients who presented via the Brown University affiliated hospitals between March 1 and July 18, 2020, were identified for external testing of the models. When chest x-rays were added to clinical data for severity prediction, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) increased from 0·821 (95% CI 0·796-0·828) to 0·846 (0·815-0·852; p<0·0001) on internal testing and 0·731 (0·712-0·738) to 0·792 (0·780-0 ·803; p<0·0001) on external testing. When deep-learning features were added to clinical data for progression prediction, the concordance index (C-index) increased from 0·769 (0·755-0·786) to 0·805 (0·800-0·820; p<0·0001) on internal testing and 0·707 (0·695-0·729) to 0·752 (0·739-0·764; p<0·0001) on external testing. The image and clinical data combined model had significantly better prognostic performance than combined severity scores and clinical data on internal testing (C-index 0·805 vs 0·781; p=0·0002) and external testing (C-index 0·752 vs 0·715; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19, artificial intelligence based on chest x-rays had better prognostic performance than clinical data or radiologist-derived severity scores. Using artificial intelligence, chest x-rays can augment clinical data in predicting the risk of progression to critical illness in patients with COVID-19.

Clinical observations have also highlighted that these patients have elevated von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIIIc. METHODS: 24 consecutive COVID-19 positive patients were selected from the intensive care unit (ICU) or the high acuity ward of Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust. RESULTS: The rate of VTE was 25% and mortality rate was 16.7%. Fibrinogen and D-Dimers were elevated, 7.9 (1.6) g/L and 2.4 (2.02) ug/ml respectively. Factor VIIIc and von vWF antigen levels were both extremely elevated at 279 (148) u/dL and 350 (131) % respectively, which are comparable to levels seen in ICU patients with severe sepsis. vWF levels were significantly higher in patients that died (p=0.017) and showed a positive correlation with age. There was a statistically significant association between COVID-19 disease and non-O blood group (p=0.02); 80% (4/5) of COVID-19 patients with VTE were blood group A. CONCLUSION: Very high levels of vWF and factor VIIIc are common in COVID-19 patients, comparable to levels in severely septic non-COVID ICU patients. This could contribute to the hypercoagulable state and increased VTE rate in COVID-19. Further studies are needed to evaluate the use of vWF for stratifying thrombotic risk in COVID-19 and to determine if elevated vWF is contributing to disease pathogenesis.","Ladikou, Eleni E; Sivaloganathan, Helena; Milne, Kate M; Arter, William E; Ramasamy, Roshan; Saad, Ramy; Stoneham, Simon M; Philips, Barbara; Eziefula, Alice C; Chevassut, Timothy",Clin Med (Lond),118,13

This article presents as a contribution a computational architecture for the development of applications for pervasive environments using IoT and based on simulation. This research was carried out based on design science research through our proposed architecture. Experimental results showed interesting scenarios that could be differentiated for government agencies, considering IoT sensors, during a pandemic such as Covid-19.

That united front was not to be seen during the 2016 debate over supplemental funding for Zika. The primary focus of this study is whether the perception of partisanship in the public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) area affects attitudes about policy options regarding PHEP. To investigate these issues, a Qualtrics online survey of members of hospital preparedness coalitions was conducted. The survey questions covered issues such as the level of governmental priority placed on fighting infectious disease, respondents' level of confidence that the essential functions of government are being managed, the role of partisanship in PHEP decision making, and support for proposals to reform the government's infectious disease response. A statistically significant association was found between respondents' reporting that partisanship in PHEP presents a risk of injury or death and support for all the proposed reforms, indicating a desire to decentralize PHEP activities and a need to reinvigorate PHEP bipartisanship. © 2021 Policy Studies Organization","Myers, N.","Risk, Hazards and Crisis in Public Policy",118,10

We collected data on gendered parenting attitudes both before and during the pandemic and report shifts in attitudes in this data visualization. Consistent with fears of exacerbated gender inequality, we find a shift toward more conventional gender parenting attitudes. We also find an increase in the importance placed on mothers’ and fathers’ earning money and a decrease in the role mothers and fathers play in child development, both of which may be due to the pandemic’s effects on the economy and schooling. © The Author(s) 2021.","Mize, T.

Due to such convenient and anarchic nature, they have also been used rampantly to promote and conduct business activities between unregistered market participants without paying taxes. Tax authorities worldwide face difficulties in regulating these hidden economy activities by traditional regulatory means. This paper presents a machine learning based Regtech tool for international tax authorities to detect transaction-based tax evasion activities on social media platforms. To build such a tool, we collected a dataset of 58,660 Instagram posts and manually labelled 2,081 sampled posts with multiple properties related to transaction-based tax evasion activities. Based on the dataset, we developed a multi-modal deep neural network to automatically detect suspicious posts. The proposed model combines comments, hashtags and image modalities to produce the final output. As shown by our experiments, the combined model achieved an AUC of 0.808 and F1 score of 0.762, outperforming any single modality models.

These changes might give rise to stress-induced factors and result in developing maladaptive behaviors. Therefore, the present study tested an explorative sequential mediation model regarding the COVID-19 pandemic as a global natural experiment and hypothesized that fear and depression would be serial mediators of the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and emotional eating. An online cross-sectional survey with convenience sampling was adopted. A total of 362 participants were recruited from Turkey, and each completed a battery of demographic questions and psychometric scales. The standardized instruments used to test the model's constructs were the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R21. The model was tested using a bootstrapping method utilizing IBM AMOS 24 software. Results showed that emotional eating was positively associated with intolerance of uncertainty, fear of COVID-19, and depression. Moreover, fear of COVID-19 had positive correlation with intolerance of uncertainty and depression. Significant negative association was also found between age and intolerance of uncertainty. In addition, females significantly reported higher levels of emotional eating and fear of COVID-19 than males. The study's hypothesized sequential mediation model was further supported. It is concluded that depression most likely developed by fear was triggered by intolerance of uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic and leading to emotional eating. The study is significant because it advances theories of emotional eating with an investigation examining some of its underlying mechanisms. Also, it is one of a few research studies highlighting to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic-related cognitions and emotions are associated with maladaptive behaviors in the case of emotional eating.","Pak, Halil; Süsen, Yanki; Denizci Nazligül, Merve; Griffiths, Mark",Int J Ment Health Addict,118,0

Drawing upon scarcity theory, the purpose of this study was to examine whether the economic stressors of perceived job insecurity and perceived financial insecurity are related to employee self-reports of enacting such behaviors. Moreover, we tested propositions regarding the impact of two state-level contextual variables that may moderate those relationships: the generosity of unemployment insurance benefits and extensiveness of statewide COVID-19-related restrictions. Using a multilevel data set of N = 745 currently employed U.S. workers nested within 43 states, we found that both job insecurity and financial insecurity were negatively related to the enactment of the CDC-recommended guidelines. However, the state-level variables acted as cross-level moderators, such that the negative relationship between job insecurity and compliance with the CDC guidelines was attenuated within states that have a more robust unemployment system. However, working in a state with more extensive COVID-19 restrictions seemed to primarily benefit more financially secure workers. When statewide policies were more restrictive, employees reporting more financial security were more likely to enact the CDC-recommended guidelines compared to their financially insecure counterparts. We discuss these findings in light of the continuing need to develop policies to address the public health crisis while also protecting employees facing economic stressors.

The historical context that promoted this pernicious threat is understudied, and such studies lay the critical foundation for designing societal-level campaigns to combat it. We analyzed the trend and content of aging narratives over 210 years across multiple genres-newspaper, magazines, fiction, non-fiction books; and modelled the predictors of the observed trend. METHODS: A 600-million-word-dataset was created from the Corpus-of-Historical-American-English and the Corpus-of-Contemporary-American-English to form the largest structured historical corpus with over 150,000 texts from multiple genres. Computational linguistics and statistical techniques were applied to study the trend, content, and predictors of aging narratives. RESULTS: Aging narratives have become more negative, in a linear fashion (p=.003), over 210 years. There are distinct shifts: From uplifting narratives of heroism and kinship in the 1800s to darker tones of illness, death, and burden in the 1900s across newspapers, magazines, and non-fiction books. Fiction defied this trend by portraying older adults positively through romantic courtship and war heroism. Significant predictors of ageism over 210 years are the medicalization of aging, loss of status, warmth, competence, and social ostracism. DISCUSSION: Though it is unrealistic to reverse the course of ageism, its declining trajectory can be ameliorated. Our unprecedented study lay the groundwork for a societal level campaign to tackle ageism. The need to act is more pressing given the Covid-19 pandemic where older adults are constantly portrayed as vulnerable.","Ng, Reuben; Chow, Ting Yu Joanne",,118,6

Such critical course of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is thought to associate with cytokine storm as in macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), although these specific data are still lacking. In this study we aimed to directly address the question, whether immune activation in COVID-19 does indeed mimic conditions as in these classical cytokine storm syndromes. METHODS: We quantified levels of 22 biomarkers in serum samples of COVID-19 (n=30, n=83 longitudinal samples in total), sHLH/MAS patients (n=50) as well as healthy controls (n=9) using bead array assay as well as single-marker ELISA and correlated results with disease outcome. RESULTS: In sHLH/MAS we observed dramatic activation of the interleukin(IL)-18-interferon (IFN)-Î³ axis, while increased serum levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and IL-8, as well as strongly reduced levels of soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) in course of SARS-CoV-2 infection discriminate immune dysregulation in critical COVID-19 from the investigated well-recognized cytokine storm conditions.

While Canada’s explicit use of the words “feminist” and “feminism” may be refreshing, critical questions on the FIAP’s interpretation and application of these concepts remain. These challenges are not unique to the FIAP. Rather, the central weaknesses of the FIAP can be seen as symptomatic of several endemic challenges that persist in the current policies and practices that seek to promote gender equality in the developing world and beyond. This article presents the theoretical and conceptual lineage that has informed the FIAP, drawing from challenges present within literature on security, gender equality, and gender mainstreaming. Three main shortcomings relevant to both the literature and the FIAP are explored: first, the assumptions and essentialization of “gender” to mean “women”; second, the frequent conflation of “gender equality” with “women’s empowerment”; and last, the paradox of gender, gender equality, and feminism being simultaneously over-politicized and depoliticized to suit prevailing policy environments, with particular implications for the global coronavirus pandemic, as well as impacts in fragile and conflict-affected states. This analysis sheds light on persistent challenges in feminist foreign policymaking and offers insights for the development of Canada’s White Paper on feminist foreign policy.","Cadesky, Jessica",Int.

Indeed, more developed and wealthier areas became more isolated after government interventions and experienced a significantly lower burden of the pandemic.

China's nationwide traffic control during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak provided us a unique opportunity to assess the direct dose-effect relationship between vehicle density and air pollution. We found that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the nationwide reduced air pollution (except for O3) could be largely explained by traffic control measures. During the traffic control period, every doubling of vehicle density was associated with a decrease of 4.2 (2.0, 6.4) µg/m3 in PM2.5, 5.5 (2.9, 8.1) µg/m3 in PM10, 1.5 (0.9, 2.0) µg/m3 in NO2, and 0.04 (0.02, 0.07) mg/m3 in CO comparing cities with different vehicle densities. Similarly, for every 10% increase in the truck proportion, PM2.5 decreased by 12.3 (4.1, 20.6) µg/m3, PM10 decreased by 14.3 (4.6, 23.9) µg/m3, and CO decreased by 0.14 (0.05, 0.23) mg/m3. Moreover, the associations between vehicle density and reduction in PM2.5, PM10, and CO during the traffic control period were stronger and showed near-complete linearity in cities with low green coverage rate (All P < 0.05 for interaction).

The existing global disease burden related to opioid use is significant. Particularly challenging groups include older drug users who are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19. Increasing access to safe and effective opioid agonist treatment (OAT) and other harm reduction services during this pandemic is critical to reduce risk. In response to COVID-19, healthcare is increasingly being delivered by telephone and video consultation, and this report describes the development of a national model of remote care to eliminate waiting lists and increase access to OAT in Ireland. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS: The purpose of this initiative is to provide easy access to OAT by developing a model of remote assessment and ongoing care and eliminate existing national waiting lists. The Irish College of General Practitioners in conjunction with the National Health Service Executive office for Social Inclusion agreed a set of protocols to enable a system of remote consultation but still delivering OAT locally to people who use drugs. This model was targeted at OAT services with existing waiting lists due to a shortage of specialist medical staff. The model involves an initial telephone assessment with COVID-risk triage, a single-patient visit to local services to provide a point of care drug screen and complete necessary documentation and remote video assessment and ongoing management by a GP addiction specialist. A secure national electronic health link system allows for the safe and timely delivery of scripts to a designated local community pharmacy. CONCLUSION: The development of a remote model of healthcare delivery allows for the reduction in transmission risks associated with COVID-19, increases access to OAT, reduces waiting times and minimises barriers to services. An evaluation of this model is ongoing and will be reported once completed. Fast adaptation of OAT delivery is critical to ensure access to and continuity of service delivery and minimise risk to our staff, patients and community. Innovative models of remote healthcare delivery adapted during the COVID-19 crisis may inform and have important benefits to our health system into the future.","Crowley, Des; Delargy, Ide",Harm Reduct J,118,1

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional multi-methods study: a qualitative scoping exercise and a telephone survey. The target population was COVID-19-trained HCWs from all provinces of Papua New Guinea. A descriptive analysis of survey responses was conducted alongside a rapid qualitative analysis of interviews and open-ended survey questions. RESULTS: Four thematic areas were identified: human resources, logistics, HCW attitudes and community attitudes. The survey response rate was 70.3% (407/579). Commonly reported barriers to COVID-19 swabbing were insufficient staff trained (74.0%, n = 301), inadequate staffing in general (64.9%, n = 264), insufficient supply of personal protective equipment (60.9%, n = 248) and no cold chain to store swabs (57.5%, n = 234). Commonly reported enablers to swabbing were community awareness and risk communication (80.8%, n = 329), consistent and sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (67.8%, n = 276), increased surge workforce (63.9%, n = 260) and having a fridge to store swabs (59.7%, n = 243). CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive community and HCW engagement strategy combined with innovations to improve the supply chain are needed to increase COVID-19 swabbing in Papua New Guinea to reach national testing targets. Investments in increasing numbers of frontline workforce, consistent supplies of PPE, swabs, transport medium, cold boxes and ability to make ice packs, in addtion to establishing regular tranport of specimens from the facility to the testing site will strengthen the supply chain. Innovations are needed to address these issues.","Smaghi, Bernnedine S; Collins, Julie; Dagina, Rosheila; Hiawalyer, Gilbert; Vaccher, Stefanie; Flint, James; Housen, Tambri",Int. j. infect. dis,118,20

Insights From an Italian Community Sample,20.9073,2.517391,2021,"BACKGROUND: The rapidly evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 24 million infections and 821 thousand deaths. However, a vaccine or specific drug is absent up to this date and more attention has been focused on the use of convalescent plasma (CP). Several articles have described the CP treatment for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. But a comprehensive systematic review with meta-analysis about the safety and efficacy of CP transfusion in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients has not been published. We conducted this study for a better understanding of the therapeutic significance of CP for patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A fixed-effect model (I2=0.0%) was used on the 9 articles for quantitative analysis showing that the mortality of patients with COVID-19 treated with or without CP was statistically significant (RR=0.57 [0.44-0.74]). Subgroup analysis showed that the severely ill patients benefited more from CP than the critically ill patients. Our study concluded that clinical improvement in severe COVID-19 cases were obvious. Adverse events were few and the effect of convalescent plasma on reducing viral load was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: Convalescent plasma therapy appears safe for COVID-19, and plasma treated patients have marked reductions in their serum viral loads and most are virus negative after transfusion. Patients with severe COVID-19 benefit more from the convalescent plasma transfusion than critical patients, and patients treated in early stage are more likely to survive. METHODS: We reviewed the scientific literature from four databases published from December 8, 2019 to August 20, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 15.1; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using fixed effect model in analyzing the overall mortality and p <0.05 was considered statistically significant.","Wenjing, Luo; Yuanzheng, Feng; Li, Jun-Ying; Tang, Liang V; Yu, Hu",Aging (Albany NY),118,29

Yet, the positive effects that companion animals have in people's lives create the need for supportive systems to ensure that financial limitations, and other barriers, do not preclude pet ownership. To help address these barriers, and reach underserved communities, various forms of community-based veterinary medicine programs have been developed across the country. This study assesses two community-based veterinary programs in North Carolina, USA. In addition to perceptions surrounding veterinary services, this study paid specific attention to communication and respect;two additional elements needed for successful community-based veterinary programs. Surveys were given to clients accessing Asheville Humane Society (AHS) mobile veterinary care clinic and Asheville Humane Society (AHS) Affordable Pet Care Clinic. Results of the anonymous survey indicate that the majority of clients had positive veterinary care experiences in terms of both veterinary services and client communication. In conclusion, low-cost or free community veterinary programs-with effective communication, empathy, and cultural competence-can help open the door to future positive veterinary experiences for disadvantaged pet owners.","Kogan, L.

In this study, an immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual radiography simulation tool was piloted in an undergraduate Radiography curriculum and user feedback retrieved. METHODS: The 3D virtual simulation tool by Virtual Medical Coaching Ltd was introduced to first year radiography students (n = 105). This technology guided students through a comprehensive process of learning anatomy, radiographic positioning and pathology. Students then X-rayed a virtual patient in the VR suite using HTC Vive Pro&#8482; headsets and hand controllers. Instant feedback was provided. An online survey was later disseminated to students to gather user feedback. Thematic and descriptive statistical analyses were applied. RESULTS: A response rate of 79% (n = 83) was achieved. Most respondents (58%) reported enjoying VR simulation, whilst some felt indifferent towards it (27%). Ninety-four percent would recommend this tool to other students. The mean length of time it took for students to feel comfortable using the technology was 60 min (10-240 min). Most respondents (58%) desired more VR access. Students attributed enhanced confidence in the areas of beam collimation (75%), anatomical marker placement (63%), centring of the X-ray tube (64%) and exposure parameter selection (56%) to their VR practice. Many students (55%) advocated the use of VR in formative or low stakes assessments. Issues flagged included technical glitches, inability to palpate patient and lack of constructive feedback. CONCLUSION: Student feedback indicates that 3D virtual radiography simulation is a valuable pedagogical tool in radiography education IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: 3D immersive VR simulation is perceived by radiography students to be a valuable learning resource. VR needs to be strategically implemented into curricula to maximise its benefits.","O039,; Connor, M; Stowe, J; Potocnik, J; Giannotti, N; Murphy, S; Rainford, L",,118,2

Parents of young children are particularly at risk for high levels of parental stress due to the current public health crisis, which can impact parenting behaviors and children's well-being. Although different initial scales have been developed to measure COVID-19 related anxiety, they have not yet been tested sufficiently in parent samples. A brief measure of COVID-19-related anxiety is necessary for both quick assessment in practice and in larger epidemiological studies of parents. OBJECTIVE: To compare the distributions, validities and reliabilities of four different COVID-19 anxiety scales: Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV19-S), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), Pandemic Anxiety Scale (PAS) and one subscale of the COVID-19 Stress Scale (CSS). Based on the psychometric properties, the purpose of this study is to provide recommendations for a brief unidimensional inventory to assess Covid-19 related anxiety among parents. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey on 515 German-speaking parents (90.3% mothers) with a child aged 0 to 6 years was conducted during a six-week period (June 29 to August 9, 2020). Half of the parents were recruited via Facebook parenting groups while the other half were recruited through childcare centers. Twenty-five items on Covid-19 related anxiety were psychometrically tested with the framework of Classical Test Theory (CTT), including item analysis, correlational analysis with family variables and explorative factor analysis (EFA). Moreover, an Item Response Theory (IRT) approach was applied to estimate item discriminations, item difficulties and test information functions. RESULTS: Based on the psychometric properties, three items of the Pandemic Anxiety Scale (PAS) were identified as a single unidimensional factor. The adapted scale demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (&#945; = .79), moderate to high item discrimination, strong positive inter-correlation with two other COVID-19 anxiety scales, and a small positive association with parenting stress. Mothers and fathers did not differ in total scores, t(513)= -.79, p = .42. CONCLUSIONS: Factor analysis suggests that existing COVID-19 related anxiety scales are measuring different latent constructs of anxiety. Furthermore, all scales showed only small to moderate correlations with trait health anxiety, suggesting COVID-19 related anxiety is distinct from general health anxiety. The adapted subscale ""disease anxiety"" of den Pandemic Anxiety Scale is an economical measure for assessing COVID-19 anxiety in parents. Directions for future research are outlined.","Kubb, Christian; Foran, Heather M",,118,1

Based on our hypothesis that alpha-ketoamide drugs can covalently bind to the active site cysteine of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, we performed docking studies, enzyme inhibition and co-crystal structure analyses and finally established that boceprevir, but not telaprevir, inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), another coronavirus, in cell culture.

METHODS: Factor analysis grouped 11 indicators into 7 distinct susceptibility factors for 3,079 counties in the conterminous United States. Unconditional mean differences are assessed using a multivariate general linear model. Data from 2018 are primarily taken from the US Census Bureau and CDC. RESULTS: About 33% of rural counties are highly susceptible to COVID-19, driven by older and health-compromised populations, and care facilities for the elderly. Major vulnerabilities in rural counties include fewer physicians, lack of mental health services, higher disability, and more uninsured. Poor Internet access limits telemedicine. Lack of social capital and social services may hinder local pandemic recovery. Meat processing facilities drive risk in micropolitan counties. Although metropolitan counties are less susceptible due to healthier and younger populations, about 6% are at risk due to community spread from dense populations. Metropolitan vulnerabilities include minorities at higher health and diabetes risk, language barriers, being a transportation hub that helps spread infection, and acute housing distress. CONCLUSIONS: There is an immediate need to know specific types of susceptibilities and vulnerabilities ahead of time to allow local and state health officials to plan and allocate resources accordingly. In rural areas it is essential to shelter-in-place vulnerable populations, whereas in large metropolitan areas general closure orders are needed to stop community spread. Pandemic response plans should address vulnerabilities.","Peters, David J",J Rural Health,118,10

Although in the long-term mass vaccinations remains the most promising approach to control the pandemic, evidence suggests that new variants of the virus have emerged that may be able to evade the immune responses triggered by current vaccines. Therefore despite the recent approval of a number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines there remains considerable urgency for effective treatments for COVID-19. Severe-to-critical COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with a dysregulated host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 with elevated levels of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) ligands including chemokine C-C ligands 3, 4, 5, as well as interleukins 6 and 10. Leronlimab, a CCR5-specific humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody originally developed for the treatment of HIV has been studied for the treatment of COVID-19. In the TEMPEST trial which compared leronlimab to placebo in subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, a post hoc analysis showed that leronlimab led to improvements from baseline in National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) at Day 14 in the sub-set of people with more severe disease. Data has also been released on a further ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 registrational trial of leronlimab in 394 people with severe-to-critical COVID-19. The results show that Day 28 mortality was reduced (P=0.0319) in the subset of participants receiving leronlimab plus other pre-specified commonly used COVID-19 treatments including dexamethasone administered as part of their standard of care (SOC) compared to participants receiving placebo plus other pre-specified commonly used COVID-19 treatments including dexamethasone as part of their SOC. Several cases have recently been reported demonstrated that treatment with leronlimab restores immune function and achieves clinical improvement in people with critical COVID-19. Here we report on a further case of a critically ill person who was treated with leronlimab. This person had been on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for an extended period of time before receiving 4 doses of leronlimab. The male subject received his first dose of leronlimab on Day 79 of hospitalization he was weaned off ECMO by Day 84 and discharged from the ECMO intensive care unit on Day 91.

Alteplase will be delivered through an initial bolus of 50mg or 100mg followed by heparin infusion for systemic anticoagulation, with alteplase re-dosing if there is a >20% PaO2/FiO2 improvement not sustained by 24 hours. Results: The primary outcome is improvement in PaO2/FiO2 at 48 hours post-randomization. Other outcomes include: ventilator- and ICU-free-days, successful extubation (no reintubation &#8804;3 days after initial extubation), and mortality. Fifity eligible patients will be enrolled in a rapidly adaptive, modified stepped-wedge design with four looks at the data. Conclusion: Findings will provide timely information on the safety, efficacy and optimal dosing of tPA to treat moderate/severe COVID-19-induced ARDS, which can be rapidly adapted to a phase III trial.

Replication of SARS-CoV-2 is characterised by transcription and replication of genomic length RNA and shorter subgenomic RNAs to produce virus proteins and ultimately progeny virions. Here we explore the pattern of both genome-length and subgenomic RNAs and positive and negative strand SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in diagnostic nasopharyngeal swabs using sensitive probe based PCR assays as well as Ampliseq panels designed to target subgenomic RNAs. Using these assays, we measured the ratios of genomic to subgenomic RNAs as well as the ratios of positive to negative strand RNAs in SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab samples. We found that while subgenomic RNAs and negative strand RNA can be readily detected in swab samples taken up to 19 and 17 days post symptom onset respectively, and therefore their detection alone is not likely an indicator of active SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, the ratios of genomic-length to subgenomic RNA and also of positive to negative strand RNA were elevated in some swabs, particularly those collected around the onset of clinical symptoms or in an individual with decreasing PCR Cts in successive swab samples. We tentatively conclude that it may be possible to refine such molecular assays to help determine if active replication of virus is occurring and progeny virions likely present in a SARS-CoV-2 positive individual. Assays targeting subgenomic N or ORF7a RNAs as well as strand specific ORF7a total genome-length and subgenomic RNAs may be the most sensitive for this purpose as these targets were consistently the most abundant in the swab samples.","Chamings, Anthony; Bhatta, Tarka Raj; Alexandersen, Soren",,118,17

However, the mechanism by which CD133+ HPCs affect the malignancy of human breast cancer has not been reported. METHODS: CD133+ HPCs were isolated and purified from human umbilical cord blood (UCB). We used in vitro culture of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, and MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in nude mice to evaluate whether CD133+ HPCs affected the apoptosis, proliferation, invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition EMT of breast cancer cells. RESULTS: Co-culture with CD133+ HPCs, but not UCB CD133- cells, promoted the proliferation of human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, accompanied by reducing in vitro spontaneous apoptosis. Co-administration of these two lines with CD133+ HPCs significantly enhanced the growth of implanted breast cancer in vivo. Furthermore, co-culture with CD133+ HPCs, enhanced the invasion of breast cancer cells, N-cadherin and Vimentin expression, but reduced E-cadherin expression in breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that CD133+ HPCs enhance the malignancy of breast cancer cells by attenuating spontaneous apoptosis and promoting the process of epithelial mesenchymal transition. These findings may provide new insights into the role of human CD133+ HPCs in breast cancer pathogenesis. Therefore, CD133+ HPCs may be a new therapeutic target for inhibiting the progression of breast cancer.","Zhang, Zhe; Zheng, Qinglian; Liu, Yonghui; Sun, Lianqing; Han, Pingping; Wang, Rui; Zhao, Jiao; Hu, Shan; Zhao, Xinhan",BMC Cancer,118,16

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of intranasal and/or pulmonary administration of CQ/HCQ for COVID-19 using Bio/chemoinformatics tools. We, hereby, hypothesize the success of the intranasal and the pulmonary routes through a gelatin matrix to overcome several challenges related to CQ and HCQ pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics properties and to increase their local concentrations at the sites of initial viral entry while minimizing the potential side effects. Molecular docking on the gelatin-simulated matrix demonstrated high loading values and a sustained release profile. Moreover, the docking on mucin as well as various receptors including Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), heparin sulphate proteoglycan and Phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), which are expressed in the lung and intranasal tissues and represent initial sites of attachment of the viral particles to the surface of respiratory cells, has shown good binding of CQ and HCQ to these receptors. The presented data provide an insight into the use of a novel drug formulation that needs to be tested in adequately powered randomized controlled clinical trials; aiming for a sustained prophylaxis effect and/or a treatment strategy against this pandemic viral infection.","Hathout, Rania M; Abdelhamid, Sherihan G; Metwally, AbdelKader A",Inform Med Unlocked,118,15

METHODS: An African American-enriched multiinstitutional cohort of 726 PCa patients consisting of both African American men (AAM; n = 254) and European American men (EAM; n = 472) was used in the analyses. Methods of categorical analysis were used. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression differences between anterior and posterior tumor lesions were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with multiple comparison corrections. RESULTS: Anti-ERG immunohistochemistry staining showed that the association between ERG status and anterior tumors is independent of race and is consistently robust for both AAM (ERGnegative 81.4% vs. ERGpositive 18.6%; p = .005) and EAM (ERGnegative 60.4% vs. ERGpositive 39.6%; p < .001).

IHC-ERGnegative were also more likely to have high-grade tumors (OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.06-2.82; p = .02). In the exploratory genomic analysis, mRNA expression of location-dependent genes is highly influenced by ERG status and African American race. However, tumor location did not impact the expression of AR or the major canonical AR-target genes (KLK3, AMACR, and MYC). CONCLUSIONS: ERGnegative tumor status is the strongest predictor of anterior prostate tumors, regardless of race. Furthermore, AR expression and canonical AR signaling do not impact tumor location.","Yamoah, Kosj; Lal, Priti; Awasthi, Shivanshu; Naghavi, Arash O; Rounbehler, Robert J; Gerke, Travis; Berglund, Anders E; Pow-Sang, Julio M; Schaeffer, Edward M; Dhillon, Jasreman; Park, Jong Y; Rebbeck, Timothy R",Prostate,118,24

The role of micronutrient status and metabolic health emerge as pivotal in COVID-19 pathogenesis and the immune system's response. Metabolic disruption, proceeding from modifiable factors, has been proposed as a significant risk factor accounting for infection susceptibility, disease severity and risk for post-COVID complications. Metabolomics, the comprehensive study and quantification of intermediates and products of metabolism, is a rapidly evolving field and a novel tool in biomarker discovery. In this article, we propose that leveraging insulin resistance biomarkers along with biomarkers of micronutrient deficiencies, will allow for a diagnostic window and provide functional therapeutic targets. Specifically, metabolomics can be applied as: a. At-home test to assess the risk of infection and propose nutritional support, b. A screening tool for high-risk COVID-19 patients to develop serious illness during hospital admission and prioritize medical support, c(i). A tool to match nutritional support with specific nutrient requirements for mildly ill patients to reduce the risk for hospitalization, and c(ii). for critically ill patients to reduce recovery time and risk of post-COVID complications, d. At-home test to monitor metabolic health and reduce post-COVID symptomatology.

Remarkably, this virus, known as Mimivirus, has a genome that encodes for nearly 1000 proteins, some of which are involved in the biosynthesis of unusual sugars. Indeed, the virus is coated by a layer of glycosylated fibers that contain d-glucose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, l-rhamnose, and 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose. Here we describe a combined structural and enzymological investigation of the protein encoded by the open-reading frame L780, which corresponds to an l-rhamnose synthase. The structure of the L780/NADP+ /UDP-l-rhamnose ternary complex was determined to 1.45 Å resolution and refined to an overall R-factor of 19.9 %. Each subunit of the dimeric protein adopts a bilobal-shaped appearance with the N-terminal domain harboring the dinucleotide binding site and the C-terminal domain positioning the UDP-sugar into the active site. The overall molecular architecture of L780 places it into the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Kinetic analyses indicate that the enzyme can function on either UDP- and dTDP-sugars but displays a higher catalytic efficiency with the UDP-linked substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that both Cys 108 and Lys 175 play key roles in catalysis. This structure represents the first model of a viral UDP-l-rhamnose synthase and provides new details into these fascinating enzymes. This article is protected by copyright.

As the disease spread, demands on health care systems increased, specifically the need to expand hospital capacity. Alternative care hospitals (ACHs) have been used to mitigate these issues; however, establishing an ACH has many challenges. The goal of this session was to perform systems testing, using a simulation-based evaluation to identify areas in need of improvement. METHODS: Four simulation cases were designed to depict common and high acuity situations encountered in the ACH, using a high technology simulator and standardized patient. A multidisciplinary observer group was given debriefing forms listing the objectives, critical actions, and specific areas to focus their attention. These forms were compiled for data collection. RESULTS: Logistical, operational, and patient safety issues were identified during the simulation and compiled into a simulation event report. Proposed solutions and protocol changes were made in response to the identified issues. CONCLUSION: Simulation was successfully used for systems testing, supporting efforts to maximize patient care and provider safety in a rapidly developed ACH.

Following the peak of the epidemic in mid-March, the curve has slowly fallen thanks to the strict lockdown imposed by the Italian government on 9th March 2020. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in 423 workers in Bergamo province who returned to the workplace after the end of the Italian lockdown on 5th May 2020. To this end, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 and a nasopharyngeal swab to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). As a secondary aim of the study, we validated a lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFIA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. FINDINGS: ELISA identified 38.5% positive subjects, of whom 51.5% were positive for both IgG and IgM, 47.3% were positive only for IgG, but only 1.2% were positive for IgM alone. Only 23 (5.4%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR, although with high cycle thresholds (between 34 and 39), indicating a very low residual viral load that was not able to infect cultured cells. All these rRT-PCR positive subjects had already experienced seroconversion. When the ELISA was used as the comparator, the estimated specificity and sensitivity of the rapid LFIA for IgG were 98% and 92%, respectively. INTERPRETATION: the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the province of Bergamo reached 38.5%, significantly higher than has been reported for most other regions worldwide. Few nasopharyngeal swabs tested positive in fully recovered subjects, though with a very low SARS-CoV-2 viral load, with implications for infectivity and discharge policies for positive individuals in the post-pandemic period. The rapid LFIA used in this study is a valuable tool for rapid serologic surveillance of COVID-19 for population studies. FUNDING: The study was supported by Regione Lombardia, Milano Serravalle - Milano Tangenziali S.p.A., Brembo S.p.A, and by MEI System.","Perico, Luca; Tomasoni, Susanna; Peracchi, Tobia; Perna, Annalisa; Pezzotta, Anna; Remuzzi, Giuseppe; Benigni, Ariela",EBioMedicine,118,16

The authors conducted a multicenter retrospective study to investigate the clinical manifestations and outcomes of patients with cancer who are diagnosed with COVID‐19. METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of hospitalized patients who were treated at 5 hospitals in Wuhan City, China, between January 5 and March 18, 2020. Clinical parameters relating to cancer history (type and treatment) and COVID‐19 were collected. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary analyses were the association between clinical factors and severe COVID‐19 and OS. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients with cancer were diagnosed with COVID‐19, with a median age of 66 years (range, 37‐98 years). Lung (21 patients; 19.6%), gastrointestinal (20 patients; 18.7%), and genitourinary (20 patients; 18.7%) cancers were the most common cancer diagnoses. A total of 37 patients (34.6%) were receiving active anticancer treatment when diagnosed with COVID‐19, whereas 70 patients (65.4%) were on follow‐up. Overall, 52.3% of patients (56 patients) developed severe COVID‐19; this rate was found to be higher among patients receiving anticancer treatment than those on follow‐up (64.9% vs 45.7%), which corresponded to an inferior OS in the former subgroup of patients (hazard ratio, 3.365; 95% CI, 1.455‐7.782 [P = .005]). The detrimental effect of anticancer treatment on OS was found to be independent of exposure to systemic therapy (case fatality rate of 33.3% [systemic therapy] vs 43.8% [nonsystemic therapy]). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated that >50.0% of infected patients with cancer are susceptible to severe COVID‐19. This risk is aggravated by simultaneous anticancer treatment and portends for a worse survival, despite treatment for COVID‐19.","Zhang, Hongyan; Wang, Linwei; Chen, Yuanyuan; Wu, Qiuji; Chen, Gaili; Shen, Xiaokun; Wang, Qun; Yan, Youqin; Yu, Yi; Zhong, Yahua; Wang, Xinghuan; Chua, Melvin L.

Due to a paucity of robust evidence, we sought to assess the presenting characteristics of patients with Covid 19 and investigate factors associated with death. Methods Retrospective analysis of adults admitted with Covid 19 to Royal Oldham Hospital, UK. Logistic regression modelling was utilised to explore factors predicting death. Results 470 patients were admitted, of whom 169 (36%) died. The median age was 71 years (IQR 57 to 82), and 255 (54.3%) were men. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n=218, 46.4%), diabetes (n=143, 30.4%) and chronic neurological disease (n=123, 26.1%). The most frequent complications were acute kidney injury (n=157, 33.4%) and myocardial injury (n=21, 4.5%). Forty three (9.1%) patients required intubation and ventilation, and 39 (8.3%) received non-invasive ventilation Independent risk factors for death were increasing age (OR per 10 year increase above 40 years 1.87, 95% CI 1.57 to 2.27), hypertension (OR 1.72, 1.10 to 2.70), cancer (OR 2.20, 1.27 to 3.81), platelets <150x103/microlitre (OR 1.93, 1.13 to 3.30), C-reactive protein >100 micrograms/mL (OR 1.68, 1.05 to 2.68), >50% chest radiograph infiltrates, (OR 2.09, 1.16 to 3.77) and acute kidney injury (OR 2.60, 1.64 to 4.13). There was no independent association between death and gender, ethnicity, deprivation level, fever, SpO2/FiO2 (oxygen saturation index), lymphopenia or other comorbidities. Conclusions We characterised the first wave of patients with Covid 19 in one of Englands highest incidence areas, determining which factors predict death.

Our approach converts group testing to a linear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as generated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm estimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than existing noisy group testing algorithms. Our approach can easily be extended to various applications, including where false negatives must be minimized.

Alternative teaching modalities have been used. Substitution of dissection courses on cadavers was a great challenge. Present study investigates students’ view on the efficacy of the “online” pre-recorded “dissection educational videos” (DEVs) in assisting anatomy teaching, aiming to modernize the lectures and reinforce comprehension. METHODS: The adequacy of the “online” anatomy courses and a possible new teaching modality were evaluated by the 2nd year pre-graduate students, employing an online questionnaire. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-six volunteer students participated. Before the pandemic, 78.1% of the students constantly attended the “auditorium-based” lectures and 73% used self-teaching tools (STTs) for a better understanding of anatomy. During pandemic, a slight lower frequency (76%) attended the “online” lectures and a higher frequency (84.2%) used at least one STT. Up to 59.2% of the students disagreed with the permanent replacement of the “auditorium-based” by the “online” lectures, while 62.8% supported the idea of parallel conduction of the lectures. Combined teaching tools were the most preferred resources. 83.2% of the students stated that the dissection labs’ cancellation negatively affected their education, and 75.5% supported the permanent addition of the pre-recorded DEV series in the lectures. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic created the temporary need for pure remote education. During lockdown, the use of STTs has significantly increased. A novel teaching modality (DEV series), presented in the study, can be used both as educational material and as a STT.","Natsis, Konstantinos; Lazaridis, Nikolaos; Kostares, Michael; Anastasopoulos, Nikolaos; Chytas, Dimitrios; Totlis, Trifon; Piagkou, Maria",Surg Radiol Anat,118,1

Although molecular testing is the gold standard method of SARS-CoV-2 detection, the existence of the false-negative results presents a major limitation to this method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective Double-Centre study was conducted on 1320 COVID-19 patients recruited at Taleghani and Shohadae Tajrish Hospitals in Tehran, Iran. We analyzed the leukocyte, lymphocyte and neutrophil counts of hospitalized cases both on admission and at discharge. We also evaluated the alteration of these parameters within a seven-day follow-up. RESULTS: Of the whole, 1077 (81.6%) neither were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) nor experienced death, and were defined as the mild-moderate group. Of 243 severe cases, while 59 (24.3%) were admitted to ICU and cured with the intensive care services, 184 (75.7%) patients died of the disease, either with or without ICU admission. Calculation of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) revealed that the mild-moderate cases had a lower ratio at discharge. On the other hand, the ratio was significantly higher in the death group as compared to the ICU group; highlighting the fact that patients with a higher degree of neutrophilia and a greater level of lymphopenia have a poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: We suggest that NLR greater than 6.5 may reflect the progression of the disease towards an unfavorable clinical outcome, with this notion that the ratios higher than 9 may strongly result in death.","Pirsalehi, Ali; Salari, Sina; Baghestani, Ahmadreza; Vahidi, Mohammad; Khave, Laya Jalilian; Akbari, Mohammad Esmaeil; Bashash, Davood",Iran J Microbiol,118,30

The manifestations are quite varied, ranging from severe lung infections to being asymptomatic. Hence, there is an urgent need to champion new tools to accelerate the end of this pandemic. Compromised immunity is a primary feature of COVID-19. Allium sativum (AS) is an effective dietary supplement known for its immune-modulatory, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antifungal, and anti-viral properties. In this paper, it is hypothesized that carbon dots derived from AS (AS-CDs) may possess the potential to downgrade the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and revert the immunological aberrations to normal in the case of COVID-19. Carbon dots (CDs) have already been explored in the world of nanobiomedicine as promising theranostic candidates for bioimaging and drug/gene delivery. The antifibrotic and antioxidant effects of AS are elaborated, as demonstrated in several studies. It is found that the most active constituent of AS, allicin has a highly potent antioxidant and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging effect. The antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-viral effects along with their capability of negating inflammatory effects and cytokine storm, are discussed. The synthesis of theranostic CDs from AS may provide a novel weapon in the therapeutic armamentarium for the management of COVID-19 infection and, at the same time, could act as a diagnostic agent for COVID-19.","Kalkal, Ashish; Allawadhi, Prince; Pradhan, Rangadhar; Khurana, Amit; Bharani, Kala Kumar; Packirisamy, Gopinath",,118,0

Developing an effective and reliable vaccine was emergently pursued to control the dramatic spread of the global pandemic. The standard stages for vaccine development were unprecedentedly accelerated over a few months. We report a case of new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. We attribute the occurrence of NORSE to the vaccine due to the temporal relationship and the lack of risk factors for epilepsy in the patient. This report adds to the literature a possible rare side effect of a COVID-19 vaccine and contributes to the extremely limited literature on potential neurological side effects of viral vector vaccines. Healthcare providers should be aware of the possibility of post-vaccination epilepsy. The patient had recurrent seizures that were refractory to conventional antiepileptic drug therapy with a dramatic response to immunotherapy with pulse steroids and plasmapheresis. This likely reflects an underlying autoimmune mechanism in the genesis of post-vaccination generalized seizures without fever.

There is evidence that obesity-related conditions may increase the severity of COVID-19 disease, especially in those below the age of 60. However, there has been limited research on mortality rate based on body mass index (BMI) in the older adult population, defined as age over 65. The objective of this study was to characterize outcomes in older adults infected with COVID-19 based on BMI. Study design and methods It is a single-center retrospective cohort study of older adults with COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes assessed were oxygen requirements, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay. Data were analyzed with the Student’s t-test, Fisher’s exact test, and multiple logistic regression analyses as appropriate. Results A total of 290 patients were included in this study. The mean age was 77.6 years. The median BMI was >30 kg/m2. The primary outcome of hospital mortality occurred in 49.7% of patients. BMI was not found to be a predictor of mortality. Age 75-79 and age ≥ 85 were associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR: 2.58; 95% CI: 1.15 - 5.79; OR: 3.17; 95% CI: 1.35 - 7.44, respectively). Patients with a BMI < 18.5, BMI 18.5 - 25, and age ≥ 85 were less likely to require mechanical ventilation (OR: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.00 - 0.83; OR:0.11; 95% CI: 0.02 - 0.64 and OR:0.28; 95% CI: 0.09 - 0.92, respectively).

These pathologies are associated with inflammation and activation of endothelial cells. Depending on the biological context and the specific group of phospholipid oxidation products, OxPL may exhibit both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects. This review will summarize the data showing a dual role of OxPL in modulation of chronic and acute inflammation as well as OxPL effects on pulmonary endothelial permeability. Recent reports show protective effects of OxPL in the models of endotoxin and ventilator-induced ALI and suggest a potential for using OxPL-derived cyclopenthenone-containing compounds with barrier-protective properties for drug design. These compounds may represent a new group of therapeutic agents for the treatment of lung syndromes associated with acute inflammation and lung vascular leak.","Fu, Panfeng; Birukov, Konstantin G.",Transl Res,118,10

A virtual clinic was piloted to deliver preoperative health optimisation and shared decision-making for patients undergoing critical elective surgery. No literature existed on virtual preoperative clinics for older people to support the development. OBJECTIVE: this healthcare improvement study describes the setup and delivery of the virtual clinic as its primary aim. Secondary aims included: assessing older people’s access to technology and their digital literacy for virtual consultation; to describe barriers and facilitators for consultations, as well as evaluation of patient and clinician satisfaction with the consultations' mode of delivery and outcomes. METHODS: a mixed methods healthcare improvement study was undertaken through plan-do-study-act cycles, semi-structure interviews, and quantitative service benchmarking. RESULTS: the pilot evaluated 67 preoperative consultations (43.3% video, 56.7% telephone, mean age 75) with a mix of surgical pathology (vascular 88.1%, colorectal 10.4%, urological 1.5%). Patient feedback demonstrated improved understanding of conditions (90.6%), and adequate opportunity to express opinions and questions (96.2%). Clinicians preferred video consultations (adequate to deliver services: 89.7% video; 68.4% telephone). The greatest barriers to engagement, none of which were exclusions to participation, included cognitive impairment, sensory impairment, or needing technical assistance setting up video consultations (52.2%). CONCLUSIONS: delivering a virtual preoperative medical optimisation and shared decision clinic for older people is feasible. This study will aid other units in developing their own virtual preoperative clinics. Future work should evaluate perioperative outcomes of delivering a face-to-face versus virtual clinic.","Joughin, Andrea; Ibitoye, Sarah; Crees, Amy; Shipway, David; Braude, Philip",Age Ageing,118,20

No significant inhibition of IBV replication was observed when infected Vero cells were treated with α-amanitin or actinomycin D. In thin sections of infected cells, assembly of IBV was observed at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and mature IBV particles were located in dilated cisternae of the RER as well as in smooth cytoplasmic vesicles. In addition to typical IBV particles, enveloped particles containing numerous ribosomes were identified at later times postinfection. Monensin, a sodium ionophore which blocks glycoprotein transport to plasma membranes at the level of the Golgi complex, was found to inhibit the formation of infectious IBV. In thin sections of infected Vero cells treated with the ionophore, IBV particles were located in dilated cytoplasmic vesicles, but fewer particles were found when compared to controls. A similar pattern of virus-specific proteins was detected in control or monensin-treated IBV-infected cells, which included two glycoproteins (170000 and 24000 daltons) and a polypeptide of 52000 daltons.

Classical immunoglobulin functions are associated with antigen recognition and the initiation of innate immune responses. However, in addition to classical functions, antibodies exhibit a variety of non-canonical functions related to the destruction of various pathogens due to catalytic activity and cofactor effects, the action of antibodies as agonists/antagonists of various receptors, the control of bacterial diversity of the intestine, etc. Canonical and non-canonical functions reflect the extreme human antibody repertoire and the variety of antibody types generated in the organism: antigen-specific, natural, polyreactive, broadly neutralizing, homophilic, bispecific and catalytic. The therapeutic effects of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are associated with both the canonical and non-canonical functions of antibodies. In this review, catalytic antibodies will be considered in more detail, since their formation is associated with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

The acquisition of passive immunity in the calf by vaccinating the dam has shown some success in previous studies; however, no data exists on the use of currently licensed vaccines in the United States. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether vaccinating cows in late gestation with a commercially available Salmonella Dublin vaccine would stimulate Salmonella-specific antibodies in the colostrum of cows at calving and whether these antibodies would be transferred to the calf. Thirty Holstein cows were vaccinated 3 wk before the end of lactation with a Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin vaccine, with a second dose given at dry-off. An additional 30 cows received only saline. Calves had a blood sample collected immediately after birth and were then fed fresh colostrum from their dam within 2 h of calving. A postcolostrum blood sample was collected 24 to 48 h later. Salmonella Dublin antibodies in colostrum as well as serum from the cows and calves were measured using an ELISA technique. Results of this study showed that vaccinated cattle had elevated Salmonella Dublin antibody titers at the time of calving (40.3 ± 9.1) as compared with control cows (−9.4 ± 1.1). Calves that received colostrum from vaccinated cattle also had a significant increase in Salmonella Dublin antibodies (88.5 ± 8.9) as compared with calves born to unvaccinated cows (−3.2 ± 1.2). This study demonstrated that the use of a commercially available Salmonella Dublin vaccine can stimulate antibodies that are passed on to the calf via colostral transfer. Further studies need to be done to determine whether these antibodies will offer protection against Salmonella challenge.","Smith, Geof W.; Smith, Feli; Zuidhof, Sjoert; Foster, Derek M.",J Dairy Sci,118,20

The lung loses its normal gas exchange efficiency with disruption of the tight permeability characteristics of the alveolar capillary barrier. Interstitial and subsequent alveolar edema lead to alveolar collapse/de-recruitment, reduced lung compliance and greater pulmonary vascular resistance, often with marked regional heterogeneity in severity. Regional heightened stress applied to surrounding normal or less injured lung from edematous and collapsed regions along with associated barotrauma, volutrauma and atelectrauma with mechanical or extreme spontaneous ventilatory efforts further propagate injury in a vicious cycle called ventilator induced lung injury. Resulting arterial hypoxemia and hypercapnia arise from the creation of regions of shunt and low ventilation-perfusion (V(A)/Q) ratios, in addition to creation of high V(A)/Q and dead space areas by blood flow obstruction with thrombosis and/or high ventilating pressures. The pathophysiology of ARDS is discussed in this article and focuses on changes in the lung parenchyma and vasculature that reduce compliance, increase vascular resistance and compromise maintenance of dry normally compliant alveolar space by active alveolar fluid clearance and passive lymphatic fluid clearance from the lung interstitium. The COVID-19 pandemic that has emerged with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has generated a new form of severe acute lung injury that resembles ARDS in many of its features, but has different characteristics in its earliest stages leading to more profound hypoxemia and loss of dyspnea perception with less radiologically evident lung injury, not described before in ARDS. Understanding the pathophysiological features of ARDS and COVID-19 lung injury is critical to the best use of supportive therapies such as low tidal volume ventilation, supplemental oxygen concentrations, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), permissive hypercapnia, prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade.","Swenson, Kai E.; Swenson, Erik R.",Crit Care Clin,118,26

We used EV markers that were potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 dissemination via vesicles and cell-origination markers, characterizing objects from different cell types that could influence clinical manifestation of COVID-19. Plasma levels of CD235a+ and CD14+ EVs in patients with moderate infection were significantly increased while CD8+ and CD19+ EVs were decreased comparing with HD. Patients with severe infection had lower levels of CD4+, CD19+, and CD146+ EVs than HD. These findings demonstrate that EV concentrations in COVID-19 are severity related.

The information seekers could face health risks if they are not proficient in OHI literacy. The OHI-seeking behaviors and skills of Chinese college students, the largest proportion of college students in the world, are understudied. This study was aimed to describe OHI-seeking behaviors and skills of college students in Guangdong, China. METHODS: College students in the Guangdong province with OHI-seeking experience were invited via WeChat, QQ, and Sina Weibo using QR code posters and flyers for participation in this online anonymized questionnaire-based study. Data on demographics, OHI literacy, information resources, search approaches, and behaviors were collected. The relationship between perceived OHI literacy and high-risk behaviors was investigated by bivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Respondents were 1203 college students with a mean age of 20.6 years, females (60.2%), and undergraduates (97.2%). They sought health information via websites (20.3%), WeChat (2.6%), or both (77.1%). Baidu was the main search engine, and baike.baidu.com (80.3%), Zhihu.com (48.4%), and Zhidao.baidu.com (35.8%) were top three among 20 searched websites for information about self-care (80.7%), general health (79.5%), disease prevention (77.7%), self-medication (61.2%), family treatment (40.9%), drugs (37.7%), western medications (26.6%), hospitals (22.7%), physicians (21.4%), and Traditional Chinese Medicine (15.6%). Despite most respondents (78%) lacked confidence in the evidence quality and satisfaction with the results, only 32.4% further consulted doctors. Many (> 50%) would recommend the retrieved information to others. About 20% experienced hacking/Internet fraud. Cronbach’s alpha for the internal consistency of OHI literacy was 0.786. Bivariate logistic regression analysis showed that students who believed they can judge the evidence level of OHI were more likely to self-diagnose (OR = 2.2, 95%CI, 1.6–3.1) and look for drug usage (OR = 3.1, 95%CI, 1.9–5.0). CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals Chinese college students’ heavy reliance on OHI to manage their own and others’ health without sufficient knowledge/skills to identify misinformation and disinformation.

However, data on the prevalence of CKD in Guatemala, Central America’s most populous country, are limited, especially for rural communities. METHODS: We conducted a population-representative survey of 2 rural agricultural municipalities in Guatemala. We collected anthropometric data, blood pressure, serum and urine creatinine, glycosylated hemoglobin, and urine albumin. Sociodemographic, health, and exposure data were self-reported. RESULTS: We enrolled 807 individuals (63% of all eligible, 35% male, mean age 39.5 years). An estimated 4.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4–6.6) had CKD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Most individuals with an eGFR below 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) had diabetes or hypertension. In multivariable analysis, the important factors associated with risk for an eGFR less than 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) included a history of diabetes or hypertension (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 11.21; 95% CI 3.28–38.24), underweight (body mass index [BMI] <18.5) (aOR 21.09; 95% CI 2.05–217.0), and an interaction between sugar cane agriculture and poverty (aOR 1.10; 95% CI 1.01–1.19). CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based survey, most observed CKD was associated with diabetes and hypertension. These results emphasize the urgent public health need to address the emerging epidemic of diabetes, hypertension, and CKD in rural Guatemala. In addition, the association between CKD and sugar cane in individuals living in poverty provides some circumstantial evidence for existence of CKD of unknown etiology in the study communities, which requires further investigation.","Miller, Ann C.; Tuiz, Eva; Shaw, Leah; Flood, David; Garcia, Pablo; Dhaenens, Eloin; Thomson, Dana R.; Barnoya, Joaquin; Montano, Carlos Mendoza; Rohloff, Peter",Kidney Int Rep,118,28

There are several factors contributing to the state of health human resources in the country, but problems with governance stand out as one area requiring further research, analysis and critique. This paper presents a retrospective analysis of the historical patterns in national health human resources governance in South Africa, based on a desktop policy review spanning 25 years after democracy. The authors took a multi-pronged, iterative approach, reviewing policy documents alongside grey and published literature. This led to a timeline showing key legislation, relevant health system and human resource policies, interventions, reviews and evaluations from 1994 to 2018. The review identified three distinct periods that help to characterise the terrain of human resources for health governance over the concerned 25 years. Firstly, a foundational period, in which much of the constitutional and legislative groundwork was laid. Secondly, the HIV epidemic period, which presented a major disruption to the development of system wide governance interventions and improvements. Thirdly, the launch of National Health Insurance discussions and policy processes, which signalled a gradual return to a comprehensive systems focus in line with the founding principles of the first period. Using this periodisation, as well as a conceptual framework of health human resources governance functions based on international literature, the authors argue that South Africa has experienced both progress and challenges in human resources for health governance. This has affected the successful implementation of its policy and strategic planning over the past 25 years. Good governance for human resources for health requires capable stewardship, underpinned by an appropriate mix of technical and administrative skills and explicit political support. The review findings suggest that strengthening human resources for health governance roles, including fostering purposeful stewardship by the National Department of Health, may be key to shifting the terrain in the availability and performance of South Africa’s health workforce going forwards.","Van Ryneveld, Manya; Schneider, Helen; Lehmann, Uta",Hum Resour Health,118,28

Several of these highly infectious pathogens, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been cemented in human history as causing epidemics or pandemics due to their lethality and contagiousness. SARS-CoV-2 is an example of these highly infectious pathogens that have recently become one of the leading causes of globally reported deaths, creating one of the worst economic downturns and health crises in the last century. As a result, the necessity for highly accurate and increasingly rapid on-site diagnostic platforms for highly infectious pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, has grown dramatically over the last two years. Current conventional non-microfluidic diagnostic techniques have limitations in their effectiveness as on-site devices due to their large turnaround times, operational costs and the need for laboratory equipment. In this review, we first present criteria, both novel and previously determined, as a foundation for the development of effective and viable on-site microfluidic diagnostic platforms for several notable pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. This list of criteria includes standards that were set out by the WHO, as well as our own “seven pillars” for effective microfluidic integration. We then evaluate the use of microfluidic integration to improve upon currently, and previously, existing platforms for the detection of infectious pathogens. Finally, we discuss a stage-wise means to translate our findings into a fundamental framework towards the development of more effective on-site SARS-CoV-2 microfluidic-integrated platforms that may facilitate future pandemic diagnostic and research endeavors. Through microfluidic integration, many limitations in currently existing infectious pathogen diagnostic platforms can be eliminated or improved upon.","Escobar, Andres; Chiu, Phyllis; Qu, Jianxi; Zhang, Yushan; Xu, Chang-qing",Micromachines (Basel),118,18

Focusing on how farmers organize and experience agriculture, we track diverging approaches to care work on urban farms in Vilnius, Lithuania. Our ethnographic fieldwork and interviews show how Lithuanian urban farmers are struggling to reconcile the civic ideals of the global urban farming movement with their historical understandings of care for specific plants and the land. Whereas the older generation views farming as kinship-based individualized work focusing on particular plants and garden ecologies, the younger generation approaches it as a way to unwind, mediate, and build a community. These different perspectives on farming translate into divergent temporalities of care in which productivist goals rooted in socialist self-provisioning practices and embodied in orderly landscapes encounter new trends of agricultural care manifested in the natural aesthetics of the farms. We examine dynamic tensions between the two farming modalities by linking them to different understandings of moral commitments and responsibilities for plants and land. Through the lens of temporality, we also show how these divergent care modes are themselves grounded in gender inequalities reproduced on the farms and enabled by by the welfare state institutions, including maternity leave and retirement policies.","Mincytė, Diana; Bartkienė, Aistė; Bikauskaitė, Renata",Geoforum,118,21

Although preclinical studies have demonstrated that CRPS may be driven in part by autoinflammation, clinical use of immune-modulating drugs in CRPS is limited. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug used to treat malaria and autoimmune disorders that may provide benefit in CRPS. OBJECTIVES: To describe the use of HCQ in patients with refractory CRPS and investigate possible mechanisms of benefit in a mouse model of CRPS. METHODS: We initiated HCQ therapy in 7 female patients with refractory CRPS undergoing treatment at the Stanford Pain Management Center. We subsequently undertook studies in the mouse tibial fracture–casting model of CRPS to identify mechanisms underlying symptom reduction. We evaluated behavior using mechanical allodynia and spinal cord autoinflammation by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: We treated 7 female patients with chronic, refractory CRPS with HCQ 200 mg twice daily for 2 months, followed by 200 mg daily thereafter. Two patients stopped HCQ secondary to lack of response or side effects. Overall, HCQ significantly improved average numerical rating scale pain from 6.8 ± 1.1 before HCQ to 3.8 ± 1.9 after HCQ treatment. In the tibial fracture–casting mouse model of CRPS, we observed reductions in allodynia, paw edema, and warmth following daily HCQ treatment starting at 3 weeks after injury. Spinal cord dorsal horn microglial activation and cytokine levels were also reduced by HCQ treatment. CONCLUSION: Together, these preclinical and clinical results suggest that HCQ may benefit patients with CRPS at least in part by modulating autoinflammation and support further investigation into the use of HCQ for CRPS.","Haight, Elena S.; Johnson, Emily M.; Carroll, Ian R.; Tawfik, Vivianne L.",Pain Rep,118,6

We conducted present study to find out the frequency, onset and severity of these lost sensations and their recovery in mild, moderate and severe COVID 19 positive patients in our setup. A questionnaire based study on 574 COVID-19 positive patients admitted in a dedicated COVID hospital between September–November, 2020 were followed up until their sensations recovered completely or maximum for two months. Fever was the most common symptom reported. Loss of smell and taste sensation is seen in 200 (34.84%) and 269 (46.86%) patients respectively; 163 (28.4%) developed both. Males were affected significantly more than females (p = 0.030 and 0.027). Approximately 1/4th patients [49 (24.5%) and 55 (20.45%)] reported loss of smell and taste sensation as their first symptom. Most common taste sensation lost was salty 191 (71.0%). Loss of smell sensation is seen maximally in mild cases and the difference among mild, moderate and severe cases is statistically significant (p = 0.00001); while the difference in loss of taste among all three grades of severity is statistically insignificant (p = 0.0770). Most of the patients [smell (142; 71%) and taste (198; 73.6%)] recovered after 2 weeks of onset of lost sensations while 96.5% (193/200) and 98.1% (264/269) patients reported complete recovery of smell and taste sensations after two months of onset. Present study shows that high percentage of COVID-19 positive patients develop loss of either one or both of smell and taste sensations but recovery is fast and complete in most of them.","Goyal, Rashmi; Kapoor, Anju; Goyal, Mukesh Kumar; Singh, Rekha",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,118,20

Innate immune responses to CoVs are initiated by recognition of double-stranded RNA and induction of interferon, which turns on a gene expression program that inhibits viral replication. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, ferrets and a person strikingly dysregulates the NAD gene set by inducing a set of PARP family members that includes enzymes required for the innate immune response to CoVs. CoV infection also induces a severe attack on host cell NAD. Overexpression of one induced enzyme, PARP10, is sufficient to depress host NAD. Gene expression and pharmacological data suggest that boosting NAD through the nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside kinase pathways may restore antiviral PARP functions to support innate immunity to CoVs, whereas PARP1,2 inhibition does not restore PARP10 activity.","Heer, Collin D.; Sanderson, Daniel J.; Alhammad, Yousef M.O.; Schmidt, Mark S.; Trammell, Samuel A.J.; Perlman, Stanley; Cohen, Michael S.; Fehr, Anthony R.; Brenner, Charles",bioRxiv,118,16

In this study, the QCM biosensor and ProLinker™ B were used to rapidly diagnosis CPV infection. ProLinker™ B enables antibodies to be attached to a gold-coated quartz surface in a regular pattern and in the correct orientation for antigen binding. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were used to set a cut-off value using reference CPVs (two groups: one CPV-positive and one CPV-negative). The ROC curves overlapped and the point of intersection was used as the cut-off value. A QCM biosensor with a cut-off value of −205 Hz showed 95.4% (104/109) sensitivity and 98.0% (149/152) specificity when used to test 261 field fecal samples compared to PCR. In conclusion, the QCM biosensor described herein is eminently suitable for the rapid diagnosis of CPV infection with high sensitivity and specificity.

However, commercial face masks contain filters that are made of materials that are not capable of inactivating neither SARS-CoV-2 nor multidrug-resistant bacteria. Therefore, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals can infect other people even if they wear them because some viable viral or bacterial loads can escape from the masks. Furthermore, viral or bacterial contact transmission can occur after touching the mask, which constitutes an increasing source of contaminated biological waste. Additionally, bacterial pathogens contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 mediated pneumonia disease complex and their resistance to antibiotics in pneumonia treatment is increasing at an alarming rate. In this regard, herein, we report the development of a novel protective non-woven face mask filter fabricated with a biofunctional coating of benzalkonium chloride that is capable of inactivating SARS-CoV-2 in one minute of contact, and the life-threatening methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Nonetheless, despite the results obtained, further studies are needed to ensure the safety and correct use of this technology for the mass production and commercialization of this broad-spectrum antimicrobial face mask filter.

There is an urgent need to design a suitable therapy or vaccine that could fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection. As spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in receptor binding and membrane fusion inside the host, it could be a suitable target for designing of an epitope-based vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus and thus has a property to mutate. So, a conserved peptide region of spike glycoprotein was used for predicting suitable B cell and T cell epitopes. 4 T cell epitopes were selected based on stability, antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity. Further, MHC-I were found from the immune database that could best interact with the selected epitopes. Population coverage analysis was also done to check the presence of identified MHC-I, in the human population of the affected countries. The T cell epitope that binds with the respective MHC-I with highest affinity was chosen. Molecular dynamic simulation results show that the epitope is well selected. This is an in-silico based study that predicts a novel T cell epitope from the conserved spike glycoprotein that could act as a target for designing of the epitope-based vaccine. Further, B cell epitopes have also been found but the main work focuses on T cell epitope as the immunity generated by it is long lasting as compared to B cell epitope.","Agarwal, Vidhu; Varadwaj, Pritish; Tiwari, Akhilesh",bioRxiv,118,1

Rotavirus, a significant cause of childhood gastroenteritis and a member of the Reoviridae family of segmented, double-stranded RNA viruses, encodes at least two direct antagonists of host innate immunity: NSP1 and VP3. NSP1, a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, mediates the degradation of cellular factors involved in both IFN induction and downstream signaling. VP3, the viral capping enzyme, utilizes a 2H-phosphodiesterase domain to prevent activation of the cellular oligoadenylate synthase (OAS)/RNase L pathway. Computational, molecular, and biochemical studies have provided key insights into the structural and mechanistic basis of innate immune antagonism by NSP1 and VP3 of group A rotaviruses (RVA).

In transient transfection assays, bICP0 also inhibits interferon dependent transcription. bICP0 can induce degradation of interferon stimulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a cellular transcription factor that is crucial for activating beta interferon (IFN-β) promoter activity. Recent studies also concluded that interactions between bICP0 and IRF7 inhibit trans-activation of IFN-β promoter activity. The C3HC4 zinc RING (really important new gene) finger located near the amino terminus of bICP0 is important for all known functions of bICP0. A recombinant virus that contains a single amino acid change in a well conserved cysteine residue of the C3HC4 zinc RING finger of bICP0 grows poorly in cultured cells, and does not reactivate from latency in cattle confirming that the C3HC4 zinc RING finger is crucial for viral growth and pathogenesis. A bICP0 deletion mutant does not induce plaques in permissive cells, but induces autophagy in a cell type dependent manner. In summary, the ability of bICP0 to stimulate productive infection, and repress IFN dependent transcription plays a crucial role in the BoHV-1 infection cycle.","Jones, Clinton",Viruses,118,1

METHOD: We used data from the 2016 NHBS HET4 (DC). A total of 747 surveys were collected. We used the free social-network analysis package, GEPHI, for all network visualization using adjacency matrix representation. We additionally conducted logistic regression analysis to examine the association of selected variables with HIV status in three models representing 1) demographic and economic effects, 2) behavioral effects, and 3) prevention-intervention effects. RESULTS: The results showed 3% were tested positive. Seed 1 initiated the largest networks with 426 nodes (15 positives); seed 4 with 273 nodes (6 positives). Seed 3 had 35 nodes (2 positives). All 23 HIV diagnoses were recruited from 4 zip-codes across DC. The risk of testing positive was higher among people high-school dropouts (Relative Risk (RR) (25.645); 95 CI% 5.699, 115.987), unemployed ((4.267); 1.295, 14.064), returning citizens ((14.319); 4.593, 44.645). We also found in the final model higher association of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness among those tested negative ((4.783); 1.042, 21.944) and HIV intervention in the past 12 months with those tested positive ((17.887); 2.350,136.135). CONCLUSION: The network visualization was used to address the primary aim of the analysis-evaluate the success of the implementation of the NHBS as a social network strategy to find new diagnoses. NHBS remains one of the strongest behavioral supplements for DC’s HIV planning activities. As part of the evaluation process our analysis helps to understand the impact of demographic, behavioral, and prevention efforts on peoples’ HIV status. We strongly recommend other jurisdictions use network visualizations to evaluate the efficacy in reaching hidden populations.","Das, Suparna; Medina, Richard; Nicolosi, Emily; Agopian, Anya; Kuo, Irene; Opoku, Jenevieve; Allston, Adam; Kharfen, Michael",PLoS One,118,1

Sensitive and accurate detection of RSV, HRV and HMPV is necessary for clinical diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS: A locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based multiplex closed one-tube nested real-time RT-PCR (mOTNRT-PCR) assay was developed for simultaneous detection of RSV, HRV and HMPV. The sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and clinical performance of mOTNRT-PCR were evaluated and compared with individual real time PCR (RT-qPCR) assay using clinical samples. The analytical sensitivity of mOTNRT-PCR assay was 5 copies/reaction for RSV, HRV and HMPV, respectively, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory viruses was observed. The coefficients of variation (CV) of intra-assay and inter-assay were between 0.51 to 3.67%. Of 398 nasopharyngeal aspirates samples tested, 109 (27.39%), 150 (37.69%) and 44 (11.06%) were positive for RSV, HRV and HMPV, respectively, whereas 95 (23.87%), 137 (34.42%) and 38 (9.55%) were positive for RSV, HRV and HMPV, respectively, by individual RT-qPCR assay. Thirty three samples that were positive by mOTNRT-PCR but negative by RT-qPCR were confirmed as true positives by sequencing using reported traditional two-step nested PCR assay. CONCLUSION: mOTNRT-PCR assay reveals extremely higher sensitivity than that of RT-qPCR assay for detecting RSV, HRV and HMPV in clinical settings.

However, systemwide immunomodulation is undesirable due to the severe side effects that typically accompany such strategies. In order to circumvent these undesired, harmful effects, scientists have turned to tailorable biomaterials that can achieve localized, potent release of immune‐modulating agents. Specifically, “stimuli‐responsive” biomaterials hold a strong promise for delivery of immunotherapeutic agents to the disease site or disease‐relevant tissues with high spatial and temporal accuracy. This review provides an overview of stimuli‐responsive biomaterials used for targeted immunomodulation. Stimuli‐responsive or “environmentally responsive” materials are customized to specifically react to changes in pH, temperature, enzymes, redox environment, photo‐stimulation, molecule‐binding, magnetic fields, ultrasound‐stimulation, and electric fields. Moreover, the latest generation of this class of materials incorporates elements that allow for response to multiple stimuli. These developments, and other stimuli‐responsive materials that are on the horizon, are discussed in the context of controlling immune responses.","Pacifici, Noah; Bolandparvaz, Amir; Lewis, Jamal S.",Adv Ther (Weinh),118,29

The indication of pre-operative mouthwash containing 1% hydrogen peroxide for reducing the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva prior to oral procedures has been significantly disseminated through several citations and influenced various dental associations in the elaboration of dental care protocols during this pandemic period, including patients admitted to hospital wards and intensive care units. AIM: The objective of this work was to perform a systematic review to answer the following question: does hydrogen peroxide mouthwash (at any concentration) have a virucidal effect? METHODS: The Cochrane, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus and EMBASE databases were searched by using the following key-words like: “hydrogen peroxide”, “mouthwash”, “mouth rinse”, “rinse”, “oral rinse”, “mouth bath”, “mouth wash” and “mouth washes”.Reviews, letters to the editor, personal opinions, book chapters, case reports, congress abstracts, studies with animals and studies on mouthwash containing other compounds other than hydrogen peroxide were excluded. FINDINGS: During the initial search1,342 articles were identified on the five electronic databases. After excluding some duplicates, 976 articles remained. Only studies assessing the virucidal effect of hydrogen peroxide mouthwash were selected, regardless of publication date. After reading titles and abstracts, no article met the eligibility criteria. CONCLUSION: There is no scientific evidence supporting the indication of hydrogen peroxide mouthwash for control of the viral load regarding SARS-CoV-2 or any other viruses in saliva.","Ortega, K.L.; Rech, B.O.; El Haje, G.L.C.; Gallo, C.B.; Pérez-Sayáns, M.; Braz-Silva, P.H.",J Hosp Infect,118,0

Proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18) strengthened both the natural immunity and acquired immunity and played an important role in organ transplantation. The roles of IL-18 in the occurrence, development, and drug treatment of OB remained unclear. METHODS: Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against mouse IL-18 (siRNA-IL-18) was used to silence IL-18 expression. Mouse heterotopic tracheal transplantation model was used to simulate OB. Recipient mice were divided into 5 groups (n = 12) according to donor mouse strains and drug treatment: isograft group, allograft group, allograft+tacrolimus group, allograft+azithromycin group, and allograft+tacrolimus+azithromycin group. The luminal obliteration rates were pathological evaluation. Expressions of cytokines and MMPs were detected by real-time PCR, western blot, and enzyme chain immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The luminal obliteration rates of IL-18 of the siRNA-IL-18 group were significantly lower than those of the negative control group (p < 0.0001) and the blank control group (p = 0.0002). mRNA expressions of IFN-γ, EMMPRIN, MMP-8, and MMP-9 of the siRNA-IL-18 group were significantly lower than those of the negative and blank control groups. No tracheal occlusion occurred in grafts of the isograft group. The rates of tracheal occlusion of the allograft group, allograft+tacrolimus group, allograft+azithromycin group, and allograft+tacrolimus+azithromycin group were 72.17 ± 4.66%, 40.33 ± 3.00%, 38.50 ± 2.08%, and 23.33 ± 3.24%, respectively.

This study describes the changes in public emotional reactions and mobility patterns in the Chinese population during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We collected data on public emotional reactions in response to the outbreak through Weibo, the Chinese Twitter, between 1st January and 31st March 2020. Using anonymized location-tracking information, we analyzed the daily mobility patterns of approximately 90% of Sichuan residents. RESULTS: There were three distinct phases of the emotional and behavioral reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak. The alarm phase (19th–26th January) was a restriction-free period, characterized by few new daily cases, but a large amount public negative emotions [the number of negative comments per Weibo post increased by 246.9 per day, 95% confidence interval (CI) 122.5–371.3], and a substantial increase in self-limiting mobility (from 45.6% to 54.5%, changing by 1.5% per day, 95% CI 0.7%–2.3%). The epidemic phase (27th January–15th February) exhibited rapidly increasing numbers of new daily cases, decreasing expression of negative emotions (a decrease of 27.3 negative comments per post per day, 95% CI −40.4 to −14.2), and a stabilized level of self-limiting mobility. The relief phase (16th February–31st March) had a steady decline in new daily cases and decreasing levels of negative emotion and self-limiting mobility. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the public's emotional reaction was strongest before the actual peak of the outbreak and declined thereafter. The change in human mobility patterns occurred before the implementation of restriction orders, suggesting a possible link between emotion and behavior.","Li, Yuchen; Zeng, Yu; Liu, Guangdi; Lu, Donghao; Yang, Huazhen; Ying, Zhiye; Hu, Yao; Qiu, Jianqing; Zhang, Chao; Fall, Katja; Fang, Fang; Valdimarsdóttir, Unnur A.; Zhang, Wei; Song, Huan",Psychological medicine,118,23

The EBOV pathogenesis starts with uncontrolled viral replication and subversion of both the innate and adaptive host immune response. The multifunctional viral VP35 protein is involved in this process by exerting an antagonistic action against the early antiviral alpha/beta interferon (IFN-α/β) response, and represents a suitable target for the development of strategies to control EBOV infection. Phage display technology permits to select antibodies as single chain Fragment variable (scFv) from an artificial immune system, due to their ability to specifically recognize the antigen of interest. ScFv is ideal for genetic manipulation and to obtain antibody constructs useful for targeting either antigens expressed on cell surface or intracellular antigens if the scFv is expressed as intracellular antibody (intrabody) or delivered into the cells. RESULTS: Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in scFv format specific for the EBOV VP35 were isolated from the ETH-2 library of human recombinant antibodies by phage display technology. Five different clones were identified by sequencing, produced in E.coli and expressed in CHO mammalian cells to be characterized in vitro. All the selected scFvs were able to react with recombinant VP35 protein in ELISA, one of the scFvs being also able to react in Western Blot assay (WB). In addition, all scFvs were expressed in cell cytoplasm as intrabodies; a luciferase reporter gene inhibition assay performed in A549 cells showed that two of the scFvs can significantly hamper the inhibition of the IFN-β-induced RIG-I signaling cascade mediated by EBOV VP35. CONCLUSION: Five antibodies in scFv format recognize an active form of EBOV VP35 in ELISA, while one antibody also recognizes VP35 in WB. Two of these scFvs were also able to interfere with the intracellular activity of VP35 in a cell system in vitro. These findings suggest that such antibodies in scFv format might be employed to develop therapeutic molecules able to hamper EBOV infections.","Flego, Michela; Frau, Aldo; Accardi, Luisa; Mallano, Alessandra; Ascione, Alessandro; Gellini, Mara; Fanunza, Elisa; Vella, Stefano; Di Bonito, Paola; Tramontano, Enzo",BMC Biotechnol,118,5

FCV was isolated from the oral fauces of 11% of healthy cats upon entry, and isolation rates were highest for kittens (33%). FHV shedding was very low (4%) at the time of entry and occurred mainly in juveniles. FECV shedding was also common among newly relinquished cats (33%), especially older kittens and juveniles (90%). The subsequent spread of all three viruses was rapid and efficient in the shelter environment. Fifteen percent of cats were shedding FCV, 52% FHV, and 60% FECV after 1 week. More detailed studies were done with FECV shedding, which could be accurately quantitated. The amounts of FECV shed by infected cats ranged from 10(2)to 10(16)particles/swab of feces. FECV shedding was several logs higher in young kittens with primary infection than adult cats with primary infections. The mean levels of FECV shedding among adults were the same for primary and chronic infections. Although shelters were not the primary source of these viruses for many relinquished cats, factors intrinsic to the shelter environment were critical in amplifying shedding and spread to susceptible individuals. Extrinsic factors were especially important for the spread of FHV and FECV. FHV shedding rates increased from 4% to 50% in 1 week's time. The speed and magnitude of the increase in FHV shedding suggested that there was reactivation of latent infections as well as acquisition of new infections. FECV shedding increased 10 to 1,000,000 fold in 1 week among cats that were already infected at entry, and more than one-half of initially negative cats were shedding FECV a week later. Feline calicivirus infection was the least likely to spread in the shelter. The infection rate only increased from 11 to 15% in 1 week.","Pedersen, N.C; Sato, R; Foley, J.E; Poland, A.M",J Feline Med Surg,118,16

The ocular anellovirus load in SHAPU and non-SHAPU patients did not differ and no SHAPU-specific anellovirus variant was detected. Analysis of paired serum and VF samples from SHAPU and non-SHAPU patients showed that the anellovirus detected in VF samples most likely originated from the systemic viral pool during viremia, potentially through breakdown of the blood-ocular barrier.

INTERVENTIONS: Remdesivir was compared with standard of care. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Primary outcome was mortality and secondary outcomes were time to clinical improvement and safety outcomes like serious adverse events, respiratory failure. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Data synthesis was done with Cochrane review manager 5 (RevMan) V.5.3. Cochrane risk of bias V.2.0 tool was used for methodological quality assessment. The GRADE pro GDT was applied for overall quality of evidence. RESULTS: 52 RCTs were screened and 4 studies were included in analysis, with total of 7324 patients. No mortality benefit was observed with remdesivir versus control group (OR=0.92 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.07), p=0.30, moderate quality evidence).

This study investigated the level of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and turnover intention, the relationship between PTSD and turnover intention, and the buffering effect of supervisor support among nurses post-MERS outbreak. Methods: In total, 300 nurses from three of 15 isolation hospitals in South Korea were invited to participate. We collected data pertaining to PTSD, turnover intention, supervisor support, work-related factors, and socio-demographic factors through a structured survey distributed to the nurses at the hospitals after the outbreak. For the statistical analyses, descriptive statistics and multiple regression were employed. Findings: Of the 147 participants, 33.3% were involved in the direct care of the infected patients, whereas 66.7% were involved in the direct care of the suspected patients. More than half (57.1%) of the nurses experienced PTSD, with 25.1% experienced full PTSD and 32.0% with moderate or some level of PTSD. The mean score of turnover intention was 16.3, with the score range of 4 to 20. The multiple regression analysis revealed that PTSD was positively associated with turnover intention, and supervisor support had a strong buffering effect. Conclusion/Application to Practice: These findings confirmed that after a fatal infectious disease outbreak like MERS, nurses experience high level of PTSD and show high intention to leave. Organizational strategies to help nurses to cope with stress and to prevent turnover intention, especially using supervisor support, would be beneficial.","Jung, Heeja; Jung, Sun Young; Lee, Mi Hyang; Kim, Mi Sun",Workplace Health Saf,118,5

RESULTS: Clinically, there were pyrexia, oculonasal discharge, diarrhea, anemia, leukopenia, and increased pro-oxidants in the unvaccinated goats, while moderate neutrophilia and leukocytosis were observed in PPRV and bacterin vaccinated goats. Two unvaccinated goats were weak and euthanized at 13 and 28 days PI. The goats vaccinated with PPRV and Mh showed better response clinically and biochemically. CONCLUSION: The mucosal vaccination of goats with PPRV vaccine and bacterine will protect against exposure and culminate in the development of protective mucosal, humoral, and cell-mediated immune responses. This vaccination strategy will provide framework needed in the prevention and control of endemic caprine pneumonia in Nigeria.","Jarikre, Theophilus Aghogho; Taiwo, Jeremiah Olalekan; Emikpe, Benjamin Obukowho; Akpavie, Stephen Owarioro",Vet World,118,24

This internet-based nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted between April 30 and May 13, 2020. The participants were 1,200 caregivers of children aged 3–14 years. Child health issues were categorized into “at least one” or “none” according to caregivers’ perception. Caregivers’ mental status was assessed using the Japanese version of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-6. The association between caregivers’ mental status and child health issues was analyzed using logistic regression models. Among the participants, 289 (24.1%) had moderate and 352 (29.3%) had severe mental distress and 69.8% of children in their care had health issues. The number of caregivers with mental distress was more than double that reported during the 2016 national survey. After adjusting for covariates, child health issues increased among caregivers with moderate mental distress (odds ratio 2.24, 95% confidence interval 1.59–3.16) and severe mental distress (odds ratio 3.05, 95% confidence interval 2.17–4.29) compared with caregivers with no mental distress. The results highlight parents’ psychological stress during the pandemic, suggesting the need for adequate parenting support. However, our study did not consider risk factors of caregivers’ mental distress such as socioeconomic background. There is an urgent need for further research to identify vulnerable populations and children’s needs to develop sustainable social support programs for those affected by the outbreak.","Horiuchi, Sayaka; Shinohara, Ryoji; Otawa, Sanae; Akiyama, Yuka; Ooka, Tadao; Kojima, Reiji; Yokomichi, Hiroshi; Miyake, Kunio; Yamagata, Zentaro",PLoS One,118,6

They frequently occur between related host species and often rely on the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species. To investigate genetic changes in novel hosts, we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA virus (Drosophila C Virus) in 19 different species of Drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral genomes. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution, where viral lineages from the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species. When we compared viruses that had evolved in different host species, we found that parallel genetic changes were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related. This suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species. This may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species, and may mean that when a new pathogen appears in a given species, closely related species may become vulnerable to the new disease.","Longdon, Ben; Day, Jonathan P; Alves, Joel M; Smith, Sophia CL; Houslay, Thomas M; McGonigle, John E; Tagliaferri, Lucia; Jiggins, Francis M",bioRxiv,118,32

In this exploitation, viruses promote their own replication by suppressing the host antiviral response and by inducing changes in host biosynthetic processes, often with extremely small genomes of their own. In the review, we discuss the phenomenon of histone mimicry by viral proteins and how this mimicry allows the virus to dial in to the cell’s transcriptional processes and establish a cell state that promotes infection. We suggest that histone mimicry is part of a broader viral strategy to use intrinsic protein disorder as a means to overcome the size limitations of its own genome and to maximize its impact on host protein networks. In particular, we discuss how intrinsic protein disorder may enable viral proteins to interfere with phase-separated host protein condensates, including those that contribute to chromatin-mediated control of gene expression.","Tarakhovsky, Alexander; Prinjha, Rab K.",J Exp Med,118,1

Clinically, patients present with cough, fever, and dyspnea. A distinction is made between idiopathic or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) and secondary organizing pneumonia (OP). In COP, neither clinical/radiological nor histological causes can be determined. It is classified as an interstitial idiopathic pneumonia (IIP) according to the criteria of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). Secondary organizing pneumonia has a known triggering mechanism, such as infectious agents, certain medications, or concomitant symptoms of other primary pulmonary diseases and diseases of other organ systems. Common to both forms is the histological picture of intra-alveolar mesenchymal buds. These are myofibroblast proliferates that branch out along the alveolar spaces. They are usually accompanied by a moderate interstitial and alveolar, chronic, and macrophage-rich inflammatory cell infiltrate. The most important differential diagnosis is common interstitial pneumonia (UIP). It also shows fibroblast proliferates, which are, however, located in the interstitium. The correct classification of an IIP as a COP by means of clinical, radiological, and histological findings is essential, since the COP, in contrast to the UIP, responds very well to corticosteroids and therefore has an excellent prognosis compared to the UIP. The course of secondary organizing pneumonia depends on the respective underlying disease. Here it is important for the pathologist to correctly identify potential accompanying histological characteristics in order to be able to provide clues to a possible cause of OP.","Krupar, Rosemarie; Kümpers, Christiane; Haenel, Alexander; Perner, Sven; Stellmacher, Florian",Pathologe,118,26

Vitamin D (in its “parent” form, cholecalciferol) has been proposed in the pharmacological management of COVID-19 by various sources. We aimed to determine whether COVID-19 mortality was affected by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, vitamin D status, or cholecalciferol therapy, and to elucidate any other predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were opportunistically recruited from three UK hospitals, and their data were collected retrospectively. Logistic regression was used to determine any relationships between COVID-19 mortality and potential predictors, including 25(OH)D levels and cholecalciferol booster therapy. A total of 986 participants with COVID-19 were studied, of whom 151 (16.0%) received cholecalciferol booster therapy. In the primary cohort of 444 patients, cholecalciferol booster therapy was associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality, following adjustment for potential confounders (OR(adj) 0.13, 95% CI 0.05–0.35, p < 0.001). This finding was replicated in a validation cohort of 541 patients (OR(adj) 0.38, 95% CI 0.17–0.84, p = 0.018). In this observational study, treatment with cholecalciferol booster therapy, regardless of baseline serum 25(OH)D levels, appears to be associated with a reduced risk of mortality in acute in-patients admitted with COVID-19.

However, vaccine escape variants might arise leading to a re-emergence of COVID. In anticipation of such a scenario, the identification of repurposed drugs that stop SARS-CoV-2 replication could have enormous utility in stemming the disease. Here, using a nano-luciferase tagged version of the virus (SARS-CoV-2- DOrf7a-NLuc) to quantitate viral load, we evaluated a range of human cell types for their ability to be infected and support replication of the virus, and performed a screen of 1971 FDA-approved drugs. Hepatocytes, kidney glomerulus, and proximal tubule cells were particularly effective in supporting SARS-CoV-2 replication, which is in- line with reported proteinuria and liver damage in patients with COVID-19. We identified 35 drugs that reduced viral replication in Vero and human hepatocytes when treated prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection and found amodiaquine, atovaquone, bedaquiline, ebastine, LY2835219, manidipine, panobinostat, and vitamin D3 to be effective in slowing SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells when used to treat infected cells.

To deal with this complexity, and to realize Precision Medicine of stroke, mathematical models are needed.

Since these three approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses, a hybrid modelling approach combining them would be the most beneficial. However, no concrete approach ready to be implemented for a specific disease has been presented to date. In this paper, we both review the strengths and weaknesses of the three approaches, and propose a roadmap for hybrid modelling in the case of stroke care. We focus on two main tasks needed for the clinical setting: a) For stroke risk calculation, we propose a new two-step approach, where non-linear mixed effects models and bioinformatic network models yield biomarkers which are used as input to a machine learning model and b) For simulation of care scenarios, we propose a new four-step approach, which revolves around iterations between simulations of the mechanistic models and imputations of non-modelled or non-measured variables.

GISAID clade variation analysis in the period March 2020–February 2021 (period I) and March 2021–first week of April 2021 (period II) showed a rapid variation of SARS-CoV-2 in all continents and India over time.

In the first wave, India registered quite a low number of COVID-19-positive cases/million people, but the scenario unexpectedly changed in the second wave, when even over 400,000 confirmed cases/day were reported. Lineage analysis in India showed the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, i.e., B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2, during April–May 2021, which might be one of the key reasons for the sudden upsurge of confirmed cases/day. Furthermore, the emergence of the new variants contributed to the shift in infection spread by the G clade of SARS-CoV-2 from 46% in period II to 82.34% by the end of May 2021. Along with the management of the emergence of new variants, few factors viz., lockdown and vaccination were also accountable for controlling the upsurge of new COVID-19 cases throughout the country.

We observed that 15 minutes of incubation at 65°C completely inactivates high titer viral stocks. Complete inactivation was also achieved with minimal amounts of UV power (70,000 μJ/cm2), which is 100-fold less power than comparable studies. Once validated, the two methods were then compared for viral RNA quantification, virion purification, and antibody recognition. We observed that UV irradiation resulted in a 2-log reduction of detectable genomes compared to heat inactivation.

The study utilizes the framework of mobility to locate the stage of embodied skill acquisition of the participants within the online learning space and illuminates the possibilities offered by this paradigm within the context of higher education. Some of the insights gained through the study include a changing perception of the conventional built classroom space, a notable preference towards a complete online or offline mode as opposed to the hybrid mode, and a transition towards self-directed learning.

Therefore, the development of a rapid and simple method for on-site detection of SARS-CoV is crucial for the identification and prevention of future SARS outbreaks. In this study, a simple colorimetric and multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed to rapid screening of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It can be visually detected based on color change and monitored in real-time with fluorescent signals. The performance of this assay, based on six primers targeting open reading frame (ORF1b) and nucleocapsid (N) genes located in different regions of the SARS-CoV, was compared with real-time RT-PCR assay using various concentrations of target genes. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was comparable to that of real-time RT-PCR assay and therefore a few target RNA to 10(4)-10(5) copies could be detected within a short period of time (20–25 min). In addition, we established a multiplex real-time LAMP assay to simultaneously detect two target regions within the SARS-CoV genome. Two target sequences were amplified by specific primers in the same reaction tube and revealed that it was able to detect down to 10(5) copies. The standard curve had a linear relationship with similar amplification efficiencies. The LAMP assay results in shorter “sample-to-answer” time than conventional PCR method.

METHODS: As part of a quality improvement initiative, a 12-component questionnaire to burn patients awaiting reconstructive surgery at a single ABA verified Burn Center during COVID-19 was conducted. Responses regarding willingness to undergo reconstruction during COVID-19, perceived medical and personal impacts of COVID-19, and perspectives on telehealth were gathered. Surveys were administered over the phone in English and Spanish to burn patients or to primary caregivers in the case of pediatric patients. RESULTS: We surveyed 23 participants who met our inclusion criteria. Average age was 23 and 43% were male. We found 22 (96%) patients were willing to undergo reconstruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Table 1 outlines the responses to questions regarding telehealth and being a burn patient during COVID-19. Examples of stressors experienced by patients and their families due to COVID-19 included: inability to communicate with healthcare providers in person, increased anxiety in public places, delayed surgical care, and interruption of physical or occupational therapy. Family members in 5 out of the 8 Spanish speaking households lost their job due to COVID-19, resulting in financial stress for the burn patient. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients expressed strong desires to return to surgical and therapy care delayed by COVID-19. Patients reported feeling especially vulnerable as burn patients and cited receiving healthcare and financial stressors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as the main causes.

Several single center reports suggest higher morbidity and mortality among candidates waitlisted for a kidney transplant as well as recipients of a kidney transplant. We aim to describe 2020 mortality patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States among kidney transplant candidates and recipients. Design, Setting, Participants, and Measurements : Using national registry data for waitlisted candidates and kidney transplant recipients collected through April 23, 2021, we report demographic and clinical factors associated with COVID-19 related mortality in 2020, other deaths in 2020 and deaths in 2019 among waitlisted candidates and transplant recipients . We quantify excess all-cause deaths among candidate and recipient populations in 2020 as well as deaths directly attributed to COVID-19 in relation to pre-pandemic mortality patterns in 2019 and 2018. Results : Among waitlisted patient deaths in 2020, 11% of deaths were attributed to COVID-19, and these candidates were more likely to be male, obese, and belong to a racial/ethnic minority group. Nearly 1 in 6 deaths (16%) among active transplant recipients in the United States in 2020 was attributed to COVID-19. Recipients who died of COVID-19 were younger, more likely to be obese, had lower educational attainment, and were more likely to belong to racial/ethnic minority groups than those who died of other causes in 2020 or 2019. We found higher overall mortality in 2020 among waitlisted candidates (24%) than among kidney transplant recipients (20%) compared to 2019. Conclusions : Our analysis demonstrates higher rates of mortality associated with COVID-19 among waitlisted candidates and kidney transplant recipients in the United States in 2020.","Mohan, Sumit; King, Kristen; Husain, S Ali; Schold, Jesse",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,118,10

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) driven smartphone apps can help alleviate such issues, allowing for in situ recordings. Implementing such an app is not trivial, necessitates strict regulatory and legal requirements, and requires short development cycles to appropriately react to abrupt changes in the pandemic. Based on an existing app framework, we developed Corona Health, an app that serves as a platform for deploying questionnaire-based studies in combination with recordings of mobile sensors. In this paper, we present the technical details of Corona Health and provide first insights into the collected data. Through collaborative efforts from experts from public health, medicine, psychology, and computer science, we released Corona Health publicly on Google Play and the Apple App Store (in July 2020) in eight languages and attracted 7290 installations so far. Currently, five studies related to physical and mental well-being are deployed and 17,241 questionnaires have been filled out. Corona Health proves to be a viable tool for conducting research related to the COVID-19 pandemic and can serve as a blueprint for future EMA-based studies. The data we collected will substantially improve our knowledge on mental and physical health states, traits and trajectories as well as its risk and protective factors over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and its diverse prevention measures.","Beierle, Felix; Schobel, Johannes; Vogel, Carsten; Allgaier, Johannes; Mulansky, Lena; Haug, Fabian; Haug, Julian; Schlee, Winfried; Holfelder, Marc; Stach, Michael; Schickler, Marc; Baumeister, Harald; Cohrdes, Caroline; Deckert, Jürgen; Deserno, Lorenz; Edler, Johanna-Sophie; Eichner, Felizitas A.; Greger, Helmut; Hein, Grit; Heuschmann, Peter; John, Dennis; Kestler, Hans A.; Krefting, Dagmar; Langguth, Berthold; Meybohm, Patrick; Probst, Thomas; Reichert, Manfred; Romanos, Marcel; Störk, Stefan; Terhorst, Yannik; Weiß, Martin; Pryss, Rüdiger",Int J Environ Res Public Health,118,26

Little is known on the sociodemographic or smoking-related traits associated with flavored cigarette use in the Asian context. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in January–March 2020 of 1123 Singaporean adult (aged 21–69 years) current smokers using a self-completed online or postal questionnaire. We used descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses to compare the answers of flavored and non-flavored cigarette users and fitted a multivariate logistic regression model to identify correlates of flavored cigarette use. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 85.2% reported ever use and 52.7% of respondents with a regular brand reported current use of flavored cigarettes. Older age 40–49 years (AOR= 0.63) age ≥50 years (AOR=0.60), Indian ethnicity (AOR=0.39), and a moderate (AOR=0.57) or high (AOR=0.34) dependence level were correlated with non-flavored cigarette use, while female gender (AOR=2.53) and a later initiation age (16–20 years: AOR=1.72; age ≥21 years: AOR=2.19) were correlated with flavored cigarette use. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with findings from other countries, flavored cigarette use in Singapore is associated with being younger in age, female, of a certain ethnicity (Malay or Chinese), and having a lower nicotine dependence level.","van der Eijk, Yvette; Ng, Xian Yi; Lee, Jeong Kyu",Tob Induc Dis,118,24

The aim of this study is to examine the opinion that specific demographic groups have about COVID-19 vaccination, in order to detect potential fears and reasons for negative attitudes towards vaccination, and to gain knowledge on how to prepare strategies to eliminate possible misinformation that could affect vaccine hesitancy. The data collection approach was based on online questionnaire surveys, divided into three groups of questions that followed the main postulates of the health belief theory—a theory that helps understanding a behaviour of the public in some concrete surrounding in receiving preventive measures. Ordinary least squares regression analyses were used to examine the influence of individual factors on refusing the vaccine, and to provide information on the perception of participants on the danger of COVID-19 infection, and on potential barriers that could retard the vaccine utility. There was an equal proportion of participants (total number 276) who planned on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (37%), and of those who did not (36.3%). The rest (26.7%) of participants were still indecisive. Our results indicated that attitudes on whether to receive the vaccine, on how serious consequences might be if getting the infection, as well as a suspicious towards the vaccine efficacy and the fear of the vaccine potential side effects, may depend on participants’ age (<40 vs. >40 years) and on whether they are healthcare workers or not. The barriers that make participants‘ unsure about of receiving the vaccine, such as a distrust in the vaccine efficacy and safety, may vary in different socio-demographic groups and depending on which is the point of time in the course of the pandemic development, as well as on the vaccine availability and experience in using certain vaccine formulas. There is a pressing need for health services to continuously provide information to the general population, and to address the root causes of mistrust through improved communication, using a wide range of policies, interventions and technologies.","Guljaš, Silva; Bosnić, Zvonimir; Salha, Tamer; Berecki, Monika; Krivdić Dupan, Zdravka; Rudan, Stjepan; Majnarić Trtica, Ljiljana",Int J Environ Res Public Health,118,6

Currently, vaccination against IBV is only partially protective; therefore, better preventions and treatments are needed. Plants produce antimicrobial secondary compounds, which may be a source for novel anti-viral drugs. Non-cytotoxic, crude ethanol extracts of Rhodiola rosea roots, Nigella sativa seeds, and Sambucus nigra fruit were tested for anti-IBV activity, since these safe, widely used plant tissues contain polyphenol derivatives that inhibit other viruses. RESULTS: Dose–response cytotoxicity curves on Vero cells using trypan blue staining determined the highest non-cytotoxic concentrations of each plant extract. To screen for IBV inhibition, cells and virus were pretreated with extracts, followed by infection in the presence of extract. Viral cytopathic effect was assessed visually following an additional 24 h incubation with extract. Cells and supernatants were harvested separately and virus titers were quantified by plaque assay. Variations of this screening protocol determined the effects of a number of shortened S. nigra extract treatments. Finally, S. nigra extract-treated virions were visualized by transmission electron microscopy with negative staining. Virus titers from infected cells treated with R. rosea and N. sativa extracts were not substantially different from infected cells treated with solvent alone. However, treatment with S. nigra extracts reduced virus titers by four orders of magnitude at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in a dose-responsive manner. Infection at a low MOI reduced viral titers by six orders of magnitude and pretreatment of virus was necessary, but not sufficient, for full virus inhibition. Electron microscopy of virions treated with S. nigra extract showed compromised envelopes and the presence of membrane vesicles, which suggested a mechanism of action. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that S. nigra extract can inhibit IBV at an early point in infection, probably by rendering the virus non-infectious. They also suggest that future studies using S. nigra extract to treat or prevent IBV or other coronaviruses are warranted.","Chen, Christie; Zuckerman, David M; Brantley, Susanna; Sharpe, Michka; Childress, Kevin; Hoiczyk, Egbert; Pendleton, Amanda R",BMC Vet Res,118,16

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate if obesity is a risk factor for the presence of long-term post-COVID symptoms in hospitalised COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: A multicentre case-control study including patients hospitalised during the first wave of the pandemic was performed. Patients with obesity were recruited as cases. Two age- and sex-matched patients without obesity per case were considered as controls. Clinical and hospitalisation data were collected from the hospital medical records. Patients were scheduled for a telephonic interview. A list of post-COVID symptoms was systematically evaluated, but participants were free to report any symptom. Anxiety/depressive levels and sleep quality were evaluated with the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), respectively. RESULTS: Overall, 88 patients with obesity and 176 without obesity were assessed 7.2 months after the hospital discharge. The most prevalent post-COVID symptoms were fatigue and dyspnea. No significant difference in the prevalence of fatigue, dyspnea, anxiety, depression and limitations of daily living activities was observed between people with and without obesity. Obesity was independently associated with a greater number of post-COVID symptoms (IRR 1.56, 95% CI 1.24-1.95, P < .001) and poor sleep quality (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.13-3.83, P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that obesity was associated with a greater number of long-term post-COVID symptoms and poor sleep quality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients.","Fernández-de-Las-Peñas, César; Torres-Macho, Juan; Elvira-Martínez, Carlos M; Molina-Trigueros, Luis J; Sebastián-Viana, Tomas; Hernández-Barrera, Valentín",Int J Clin Pract,118,16

Hospitalized patients of COVID-19 suffer from a high mortality rate, motivating the development of convenient and practical methods that allow clinicians to promptly identify high-risk patients. Here, we have developed a risk score using clinical data from 1479 inpatients admitted to Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China (development cohort) and externally validated with data from two other centers: 141 inpatients from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China (validation cohort 1) and 432 inpatients from The Third People’s Hospital of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China (validation cohort 2). The risk score is based on three biomarkers that are readily available in routine blood samples and can easily be translated into a probability of death. The risk score can predict the mortality of individual patients more than 12 d in advance with more than 90% accuracy across all cohorts. Moreover, the Kaplan–Meier score shows that patients can be clearly differentiated upon admission as low, intermediate, or high risk, with an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.9551. In summary, a simple risk score has been validated to predict death in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); it has also been validated in independent cohorts.","Yuan, Ye; Sun, Chuan; Tang, Xiuchuan; Cheng, Cheng; Mombaerts, Laurent; Wang, Maolin; Hu, Tao; Sun, Chenyu; Guo, Yuqi; Li, Xiuting; Xu, Hui; Ren, Tongxin; Xiao, Yang; Xiao, Yaru; Zhu, Hongling; Wu, Honghan; Li, Kezhi; Chen, Chuming; Liu, Yingxia; Liang, Zhichao; Cao, Zhiguo; Zhang, Hai-Tao; Ch.

METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants received low-dose vaccine, middle-dose vaccine or placebo. Prime-booster regimens were given intramuscularly 56 days apart. ELISA antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and pseudovirus neutralising antibodies were detected. Adverse events were monitored for 28 days following each vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 430 participants were enrolled in the study, with 30 participants aged 18-55 years (MID cohort), 250 participants aged 56 years and older (OLD cohort), and 150 participants aged 6-17 years (MIN cohort). Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine induced significant RBD-specific ELISA antibodies which decreased with increasing age, with geometric mean titres (GMTs) of 1037.5 in MIN cohort, 647.2 in MID cohort, and 338.0 in OLD cohort receiving 5×10 10 viral particles on day 28 following boost vaccination. Pseudovirus neutralising antibodies showed a similar pattern, with GMTs of 168.0 in MIN cohort, 76.8 in MID cohort, and 79.7 in OLD cohort. A single dose in children and adolescents induced higher antibody responses than that elicited by two doses in adults, with GMTs of 1091.6 and 96.6 in ELISA antibody and neutralising antibody, respectively.

OCPs have many other labeled non-contraceptive indications, and as a result there is an associated risk of improper use, as with any other medications. This study was designed to assess the unforeseen improper uses of OCPs observed by community pharmacists in Jordan. METHOD: A cross-sectional study design was conducted using a self-administered survey. A convenience sample (n = 380) of Jordanian community pharmacists, were recruited through social media resources. The survey included multiple-choice and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics and correlation analyses were completed using SPSS. RESULTS: More than half of the recruited pharmacists (55.3%) were female, and the mean age of the participants was 32.58 ± 9.94. The majority of the pharmacists (85%) had good knowledge about the non-contraceptive indications of OCPs. About 53% of them confirmed their exposure to cases of the improper use of OCPs. About 67.5% of the pharmacists who confirmed exposure to such cases, reported the topical use of OCPs for the enhancement of hair growth. Around 15% of those pharmacists stated that OCPs were used to give negative results for addictive drug screening tests. In the event that the pharmacists suspected improper use, more than 90% suggested they would refrain from dispensing the pills. CONCLUSION: This study has spotlighted many unforeseen uses of OCPs in Jordan and highlighted the need for restricted national regulations on the monitoring of OCP prescription/selling patterns in Jordan by policymakers. Moreover, there is a need for the establishment of national educational programs for the Jordanian community regarding the safe proper use of OCPs.","Barakat, Muna; Al-Qudah, Raja’a; Akour, Amal; Al-Qudah, Najem; Dallal Bashi, Yahya H.",PLoS One,118,24

The results allow prediction of the magnitude of cases which this endoscopic service might witness in the next months and planning of future actions accordingly. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in the gastroenterology department of a large urban tertiary care medical center from October 15, 2020, to November 15, 2020. In this institution, all patients proposed for endoscopic procedures under deep sedation must be submitted to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) detection. These results were thoroughly reviewed. RESULTS: In the 1-month period, a total of 833 different procedures were done in 833 patients admitted to the endoscopy unit. Of these, 167 (20%) were submitted to nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2. Only 1 (0.6%) was positive for this infection, and her procedure was postponed. This RT-PCR-positive patient was not symptomatic for CO­VID-19 infection at the time of preprocedure screening. She had no positive contacts for COVID-19 and had not traveled outside the country. CONCLUSION: We found that the proportion of patients proposed for an endoscopic intervention who were asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 was low. However, only one fifth of patients were tested and, considering the proportion of 0.6%, it is reasonable to consider that exposure of healthcare workers and other patients can occur. So, all prevention measures must be strictly followed. However, the cost-benefit of an universal testing policy must be proven.","Correia, Catarina; Almeida, Nuno; Figueiredo, Pedro",GE Port J Gastroenterol,118,1

We examined associations of stay-at-home order (SAHO) and face-masking recommendation with COVID-19 epidemics in the USA. METHODS: In this quasi-experimental interrupted time-series study, we modeled temporal trends in daily new cases and deaths of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19 time-varying reproduction numbers in the USA between March 1 and April 20, 2020. In addition, we conducted simulation analyses. RESULTS: The number of residents under SAHO increased since March 19 and plateaued at 290,829,980 (88.6% of the U.S. population) on April 7. Trends in COVID-19 time-varying reproduction numbers peaked on March 23, further reduced on April 3, and fell below/around 1.0 on April 13. Early-implementation and early-lift of SAHO would reduce and increase COVID-19 epidemics, respectively. Multivariable piecewise log-linear regression revealed the states’ neighboring relationship with New York was linked to COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths. There were two turning points in daily new-case trend, being March 28 (slope-changes = −0.09) and April 3 (slope-changes = −0.09), which appeared to be associated with implementation of SAHO on March 28 (affecting 48.5% of the US population in 22 states and District of Columbia), and face-masking recommendation on April 3, respectively. There were also two turning points in daily new-death trend, being April 9 (slope-changes = −0.06) and April 19 (slope-changes = −0.90).

They have published a great amount of first-hand clinical data. Collecting their data and forming a large sample for analysis is more conducive to the recognition, prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in children. The epidemic prevention and control experience of Chinese pediatricians should be shared with the world. Methods By searching Chinese and English literature, the data of 406 children with COVID-19 in China were analyzed. Results It was found that the clustered incidence of children's families is a dynamic transmission feature; the incidence is low; asymptomatic infections and mild cases account for 44.8%, with only 7 cases of critical illness; laboratory examination of lymphocyte counts is not reduced, as it is for adults; chest CT findings are less severe than those for adults. These presentations are the clinical features of COVID-19 in children. Only 55 of the 406 cases were tested by anal swab for virus nucleic acid, 45 of which were positive, accounting for 81.8% of stool samples. Conclusion There are more children than adults with asymptomatic infections, milder conditions, faster recovery, and a better prognosis. Some concealed morbidity characteristics also bring difficulties to the early identification, prevention and control of COVID-19. COVID-19 screening is needed in the pediatric fever clinic, and respiratory and digestive tract nucleic acid tests should be performed. Efforts should be made to prevent children from becoming a hidden source of transmission in kindergartens, schools or families. Furthermore, China's experience in treating COVID-19 in children has led to faster recovery of sick children.","Zhen-Dong, Yang; Gao-Jun, Zhou; Run-Ming, Jin; Zhi-Sheng, Liu; Zong-Qi, Dong; Xiong, Xie; Guo-Wei, Song",J Infect,118,16

This study aimed to determine whether depletion or exclusion of rRNA can improve microarray detection and simplify its analysis. Therefore, two different rRNA depletion and exclusion protocols, RiboMinus™ technology and non-rRNA binding hexanucleotides, were applied to the microarray sample processing and the outcome was compared with those of the sequence-independent amplification protocol. This study concludes that the two procedures, described to deplete or exclude rRNA, have negligible effect on the microarrays detection and analysis and might only in combination with further techniques result in a significant enhancement of sensitivity.
