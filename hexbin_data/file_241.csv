831,Feline Immunodeficiency Virus in South America,2012-03-14,"The rapid emergence of AIDS in humans during the period between 1980 and 2000 has led to extensive efforts to understand more fully similar etiologic agents of chronic and progressive acquired immunodeficiency disease in several mammalian species. Lentiviruses that have gene sequence homology with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been found in different species (including sheep, goats, horses, cattle, cats, and several Old World monkey species). Lentiviruses, comprising a genus of the Retroviridae family, cause persistent infection that can lead to varying degrees of morbidity and mortality depending on the virus and the host species involved. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) causes an immune system disease in domestic cats (Felis catus) involving depletion of the CD4+ population of T lymphocytes, increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections, and sometimes death. Viruses related to domestic cat FIV occur also in a variety of nondomestic felids. This is a brief overview of the current state of knowledge of this large and ancient group of viruses (FIVs) in South America.","Teixeira, Bruno M.; Hagiwara, Mitika K.; Cruz, Juliano C.

928,"Pip6-PMO, A New Generation of Peptide-oligonucleotide Conjugates With Improved Cardiac Exon Skipping Activity for DMD Treatment",2012-08-14,"Antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) are currently the most promising therapeutic intervention for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). AOs modulate dystrophin pre-mRNA splicing, thereby specifically restoring the dystrophin reading frame and generating a truncated but semifunctional dystrophin protein. Challenges in the development of this approach are the relatively poor systemic AO delivery and inefficient dystrophin correction in affected non-skeletal muscle tissues, including the heart. We have previously reported impressive heart activity including high-splicing efficiency and dystrophin restoration following a single administration of an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide (CPPs) conjugated to a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO): Pip5e-PMO. However, the mechanisms underlying this activity are poorly understood. Here, we report studies involving single dose administration (12.5 mg/kg) of derivatives of Pip5e-PMO, consecutively assigned as Pip6-PMOs. These peptide-PMOs comprise alterations to the central hydrophobic core of the Pip5e peptide and illustrate that certain changes to the peptide sequence improves its activity; however, partial deletions within the hydrophobic core abolish its efficiency. Our data indicate that the hydrophobic core of the Pip sequences is critical for PMO delivery to the heart and that specific modifications to this region can enhance activity further. The results have implications for therapeutic PMO development for DMD.","Betts, Corinne; Saleh, Amer F; Arzumanov, Andrey A; Hammond, Suzan M; Godfrey, Caroline; Coursindel, Thibault; Gait, Michael J; Wood, Matthew JA",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3438601/,241
2652,Fomitopsis betulina (formerly Piptoporus betulinus): the Iceman’s polypore fungus with modern biotechnological potential,2017-04-04,"Higher Basidiomycota have been used in natural medicine throughout the world for centuries. One of such fungi is Fomitopsis betulina (formerly Piptoporus betulinus), which causes brown rot of birch wood. Annual white to brownish fruiting bodies of the species can be found on trees in the northern hemisphere but F. betulina can also be cultured as a mycelium and fruiting body. The fungus has a long tradition of being applied in folk medicine as an antimicrobial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory agent. Probably due to the curative properties, pieces of its fruiting body were carried by Ötzi the Iceman. Modern research confirms the health-promoting benefits of F. betulina. Pharmacological studies have provided evidence supporting the antibacterial, anti-parasitic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective, and immunomodulating activities of F. betulina preparations. Biologically active compounds such as triterpenoids have been isolated. The mushroom is also a reservoir of valuable enzymes and other substances such as cell wall (1→3)-α-d-glucan which can be used for induction of microbial enzymes degrading cariogenic dental biofilm. In conclusion, F. betulina can be considered as a promising source for the development of new products for healthcare and other biotechnological uses.","Pleszczyńska, Małgorzata; Lemieszek, Marta K.; Siwulski, Marek; Wiater, Adrian; Rzeski, Wojciech; Szczodrak, Janusz",World J Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5380686/,241

2736,Immunobiology of Newcastle Disease Virus and Its Use for Prophylactic Vaccination in Poultry and as Adjuvant for Therapeutic Vaccination in Cancer Patients,2017-05-20,"Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most important diseases of poultry worldwide. In the last decades, molecular research has gained a lot of new information about its causative agent, newcastle disease virus (NDV). In poultry industry, certain strains of NDV have been used for preventive vaccination for more than 60 years. NDV has also been applied to cancer patients with beneficial effects for about 50 years, but this is less well known. The molecular basis for these differential effects of NDV in birds and man have been elucidated in the last decades and are explained in this review. The anti-neoplastic and immune-stimulatory properties in non-permissive hosts such as mouse and man have to do with the strong type I interferon responses induced in these foreign species. Additionally, NDV has the potential to break various types of tumor resistances and also to affect liver fibrosis. A main section is devoted to the benefits of clinical application of NDV and NDV-based vaccines to cancer patients. Reverse genetics technology allowed developing NDV into a vector suitable for gene therapy. Examples will be provided in which genetically engineered NDV is being used successfully as vector against new emerging viruses.","Schirrmacher, Volker",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5455011/,241
2761,Sugar-Binding Profiles of Chitin-Binding Lectins from the Hevein Family: A Comprehensive Study,2017-05-30,"Chitin-binding lectins form the hevein family in plants, which are defined by the presence of single or multiple structurally conserved GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine)-binding domains. Although they have been used as probes for chito-oligosaccharides, their detailed specificities remain to be investigated. In this study, we analyzed six chitin-binding lectins, DSA, LEL, PWM, STL, UDA, and WGA, by quantitative frontal affinity chromatography. Some novel features were evident: WGA showed almost comparable affinity for pyridylaminated chitotriose and chitotetraose, while LEL and UDA showed much weaker affinity, and DSA, PWM, and STL had no substantial affinity for the former. WGA showed selective affinity for hybrid-type N-glycans harboring a bisecting GlcNAc residue. UDA showed extensive binding to high-mannose type N-glycans, with affinity increasing with the number of Man residues. DSA showed the highest affinity for highly branched N-glycans consisting of type II LacNAc (N-acetyllactosamine). Further, multivalent features of these lectins were investigated by using glycoconjugate and lectin microarrays. The lectins showed substantial binding to immobilized LacNAc as well as chito-oligosaccharides, although the extents to which they bound varied among them. WGA showed strong binding to heavily sialylated glycoproteins. The above observations will help interpret lectin-glycoprotein interactions in histochemical studies and glyco-biomarker investigations.","Itakura, Yoko; Nakamura-Tsuruta, Sachiko; Kominami, Junko; Tateno, Hiroaki; Hirabayashi, Jun",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5485984/,241
2826,"Evaluation of control measures for bovine viral diarrhea implemented in Nemuro District, Hokkaido, Japan, using a scenario tree model",2017-05-25,"A scenario tree model was developed to propose efficient bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) control measures. The model used field data in eastern Hokkaido where the risk of BVDV infection in cattle has been reduced by an eradication program including mass vaccination, individual tests prior to communal pasture grazing, herd screening tests using bulk milk, and outbreak investigations of newly infected herds. These four activities were then used as hypothesized control measures in the simulation. In each simulation, the numbers of cattle infected persistently and transiently with BVDV detected by clinical manifestations and diagnosis tests and of missed by all of the diagnosis tests were calculated, and the numbers were used as indicators to be compared for the efficacy of the control measures. The model outputs indicated that the adoption of mass vaccination decreased the number of missed BVD cattle, although it did not increase the number of detected BVD cattle. Under implementation of mass vaccination, the efficacy of individual tests on selected 20% of the young and adult cattle was equal to that of the herd screening test performed in all the herds. When the virus prevalence or the number of sensitive animals becomes low, the efficacy of herd screening test was superior to one of individual tests. Considering the model outputs together, the scenario tree model developed in the present study was useful to compare the efficacy of the control measures for BVD.","ISODA, Norikazu; ASANO, Akihiro; ICHIJO, Michiru; WAKAMORI, Shiho; OHNO, Hiroshi; SATO, Kazuhiko; OKAMOTO, Hirokazu; NAKAO, Shigeru; KATO, Hajime; SAITO, Kazuma; ITO, Naoki; USUI, Akira; TAKAYAMA, Hiroaki; SAKODA, Yoshihiro",J Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5559360/,241
2892,Efficacy of Antiviral Drugs against Feline Immunodeficiency Virus,2015-12-18,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is one of the most common infectious agents affecting cats worldwide .FIV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) share many properties: both are lifelong persistent lentiviruses that are similar genetically and morphologically and both viruses propagate in T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and neural cells. Experimentally infected cats have measurable immune suppression, which sometimes progresses to an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A transient initial state of infection is followed by a long latent stage with low virus replication and absence of clinical signs. In the terminal stage, both viruses can cause severe immunosuppression. Thus, FIV infection in cats has become an important natural model for studying HIV infection in humans, especially for evaluation of antiviral compounds. Of particular importance for chemotherapeutic studies is the close similarity between the reverse transcriptase (RT) of FIV and HIV, which results in high in vitro susceptibility of FIV to many RT-targeted antiviral compounds used in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. Thus, the aim of this article is to provide an up-to-date review of studies on antiviral treatment of FIV, focusing on commercially available compounds for human or animal use.","Hartmann, Katrin; Wooding, Anita; Bergmann, Michèle",Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5644647/,241
3363,Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukaemia virus in client-owned cats in New Zealand,2017-09-19,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to collect baseline data on the occurrence, testing and vaccination practices, and clinical outcomes of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in New Zealand METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 423 veterinary practices in New Zealand was performed to collect data on FeLV and FIV testing and vaccination during the 2015 calendar year. Clinical records from 572 cats tested using a point-of-care ELISA at a first-opinion veterinary practice between 7 April 2010 and 23 June 2016 were also obtained and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify risk factors for test positivity. Survival times were estimated using Kaplan–Meier methods. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 112 clinics (26.4%) of which 72 performed in-house testing. Of the 2125 tests performed, 56 (2.6%) were positive for FeLV and 393 (18.5%) were positive for FIV. Fewer than 1% of cats were vaccinated for FeLV, with veterinarians citing low perceived prevalence as the primary reason for not vaccinating. Being male compared with being female and having clinical evidence of immunosuppression were significant risk factors for both FeLV and FIV test positivity. The median survival times of FeLV and FIV test-positive cats were 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 0–16) and 650 days (95% CI 431–993), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Testing and vaccination for FeLV and FIV in New Zealand appears targeted towards high-risk animals, which may bias prevalence estimates. Baseline data should be monitored for changes in FeLV epidemiology now commercial vaccines are no longer available.","Luckman, Claire; Gates, M Carolyn",JFMS Open Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125856/,241
4157,Characterisation of Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells as mesenchymal in phenotype,2019-12-11,"The Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney Cell (CRFK) is an immortalised cell line derived from the feline kidney that is utilised for the growth of certain vaccinal viruses. Confusion exists as to whether CRFK are epithelial or mesenchymal in phenotype. The aim of this study was to characterise CRFK cells via immunofluorescence, enzyme cytochemistry, western blotting, RT-qPCR for S100A4 and comparison to primary feline proximal tubular epithelial cells (FPTEC) and feline cortical fibroblasts (FCF). CRFK cells were of fusiform morphology and appeared similar to FCF. CRFK expressed the mesenchymal intermediate filament (IF) protein vimentin together with two cell adhesion molecules associated with feline fibroblasts (CD29 and CD44), and lacked expression of the epithelial IF cytokeratin, myogenic IF desmin and endothelial marker von Willebrand factor (vWF). In addition, CRFK did not demonstrate brush border enzyme activity typical of FPTEC. S100A4 gene expression, implicated in both neoplastic transformation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, was highly upregulated in CRFK in comparison to the primary feline renal cells. CRFK appear phenotypically similar to fibroblasts, rather than tubular epithelial cells, and may have undergone neoplastic transformation or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition after extensive passaging. This finding may have potential implications for future research utilising this cell line.","Lawson, J.S.; Syme, H.M.; Wheeler-Jones, C.P.D.; Elliott, J.",Res Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6863388/,241

Four weeks after heat treatment, we observed, in addition to normally remyelinated axons, a few aberrantly remyelinated axons which had both CNS-and PNS-type myelin sheaths: the CNS-type myelin sheaths were always situated inside the PNS-type sheaths. This finding indicates that in some conditions Schwann cells can form myelin sheaths around those formed by oligodendrocytes.","Sasaki, M.; Ide, C.",Acta Neuropathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086550/,241

5400,Feline Immunodeficiency Virus and Puma Lentivirus in Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi): Epidemiology and Diagnostic Issues,2006,"By using the ‘acidotropic’ vital dye, Acridine Orange, we have found that the presynaptic terminals of rod and cone photoreceptors in retinas ofRana pipiens maintain a low pH relative to the surrounding medium through an energy dependent mechanism. When this pH is raised, by exposing the retinas to weak bases like ammonium chloride, the terminals exhibit large, membrane-delimited compartments, many of which accumulate endocytic tracers. This effect is partly reversed when the weak bases are removed. We infer that among the acidified structures within the terminals are endocytic compartments with at least some of the characteristics of the endosomes that participate in receptor-mediated endocytosis in other cell types. One role of these structures in the terminals may be in the recycling of synaptic vesicles.","Sulzer, D.; Holtzman, E.",J Neurocytol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089201/,241

However, the use of these ACE inhibitors, which were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, is hampered by common side effects. Moreover, we now know that ACE actually consists of two parts (called the N- and C-domains) that have different functions. Therefore, the design of specific domain-selective ACE inhibitors is expected to produce next-generation drugs that might be safer and more effective. Here we discuss the structural features of current inhibitors and outline how next-generation ACE inhibitors could be designed by using the three-dimensional molecular structure of human testis ACE. The ACE structure provides a unique opportunity for rational drug design, based on a combination of in silico modelling using existing inhibitors as scaffolds and iterative lead optimization to drive the synthetic chemistry.","Acharya, K.

7259,A conserved OmpA-like protein in Legionella pneumophila required for efficient intracellular replication,2016-07-14,"High-tech biomedical advances have led to increases both in the number of mice used for research and in exchanges of mice and/or their tissues between institutions. The latter are associated with the risk of dissemination of infectious agents. Because of the lack of international standardization of health surveillance programs, health certificates for imported rodents may be informative but may not address the needs of the importing facility. Preservation of mouse germ-plasm is achieved by cryopreservation of spermatozoa, embryos, or ovaries, and embryonic stem cells are used for the production of genetically engineered mice. After embryo transfer, recipients and rederived pups that test negative in microbiological screening for relevant microorganisms are released into full barrier holding areas. However, current research shows that embryos may also transmit microorganisms, especially viruses, to the recipient mice. In this article, we discuss regulations and practical issues in the shipping of live mice and mouse tissues, including spermatozoa, embryos, ovaries, and embryonic stem cells, and review work on microbial contamination of these biological materials. In addition, we present ways to reduce the risk of transmission of pathogens to mice under routine conditions.","Mahabir, Esther; Bauer, Beth; Schmidt, Jörg",ILAR J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108542/,241
7343,Computer simulations of protein–membrane systems,2020-02-26,"Inflammation is a prominent feature of several disorders characterized by primary demyelination, but it is not clear whether a relationship exists between inflammation and myelin damage. We have found that substantial demyelination results from the focal inflammatory lesion caused by the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 200 ng) directly into the rat dorsal funiculus. Within 24 h, such injections caused a focal inflammatory response consisting of a substantial number of polymorphonuclear cells and ED1-positive and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-positive macrophages/microglia. The number of inflammatory cells was substantially reduced by day 7. OX-52-positive T-cells were less frequently observed but were present in the meninges at 8 h, reached a maximum in the dorsal funiculus at 7 days, and were rare at 14 days. The inflammation was followed by the appearance of a large lesion of primary demyelination that encompassed up to ∼75% of the cross-sectional area of the dorsal funiculus. Treatment with dexamethasone significantly reduced the number of cells expressing iNOS, but did not prevent the demyelination. By 28 days the lesions were largely remyelinated, usually by Schwann cells. These changes were not observed in control, saline-injected animals. We conclude that the intraspinal injection of LPS results in inflammation and subsequently in prominent demyelination. The mechanisms underlying the demyelination are not clear, but it is notable that it typically begins with disruption of the adaxonal myelin. Indeed, there is an early loss of myelin-associated glycoprotein within the lesion, despite the persistence of proteolipid protein. This combination is a feature of the pattern III lesion recently described in multiple sclerosis (Lucchinetti et al., 2000), and we therefore suggest that LPS-induced demyelination may serve as the first experimental model available for the study of this type of multiple sclerosis lesion.","Felts, Paul A.; Woolston, Anne-Marie; Fernando, Himali B.; Asquith, Stephen; Gregson, Norman A.; Mizzi, Oliver J.; Smith, Kenneth J.",Brain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109778/,241

7641,Animal immunodeficiency viruses,2002-11-13,"Antigenic differences between European and American isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were revealed by serologic analysis of a recombinant protein derived from PRRSV open reading frame 3 (ORF 3). The hydrophilic carboxyterminal 199 amino acids encoded by the ORF 3 of a European (Lelystad) isolate of PRRSV were expressed as a recombinant fusion protein (BP03-P) in a baculovirus gene expression system. Sera from gnotobiotic swine exposed to prototypic reference European and American isolates of PRRSV and sera from conventionally reared European and American swine convalescing from naturally acquired PRRSV infections were used to characterize the BP03-P protein. Sera from gnotobiotic and conventionally reared swine exposed to European isolates of PRRSV were significantly more reactive (P < 0.01) with BP03-P than were the corresponding American PRRSV antisera using the indirect immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). Prototypic European, but not American, PRRSV antisera also recognized BP03-P using western immunoblotting and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) procedures. However, gnotobiotically derived antiserum to an atypical American-origin PRRSV was reactive with BP03-P by both IPMA and western immunoblot. Despite a predicted potential for N-linked glycosylation, studies with tunicamycin and peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) indicated that BP03-P was not N-glycosylated in either insect cell cultures or Trichoplusia ni larvae infected with the recombinant baculovirus. Sera from rabbits inoculated with BP03-P failed to neutralize both the European (Lelystad) and American (ATCC VR-2332) reference isolates of PRRSV and did not react by IPMA with PRRSV-infected cell cultures. Taken together, the data suggest that the carboxyterminal portion of PRRSV ORF 3 encodes a non-neutralizing viral peptide that is partially responsible for the serologic differences noted between European and most American isolates of PRRSV.","Katz, Jonathan B.; Shafer, Amy L.; Eernisse, Kenneth A.; Landgraf, John G.; Nelson, Eric A.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117291/,241
7643,Different stabilities to bile among feline calicivirus strains of respiratory and enteric origin,1992-06-01,"We have performed molecular studies on the pig interferon (IFN) system (i) to analyse the role played by endogenous IFN in neonatal viral enteritis such as transmissible gastroenteritis and possibly to obtain, via recombinant DNA technology, a new anti-infectious and immunomodulatory agent in this species, (ii) to characterize the structure and biological functions of the IFN-like antiviral activity produced by the porcine embryo at the time implantation in the uterus. By probing porcine genomic libraries with human and porcine IFN-α probes to isolate related genes, we have shown that the porcine IFN-α multigene family included, like several other mammalian species, two subfamilies of related but distinct genes. Class I subfamily contains at least 11 loci, located on chromosome no. 1, among which nine have been cloned and two (potentially functional) sequenced. Class II subfamily, which is specifically expressed by the embryo of ruminants before implantation, contains at least seven loci among which six have been cloned. One of the sequenced class I loci: PoIFN-α1 encodes a 189 amino acids (AA) preprotein. After removal of the sequence encoding the putative signal peptide (23 N-terminal AA) this gene was inserted into an Escherichia coli bicistronic expression vector allowing intracellular synthesis of mature porcine IFN-α1 (methionyl IFN-α1). Expression of the recombinant protein was optimized by insertion of a seven base pairs long random synthetic sequence in the intercistronic region, followed by cloning in E. coli and immunodetection of clones expressing high amounts of recombinant protein. The E. coli strain obtained produced high levels of a 18 000 Da protein exhibiting the same in vitro overall biological properties as leucocyte derived porcine IFN (LeuIFN). However, it had a stronger antiviral effect on porcine cells than LeuIFN. After immunoaffinity purification to a specific activity of 5−10 × 10(7) International Units (IU)/mg of protein, pharmacokinetic and pharmacological studies were realized to determine the in vivo half life of this rIFN-α in the pig. These experiments revealed no major toxic effects in newborn (given 5 × 10(6)IU/kg) or adult (1 × 10(6)IU/kg) pigs.

7652,Characteristics of vero cytotoxin producing Escherichia coli associated with intestinal colonization and diarrhea in calves,2002-11-13,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) invades the nervous system and replicates in neurons and glial cell of the white matter during a period of severe viral induced immunosuppression. Demyelination occurs in infected white matter areas in the absence of inflammation. The mechanism of demyelination is not apparent because there is no ultrastructural evidence of viral replication in the oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells. However, brain tissue culture studies have shown that oligodendrocytes support transcription of all CDV genes and later on degenerate, although no viral proteins can be found in these cells. It remains to be shown how such a restricted infection leads to demyelination. Concomitant with immunologic recovery during the further course of the disease, inflammation occurs in the demyelinating lesions with progression of the lesions in some animals. A series of experiments in vitro suggested that chronic demyelination is due to a bystander mechanism associated with the virus-induced immune response in which antibody dependent cell-mediated reactions play an important role. The progressive, or even relapsing, course of the disease is associated with viral persistence in the nervous system. Persistence of CDV in the brain appears to be due to non-cytolytic selective spread of the virus with very limited budding. In this way CDV escapes immune surveillance.","Vandevelde, Marc; Zurbriggen, Andreas",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117369/,241

In contrast, vaccination of the mares with an inactivated, adjuvanted serotype 6 bovine rotavirus produced a heterotypic response similar to that of the homotypic response in both serum and milk, although the predominant response in serum was IgG, while in milk it was IgA. These results suggest that non serotype-restricted passive protection of foals against rotavirus may be achieved by parenteral vaccination of mares.","Browning, G.F.; Chalmers, R.M.; Sale, C.S.H.; Fitzgerald, T.A.; Snodgrass, D.R.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117508/,241

7763,Construction of a bovine-murine heteromyeloma cell line; Production of bovine monoclonal antibodies against rotavirus and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin,2002-11-12,"Antigens encoded within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are not normally expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), but can be induced by treatment with interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Other cytokines released during an inflammatory process can potentially influence MHC expression as well. One cytokine of interest is interleukin-1 (IL-1), an immunoregulatory polypeptide that is produced by macrophages and also by cells in the CNS. In this study, the effedt of IL-1β on MHC expression in a human glioblastoma multiforme cell line, U-105 MG, has been examined. Treatment of U-105 MG with 10 U IL-1β/ml for a period of 5 days resulted in a decrease in constitutive cell surface HLA class II expression and limited the induction of class II by IFN-γ. This effect was also observed on steady-state levels of class II RNA and could be neutralized with antibodies to IL-1β. All class II transcripts examined (HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP α and β) were affected. Class I expression was only marginally changed by IL-1β treatment. A minimal concentration of 1 U IL-1β/ml was required to reduce class II expression and a kinetics experiment indicated that U-105MG must be treated for at least 4 days with IL-1β for a decrease in class II expression to be observed. This study suggests that IL-1 may play a role in limiting immunoreactivity in the CNS by limiting class II induction.","Cowan, Elliot P.; Pierce, Michael L.; Dhib-Jalbut, Suhayl",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119491/,241
7787,The immunobiology of the feline leukemia virus,2002-11-12,"The molecular basis of constitutive and inducible major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene expression was studied in murine astrocytes in primary culture. Astrocytes constitutively expressed MHC class I molecules and treatment of these cells with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) further induced expression. The conserved region containing the upstream MHC class I regulatory element (MHC-CRE) and juxtaposed interferon consensus sequence (ICS) enhanced consttutive MHC class I promoter activity. As seen with cell surface expression of MHC molecules, treatment of astrocytes with IFN-γ increased MHC class I promoter activity. Inducible expression required the presence of the MHC-CRE/ICS enhancer region. Nuclear factors that bind to the MHC-CRE and ICS were constitutively expressed in cultured astrocytes and IFN-γ treatment further induced binding activity both to the MHC-CRE and ICS and correlated with induction of MHC class I gene expression. This study identifies the MHC-CRE and ICS as the major cis elements in controlling MHC class I promoter activity and suggests that the expression of nuclear factor binding activities to these enhancer elements is a basic transactivating mechanism for the expression of MHC class I genes in astrocytes.","Massa, Paul T.; Hirschfeld, Steven; Levi, Ben-Zion; Quigley, Laura A.; Ozato, Keiko; McFarlin, Dale E.",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119682/,241

We used a (51)Cr release assay to study the susceptibility of oligodendrocyte-enriched glial cells to MHC-restricted and non-restricted immune-mediated cytolysis. Mitogen-activated mononuclear cells induced significant lysis in a lectin-dependent cytotoxicity assay. Mononuclear cells allo-activated in a one-way mixed lymphocyte culture with E(−) cells from the glial cell donor induced a significantly higher degree of oligodendrocyte cytolysis than mononuclear cells activated with E(−) cells bearing MHC-class I antigens discordant with the glia. Cytolysis by alloactivated unfractionated lymphocytes and by purified CD8(+) lymphocytes was reduced by an anti-class I antibody (W6/32).

7797,Tissue chambers — a useful model for in vivo studies of cytokine production in the pig,1998-01-05,"In vitro culture conditions were determined to induce an anti-Salmonella abortusovis antibody synthesis from lymph node leucocytes of three immunized sheep and two unprimed lambs maintained in culture in the presence of heat-inactivated bacteria for 2 weeks. Humoral immune responses were assessed by enumerating specific antibody-secreting cells using ELISASPOT and by titrating immunoglobulins secreted into culture supernatants using ELISA techniques. Optimal secondary antibody response was observed from cultures performed with fetal calf serum (compared with horse serum) and with an antigen concentration of one to ten bacteria per cell. This kind of antigenic stimulation allowed induction of numerous antibody-secreting cells without adsorption of the secreted antibodies. Maximal numbers of antibody-secreting cells could reach a rate of 1% of the sheep leucocytes initially put into culture. Kinetic profiles of antibody production from boosted lymph node cells were characterized by an ascending phase from the sixth to the twelfth day of culture and then showed a plateau phase until Day 14. Most of the responses were composed of IgM and IgG1 antibodies, traces of IgG2 being detected at the end of experiments. From the twelfth day of antigenic stimulation, the IgM isotype was preferentially expressed with high antigen concentration (100 bacteria per cell), whereas the highest amounts of IgG1 were detected at lower concentration (one to ten bacteria per cell). While anti-Salmonella IgM appeared to be mainly specific for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cell wall fraction, some IgG1 recognized other bacterial antigens. Kinetic profiles and magnitudes of primary antibody responses induced in vitro from lamb lymph node cells did not differ from those defined in cultures of sheep boosted leucocytes. But these immune reactions were mainly made up of anti-LPS IgM. Few anti-Salmonella IgG1 were detected from the tenth day of culture. So these in vitro assays allowed induction of an antibody synthesis from either in vivo sensitized or unprimed sheep lymph node leucocytes. This methodology would permit achievement of more detailed studies on interactions between Salmonella and lymph node leucocytes, leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling bacterial dissemination through the lymphoid tissue.","Berthon, P.; Gohin, I.; Lantier, I.; Olivier, M.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119719/,241

Fifteen-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats injected intracerebrally with the HNT strain of measles virus showed already within 1 day after infection an increased number of cells producing IFN-γ in the spleen, cervical lymph nodes and leptomeninges. These rats recovered after a transient neuronal infection in the brain. Rats infected intracerebrally with vesicular stomatitis virus, on the other hand, all succumbed after 2 days and showed no IFN-γ production in lymphoid cells.

The piglets were the offspring from 12 sires and 31 dams. Data from an earlier experiment, including 96 piglets of seven sires and 24 dams, were added when estimating heritabilities for Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The highest heritability (h(2)=0.87±0.41) was estimated for the total number of PMNL. Medium high heritabilities (h(2)=0.3−0.4) were estimated for the phagocytic capacity of PMNL, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production and the total number of WBC, while the heritability estimates were lower (h(2)=0.00−0.08±0.12) for the total number of lymphocytes, serum concentrations of Ig and IFN-α production. Pronounced differences between litters from various dams were found for total number of lymphocytes, IFN-α production, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The Con A induced proliferation was positively correlated (r=0.48, P<0.001) with the IL-2 production and both these parameters were correlated (r=0.44 and 0.37, respectively, P<0.001) to the virus induced IFN-α production. Despite these positive correlations, no parental offspring group was uniformly superior across all traits measured. However, the heritabilities estimated for the immune parameters are sufficiently high to be used as genetic markers in selection for general immune competence of swine.","Edfors-Lilja, Inger; Wattrang, Eva; Magnusson, U.; Fossum, Caroline",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119906/,241

However, the effect of antipsychotic use on specific causes of mortality has not yet been investigated thoroughly. METHODS: Utilizing the Danish nationwide registers, we defined a cohort of patients diagnosed with AD. Utilizing separate Cox regressions for specific causes of mortality, we investigated the effects of cumulative antipsychotic dosage after diagnosis and current antipsychotic exposure in the time period 2000–2011. RESULTS: In total, 45,894 patients were followed for 3,803,996 person-years. A total of 6129 cardiovascular related deaths, 2088 cancer related deaths, 1620 infection related deaths, and 28 intentional self-harm related deaths are presented. Current antipsychotic exposure increased mortality rate with HR between 1.92 and 2.31 for cardiovascular, cancer, and infection related death. Cumulative antipsychotic dosages were most commonly associated with increased rates of mortality for cardiovascular and infection as cause of death, whereas the associations were less clear with cancer and intentional self-harm as cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that cumulative antipsychotic drug dosages increased mortality rates for cardiovascular and infection as cause of death. These findings highlight the need for further investigations of long-term effects of treatment and of possible sub-groups who could benefit from treatment.","Nielsen, R.-E.; Lolk, A.; M.

The chapter also reviews genetic pharmacology as it relates to antiviral antisense research and drug development. Antisense oligonucleotides are selective compounds by virtue of their interaction with specific segments of RNA. For potential antivirals, identification of appropriate target RNA sequences for antisense oligonucleotides is performed at two levels: the optimal gene within the virus, and the optimal sequence within the RNA. The importance of these oligonucleotide modifications in designing effective drugs is just now being evaluated, both in animal model systems and in the clinic. The first generation of widely used antisense oligonucleotides has been the phosphorothioate (PS) compounds and a body of data on biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism in animals and in humans is now available. Since the identification and sequencing of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there has been a strong interest in identifying a potent oligonucleotide inhibitor that would have the potential for development as a therapy for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Numerous phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, with no apparent antisense sequence specificity, can have an anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV) effect. Oligonucleotides can be effective anti-influenza agents in cell culture assays. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein that is a transactivator has been also reported to be targeted successfully by antisense oligonucleotides in vivo. Several of picornaviruses have been targets for antisense oligonucleotide inhibition, and the studies demonstrate the versatility of the antisense approach. However, the fact that oligonucleotides may contribute numerous mechanisms toward the antiviral activity, in addition to the antisense mechanism, may in some cases be an asset in the pursuit of clinically useful antiviral drugs.","Kilkuskie, R.E.; Field, A.K.",Adv Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129323/,241

8735,Viral and cellular mRNA capping: Past and prospects,2004-01-07,"Defective interfering (DI) particles are subgenomic deletion mutants generated from the infectious virus genomes, generally by replicase errors. DI particles and related satellite genomes of the plant RNA viruses are generated by a wide variety of animal, plant, and fungal viruses. The ubiquity of DI viruses was first clearly recognized by Huang and Baltimore. They proposed and defined the term “DI particle” to include defective viruses containing only some portion of the infectious virus genome, requiring homologous parental virus as a helper for the replication, containing virus structural proteins and antigens, and exhibiting the capacity to replicate preferentially at the expense of infectious helper virus in cells infected by both. Satellite RNAs of plants are small RNAs that usually share little or no homology with their helper viruses, although some do exhibit some sequence homology with their helper viruses, and thus resemble DI particles in at least a portion of their genomes. Depending on the leaving sites and resumption sites, DI particles can be produced that are simple internal deletions of the virus genome, simple deletions with a new terminus, or complex or bizarre genomes with multiple rearrangements of the virus segments. DI viruses and defective viruses generally are widespread in nature. Laboratory studies show that they can sometimes exert powerful disease-modulating effects (either attenuation or intensification of symptoms). Their role in nature remains largely unexplored, despite the recent suggestive evidence for their importance in a number of systems.","Roux, Laurent; Simon, Anne E.; Holland, John J.",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131706/,241

METHODS: A narrative review from a clinical perspective of clinical features, diagnostic tests, treatments and outcomes of patients with Ebola virus disease. RESULTS: Substantial advances have been made in the care of patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD), precipitated by the unprecedented extent of the 2014–2016 outbreak. There has been improved point-of-care diagnostics, improved characterization of the clinical course of EVD, improved patient-optimized standards of care, evaluation of effective anti-Ebola therapies, administration of effective vaccines, and development of innovative Ebola treatment units. A better understanding of the Ebola virus disease clinical syndrome has led to the appreciation of a central role for critical care clinicians—over 50% of patients have life-threatening complications, including hypotension, severe electrolyte imbalance, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis and respiratory failure. Accordingly, patients often require critical care interventions such as monitoring of vital signs, intravenous fluid resuscitation, intravenous vasoactive medications, frequent diagnostic laboratory testing, renal replacement therapy, oxygen and occasionally mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: With advanced training and adherence to infection prevention and control practices, clinical interventions, including critical care, are feasible and safe to perform in critically ill patients.

This disease has become the most significant limiting factor in kiwifruit production. Psa colonizes different organs of the host plant, causing a specific symptomatology on each of them. In addition, the systemic invasion of the plant may quickly lead to plant death. Despite the massive risk that this disease poses to the kiwifruit industry, studies focusing on Psa ecology have been sporadic, and a comprehensive description of the disease epidemiology is still missing. Optimal environmental conditions for infection, dispersal and survival in the environment, or the mechanisms of penetration and colonization of host tissues have not been fully elucidated yet. The present work aims to provide a synthesis of the current knowledge, and a deeper understanding of the epidemiology of kiwifruit bacterial canker based on new experimental data. The pathogen may survive in the environment or overwinter in dormant tissues and be dispersed by wind or rain. Psa was observed in association with several plant structures (stomata, trichomes, lenticels) and wounds, which could represent entry points for apoplast infection. Environmental conditions also affect the bacterial colonization, with lower optimum values of temperature and humidity for epiphytic than for endophytic growth, and disease incidence requiring a combination of mild temperature and leaf wetness. By providing information on Psa ecology, these data sets may contribute to plan efficient control strategies for kiwifruit bacterial canker.

We measured the coefficient of filtration (Kfc) of the lungs, total pulmonary vascular resistance, and the wet-to-dry lung weight ratio (WW/DW ratio). RESULTS: Kfc was significantly increased after 60 min reperfusion compared with baseline in the IR group, but no change in the sham group. An increase in Kfc was inhibited in the N + IR group compared with the IR group (0.92 ± 0.28 vs. 2.82 ± 0.68 ml min(−1) mmHg(−1) 100 g(−1); P < 0.01). Also, nicorandil attenuated WW/DW ratio was compared with IR group (8.3 ± 0.41 vs. 10.9 ± 2.5; P < 0.05). Nicorandil’s inhibitory effect was blocked by glibenclamide and ODQ (P < 0.01), but not by L-NAME. CONCLUSIONS: Nicorandil attenuated IR injury in isolated rat lungs. This protective effect appears to involve its activation as K(ATP) channel opener as well as that of the sGC-cGMP pathway.","Abe, Kyoko; Horiguchi, Takashi; Enzan, Keiji; Masaki, Yoko; Nishikawa, Toshiaki; Kimura, Tetsu",Lung,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223246/,241
11186,Production and immunogenicity of Fubc subunit protein redesigned from DENV envelope protein,2020-03-30,"Pigs are capable of harbouring influenza A viruses of human and avian origin in their respiratory tracts and thus act as an important intermediary host to generate novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential by genetic reassortment between the two viruses. Here, we show that two distinct H1N2 swine influenza viruses contain avian-like or classical swine-like hemagglutinins with polymerase acidic (PA) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes from 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses that were found to be circulating in Korean pigs in 2018. Swine H1N2 influenza virus containing an avian-like hemagglutinin gene had enhanced pathogenicity, causing severe interstitial pneumonia in infected pigs and mice. The mortality rate of mice infected with swine H1N2 influenza virus containing an avian-like hemagglutinin gene was higher by 100% when compared to that of mice infected with swine H1N2 influenza virus harbouring classical swine-like hemagglutinin. Further, chemokines attracting inflammatory cells were strongly induced in lung tissues of pigs and mice infected by swine H1N2 influenza virus containing an avian-like hemagglutinin gene. In conclusion, it is necessary for the well-being of humans and pigs to closely monitor swine influenza viruses containing avian-like hemagglutinin with PA and NP genes from 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred five neurologists and nurses from 30 Italian multiple sclerosis centres were involved in an online quali-quantitative survey on the organization of care, combined with the Satisfaction and Compassion Fatigue Test and a collection of narratives. Descriptive statistics of the quantitative data were integrated with the results obtained by the narrative medicine methods of analysis. RESULTS: Most of the practitioners were neurologists, 46 average years old, 69% women, 43% part time dedicated to multiple sclerosis. An increased number of patients in the last 3 years were referred in 29 centres. Differences were found between neurologists and nurses. Physicians showed higher risks of burnout, reporting intensive working paces, lack of medical personnel, and anxiety caused by the precarious employment conditions. Nurses appeared more satisfied, although the reference to the lack of spaces, and the cross professional roles risk of compassion fatigue. Both positive and negative relationships of care were depicted as influencing the professional quality of life. CONCLUSION: The interviewed neurological teams need to limit the risk of compassion fatigue, which appeared from the first years of the career. The prevalence of the risk among neurologists suggests more awareness among scientific societies and health care managers on the risk for this category, as first step to prevent it.

We developed and validated a score to predict mortality upon admission to a NICU in Ethiopia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study at the University of Gondar Hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia. Neonates hospitalized in the NICU between January 1, 2016 to June 31, 2017. Cases were neonates who died and controls were neonates who survived. RESULTS: Univariate logistic regression identified variables associated with mortality. The final model was developed with stepwise logistic regression. We created the Neonatal Mortality Score, which ranged from 0 to 52, from the model’s coefficients. Bootstrap analysis internally validated the model. The discrimination and calibration were calculated. In the derivation dataset, there were 207 cases and 605 controls. Variables associated with mortality were admission level of consciousness, admission respiratory distress, gestational age, and birthweight. The AUC for neonatal mortality using these variables in aggregate was 0.88 (95% CI 0.85–0.91). The model achieved excellent discrimination (bias-corrected AUC) under internal validation. Using a cut-off of 12, the sensitivity and specificity of the Neonatal Mortality Score was 81 and 80%, respectively. The AUC for the Neonatal Mortality Score was 0.88 (95% CI 0.85–0.91), with similar bias-corrected AUC. In the validation dataset, there were 124 cases and 122 controls, the final model and the Neonatal Mortality Score had similar discrimination and calibration.

11932,"Cobalt-catalyzed highly enantioselective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids",2020-06-26,"BACKGROUND: The benefits of telemedicine include cost savings and decentralized care. Video consultation is one form that enables early detection of deteriorating patients and promotion of self-efficacy in patients who are well but anxious. Abdominal pain is a common symptom presented by patients in emergency departments. These patients could benefit from video consultation, as it enables remote follow-up of patients who do not require admission and facilitates early discharge of patients from overcrowded hospitals. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of digital telereview in patients presenting with undifferentiated acute abdominal pain. METHODS: The SAVED study was a prospective randomized controlled trial in which follow-up using existing telephone-based telereview (control) was compared with digital telereview (intervention). Patients with undifferentiated acute abdominal pain discharged from the emergency department observation ward were studied based on intention-to-treat. The control arm received routine, provider-scheduled telereview with missed reviews actively coordinated and rescheduled by emergency department staff. The intervention arm received access to a platform for digital telereview (asynchronous and synchronous format) that enabled patient-led appointment rescheduling. Patients were followed-up for 2 weeks for outcomes of service utilization, efficacy (compliance with their disposition plan), and safety (re-presentation for the same condition). RESULTS: A total of 70 patients participated, with patients randomly assigned to each arm (1:1 ratio). Patients were a mean age of 40.0 (SD 13.8; range 22-71) years, predominantly female (47/70, 67%), and predominantly of Chinese ethnicity (39/70, 56%). The telereview service was used by 32 patients in the control arm (32/35, 91%) and 18 patients in the intervention arm (18/35, 51%). Most patients in control (33/35, 94%; 95% CI 79.5%-99.0%) and intervention (34/35, 97%; 95% CI 83.4%-99.9%) arms were compliant with their final disposition. There was a low rate of re-presentation at 72 hours and 2 weeks for both control (72 hours: 2/35, 6%; 95% CI 1.0%-20.5%; 2 weeks: 2/35, 6%, 95% CI 1.0%-20.5%) and intervention (72 hours: 2/35, 6%; 95% CI 1.0%-20.5%; 2 weeks: 3/35, 9%, 95% CI 2.2%-24.2%) arms. There were no significant differences in safety (P>.99) and efficacy (P>.99) between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The application of digital telereview for the follow-up of patients with abdominal pain may be safe and effective. Future studies are needed to evaluate its cost-effectiveness and usefulness for broader clinical application.

12186,Regioselective synthesis of plant (iso)flavone glycosides in Escherichia coli,2008-08-01,"The solvent-tolerant bacterium Pseudomonas putida S12 was engineered to efficiently utilize the C(1) compounds methanol and formaldehyde as auxiliary substrate. The hps and phi genes of Bacillus brevis, encoding two key steps of the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, were introduced to construct a pathway for the metabolism of the toxic methanol oxidation intermediate formaldehyde. This approach resulted in a remarkably increased biomass yield on the primary substrate glucose when cultured in C-limited chemostats fed with a mixture of glucose and formaldehyde. With increasing relative formaldehyde feed concentrations, the biomass yield increased from 35% (C-mol biomass/C-mol glucose) without formaldehyde to 91% at 60% relative formaldehyde concentration. The RuMP-pathway expressing strain was also capable of growing to higher relative formaldehyde concentrations than the control strain. The presence of an endogenous methanol oxidizing enzyme activity in P. putida S12 allowed the replacement of formaldehyde with the less toxic methanol, resulting in an 84% (C-mol/C-mol) biomass yield. Thus, by introducing two enzymes of the RuMP pathway, co-utilization of the cheap and renewable substrate methanol was achieved, making an important contribution to the efficient use of P. putida S12 as a bioconversion platform host.","Koopman, Frank W.; de Winde, Johannes H.; Ruijssenaars, Harald J.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690845/,241

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Optimized MRI sequences for cartilage imaging at 3.0 T were tailored for 7.0 T: an intermediate-weighted fast spin-echo (IM-w FSE), a fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) and a T1-weighted 3D high-spatial-resolution volumetric fat-suppressed spoiled gradient-echo (SPGR) sequence. Three healthy subjects and seven patients with mild OA were examined. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), diagnostic confidence in assessing cartilage abnormalities, and image quality were determined. Abnormalities were assessed with the whole organ magnetic resonance imaging score (WORMS). Focal cartilage lesions and bone marrow edema pattern (BMEP) were also quantified. RESULTS: At 7.0 T, SNR was increased (p < 0.05) for all sequences. For the IM-w FSE sequence, limitations with the specific absorption rate (SAR) required modifications of the scan parameters yielding an incomplete coverage of the knee joint, extensive artifacts, and a less effective fat saturation. CNR and image quality were increased (p < 0.05) for SPGR and FIESTA and decreased for IM-w FSE. Diagnostic confidence for cartilage lesions was highest (p < 0.05) for FIESTA at 7.0 T. Evaluation of BMEP was decreased (p < 0.05) at 7.0 T due to limited performance of IM-w FSE. CONCLUSION: Gradient echo-based pulse sequences like SPGR and FIESTA are well suited for imaging at UHF which may improve early detection of cartilage lesions. However, UHF IM-w FSE sequences are less feasible for clinical use.","Stahl, Robert; Krug, Roland; Kelley, Douglas A. C.; Zuo, Jin; Ma, C.

The aim of this study was to investigate the 6MWT performance in children with ESRD compared to reference values obtained in healthy children and, secondly, to study the relationship between 6MWT performance with anthropometric variables, clinical parameters, aerobic capacity and muscle strength. Twenty patients (13 boys and seven girls; mean age 14.1 ± 3.4 years) on dialysis participated in this study. Anthropometrics were taken in a standardized manner. The 6MWT was performed in a 20-m-long track in a straight hallway. Aerobic fitness was measured using a cycle ergometer test to determine peak oxygen uptake [Formula: see text], peak rate (W(peak)) and ventilatory threshold (VT). Muscle strength was measured using hand-held myometry. Children with ESRD showed a reduced 6MWT performance (83% of predicted, p < 0.0001), irrespective of the reference values used. The strongest predictors of 6MWT performance were haematocrit and height. Regression models explained 59% (haematocrit and height) to 60% (haematocrit) of the variance in 6MWT performance. 6MWT performance was not associated with [Formula: see text], strength, or other anthropometric variables, but it was significantly associated with haematocrit and height. Children with ESRD scored lower on the 6MWT than healthy children. Based on these results, the 6MWT may be a useful instrument for monitoring clinical status in children with ESRD, however it cannot substitute for other fitness tests, such as a progressive exercise test to measure [Formula: see text] or muscle strength tests.","Takken, Tim; Engelbert, Raoul; van Bergen, Monique; Groothoff, Jaap; Nauta, Jeroen; van Hoeck, Koen; Lilien, Marc; Helders, Paul",Pediatr Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2753769/,241

In particular, the direct secretion of proteinaceous products into the growth medium greatly facilitates their downstream processing, which is an important advantage of B. subtilis over other biotechnological production hosts, such as Escherichia coli. The application spectrum of B. subtilis is, however, often confined to proteins from Bacillus or closely related species. One of the major reasons for this (current) limitation is the inefficient formation of disulfide bonds, which are found in many, especially eukaryotic, proteins. Future exploitation of B. subtilis to fulfill the ever-growing demand for pharmaceutical and other high-value proteins will therefore depend on overcoming this particular hurdle. Recently, promising advances in this area have been achieved, which focus attention on the need to modulate the cellular levels and activity of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases (TDORs). These TDORs are enzymes that control the cleavage or formation of disulfide bonds. This review will discuss readily applicable approaches for TDOR modulation and aims to provide leads for further improvement of the Bacillus cell factory for production of disulfide bond-containing proteins.","Kouwen, Thijs R.

In addition, the isobutanol production by the parental strain (JCL16) and the high isobutanol-tolerant mutant (SA481) were compared with JCL260. Interestingly, we found that the isobutanol-tolerant strain in fact produced worse than either JCL16 or JCL260. This result suggests that in situ product removal can properly overcome isobutanol toxicity in E. coli cultures.

The cis and trans requirements for Mu phage-mediated transposition, which include the L/R ends of the Mu DNA, the transposition factors MuA and MuB, and the cis/trans functioning of the E element as an enhancer, are presented. Mini-Mu(LR)/(LER) units are Mu derivatives that lack most of the Mu genes but contain the L/R ends or a properly arranged E element in cis to the L/R ends. The dual-component system, which consists of an integrative plasmid with a mini-Mu and an easily eliminated helper plasmid encoding inducible transposition factors, is described in detail as a tool for the integration/amplification of recombinant DNAs. This chromosomal editing method is based on replicative transposition through the formation of a cointegrate that can be resolved in a recombination-dependent manner. (E-plus)- or (E-minus)-helpers that differ in the presence of the trans-acting E element are used to achieve the proper mini-Mu transposition intensity. The systems that have been developed for the construction of stably maintained mini-Mu multi-integrant strains of Escherichia coli and Methylophilus methylotrophus are described. A novel integration/amplification/fixation strategy is proposed for consecutive independent replicative transpositions of different mini-Mu(LER) units with “excisable” E elements in methylotrophic cells.","Akhverdyan, Valerii Z.; Gak, Evgueni R.; Tokmakova, Irina L.; Stoynova, Nataliya V.; Yomantas, Yurgis A.

It depends on many factors. The main factor is the metabolism of the microbial species present inside and on the vertebrate. In this review, we combine the results from studies on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected during this decay process and those on the biochemical formation of VOCs in order to improve our understanding of the decay process. Micro-organisms are the main producers of VOCs, which are by- or end-products of microbial metabolism. Many microbes are already present inside and on a vertebrate, and these can initiate microbial decay. In addition, micro-organisms from the environment colonize the cadaver. The composition of microbial communities is complex, and communities of different species interact with each other in succession. In comparison to the complexity of the decay process, the resulting volatile pattern does show some consistency. Therefore, the possibility of an existence of a time-dependent core volatile pattern, which could be used for applications in areas such as forensics or food science, is discussed.

Cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectins are the main components of plant cell wall polysaccharides. These polysaccharides are often tightly packed, contain many different sugar residues, and are branched with a diversity of structures. To enable efficient degradation of these polysaccharides, fungi produce an extensive set of carbohydrate-active enzymes. The variety of the enzyme set differs between fungi and often corresponds to the requirements of its habitat. Carbohydrate-active enzymes can be organized in different families based on the amino acid sequence of the structurally related catalytic modules. Fungal enzymes involved in plant polysaccharide degradation are assigned to at least 35 glycoside hydrolase families, three carbohydrate esterase families and six polysaccharide lyase families. This mini-review will discuss the enzymes needed for complete degradation of plant polysaccharides and will give an overview of the latest developments concerning fungal carbohydrate-active enzymes and their corresponding families.","van den Brink, Joost; de Vries, Ronald P.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3160556/,241

However, statins, the most widely prescribed LDL-cholesterol lowering drugs, increase diabetes risk. We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in the public domain to investigate the relationship of LDL-C and diabetes and identify loci encoding potential drug targets for LDL-cholesterol modification without causing dysglycemia. We obtained summary-level GWAS data for LDL-C from GLGC, glycemic traits from MAGIC, diabetes from DIAGRAM and CAD from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D consortia. Mendelian randomization analyses identified a one standard deviation (SD) increase in LDL-C caused an increased risk of CAD (odds ratio [OR] 1.63 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.55, 1.71), which was not influenced by removing SNPs associated with diabetes. LDL-C/CAD-associated SNPs showed consistent effect directions (binomial P = 6.85 × 10(−5)). Conversely, a 1-SD increase in LDL-C was causally protective of diabetes (OR 0.86; 95 % CI 0.81, 0.91), however LDL-cholesterol/diabetes-associated SNPs did not show consistent effect directions (binomial P = 0.15). HMGCR, our positive control, associated with LDL-C, CAD and a glycemic composite (derived from GWAS meta-analysis of four glycemic traits and diabetes). In contrast, PCSK9, APOB, LPA, CETP, PLG, NPC1L1 and ALDH2 were identified as “druggable” loci that alter LDL-C and risk of CAD without displaying associations with dysglycemia. In conclusion, LDL-C increases the risk of CAD and the relationship is independent of any association of LDL-C with diabetes. Loci that encode targets of emerging LDL-C lowering drugs do not associate with dysglycemia, and this provides provisional evidence that new LDL-C lowering drugs (such as PCSK9 inhibitors) may not influence risk of diabetes.

Gel-immobilized S. barnesii cells were used to inoculate a mesophilic (30°C) bioreactor fed with lactate as electron donor at an organic loading rate of 5 g chemical oxygen demand (COD) × L(−1) day(−1). Selenate was reduced efficiently (>97%) in the nitrate and sulfate fed bioreactor, and a minimal effluent concentration of 39 µg Se × L(−1) was obtained. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM–EDX) analysis revealed spherical bioprecipitates of ≤2 µm diameter mostly on the gel surface, consisting of selenium with a minor contribution of sulfur. To validate the bioaugmentation success under microbial competition, gel cubes with immobilized S. barnesii cells were added to an Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Bed (UASB) reactor, resulting in earlier selenate (24 hydraulic retention times (HRTs)) and sulfate (44 HRTs) removal and higher nitrate/nitrite removal efficiencies compared to a non-bioaugmented control reactor. S. barnesii was efficiently immobilized inside the UASB bioreactors as the selenate-reducing activity was maintained during long-term operation (58 days), and molecular analysis showed that S. barnesii was present in both the sludge bed and the effluent. This demonstrates that gel immobilization of specialized bacterial strains can supersede wash-out and out-competition of newly introduced strains in continuous bioaugmented systems. Eventually, proliferation of a selenium-respiring specialist occurred in the non-bioaugmented control reactor, resulting in simultaneous nitrate and selenate removal during a later phase of operation.

12558,Xylose anaerobic conversion by open-mixed cultures,2009-02-01,"A new method is described to remove and separate biosurfactants from complex mixtures by compressing and harvesting the liquid surface layer. This method was applied to Bacillus subtilis cultures, in which the lipopeptide antibiotic fengycin as well as the polyketide antibiotic bacillaene were produced. The automated harvesting and collection in a custom-built glass body called ‘flounder’ was repeated several hundred times. The fengycin concentration in the fractions was found to be four times higher than in the culture centrifugate. Of the overall fengycin, 50% (w/w) were recovered after 300 cycles, 95% (w/w) after 800 harvesting cycles. A separation of fengycin from the less surface-active bacillaene could be achieved due to stronger surface activity of fengycin. The ratio of partition coefficients of fengycin and bacillaene was nine times higher compared to foam fractionation. A stepwise increase of the equilibrium surface tension in the centrifugate from 29 to 33 mN/m indicated a fractionated separation of different surface-active substances. The utilization of cell containing culture broth instead of centrifugate had only slight effects on separation efficiency. These results demonstrate the possibility to separate biosurfactants directly from cultivation without the use of extraction solvents or foam formation.","Glazyrina, Julia; Junne, Stefan; Thiesen, Peter; Lunkenheimer, Klaus; Goetz, Peter",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7419455/,241

Here, we describe the first strain of Escherichia coli developed to produce the higher alcohol and potential new biofuel 2-methyl-1-butanol (2MB). To accomplish this, we explored the biodiversity of enzymes catalyzing key parts of the isoleucine biosynthetic pathway, finding that AHAS II (ilvGM) from Salmonella typhimurium and threonine deaminase (ilvA) from Corynebacterium glutamicum improve 2MB production the most. Overexpression of the native threonine biosynthetic operon (thrABC) on plasmid without the native transcription regulation also improved 2MB production in E. coli. Finally, we knocked out competing pathways upstream of threonine production (ΔmetA, Δtdh) to increase its availability for further improvement of 2MB production. This work led to a strain of E. coli that produces 1.25 g/L 2MB in 24 h, a total alcohol content of 3 g/L, and with yields of up to 0.17 g 2MB/g glucose.","Cann, Anthony F.; Liao, James C.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7419481/,241
12565,Production of 2-methyl-1-butanol in engineered Escherichia coli,2008-11-01,"While cultivation is a convenient way of proliferating and understanding bacteria, studies have shown the formation of nonculturable cells in nonspore-forming bacteria in response to environmental stress and thus in turn have generated immense interest. Whether these cells are in a state of dormancy or in a stage preceding cell death has been considered of paramount importance for the past couple of decades. In this study, osmotic-stress-induced dormant bacterial cells were separated by cell sorting and revived by osmotic down-shift in the absence of nutrients, source(s) that potentially could supply nutrients, and/or the external addition of resuscitation factor(s). Reversal of dormancy followed a definite pattern akin to population asynchrony of dormant cells, and the phenomenon was observed across three species, namely, Enterobacter sp. strain mcp11b, Klebsiella pneumonia strain mcp11d and Escherichia coli. In addition, our study precisely forecasted the presence of multiple subpopulations in dormant cells, which is explained by an emerging theory of survival mechanisms in stressful environments. These observations reveal that the state of dormancy induced by environmental stress in these nonspore-forming bacteria is “reversible” and also implies that it is an orderly and spontaneous adaptation to circumvent adverse conditions.

Despite this progress to date, the application of time series analysis has remained underexplored due to complexity of the underlying techniques. In this study, we have deployed a novel ML, called automated time series (AutoTS) machine learning, to automate data processing and the application of a multitude of models to assess which best forecasts future values. This rapid experimentation allows for and enables the selection of the most accurate model in order to perform time series predictions. By using the nation-wide ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) dataset of hospitalized patients of Romania, we have generated time series datasets over the period of 2008–2018 and performed highly accurate AutoTS predictions for the ten deadliest diseases. Forecast results for the years 2019 and 2020 were generated on a NUTS 2 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) regional level. This is the first study to our knowledge to perform time series forecasting of multiple diseases at a regional level using automated time series machine learning on a national ICD-10 dataset. The deployment of AutoTS technology can help decision makers in implementing targeted national health policies more efficiently.","Olsavszky, Victor; Dosius, Mihnea; Vladescu, Cristian; Benecke, Johannes",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7400312/,241

We sought to investigate the impact of MCS using combined veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and micro-axial flow pumps (the ECMELLA concept) in influenza-related myocarditis complicated by rCS. METHODS: This is a prospective, observational analysis from the single centre HAnnover Cardiac Unloading REgistry (HACURE) from two recent epidemic influenza seasons. We analysed patients with verified influenza-associated myocarditis complicated by rCS who were admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) on MCS. Subsequently, we performed a propensity score (PS) matched analysis to patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by rCS and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (DCM) related rCS. RESULTS: We describe a series of seven patients with rCS-complicated influenza-related myocarditis (mean age 56±10 years, 58% male, influenza A (n=2)/influenza B (n=5)). No patient had been vaccinated prior to the influenza season. MCS was provided using combined VA-ECMO and Impella micro-axial flow pump. In two patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, VA-ECMO had been implanted for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. All patients died within 18 days of hospital admission. By PS-based comparison to patients with AMI- or DCM-related rCS and combined MCS, 30-day mortality was significantly higher in influenza-related rCS. CONCLUSION: Despite initial stabilisation with combined MCS in patients with rCS-complicated influenza-related myocarditis, the detrimental course of shock could not be stopped and all patients died. Influenza virus infection potentially critically affects other organs besides the heart, leading to irreversible end-organ damage that MCS cannot compensate for and, therefore, results in a devastating outcome.","Sieweke, Jan-Thorben; Akin, Muharrem; Stetskamp, Sebastian; Riehle, Christian; Jonigk, Danny; Flierl, Ulrike; Pfeffer, Tobias J.; Hirsch, Valentin; Dutzmann, Jochen; Hoeper, Marius M.; Kühn, Christian; Bauersachs, Johann; Schäfer, Andreas",Eur Respir J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7469974/,241

Although crucial for the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, blood feeding remains poorly understood due to technological limitations. Indeed, studies often expose human subjects to assess biting behavior. Here, we present the biteOscope, a device that attracts mosquitoes to a host mimic which they bite to obtain an artificial blood meal. The host mimic is transparent, allowing high-resolution imaging of the feeding mosquito. Using machine learning, we extract detailed behavioral statistics describing the locomotion, pose, biting, and feeding dynamics of Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Anopheles stephensi, and Anopheles coluzzii. In addition to characterizing behavioral patterns, we discover that the common insect repellent DEET repels Anopheles coluzzii upon contact with their legs. The biteOscope provides a new perspective on mosquito blood feeding, enabling the high-throughput quantitative characterization of this lethal behavior.","Hol, Felix JH; Lambrechts, Louis; Prakash, Manu",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7535929/,241

Orostachys japonica (O. japonica), which is a perennial plant belonging to the genus Orostachys of the Crassulaceae family, has been revealed to exhibit pharmacological properties against various tumors in numerous studies. The present review aimed to discuss the biological actions and underlying molecular mechanisms of O. japonica and its representative compounds—kaempferol and quercetin—against tumors. O. japonica reportedly has antiproliferative, anti-angiogenic, and antimetastatic activities against various types of malignant tumors through the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, a blockade of downstream vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-VEGFR2 pathways, and the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In addition, emerging studies have highlighted the antitumor efficacy of kaempferol and quercetin. Interestingly, it was found that alterations of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades are involved in the pivotal mechanisms of the antitumor effects of O. japonica and its two compounds against cancer cell overgrowth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In summary, O. japonica could be considered a preventive and therapeutic medicinal plant which exhibits antitumor actions by reversing altered patterns of MAPK cascades, and kaempferol and quercetin might be potential components that can contribute to the efficacy and underlying mechanism of O. japonica.","Hur, Soyoung; Jang, Eungyeong; Lee, Jang-Hoon",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7915109/,241

Telemetric interventions have attracted great interest and may provide effective new therapeutic approaches for improving type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) care. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the clinical effectiveness of telemetric interventions on glycated hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) specifically and T2DM management generally in a systematic meta-review. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, and EMBASE databases from January 2008 to April 2020. Studies that addressed HbA(1c), blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, BMI, diabetes-related and health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness, time savings, and the clinical effectiveness of telemetric interventions were analyzed. In total, 73 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 10 systematic reviews/meta-analyses, 9 qualitative studies, 2 cohort studies, 2 nonrandomized controlled studies, 2 observational studies, and 1 noncontrolled intervention study were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 1647 citations were identified. After careful screening, 99 studies (n=15,939 patients; n=82,436 patient cases) were selected by two independent reviewers for inclusion in the review. Telemetric interventions were categorized according to communication channels to health care providers: (1) “real-time video” interventions, (2) “real-time audio” interventions, (3) “asynchronous” interventions, and (4) “combined” interventions. To analyze changes in HbA(1c), suitable RCTs were pooled and the average was determined. An HbA(1c) decrease of –1.15% (95% CI –1.84% to –0.45%), yielding an HbA(1c) value of 6.95% (SD 0.495), was shown in studies using 6-month “real-time video” interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Telemetric interventions clearly improve HbA(1c) values in both the short term and the long term and contribute to the effective management of T2DM.

16739,Salubrinal Alleviates Collagen-Induced Arthritis through Promoting P65 Degradation in Osteoclastogenesis,2021-03-28,"The physiological response to a psychological stressor broadly impacts energy metabolism. Inversely, changes in energy availability affect the physiological response to the stressor in terms of hypothalamus, pituitary adrenal axis (HPA), and sympathetic nervous system activation. Glucocorticoids, the endpoint of the HPA axis, are critical checkpoints in endocrine control of energy homeostasis and have been linked to metabolic diseases including obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Glucocorticoids, through the glucocorticoid receptor, activate transcription of genes associated with glucose and lipid regulatory pathways and thereby control both physiological and pathophysiological systemic energy homeostasis. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of glucocorticoid functions in energy metabolism and systemic metabolic dysfunction, particularly focusing on glucose and lipid metabolism. There are elements in the external environment that induce lifelong changes in the HPA axis stress response and glucocorticoid levels, and the most prominent are early life adversity, or exposure to traumatic stress. We hypothesise that when the HPA axis is so disturbed after early life adversity, it will fundamentally alter hepatic gluconeogenesis, inducing hyperglycaemia, and hence crystalise the significant lifelong risk of developing either the metabolic syndrome, or type 2 diabetes. This gives a “Jekyll and Hyde” role to gluconeogenesis, providing the necessary energy in situations of acute stress, but driving towards pathophysiological consequences when the HPA axis has been altered.","Seal, Snehaa V.; Turner, Jonathan D.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8037741/,241

Atherosclerosis is characterized as an inflammatory chronic disease which is caused by the formation of lesions in the arterial wall. Subsequently, lesion progression and disruption ultimately lead to heart disease and stroke. The development of atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of approximately 50% of all deaths in westernized societies. Countless studies have aimed to improve therapeutic approaches for atherosclerosis treatment; however, it remains high on the global list of challenges toward healthy and long lives. Some patients with familial hypercholesterolemia could not get intended LDL-C goals even with high doses of traditional therapies such as statins, with many of them being unable to tolerate statins because of the harsh side effects. Furthermore, even in patients achieving target LDL-C levels, the residual risk of traditional therapies is still significant thus highlighting the necessity of ongoing research for more effective therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects. Decoy-based drug candidates represent an opportunity to inhibit regulatory pathways that promote atherosclerosis. In this review, the potential roles of decoys in the treatment of atherosclerosis were described based on the in vitro and in vivo findings.","Mahjoubin-Tehran, Maryam; Teng, Yong; Jalili, Amin; Aghaee-Bakhtiari, Seyed Hamid; Markin, Alexander M.; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8122884/,241

The encouraging results of a recent trial conducted in young children in Burkina Faso and Mali in which a combination of the RTS,S/AS01(E) malaria vaccine and seasonal malaria chemoprevention led to a substantial reduction in clinical cases of malaria, severe malaria, and malaria deaths compared with the administration of either intervention given alone suggests that there may be other epidemiological/clinical situations in which a combination of malaria vaccination and chemoprevention could be beneficial. Some of these potential opportunities are considered in this paper. These include combining vaccination with intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants, with intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (through vaccination of women of child-bearing age before or during pregnancy), or with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in the management of children recently admitted to hospital with severe anaemia. Other potential uses of the combination are prevention of malaria in children at particular risk from the adverse effects of clinical malaria, such as those with sickle cell disease, and during the final stages of a malaria elimination programme when vaccination could be combined with repeated rounds of mass drug administration. The combination of a pre-erythrocytic stage malaria vaccine with an effective chemopreventive regimen could make a valuable contribution to malaria control and elimination in a variety of clinical or epidemiological situations, and the potential of this approach to malaria control needs to be explored.","Greenwood, Brian; Cairns, Matthew; Chaponda, Mike; Chico, R.

In the last two decades, extensive research has been conducted on gender related issues, studying both their antecedents and consequences. However, existing literature reviews fail to provide a comprehensive and clear picture of what has been studied so far, which could guide scholars in their future research. Our paper offers a scoping review of a large portion of the research that has been published over the last 22 years, on gender equality and related issues, with a specific focus on business and economics studies. Combining innovative methods drawn from both network analysis and text mining, we provide a synthesis of 15,465 scientific articles. We identify 27 main research topics, we measure their relevance from a semantic point of view and the relationships among them, highlighting the importance of each topic in the overall gender discourse. We find that prominent research topics mostly relate to women in the workforce–e.g., concerning compensation, role, education, decision-making and career progression. However, some of them are losing momentum, and some other research trends–for example related to female entrepreneurship, leadership and participation in the board of directors–are on the rise.

In our pediatric HSCT program, myalgia was regularly observed after treosulfan-based conditioning, which is a relatively unknown side effect. Using a natural language processing and text-mining tool (CDC), we investigated whether treosulfan compared with busulfan was associated with an increased risk of myalgia. Furthermore, among treosulfan users, we studied the characteristics of given treatment of myalgia, and studied prognostic factors for developing myalgia during treosulfan use. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) until 28 days after HSCT were screened using the CDC for myalgia and 22 synonyms. Time to myalgia, location of pain, duration, severity and drug treatment were collected. Pain severity was classified according to the WHO pain relief ladder. Logistic regression was performed to assess prognostic factors. 114 patients received treosulfan and 92 busulfan. Myalgia was reported in 37 patients; 34 patients in the treosulfan group and 3 patients in the busulfan group (p = 0.01). In the treosulfan group, median time to myalgia was 7 days (0–12) and median duration of pain was 19 days (4–73). 44% of patients needed strong acting opiates and adjuvant medicines (e.g. ketamine). Hemoglobinopathy was a significant risk factor, as compared to other underlying diseases (OR 7.16 95% CI 2.09–30.03, p = 0.003). Myalgia appears to be a common adverse effect of treosulfan in pediatric HSCT, especially in hemoglobinopathy. Using the CDC, EHRs were easily screened to detect this previously unknown side effect, proving the effectiveness of the tool. Recognition of treosulfan-induced myalgia is important for adequate pain management strategies and thereby for improving the quality of hospital stay.","van der Stoep, M. Y.

Children with comorbidity and aged < 2 years are at particular risk. Methods: a descriptive, retrospective study on the clinical presentation and management of patients with H1N1 infection was performed in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). All children admitted in PICU of Coimbra's Pediatrics Hospital (CPH) were described, from July 15(th) to November 30(th) of 2009. Results: during this period, 241 children with laboratory confirmation of H1N1 infection were observed in CPH, of whom 38 (16%) required hospitalization, 4 (1.7%) in PICU-CPH. The age ranged from 4 months to 21 years. Three patients had previous co-morbidities. All met clinical criteria for H1N1 infection and were admitted with respiratory distress (4), rapidly progressive and evolution to ARDS (2), associated with shock (2) and lethargy (2). Three patients required mechanical ventilation (conventional and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation); the duration ranged between 4-12 days. Two patients received intravenous catecholamines support, two developed acute renal failure and two had pancytopenia. There were two bacterial coinfections. All received treatment with oseltamivir. Length of PICU stay ranged from 5-22 days, with a favorable outcome in all cases. Conclusion: in the 1st peak of H1N1 outbreak, 10% of the hospitalized children required PICU admission. Despite severe respiratory disease and multiple organ dysfunction, a good outcome was achieved, with no mortality.","Neto, P; Silva, P V; Santos, S; Pinto, C; Dinis, A; Carvalho, L; Neves, F",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104474/,241

23525,"Contents of veterinary microbiol, volume 48",2003-12-10,"Clinical microbiology laboratories increasingly rely on molecular diagnostic techniques. The various formats of nucleic acid amplification are the most frequently used molecular tests in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. In many clinical settings, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is clearly the method of choice due to its exquisite sensitivity and specificity. Today, many conventional PCR methods are being replaced by real-time PCR, which allows more rapid detection and quantification of the PCR product, as well as detection of different strains of the pathogen by melting curve analysis. The ability to measure the quantity of microbe by quantitative PCR has become increasingly important, providing information on the progression and prognosis of disease, and effectiveness of treatment. Other widely used molecular diagnostic techniques are isothermal amplification methods and nucleic acid hybridization techniques. Microarray is a technique which holds promise and has an exceptional sensitivity and the capacity to detect several pathogens simultaneously. However, microarrays are currently too expensive to be adapted for routine diagnostics, and their diagnostic use requires broad-based nucleic acid amplification prior to analysis which is not well established. Several molecular methods can be used for genotyping, which allows the identification of different subtypes of the pathogen; genotyping plays a role in the risk assessment and management of infections. Clinicians need to recognize the enhanced accuracy and speed of the molecular diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis of infections, but also to understand their limitations. Laboratory results should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation of the patient, and appropriate site, quality, and timing of specimen collection are required for reliable test results.","Kurkela, Satu; Brown, David W.G.",Medicine (Abingdon),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108329/,241

23536,"Contents Vol. 42, 1994",2002-11-14,"Reproductive performance in Holstein dairy cattle managed during summer in southern Sonora is a challenge because of high ambient temperature and relative humidity. Both of these factors contribute to heat stress, which influences cow behavior. The physiological response of cows to heat stress is one component of a system-wide gene network. Within this environment, a superior cow's ability to get pregnant early during postpartum is favorable as to reduce the trait days open and to increase productive life. Recently, many reproductive specialists have recommended using pregnancy rate as a measure of reproductive success, after converting this trait into a quantitative value using a linear formula. In comparison to the traditional measure of days open, pregnancy rate calculation includes more easily cows that do not become pregnant; furthermore, the output variable indicates that larger values are more desirable, and therefore, more understandable by dairy producers. The objective herein was to predict pregnancy rate in lactating Holstein cows using molecular markers associated with fertility in Holstein cows under a heat-stressed environment. This study included 500 cows from three dairy herds located in the Yaqui Valley of Sonora. A blood sample was collected from every cow and spotted onto FTA cards. The DNA was extracted from each card and used to genotype 179 tag SNP within 43 genes in the prolactin and GH-IGF1 pathways. Five SNP within the genes IGFBP7, IGFBP2, PAPPA1, SSTR2, and STAT6 were associated with pregnancy rate using a mixed effects model. The genotype term was later included in this model to calculate allele substitution effects. Molecular breeding values of the individual cows were calculated by summing the additive genotype effect for each SNP that showed a significant independent association with pregnancy rate, and the average MBV was 0.46 ± 0.01%. Two statistical regression models were used to predict the variable pregnancy rate: a full model that included effects of days and number of lactations, contemporary group (e.g., farm management group), health status, and MBV and a reduced model that only included MBV. Coefficients of determination were 37.61% and 3.07% for full and reduced models, respectively (P < 0.01). These results indicate that five SNP explained only a small proportion of the additive genetic variance for pregnancy rate. Additional research is needed to understand if these results are due to low heritability/repeatability of a fertility and (or) if these results are also influenced by heat stress.","Zamorano-Algandar, R.; Leyva-Corona, J.

The pattern results from how species interact and evolve by mechanisms and processes including symbiosis; symbiogenesis; lateral gene transfer (that occurs via bacterial conjugation, transformation, transduction, Gene Transfer Agents, or the movements of transposons, retrotransposons, and other mobile genetic elements); hybridization or divergence with gene flow; and infectious heredity (induced either directly by bacteria, bacteriophages, viruses, prions, protozoa and fungi, or via vectors that transmit these pathogens). Research on reticulate evolution today takes on inter- and transdisciplinary proportions and is able to unite distinct research fields ranging from microbiology and molecular genetics to evolutionary biology and the biomedical sciences.

Though the key platforms for promoting public understanding of science are spearheaded mainly by institutions that promote informal science learning as well as by learned societies, the contribution from newspapers is also important. Content analysis of one continuous week of a national newspaper was undertaken, and the results show that coverage of science and technology was modest and predominantly news driven. For news stories set locally, there was a pronounced emphasis on the use of institutional actors in the text as well as quotations. Articles on health/medicine and earth science elicited the most coverage in the press. Some suggestions for using newspaper science to introduce inquiry in the science classroom are discussed.","Subramaniam, R.",Inquiry into the Singapore Science Classroom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121142/,241

28160,Interaction of influenza virus with swine alveolar macrophages: Influence of anti-virus antibodies and cytochalasin B,2006-12-29,"More and more, asset management organizations are introducing data science initiatives to support predictive maintenance and anomaly detection. Asset management organizations are by nature data intensive to manage their assets like bridges, dykes, railways and roads. For this, they often implement data lakes using a variety of architectures and technologies to store big data and facilitate data science initiatives. However, the decision-outcomes of data science models are often highly reliant on the quality of the data. The data in the data lake therefore has to be of sufficient quality to develop trust by decision-makers. Not surprisingly, organizations are increasingly adopting data governance as a means to ensure that the quality of data entering the data lake is and remains of sufficient quality, and to ensure the organization remains legally compliant. The objective of the case study is to understand the role of data governance as success factor for data science. For this, a case study regarding the governance of data in a data lake in the asset management domain is analyzed to test three propositions contributing to the success of using data science. The results show that unambiguous ownership of the data, monitoring the quality of the data entering the data lake, and a controlled overview of standard and specific compliance requirements are important factors for maintaining data quality and compliance and building trust in data science products.","Brous, Paul; Janssen, Marijn; Krans, Rutger","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134294/,241

Riskscapes encompass different viewpoints on the threat of loss across space, time, individuals and collectives. This Special Issue of the Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy, and Society enhances our understanding of the multifaceted and interlocking dimensions of climate change and riskscapes. It brings together rigorous and critical international scholarship across diverse realms on inquiry under two, interlinked, themes: (i) governance and institutional responses and (ii) vulnerabilities and inequalities. The contributors offer a forceful reminder that when considering climate change, social justice principles cannot be appended after the fact. Climate change adaptation and mitigation pose complex and interdependent social and ethical dilemmas that will need to be explicitly confronted in any activation of “Green New Deal” strategies currently being developed internationally. Such critical insights about the layered, unequal and institutional dimensions of risks are of paramount import when considering other riskscapes pertaining to conflict and war, displaced people and pandemics like the 2019–2020 global COVID-19 pandemic.","Davies, Anna; Hooks, Gregory; Knox-Hayes, Janelle; Liévanos, Raoul S",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7454449/,241
39019,Zika virus enhances dengue risk,2020-09-11,"We investigated the constraints on sulfide uptake by bacterial ectosymbionts on the marine peritrich ciliate Zoothamnium niveum by a combination of experimental and numerical methods. Protists with symbionts were collected on large blocks of mangrove-peat. The blocks were placed in a flow cell with flow adjusted to in situ velocity. The water motion around the colonies was then characterized by particle tracking velocimetry. This shows that the feather-shaped colony of Z. niveum generates a unidirectional flow of seawater through the colony with no recirculation. The source of the feeding current was the free-flowing water although the size of the colonies suggests that they live partly submerged in the diffusive boundary layer. We showed that the filtered volume allows Z. niveum to assimilate sufficient sulfide to sustain the symbiosis at a few micromoles per liter in ambient concentration. Numerical modeling shows that sulfide oxidizing bacteria on the surfaces of Z. niveum can sustain 100-times higher sulfide uptake than bacteria on flat surfaces, such as microbial mats. The study demonstrates that the filter feeding zooids of Z. niveum are preadapted to be prime habitats for sulfide oxidizing bacteria due to Z. niveum’s habitat preference and due to the feeding current. Z. niveum is capable of exploiting low concentrations of sulfide in near norm-oxic seawater. This links its otherwise dissimilar habitats and makes it functionally similar to invertebrates with thiotrophic symbionts in filtering organs.

52931,Strategies to Tackle Antimicrobial Resistance: The Example of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,2021-05-06,"OBJECTIVES: To construct a distribution atlas of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia on computed tomography (CT) and further explore the difference in distribution by location and disease severity through a retrospective study of 484 cases in Jiangsu, China. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 10 to February 18 in Jiangsu Province, China, were enrolled in our study. The patients were further divided into asymptomatic/mild, moderate, and severe/critically ill groups. A deep learning algorithm was applied to the anatomic pulmonary segmentation and pneumonia lesion extraction. The frequency of opacity on CT was calculated, and a color-coded distribution atlas was built. A further comparison was made between the upper and lower lungs, between bilateral lungs, and between various severity groups. Additional lesion-based radiomics analysis was performed to ascertain the features associated with the disease severity. RESULTS: A total of 484 laboratory-confirmed patients with 945 repeated CT scans were included. Pulmonary opacity was mainly distributed in the subpleural and peripheral areas. The distances from the opacity to the nearest parietal/visceral pleura were shortest in the asymptomatic/mild group. More diffused lesions were found in the severe/critically ill group. The frequency of opacity increased with increased severity and peaked at about 3–4 or 7–8 o’clock direction in the upper lungs, as opposed to the 5 or 6 o’clock direction in the lower lungs. Lesions with greater energy, more circle-like, and greater surface area were more likely found in severe/critically ill cases than the others. CONCLUSION: This study constructed a detailed distribution atlas of COVID-19 pneumonia and compared specific patterns in different parts of the lungs at various severities. The radiomics features most associated with the severity were also found. These results may be valuable in determining the COVID-19 sub-phenotype.

54851,Albumin-Coated Single-Core Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for Enhanced Molecular Magnetic Imaging (MRI/MPI),2021-06-09,"It is seen that anime, which is a Japanese animation type, with the food scenes in it, cause the curiosity and interest of the anime viewers from different cultures towards Japanese cuisine. It is thought to contribute to Japan in terms of gastronomy. Accordingly, although there are many promotional and marketing tools to spread the products of Japanese cuisine culture to the world, the idea that anime with a large global viewers also have a share in this promotion is the starting point of this study. Within this context, in this study, it was aimed to research how animes affect the perception of Japanese cuisine culture in individuals. At the same time, informations about the foods they prefer belonging to this culture have been obtained. Interview technique which is one of the qualitative research methods was used for data collection. The interview questions were sent to 31 anime viewers by selecting the snowball sample method, through Google Forms, and the answers were collected between 2 February 2021 and 16 February 2021. Descriptive and content analysis was applied to the obtained data. According to the results of the research, it is seen that animes have a serious contribution to the reflection of the Japanese cuisine culture. While the interesting scenes in the food-themed animes enable the viewers to try Japanese food, it has been determined that they encourage to buy Japanese cuisine products and use them at home. In general, it was observed that animes made nearly half of the participants curious about Japanese cuisine and animes directed them to experience it.","Basaran, Guliz; Sunnetcioglu, Serdar",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8215867/,241
56046,Emerging Exosomes and Exosomal MiRNAs in Spinal Cord Injury,2021-07-09,"ESL/EFL teachers, especially those working in higher education, across the world were required to teach online after the spread on COVID-19. Many empirical studies have been conducted in the last 1 year to investigate various aspects of online teaching and learning of languages. However, online ESL teaching in South Asian contexts remains almost unexplored. This paper reports a multiple case study that aimed to bridge this gap and explore online formative assessment (FA) and feedback practices of three ESL teachers working in three universities in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. Data were collected through classroom observations, interviews and document analysis. The results indicate that all three teachers actively engaged their students in a variety of FA practices, although they did not use the obtained information from assessments properly and there remained many areas of improvement. Their feedback practices, which involved the integration of a few digital tools, were regular and student-friendly. The study is significant in that it is the first of its kind. Future researchers can conduct large scale studies to verify if the findings of the study are true for other university ESL teachers who are teaching online.","Mahapatra, Santosh Kumar",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8288836/,241
56126,Disease Differentiation and Monitoring of Anti-TNF Treatment in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Spondyloarthropathies,2021-07-09,"PURPOSE: The Emergency Surgery Score (ESS) is a reliable point-based score that predicts mortality and morbidity in emergency surgery patients. However, it has been validated only in the U.S. patients. We aimed to prospectively validate ESS in a Greek patient population. METHODS: All patients who underwent an emergent laparotomy were prospectively included over a 15-month period. A systematic chart review was performed to collect relevant preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables based on which the ESS was calculated for each patient. The relationship between ESS and 30-day mortality, morbidity (i.e., the occurrence of at least one complication), and the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission was evaluated and compared between the Greek and U.S. patients using the c-statistics methodology. The study was registered on ""Research Registry"" with the unique identifying number 5901. RESULTS: A total of 214 patients (102 Greek) were included. The mean age was 64 years, 44% were female, and the median ESS was 7. The most common indication for surgery was hollow viscus perforation (25%). The ESS reliably and incrementally predicted mortality (c-statistics = 0.79 [95% CI 0.67–0.90] and 0.83 [95% CI 0.74–0.92]), morbidity (c-statistics = 0.83 [95% CI 0.76–0.91] and 0.79 [95% CI 0.69–0.88]), and ICU admission (c-statistics = 0.88 [95% CI 0.81–0.96] and 0.84 [95% CI 0.77–0.91]) in both Greek and U.S. patients. CONCLUSION: The correlation between the ESS and the surgical outcomes was statistically significant in both Greek and U.S. patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. ESS could prove globally useful for preoperative patient counseling and quality-of-care benchmarking.","Christou, Chrysanthos Dimitris; Naar, Leon; Kongkaewpaisan, Napaporn; Tsolakidis, Alexandros; Smyrnis, Panagiotis; Tooulias, Andreas; Tsoulfas, Georgios; Papadopoulos, Vasileios Nikolaos; Velmahos, George Constantinos; Kaafarani, Haytham Mohamed Ali",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8297717/,241

Increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis are common features in most diabetes complications. Although extensive studies have examined the biochemical pathways leading to the expression of inflammatory, profibrotic, and other pathological genes, as well as genetic factors related to diabetes and associated complications, much less is known about the contribution of epigenetic changes that occur without alterations in the DNA sequence. Environmental factors, lifestyles, and improper diet implicated in diabetes can affect epigenetic states. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, can alter gene transcription in response to environmental stimuli and cooperate with noncoding RNAs. These epigenetic modifications have been observed in various target cells under diabetic conditions. Moreover, epigenetics has also been implicated in the phenomenon of metabolic memory observed in clinic trials and animal studies, in which prior episodes of poor glycemic control can confer continued risk of complications despite subsequent glucose normalization. Epigenome-wide association studies in cohorts with diabetes are uncovering epigenotype variations that provide new insights into diabetic vascular complications. Here, I discuss the role of epigenetics and noncoding RNAs in diabetes complications and metabolic memory, and their translation potential to serve as biomarkers and drug targets to improve clinical management of diabetic vascular complications.","Natarajan, Rama",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/dbi20-0030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472942/,241

Objective To investigate potential transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 infection with epidemiologic evidence from a COVID-19 outbreak. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study examined a community COVID-19 outbreak in Zhejiang province. On January 19, 2020, 128 individuals took 2 buses (60 [46.9%] from bus 1 and 68 [53.1%] from bus 2) on a 100-minute round trip to attend a 150-minute worship event. The source patient was a passenger on bus 2. We compared risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection among at-risk individuals taking bus 1 (n = 60) and bus 2 (n = 67 [source patient excluded]) and among all other individuals (n = 172) attending the worship event. We also divided seats on the exposed bus into high-risk and low-risk zones according to the distance from the source patient and compared COVID-19 risks in each zone. In both buses, central air conditioners were in indoor recirculation mode. Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or by viral genome sequencing results. Attack rates for SARS-CoV-2 infection were calculated for different groups, and the spatial distribution of individuals who developed infection on bus 2 was obtained. Results Of the 128 participants, 15 (11.7%) were men, 113 (88.3%) were women, and the mean age was 58.6 years. On bus 2, 24 of the 68 individuals (35.3% [including the index patient]) received a diagnosis of COVID-19 after the event. Meanwhile, none of the 60 individuals in bus 1 were infected. Among the other 172 individuals at the worship event, 7 (4.1%) subsequently received a COVID-19 diagnosis. Individuals in bus 2 had a 34.3% (95% CI, 24.1%-46.3%) higher risk of getting COVID-19 compared with those in bus 1 and were 11.4 (95% CI, 5.1-25.4) times more likely to have COVID-19 compared with all other individuals attending the worship event. Within bus 2, individuals in high-risk zones had moderately, but nonsignificantly, higher risk for COVID-19 compared with those in the low-risk zones. The absence of a significantly increased risk in the part of the bus closer to the index case suggested that airborne spread of the virus may at least partially explain the markedly high attack rate observed. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study and case investigation of a community outbreak of COVID-19 in Zhejiang province, individuals who rode a bus to a worship event with a patient with COVID-19 had a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than individuals who rode another bus to the same event. Airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 seems likely to have contributed to the high attack rate in the exposed bus. Future efforts at prevention and control must consider the potential for airborne spread of the virus.","Shen, Ye; Li, Changwei; Dong, Hongjun; Wang, Zhen; Martinez, Leonardo; Sun, Zhou; Handel, Andreas; Chen, Zhiping; Chen, Enfu; Ebell, Mark H; Wang, Fan; Yi, Bo; Wang, Haibin; Wang, Xiaoxiao; Wang, Aihong; Chen, Bingbing; Qi, Yanling; Liang, Lirong; Li, Yang; Ling, Feng; Chen, Junfang; Xu, Guozhang",JAMA internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.5225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32870239/,241

RECENT FINDINGS Two randomized controlled studies have been published recently, with conflicting results. Although the evidence of the benefit of rituximab is limited, it is already incorporated into many treatment regimens, both in studies and in standard clinical practice. The use of rituximab in PCNSL is still a matter of debate. A positive effect on the outcome is uncertain. However, there are no clinical signs of significantly increased toxicity. The uncertain positive effect should therefore be weighed against the increased costs of the treatment.","Bromberg, Jacoline E C; van der Meulen, Matthijs; Doorduijn, Jeanette K",Current oncology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11912-020-00941-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602069/,241

64718,Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Bioactive Sphingolipids in Fungi.,2021,"OBJECTIVE Complex soft tissue reconstruction of the head and neck requires a viable, versatile, and dependable flap. Free flaps, such as the radial forearm and anterolateral thigh flap, have been the mainstay of complex head and neck reconstruction. However, a local pedicled flap, such as the submental island flap (SIF), could be a more effective and less demanding alternative. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to compare free tissue transfer (FTT) with the SIF for head and neck reconstruction. DATA SOURCES We performed a systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE databases. Meta-analysis was performed on outcomes reported in ≥3 studies. REVIEW METHODS Candidate articles were assessed for eligibility by 2 authors. Three authors performed data extraction and methodological quality of the included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Form for Cohort Studies. RESULTS The search strategy resulted in 450 studies, of which 7 were included in the analysis, yielding 155 SIF and 198 FTT cases. Operating time and length of stay were significantly lower for the SIF than for FTT (P = .05 and P = .0008). There was no significant difference between the groups for complete flap loss, debulking revisions, and oncologic recurrence. CONCLUSION These results suggest that the SIF reduces length of stay and operating time as compared with FTT in head and neck reconstruction. These findings suggest that the SIF can be considered an alternative reconstructive option to FTT when evaluating intraoral, lateral facial, skull base, and parotidectomy defects, given comparable defect size and tumor biology.","Jørgensen, Mads Gustaf; Tabatabaeifar, Siavosh; Toyserkani, Navid Mohamadpour; Sørensen, Jens Ahm",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599819875416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500500/,241

The discovery of viruses encoding deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) suggests they remove ubiquitin to evade ubiquitin-dependent antiviral responses; however, this has never been conclusively demonstrated in virus-infected cells. Arteriviruses are economically important positive-stranded RNA viruses that encode an ovarian tumor (OTU) domain DUB known as papain-like protease 2 (PLP2). This enzyme is essential for arterivirus replication by cleaving a site within the viral replicase polyproteins and also removes ubiquitin from cellular proteins. To dissect this dual specificity, which relies on a single catalytic site, we determined the crystal structure of equine arteritis virus PLP2 in complex with ubiquitin (1.45 Å). PLP2 binds ubiquitin using a zinc finger that is uniquely integrated into an exceptionally compact OTU-domain fold that represents a new subclass of zinc-dependent OTU DUBs. Notably, the ubiquitin-binding surface is distant from the catalytic site, which allowed us to mutate this surface to significantly reduce DUB activity without affecting polyprotein cleavage. Viruses harboring such mutations exhibited WT replication kinetics, confirming that PLP2-mediated polyprotein cleavage was intact, but the loss of DUB activity strikingly enhanced innate immune signaling. Compared with WT virus infection, IFN-β mRNA levels in equine cells infected with PLP2 mutants were increased by nearly an order of magnitude. Our findings not only establish PLP2 DUB activity as a critical factor in arteriviral innate immune evasion, but the selective inactivation of DUB activity also opens unique possibilities for developing improved live attenuated vaccines against arteriviruses and other viruses encoding similar dual-specificity proteases.","van Kasteren, Puck B; Bailey-Elkin, Ben A; James, Terrence W; Ninaber, Dennis K; Beugeling, Corrine; Khajehpour, Mazdak; Snijder, Eric J; Mark, Brian L; Kikkert, Marjolein",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1218464110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23401522/,241

However, the overall prevalence of urinary and sexual dysfunction remains unclear. Objective To evaluate the prevalence of urinary and sexual dysfunction in patients aged >10 yr after repair of ARM in infancy. Evidence acquisition A systematic literature review was performed using the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Selected studies were reviewed according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Standards for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) criteria. We included studies reporting the prevalence of the following outcomes: urinary incontinence (UI), lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NBD), sexual dysfunction (SD), erectile dysfunction (ED), ejaculatory dysfunction, and birth rate. We initially identified 588 studies, of which 17 were included for evidence synthesis. Evidence synthesis A probabilistic meta-analysis on each subgroup revealed the following combined prevalence estimates: UI 16% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7-27%), LUTS/NBD 36% (95% CI 13-62%), SD among women 50% (95% CI 34-66%), ED 12% (95% CI 7-18%), ejaculatory dysfunction 16% (95% CI 9-25%), and birth rate 20% (95% CI 7-38%). Subgroup analysis showed a higher prevalence of ED and ejaculatory dysfunction among patients with high ARM severity when compared to low ARM severity. Conclusions Among patients undergoing ARM repair, we found a high prevalence of long-term impairment of UI, ED, and SD. We stress the need for larger multicentre trials with more comparable populations to optimise treatment and follow-up regimens. Patient summary We reviewed long-term outcomes for patients with anorectal malformations who underwent surgery and found that both urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunctions are common for both males and females.","Bjoersum-Meyer, Thomas; Kaalby, Lasse; Lund, Lars; Christensen, Peter; Jakobsen, Marianne S; Baatrup, Gunnar; Qvist, Niels; Ellebaek, Mark",European urology open science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euros.2021.01.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34337501/,241

The purpose of this study was to assess persistence with osteoporosis treatment in patients from the FLS over a period of 1 year, and to determine predictors of discontinuation. METHODS The study population comprised adults of both genders, aged 50 or over, admitted to Lille University Hospital between January 2016 and January 2019 for a low-trauma fracture and managed in our FLS. Outcomes included (1) persistence rate at 1 year after treatment initiation, (2) persistence rate at 2 years after treatment initiation, (3) persistence rate at 1 and 2 years after treatment initiation according to type of treatment, (4) predictors of non-persistence, and (5) reasons for discontinuing treatment over 1 year after initiation. Persistence was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS In all, 1,224 patients (≥ 50 years old) with a recent history of low-trauma fracture (≤ 12 months) were identified. Of these, 380 patients - 79.2% female; mean (SD) age 76 (11) years - were seen at the FLS. In those 380 patients, 410 fractures were found and 360 of them (87.8%) were major fractures, breaking down as follows: vertebra (44%), hip (19%), proximal humerus (10%), and pelvis (8%). Osteoporosis treatment was prescribed for 367 (96.6%) patients and 275 of them began the prescribed treatment. The following anti-osteoporosis drugs were prescribed: zoledronic acid (n=150, 54.5%), teriparatide (n=63, 22.9%), and denosumab (n=39, 14.2%). Oral bisphosphonates were prescribed for a few patients (n=23, 8.4%). Persistence with osteoporosis medication (any class) was estimated at 84.1% (95% CI: 79.1% to 88.1%) at 12-month follow-up, and dropped to 70.3% (95% CI: 63.7% to 75.9%) at 24 months. When drug-specific analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, persistence rates at 12 and 24 months were found to be higher with denosumab than with any other treatment. Independent predictors of non-persistence at 12 months were 'follow-up performed by a general practitioner (GP)' - Odds Ratio (OR) for GP vs. FLS = 3.68; 95% CI, 1.52 to 8.90, p=0.004 - and 'treatment with zoledronic acid' - OR for zoledronic acid vs. denosumab = 3.39; 95% CI, 1.21 to 9.50, p=0.019; OR for zoledronic acid vs. teriparatide = 8.86; 95% CI, 1.15 to 68.10, p=0.035. CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence of the success of our FLS in terms of long-term persistence with osteoporosis treatments.

70455,Correction to: Visualization and Functional Analysis of Spindle Actin and Chromosome Segregation in Mammalian Oocytes.,2020,"BACKGROUND Foot orthoses (FOs) have been widely prescribed to alter various lower limb disorders. FOs' geometrical design and material properties have been shown to influence their impact on foot biomechanics. New technologies such as 3D printing provide the potential to produce custom shapes and add functionalities to FOs by adding extra-components. RESEARCH QUESTION The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of 3D printed FOs stiffness and newly design postings on foot kinematics and plantar pressures in healthy people. METHODS Two pairs of ¾ length prefabricated 3D printed FOs were administered to 15 healthy participants with normal foot posture. FOs were of different stiffness and were designed so that extra-components, innovative flat postings, could be inserted at the rearfoot. In-shoe multi-segment foot kinematics as well as plantar pressures were recorded while participants walked on a treadmill. One-way ANOVAs using statistical non-parametric mapping were performed to estimate the effect of FOs stiffness and then the addition of postings during the stance phase of walking. RESULTS Increasing FOs stiffness altered frontal and transverse plane foot kinematics, especially by further reducing rearfoot eversion and increasing the rearfoot abduction. Postings had notable effect on rearfoot frontal plane kinematics, by enhancing FOs effect. Looking at plantar pressures, wearing FOs was associated with a shift of the loads from the rearfoot to the midfoot region. Higher peak pressures under the rearfoot and midfoot (up to +31.7 %) were also observed when increasing the stiffness of the FOs. SIGNIFICANCE 3D printing techniques offer a wide range of possibilities in terms of material properties and design, providing clinicians the opportunity to administer FOs that could be modulated according to pathologies as well as during the treatment by adding extra-components. Further studies including people presenting musculoskeletal disorders are required.","Desmyttere, Gauthier; Leteneur, Sébastien; Hajizadeh, Maryam; Bleau, Jacinte; Begon, Mickael",Gait & posture,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2020.07.146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818861/,241

To what extent are the mechanical-ventilatory responses to upper-body exercise influenced by task-specific locomotor mechanics? What is the main finding and its importance? When compared with lower-body exercise performed at similar ventilations, upper-body exercise was characterized by tidal volume constraint, dynamic lung hyperinflation and an increased propensity towards neuromechanical uncoupling of the respiratory system. Importantly, these responses were independent of respiratory dysfunction and flow limitation. Thus, the mechanical ventilatory responses to upper-body exercise are attributable, in part, to task-specific locomotor mechanics (i.e. non-respiratory loading of the thorax). ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which the mechanical ventilatory responses to upper-body exercise are influenced by task-specific locomotor mechanics. Eight healthy men (mean ± SD: age, 24 ± 5 years; mass, 74 ± 11 kg; and stature, 1.79 ± 0.07 m) completed two maximal exercise tests, on separate days, comprising 4 min stepwise increments of 15 W during upper-body exercise (arm-cranking) or 30 W during lower-body exercise (leg-cycling). The tests were repeated at work rates calculated to elicit 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% of the peak ventilation achieved during arm-cranking ( V ̇ E , UBE ). Exercise measures included pulmonary ventilation and gas exchange, oesophageal pressure-derived indices of respiratory mechanics, operating lung volumes and expiratory flow limitation. Subjects exhibited normal resting pulmonary function. Arm-crank exercise elicited significantly lower peak values for work rate, O2 uptake, CO2 output, minute ventilation and tidal volume (p < 0.05). At matched ventilations, arm-crank exercise restricted tidal volume expansion relative to leg-cycling exercise at 60% V ̇ E , UBE (1.74 ± 0.61 versus 2.27 ± 0.68 l, p < 0.001), 80% V ̇ E , UBE (2.07 ± 0.70 versus 2.52 ± 0.67 l, p < 0.001) and 100% V ̇ E , UBE (1.97 ± 0.85 versus 2.55 ± 0.72 l, p = 0.002). Despite minimal evidence of expiratory flow limitation, expiratory reserve volume was significantly higher during arm-cranking versus leg-cycling exercise at 100% V ̇ E , UBE (39 ± 8 versus 29 ± 8% of vital capacity, p = 0.002). At any given ventilation, arm-cranking elicited greater inspiratory effort (oesophageal pressure) relative to thoracic displacement (tidal volume). Arm-cranking exercise is sufficient to provoke respiratory mechanical derangements (restricted tidal volume expansion, dynamic hyperinflation and neuromechanical uncoupling) in subjects with normal pulmonary function and expiratory flow reserve. These responses are likely to be attributable to task-specific locomotor mechanics (i.e. non-respiratory loading of the thorax).","Tiller, Nicholas B; Campbell, Ian G; Romer, Lee M",Experimental physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep087648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919515/,241
70602,WAVE1 and WAVE2 have distinct and overlapping roles in controlling actin assembly at the leading edge.,2020-07-22,"BACKGROUND Intravenous (IV) lysis with alteplase is known to increase biomarkers of blood brain barrier breakdown and has therefore been associated with secondary injuries such as hemorrhagic transformation. The impact of alteplase on brain edema formation, however, has not been investigated yet. The purpose was to examine the effects of IV alteplase on ischemic lesion water homeostasis differentiated from final tissue infarct in patients with and without successful endovascular therapy (sET). METHODS 232 middle cerebral artery stroke patients were analyzed. 147 patients received IV alteplase, of which 106 patients received subsequent sET. Out of 85 patients without IV alteplase, 50 received sET. Ischemic brain edema was quantified in admission and follow-up CT using quantitative lesion water uptake (NWU) and its difference was calculated (ΔNWU). The relationship of alteplase on ΔNWU and edema-corrected final infarct volume was analyzed using univariate and multivariate linear regression models. RESULTS The mean ΔNWU was 11.8% (SD,7.9) in patients with alteplase and 11.5% (SD,8.3) in patients without alteplase (p=0.8). Alteplase was not associated with lowered ΔNWU while being associated with reduced edema-corrected tissue infarct volume (-27.4 mL; 95%CI: -49.4 to -5.4 mL; p=0.02), adjusted for ASPECTS and recanalization status. In patients with sET, ΔNWU was 10.5% (95%CI: 6.3-10.5%) for patients with IV alteplase and 8.4% (95%CI: 9.1-12.0) for patients without IV alteplase. CONCLUSION The application of IV alteplase did not significantly alter ischemic lesion water homeostasis, but was associated with reduced edema-corrected tissue infarct volume, which might directly be linked to improved functional outcome.","Broocks, Gabriel; Kniep, Helge; Kemmling, Andre; Flottmann, Fabian; Nawabi, Jawed; Elsayed, Sarah; Schön, Gerhard; Thomalla, Götz; Fiehler, Jens; Hanning, Uta",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529738/,241

MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective cohort study was conducted on pregnant women with COVID-19. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of a nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimen was used for the diagnosis. Initial Ct values for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR tests were recorded. 22.9 was the 50th percentile Ct value of the study population. The study population was divided into two groups based on their Ct values: (1) Cases with Higher Ct values (Ct > 22.9)(n = 50) and (2) Cases with lower Ct values (Ct ≤ 22.9)(n = 55). Demographic features, clinical characteristics, disease progression, laboratory test results and pregnancy outcomes were compared between the groups. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the performance of Ct values in predicting obstetric complications. RESULTS Obstetric complication rate was significantly higher in cases with lower Ct values (p < .001). A significantly lower lymphocyte count together with higher ESR, procalcitonin and IL-6 values were observed in the cases with lower Ct values (p > .05). Additionally, a significantly higher NICU admission rate and longer hospital stays were present in the cases with lower Ct values (p > .05). The value in ROC curves with the best balance of sensitivity/specificity was 22.5 (85.7% sensitivity, 63.6% specificity). CONCLUSION Lower Ct values may be associated with an increased rate of obstetric complications in pregnant women with COVID-19. Physicians should be cautious in the management of cases with Ct levels below 22.5.","Tanacan, Atakan; Anuk, Ali Taner; Erol, Seyit Ahmet; Keskin, Huseyin Levent; Altinboga, Orhan; Yakistiran, Betul; Aydogan, Sibel; Unlu, Serpil; Eyi, Elif Gul Yapar; Tayman, Cuneyt; Dinc, Bedia; Sahin, Dilek; Moraloglu Tekin, Ozlem","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1900105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33706649/,241

75045,Applying active learning in a virtual classroom such as a molecular biology escape room.,2020-08-19,"BACKGROUND The United States (US) is ranked 22nd on the Global Terrorism Index (2019), a scoring system of terrorist activities. While the global number of deaths from terrorism over the past five years is down, the number of countries affected by terrorism is growing and the health care repercussions remain significant. Counter-Terrorism Medicine (CTM) is rapidly emerging as a necessary sub-specialty, and this study aims to provide the epidemiological context over the past decade supporting this need by detailing the unique injury types responders are likely to encounter and setting the stage for the development of training programs utilizing these data. METHODS The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) was searched for all attacks in the US from 2008-2018. Attacks met inclusion criteria if they fulfilled the three terrorism-related criteria as set by the GTD. Ambiguous events were excluded when there was uncertainty as to whether the incident met all of the criteria for inclusion in the GTD. The grey literature was reviewed, and each event was cross-matched with reputable international and national newspaper sources online to confirm or add details regarding weapon type used and, whenever available, details of victim and perpetrator fatalities and injuries. RESULTS In total, 304 events were recorded during the period of study. Of the 304 events, 117 (38.5%) used incendiary-only weapons, 80 (26.3%) used firearms as their sole weapon, 55 (18.1%) used explosives, bombs, or dynamite (E/B/D), 23 (7.6%) were melee-only, six (2.0%) used vehicles-only, four (1.3%) were chemicals-only, two (0.7%) used sabotage equipment, two (0.7%) were listed as ""others,"" and one (0.3%) used biological weapon. There was no recorded nuclear or radiological weapon use. In addition, 14 (4.6%) events used a mix of weapons. CONCLUSIONS In the decade from 2008 through 2018, terrorist attacks on US soil used weapons with well-understood injury-causing modalities. A total of 217 fatal injuries (FI) and 660 non-fatal injuries (NFI) were sustained as a result of these events during that period.Incendiary weapons were the most commonly chosen methodology, followed by firearms and E/B/D attacks. Firearm events contributed to a disproportionality high fatality count while E/B/D events contributed to a disproportionally high NFI count.","Tin, Derrick; Hart, Alexander; Ciottone, Gregory R",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x21000558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134816/,241

77232,Instrumental analysis of RNA modifications.,2021-02-22,"Introduction To assess the cost-effectiveness of stent-retriever mechanical thrombectomy and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator compared with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator alone in patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusions in Spain. Materials and methods Clinical data were taken from the SWIFT PRIME clinical trial. A lifetime Markov state transition model defined by the modified Rankin Scale score was developed to estimate costs and health outcomes (life years gained and quality adjusted life years). A Spanish National Health System perspective (direct medical costs) was considered. Resource utilisation and utilities were obtained from available published data and endorsed by an expert panel. Costs (€, 2016) were obtained from various Spanish sources. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results Stent-retriever thrombectomy after intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was associated with better outcomes (1.17 life years gained and 2.51 quality adjusted life years) and savings of €44,378, resulting in a dominant therapy over intravenous tissue plasminogen activator alone. A net monetary benefit of €119,744 was obtained considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000/quality adjusted life year gained. The combined therapy was also dominant in all sensitivity analyses, deterministic and probabilistic. Discussion The results were consistent with a previously published cost-effectiveness analysis and reinforce the likeliness of the selection of stent-retriever mechanical thrombectomy plus intravenous tissue plasminogen activator over intravenous tissue plasminogen activator alone. Conclusion Stent-retriever thrombectomy after intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is a dominant alternative over intravenous tissue plasminogen activator alone (more effective and less costly) for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusions in the Spanish setting.","de Andrés-Nogales, Fernando; Álvarez, María; de Miquel, María Ángeles; Segura, Tomás; Gil, Alberto; Cardona, Pere; Casado, Miguel Ángel; Nogueira, Raul G; Dávalos, Antoni",European stroke journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987317721865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008321/,241

Rheumatic diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases, the prevalence and impact of which in COVID-19 patients are poorly known. We performed a pooled analysis of published data intending to summarize clinical presentation and patient outcomes in those with established rheumatic disease diagnosis and concurrent COVID-19. METHODS PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify studies reporting data about rheumatic disease patients who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and published until July 22, 2020. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled incidence and rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality among these patients, and interstudy heterogeneity was identified using I2 statistics with greater than 75% value indicating substantial interstudy variation. RESULTS Twenty studies were included, giving a total sample size of 49,099 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of 49,099 COVID-19 patients, a total of 1382 were also diagnosed with a rheumatic disease in the past. The random-effects pooled prevalence of COVID-19 among rheumatic disease patients was found to be 0.9%. The rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality were 70.7%, 11.6%, and 10.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Although the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not dramatically high in rheumatic disease patients, concurrent COVID-19 does seem to play a role in determining disease severity and outcomes to some extent. Further studies are needed to give conclusive evidence about whether this subset of the population is at a higher risk of COVID-19 and related outcomes compared with the population at large.","Sachdeva, Sonali; Manaktala, Pritika; Malik, Faizan Ahmad; Gupta, Udita; Desai, Rupak",Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/rhu.0000000000001746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33902097/,241
78421,Mutant Construction and Integration Vector-Mediated Genetic Complementation in Listeria monocytogenes.,2021,"Computed Tomography (CT) plays an important role in monitoring radiation-induced Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF), where accurate segmentation of the PF lesions is highly desired for diagnosis and treatment follow-up. However, the task is challenged by ambiguous boundary, irregular shape, various position and size of the lesions, as well as the difficulty in acquiring a large set of annotated volumetric images for training. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel convolutional neural network called PF-Net and incorporate it into a semi-supervised learning framework based on Iterative Confidence-based Refinement And Weighting of pseudo Labels (I-CRAWL). Our PF-Net combines 2D and 3D convolutions to deal with CT volumes with large inter-slice spacing, and uses multi-scale guided dense attention to segment complex PF lesions. For semi-supervised learning, our I-CRAWL employs pixel-level uncertainty-based confidence-aware refinement to improve the accuracy of pseudo labels of unannotated images, and uses image-level uncertainty for confidence-based image weighting to suppress low-quality pseudo labels in an iterative training process. Extensive experiments with CT scans of Rhesus Macaques with radiation-induced PF showed that: 1) PF-Net achieved higher segmentation accuracy than existing 2D, 3D and 2.5D neural networks, and 2) I-CRAWL outperformed state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods for the PF lesion segmentation task. Our method has a potential to improve the diagnosis of PF and clinical assessment of side effects of radiotherapy for lung cancers.","Wang, Guotai; Zhai, Shuwei; Lasio, Giovanni; Zhang, Baoshe; Yi, Byong; Chen, Shifeng; Macvittie, Thomas J; Metaxas, Dimitris; Zhou, Jinghao; Zhang, Shaoting",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2021.3117564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34606451/,241

While iOAT is part of the continuum of care for OUD in some European countries and in some parts of Canada, it is not an available treatment in the United States. We suggest that one reason for this situation is the belief that a genuine treatment for substance use disorder cannot prescribe the same substance as that used. We examine possible rationales for this belief by considering four combinations of views on the constitutive causal basis of substance use disorders and the definition of effective treatment. We show that all but one combination counts iOAT as a genuine treatment and that there are good reasons to reject the one that does not. Specifically, we claim that medical interventions, such as iOAT, that significantly reduce the severity of a disorder deserve to be categorized as effective treatments and regarded as such in practice.","Steel, Daniel; Tekin, Şerife",Kennedy Institute of Ethics journal,https://doi.org/10.1353/ken.2021.0022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34565745/,241

We designed AdH5 vectors expressing antigen under the control of a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immediate-early promoter containing its intron A sequence. The transcriptional levels of antigen and immune responses to antigen for vectors with the HCMV promoter with the intron A sequence (LP) were greater than those for AdH5 vectors using the HCMV promoter sequence without intron A (SP). We compared an E1E3-deleted AdH5 adenoviral vector, which affords more space for insertion of foreign sequences, and showed it to be as immunogenic as an E1-deleted AdH5 vector. Neutralizing antibodies to AdH5 limit the efficacy of vaccines based on the AdH5 serotype, and simian adenoviral vectors offer an attractive option to overcome this problem. We constructed E1E3-deleted human and simian adenoviral vectors encoding the pre-erythrocytic-stage malarial antigen Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein. We compared the immunogenicity and efficacy of AdC6, a recombinant simian adenovirus serotype 6 vector, in a murine malaria model to those of AdH5 and the poxviral vectors MVA and FP9. AdC6 induced sterile protection from a single dose in 90% of mice, in contrast to AdH5 (25%) and poxviral vectors MVA and FP9 (0%). Adenoviral vectors maintained potent CD8(+) T-cell responses for a longer period after immunization than did poxviral vectors and mainly induced an effector memory phenotype of cells. Significantly, AdC6 was able to maintain protection in the presence of preexisting immunity to AdH5.","Sridhar, S; Reyes-Sandoval, A; Draper, S J; Moore, A C; Gilbert, S C; Gao, G P; Wilson, J M; Hill, A V S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02568-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18256155/,241
83072,"Avian parvovirus: classification, phylogeny, pathogenesis and diagnosis.",2018,"Macro domains (also called ""X domains"") constitute a protein module family present in all kingdoms of life, including viruses of the Coronaviridae and Togaviridae families. Crystal structures of the macro domain from the Chikungunya virus (an ""Old World"" alphavirus) and the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (a ""New World"" alphavirus) were determined at resolutions of 1.65 and 2.30 A, respectively. These domains are active as adenosine di-phosphoribose 1''-phosphate phosphatases. Both the Chikungunya and the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus macro domains are ADP-ribose binding modules, as revealed by structural and functional analysis. A single aspartic acid conserved through all macro domains is responsible for the specific binding of the adenine base. Sequence-unspecific binding to long, negatively charged polymers such as poly(ADP-ribose), DNA, and RNA is observed and attributed to positively charged patches outside of the active site pocket, as judged by mutagenesis and binding studies. The crystal structure of the Chikungunya virus macro domain with an RNA trimer shows a binding mode utilizing the same adenine-binding pocket as ADP-ribose, but avoiding the ADP-ribose 1''-phosphate phosphatase active site. This leaves the AMP binding site as the sole common feature in all macro domains.","Malet, Hélène; Coutard, Bruno; Jamal, Saïd; Dutartre, Hélène; Papageorgiou, Nicolas; Neuvonen, Maarit; Ahola, Tero; Forrester, Naomi; Gould, Ernest A; Lafitte, Daniel; Ferron, Francois; Lescar, Julien; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Canard, Bruno",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00189-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19386706/,241

Methods: Six adult horses were enrolled in a prospective randomized crossover design. Horses were administered one treatment per day, with a seven day washout period: (a) meperidine 1 mg/kg IM, saline 6 mL SC; (b) saline 6 mL IM, meperidine 1 mg/kg SC; (c) saline 6 mL SC, saline 6 mL IM. Blood samples were obtained for plasmatic histamine (baseline, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min) via LC-MS/MS and plasmatic tryptase (baseline, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min) quantification with enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays. Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentrations prior to any meperidine treatment and 7-14 days following the first meperidine treatment were evaluated with enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays. Histamine and tryptase concentrations were evaluated with a mixed-effect analysis of variance. The levels of IgE at baseline (before the administration of the first dose of meperidine) were compared with the IgE values at 60 min following the second meperidine administration with the Paired t test. Biopsies of localized injection site reactions from subcutaneous meperidine administration were collected from two horses. Results: No statistically significant elevations from baseline in histamine (p = 0.595), tryptase (p = 0.836), or IgE (p = 0.844) were found in any of the horses in this study. There were no differences between treatment groups. Administration of SC meperidine caused a localized vasculitis and thrombosis with regional edema and hemorrhage. Conclusion: No evidence of anaphylactoid or anaphylactic type reactions occurred following IM or SC meperidine administration.","Trenholme, H Nicole; Sakai, Daniel M; Berghaus, Londa J; Hanafi, Amanda L; Knych, Heather K; Ryan, Clare A; McHale, Brittany; Banovic, Frane; Quandt, Jane E; Barletta, Michele; Reed, Rachel A",Frontiers in veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.584922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33426016/,241

It is unknown whether this is due to a generalized humoral prothrombotic state or endothelial factors such as inflammation and dysfunction. The aim was to further characterize thrombin generation using a novel analyser (ST Genesia, Diagnostica Stago, Asnières, France) and a panel of haematological analytes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS Platelet poor plasma of 34 patients with noncritical COVID-19 was compared with 75 patients with critical COVID-19 (as defined by WHO criteria) in a retrospective study by calibrated automated thrombography and ELISA. Patients were matched for baseline characteristics of age and gender. RESULTS Critical patients had significantly increased fibrinogen, CRP, interleukin-6 and D-dimer compared to noncritical patients. Thrombin generation, in critical patients, was right shifted without significant differences in peak, velocity index or endogenous thrombin potential. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were significantly increased in the critical versus noncritical patients. Critically ill patients were on haemodiafiltration (31%; heparin used in the circuit) or often received escalated prophylactic low-molecular weight heparin. CONCLUSION These results confirm increased fibrinogen and D-dimer in critical COVID-19-infected patients. Importantly, disease severity did not increase thrombin generation (including thrombin-antithrombin complexes and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2) when comparing both cohorts; counter-intuitively critical patients were hypocoaguable. tPA, TFPI and VEGF were increased in critical patients, which are hypothesized to reflect endothelial dysfunction and/or contribution of heparin (which may cause endothelial TFPI/tPA release).","White, Danielle; MacDonald, Stephen; Edwards, Tara; Bridgeman, Chris; Hayman, Megan; Sharp, Megan; Cox-Morton, Sally; Duff, Emily; Mahajan, Swati; Moore, Chloe; Kirk, Melissa; Williams, Richard; Besser, Martin; Thomas, Will",International journal of laboratory hematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijlh.13329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32892505/,241

MATERIALS AND METHODS Adult male mice were decerebrated and arterially perfused with a carbogenated Ringer's solution to establish the decerebrate arterially perfused mouse (DAPM). To allow distinction between central neural and peripheral actions of sildenafil, experiments were conducted in both the DAPM and in a 'pithed' DAPM, which has no functional brainstem or spinal cord. The action of systemic and intrathecal sildenafil on micturition was assessed in urethane-anaesthetised mice. RESULTS In the DAPM, systemic perfusion of sildenafil (30 pm) decreased the voiding threshold pressure [to a mean (sem) 84.7 (3.8)% of control] and increased bladder compliance [to a mean (sem) 140.2 (8.3)% of control, an effect replicated in the pithed DAPM]. Sildenafil was without effect on most voiding variables but significantly increased the number of bursts of the external urethral sphincter (EUS) per void in DAPM [to a mean (sem) 130.1 (6.9)% of control at 30 pm] and in urethane-anaesthetised mice [to a mean (sem) 117.5 (5.8)% of control at 14 ng/kg]. Sildenafil (10 and 30 pm) increased pelvic afferent activity during both bladder filling and the isovolumetric phase [to a mean (sem) 205.4 (30.2)% of control at 30 pm]. Intrathecal application of sildenafil (5 μL of either 150 pm or 1.5 nm) did not alter cystometry and EUS-electromyography variables in urethane-anaesthetised mice. CONCLUSIONS Low-dose sildenafil increases bladder compliance, increases pelvic nerve afferent activity, and augments the bursting activity of the EUS. We propose that the novel actions on afferent traffic and sphincter control may contribute to its beneficial actions to restore storage and voiding efficiency in LUT dysfunction.","Ito, Hiroki; Chakrabarty, Basu; Drake, Marcus J; Fry, Christopher H; Kanai, Anthony J; Pickering, Anthony E",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.14664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30636087/,241

This study aims to assess the clinical features of fracture patients at our hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak and formulate the medical steps to ensure the effective treatment of fracture patients with minimal risk of infection to healthcare workers. Methods One hundred twelve patients with different fractures that were admitted to the orthopedics department of our hospital from January 24 to March 9 in 2020 were reviewed. Data including age, gender, injury location, admission time, operation time, discharge time were compared with fracture patients from the same period in 2019. Results Compared to the same period in 2019, there is a 42% decrease in the number of fracture patients in 2020. Specifically, the incidences of forearm, thigh, hand, and foot fractures have increased during the COVID-19 outbreak, while other parts are less affected. The time from injury to hospitalization, the surgery wait time and time of discharge after surgery for patients with hip fractures were 2.9±7.1, 2.0±1.7 and 7.7±4.0 days respectively in 2019, which changed to 2.0±5.0, 4.5±4.0 and 10.6±4.2 days in 2020. Following the orthopedic treatment regimen followed at our hospital, all patients had non-life-threatening limb fractures. Six patients were operated in a negative pressure room, and emergency screening was completed for six patients. No patients were positive for COVID-19, and all were discharged safely without infection or other serious complications. Conclusions Hip fractures are highly prevalent during this epidemic. However, mandatory screening delays surgery by more than 48 hours. The orthopedic department should prioritize screening of emergency patients to minimize the risk of infection among other patients and medical personnel.","Yu, Pei; Wu, Chuanlong; Zhuang, Chengyu; Ye, Tingjun; Zhang, Yin; Liu, Jingfeng; Wang, Lei",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-4174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953732/,241
85703,Effects of dietary vitamin A content on antibody responses of feedlot calves inoculated intramuscularly with an inactivated bovine coronavirus vaccine.,2013,"BACKGROUND Homelessness is a growing concern as it affects a large number of people worldwide. Individuals and families experiencing homelessness are vulnerable in terms of health and underutilise health services. Despite being a global problem, not much is known about the range and breath of literature exploring health problems and health care service utilisation among homeless adults in Africa. OBJECTIVES To identify the nature and scope of existing evidence on physical and mental health, and health service utilisation among homeless adults in Africa. The review aimed to examine how research is conducted, identify gaps, guide future research, and make recommendations for development and implementation of policies and practices. METHODS A search of articles and reports involving six databases: Scopus, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, African Journal Online, and Google Scholar was conducted from June 2018 to February 2019. Studies published between 1980 and 2019 that examined the health problems and health service utilisation among homeless adults in Africa were considered. Manual search in reference lists and grey literature was also done to add reports. Data was extracted manually using a charting developed. A descriptive analysis and narrative synthesis were performed. RESULTS Of 761 records found, 14 satisfied the pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three themes emerged from the studies: Physical health problems, mental health problems; and healthcare services utilisation. Of the 14 included studies, nine studied and reported physical health problems such as sexually transmitted infections, injuries and disabilities, respiratory and cardiac diseases. Five studies explored mental health problems such as psychotic disorders, mood disorders, self-harm and suicidal behaviour. Only five studies investigated utilisation of different types of health care services among homeless people. CONCLUSIONS Evidence shows that homeless adults suffered from a range of physical and mental health problems, and underutilisation of health care services. However, there is lack of information on the complex interrelationship between homelessness and health, as well as differences in prevalence of health problems among the various sub-groups of homeless. There is also lack of information regarding utilisation other important healthcare services such as mental health services, alcohol and drugs services, and accident and emergency service, and future researches should address that. Also, attention should be given to intervention models for complex and effective physical and psychiatric care as well as social support to address the homeless people's health vulnerabilities.","Osei Asibey, Benedict; Conroy, Elizabeth; Marjadi, Brahmaputra",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-08648-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32357856/,241
87650,"Coronavirus Diseases in Pregnant Women, the Placenta, Fetus, and Neonate.",2021,"OBJECTIVES Limited involvement of the major peripancreatic vessels is no longer considered a contraindication for resection in cases of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Extended open pancreatectomies associated with vascular resection are performed in experienced centers with mortality and morbidity rates comparable to standard pancreatic resection. We evaluate the safety, feasibility, and outcomes of robotic extended pancreatectomy with vascular resection. METHODS We reviewed data of 5 patients with a median age of 60 years (range, 52-74 years) who underwent robotic surgery for pancreatic tumors with vascular involvement between May 2007 and March 2010 at our institution. The types of resection included 2 left-sided splenopancreatectomy with celiac axis resection, 1 left-sided splenopancreatectomy with portal vein resection, and 2 pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein resection. RESULTS No conversions occurred. The overall mean operating time was 392 ± 66 minutes (range, 310-460 min). The overall mean blood loss was 200 ± 61 mL (range, 150-300 mL) with no transfusions. No mortalities occurred. At a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 3-20 months), 4 patients were alive and disease free. CONCLUSIONS This early series by a single surgeon supports the feasibility and safety of robotic pancreatectomy with vascular resection for selected patients with locally advanced pancreatic tumor.","Giulianotti, Pier Cristoforo; Addeo, Pietro; Buchs, Nicolas Christian; Ayloo, Subhashini M; Bianco, Francesco Maria",Pancreas,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpa.0b013e318220e3a4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21785385/,241
87981,Influence of transfusion of lymphokine-activated T killer cells on inflammatory responses in dogs after laparotomy.,2016,"BACKGROUND Many patients undergoing cardiac device implantation are taking direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC). Continuing DOAC during device implantation may increase periprocedural bleeding risk; however, interrupting DOACs may increase thromboembolic risk. OBJECTIVE To compare the incidence of clinically significant pocket hematoma and thromboembolism in patients who have their DOAC continued or interrupted for cardiac device implantation. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL until December 2019 and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that compared outcomes after continuing or interrupting DOAC during cardiac device implantation. Independently and in duplicate, reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full-text of potentially eligible studies. They then evaluated risk of bias and abstracted data. RCT data were pooled using a fixed-effect model. Quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS Two RCTs, representing 763 patients, and 3 observational studies met eligibility criteria. In RCTs, continuing DOAC for device implantation compared to interrupting DOAC resulted in no significant difference in clinically significant pocket hematoma (2.1% vs. 1.8%; RR 1.15; 95%CI 0.44-3.05) or thromboembolism (0.03% vs. 0.03%; RR 1.02; 95%CI 0.06-16.21). Quality of evidence for both outcomes was moderate due to imprecision. Observational studies showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS Continuing DOACs for device implantation results in little to no difference in the incidence of clinically significant pocket hematoma or thromboembolism. Given the ease of stopping and re-starting DOACs, interrupting DOACs may be the preferred strategy for most patients. However, whenever continuous therapeutic anti-coagulation is desired, DOAC continuation should be preferred over bridging with parenteral anticoagulation. This article is protected by copyright.

A case study was carried out in Savar Upazila, a sub-district of the capital city Dhaka in Bangladesh, which is traversed by a prominent national highway (Dhaka- Aricha-N5) that also passes the concentric industrial export processing zone surrounding Dhaka. This municipality is thus part of a high-density transport network with extensive economic activities. COVID-19 data were collected from local records at the Upazila Health Complex, while spatial data of the Savar Upazila, including the pertinent road network, were identified and digitized using geographical information systems software.

ALPPS procedure using ischemic bipartition of the liver is a modified technique that may reduce complications compared to classical ALPPS. PATIENT CONCERNS Two patients with multiple colorectal liver metastasis with extensive involvement of the liver were considered unresectable before treatment because of small future liver remnant (FLR). DIAGNOSES Two patients were diagnosed by imaging examination with volumetry of the liver. INTERVENTIONS In the first stage, ischemic bipartition of the liver is achieved using radiofrequency ablation. The Glissonian pedicles from Segment 4 are identified and ablated, the FLR is cleared, and the right portal vein is ligated. In the second stage, the typical procedure is performed, and an extended liver resection is performed. OUTCOMES The procedure was feasible with acceptable hypertrophy of FLRs. Blood transfusions were unnecessary, and severe postoperative complications were avoided. LESSONS The ALPPS procedure with ischemic bipartition is safe and feasible and can produce results that are the same as those of the classical ALPPS procedure while reducing invasiveness during the first stage.","Machado, Marcel C C; Abe, Emerson S; Dumarco, Rodrigo; Viana, Públio; Machado, Marcel Autran C",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000011656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30075551/,241

Incidence of HAV infection is low in the United States, mostly related to consumption of contaminated food. Starting in 2017, Indiana reported a large HAV outbreak. We sought to characterize the risk-exposures, clinical features and outcomes of HAV and examine the differences based on underlying cirrhosis and age. Adults ≥18 years diagnosed with HAV between January 2017 and April 2019 at two large health care systems in Indiana were identified. Demographic data, risk-exposures, clinical features, laboratory data, and clinical outcomes were collected for analysis. The HAV cohort constituted 264 individuals with mean-age of 41-years, 62% male, and 94% Caucasian. Risk-exposures identified were illicit-drug use (74%), food-borne (15%), person to person (11%), and incarceration (11%). Mortality rate was 2%, acute liver failure (ALF) was seen in 4%, acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) in 30% (6 of 20 with underlying cirrhosis). Admission MELD score was the only factor associated with ALF [OR=1.17 (1.08-1.2), p<0.0001], on multivariable logistic regression analysis. Higher proportion of individuals with underlying cirrhosis developed acute kidney injury (AKI) (26% vs. 9%, p=0.03), ascites (45% vs. 11%, p<0.0001) and hepatic encephalopathy (35% vs. 4%, p<0.0001). In conclusion, illicit-drug use was the predominant risk-exposure in the current HAV outbreak, which was associated with 2% mortality rate, and those with cirrhosis had worse outcomes (AKI, ascites and HE), of whom 30% developed ACLF.","Samala, Niharika; Abdallah, Wassim; Poole, Ashley; Shamseddeen, Hani; Are, Vijay; Orman, Eric; Patidar, Kavish R; Vuppalanchi, Raj",Journal of viral hepatitis,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvh.13504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763937/,241

This study aimed to assess the tolerability of adjuvant GnP in Japanese patients with resected PC. METHODS This was a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study of patients with resected PC in Japan. Patients received 125 mg/m2 of nab-paclitaxel and 1000 mg/m2 of gemcitabine on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle for a total of 6 cycles. The primary end point was tolerability, defined as the absence of specific grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events by the end of cycle 2. Secondary end points included safety, disease-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS Forty-one patients were enrolled between June 2016 and February 2017 (median age, 68 years; 51% male; stage II, 95%). Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel met the tolerability criteria in 39 of the 40 patients included in the tolerability analysis set (97.5%). The most common treatment-related adverse events were leukopenia, neutropenia, alopecia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. After a follow-up of 30.1 months, median disease-free survival was 17.0 months and median overall survival was not reached.

For the general public and for people with mental illnesses, this pandemic may cause mental/physical stress and major life impacts. PURPOSE This study was designed to explore the related changes in daily life and impacts on the well-being of a group of patients with chronic treatment-resistant depression (TRD) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This study was a part of a long-term, follow-up study of a cohort of patients with TRD collected in 2018. All of the subjects who were diagnosed with major depression and fit the inclusion criteria were referred by the psychiatrists from two teaching hospitals. Structured interviews were used to collect data on physical and psychological changes during the pandemic period between January and May 2020. The researchers organized the key points by recording or note taking. Thematic analysis was used to summarize and classify themes and units. RESULTS The 116 respondents revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected their health in the biological, psychological, and social dimensions. The three emerging themes included: The threatening of homogeneity in the whole person's health, the interaction between bio-psycho-social aspects, and positive growth of individuals with TRD. Although the participants had confidence in the prevention strategies of the government related to COVID-19, they expressed feelings of distress and restlessness with regard to COVID-19-related news reports. CONCLUSIONS / IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health of patients with TRD in both positive and negative ways. As the goal of government preventive strategies is to protect and promote public health, regular attention should be paid to the negative effects of long-term exposure to pandemic-related news on this vulnerable population.","Chen, Kuan-Ling; Hung, Wei-Chieh; Lee, Ming-Been; Chen, I-Ming; Wu, Chia-Yi",Hu li za zhi The journal of nursing,https://doi.org/10.6224/jn.202010_67(5).08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978766/,241

The present article reviews behavioural, psychopharmacological and neuroanatomical evidence accumulated along more than fifty years that provides strong support to the contention that anxiety is critical in the transition from CS (conditioned stimulus)-induced freezing to escape/avoidance responses during the initial stages of TWAA acquisition. Thus, anxiolytic drugs of different types accelerate avoidance acquisition, anxiogenic drugs impair it, and avoidance during these initial acquisition stages is negatively associated with other typical measures of anxiety. In addition behavioural and developmental treatments that reduce or increase anxiety/stress respectively facilitate or impair TWAA acquisition. Finally, evidence for the regulation of TWAA acquisition by septo-hippocampal and amygdala-related mechanisms is discussed. Collectively, the reviewed evidence gives support to the initial acquisition of TWAA as a paradigm with considerable predictive and (in particular) construct validity as an approach-avoidance conflict-based rodent anxiety model.","Fernández-Teruel, Alberto; Tobeña, Adolf",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.08.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916193/,241

This study aimed to determine the effect of TIVA with different ratios of ketofol on recovery in children. METHODS Seventy-five children aged 3-12 years and undergoing adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy surgery were randomized into three groups. Ratios of 1:5, 1:6.7 and 1:10 ketamine-propofol mixture (ketofol) were prepared in the same syringe for groups I, II and III, respectively. Induction and maintenance of anesthesia were performed with 1:5, 1:6.7 and 1:10 ratios of ketofol in groups I, II and III, respectively. A McFarlan infusion dose regimen was used (15 mg/kg/h for 15 min, 13 mg/kg/h for 15 min, 11 mg/kg/h for 30 min) and infusion rates were decreased for the different ratios. Infusion rates were reduced to 67, 80 and 90% of the McFarlan dose regimen for groups I, II and III, respectively. Extubating time, length of stay in PACU, postoperative PAED and FLACC scores were recorded. RESULTS Extubating time was significantly lower [mean 254.3 ± 92.7 s (95% CI 216.6-292.6, p = 0.001)] in group III than in groups I and II [371.3 ± 153 s (308.1-434.48) and 343.2 ± 123.7 s (292.2-394.3), respectively].

METHODS We used linked health data from hospitalisation, mortality records and primary care consultations to follow-up 563,151 Welsh residents from their 60 th birthday to estimate dementia rate and associated risk factors. Dementia, epilepsy and covariates (medication, smoking, comorbidities) were classified using previously validated code lists. We studied rate of dementia and dementia subtypes in people with epilepsy (PWE) and without using (stratified) Kaplan-Meier plots and flexible parametric survival models. RESULTS PWE had a 2.5 (95% CI 2.3 to 2.6) times higher hazard of incident dementia, a 1.6 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.8) times higher hazard of incident Alzheimers disease (AD), and a 3.1 (95% CI 2.8 to 3.4) times higher hazard of incident Vascular dementia (VaD). A history of stroke modified the increased incidence in PWE. PWE who were first diagnosed at age 25 years or younger had a similar dementia rate compared to those diagnosed later in life. PWE who had ever been prescribed sodium valproate compared those who had not, were at higher risk of dementia (HR: 1.6; 99% CI: 1.4 to 1.9) and VaD (HR: 1.7; 99% CI: 1.4 to 2.1), but not AD (HR: 1.2; 99% CI: 0.9 to 1.5).

100489,Simultaneous Bilateral vs Unilateral Carotid Artery Stenting: 30-Day and 1-Year Results.,2016,"BACKGROUND Transradial access for neurointerventions offers advantages of fewer access-site complications, reduced procedure time, and greater patient comfort over transfemoral access. Data about transradial access for flow diversion are limited. We share our early experience with transradial access for flow diversion in a relatively large case series. METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent Pipeline embolization device (Medtronic) deployment via transradial access were included in the study, irrespective of location and laterality of the intracranial aneurysm. The cases were performed between July 2016 and October 2019. Demographics, aneurysm characteristics, and procedure-related details (including catheter systems used) were recorded and statistically evaluated. RESULTS Thirty-five transradial flow diversion procedures were attempted in 32 patients, of which 33 procedures were successful. In two cases involving left common carotid artery and internal carotid artery access, guide catheter herniation into the aortic arch led to abandonment of transradial access in favor of transfemoral access. The most common aneurysm locations in the transradial access procedures were the posterior communicating artery (n = 7), ophthalmic artery (n = 7), and superior hypophyseal artery (n = 7). Most transradial access procedures (66.7%) were performed using a biaxial catheter system. 6-French Benchmark (Penumbra) and Phenom 27 (Medtronic) were the most commonly utilized guide- and microcatheters, respectively. One patient had intraprocedural subarachnoid hemorrhage. No access-site complications occurred. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates safety and feasibility of transradial access for Pipeline embolization device deployment and shows the versatility of this approach for different catheter systems. Tortuosity and acute angulation of the left common carotid artery and internal carotid artery were associated with approach failure.","Waqas, Muhammad; Vakharia, Kunal; Dossani, Rimal H; Rajah, Gary B; Tso, Michael K; Gong, Andrew D; Rho, Kyungduk; Rai, Hamid H; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Davies, Jason M","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019920938961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32623930/,241

Current guidelines for CVT management support the initial use of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin followed by longer-term oral vitamin K antagonist (VKA). There has been increasing, albeit limited, evidence for the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) as an alternative to VKA. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that compared the safety and efficacy of DOACs to VKA in treating CVT. A comprehensive literature search was carried out in Medline, Embase and Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register using a suitable keyword/MeSH term search strategy. All studies published in English comparing outcomes of patients with CVT treated with DOAC or VKA were included. In total, 6 studies (5 observational studies and 1 randomized clinical trial) comprising 412 patients (age range 16-83 years) were analyzed. DOAC was used in 151 patients, while 261 received VKA. The follow-up period was 3-11 months. The efficacy of DOACs was comparable with VKA in terms of partial or full thrombus recanalization (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89-1.16) and excellent functional recovery with modified Rankin scale < 2 (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93-1.13). Patients treated with DOAC developed lower major bleeding events when compared to VKA, although this did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.12-1.59). We provide preliminary evidence to support DOAC as effective and safe alternatives to VKA in CVT treatment. We await the results of upcoming randomized trials to further support our results and validate the use of DOAC.","Lee, Grace K H; Chen, Vanessa H; Tan, Choon-Han; Leow, Aloysius S T; Kong, Wan-Yee; Sia, Ching-Hui; Chew, Nicholas W S; Tu, Tian-Ming; Chan, Bernard P L; Yeo, Leonard L L; Sharma, Vijay K; Tan, Benjamin Y Q",Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-020-02106-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32279216/,241
103689,Experience in Nutrition Management of Diabetes-Affected COVID-19 Patients.,2021,"The aim of the present paper is to explore whether seasonal outbreaks of infectious diseases may be linked to changes in host microbiomes. This is a very important issue, because one way to have more control over seasonal outbreaks is to understand the factors that underlie them. In this paper, I will evaluate the relevance of the microbiome as one of such factors. The paper is based on two pillars of reasoning. Firstly, on the idea that microbiomes play an important role in their hosts' defence against infectious diseases. Secondly, on the idea that microbiomes are not stable, but change seasonally. These two ideas are combined in order to argue that seasonal changes in a given microbiome may influence the functionality of the host's immune system and consequently make it easier for infectious agents to infect the host at certain times of year. I will argue that, while this is only a theoretical possibility, certain studies may back up such claims. Furthermore, I will show that this does not necessarily contradict other hypotheses aimed at explaining seasonal outbreaks; in fact, it may even enhance them.","Stencel, Adrian","BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.202000148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165975/,241
104373,Cloning whole bacterial genomes in yeast.,2012,"In 2019, the requisite biomedical and behavioral interventions to eliminate new HIV infections exist. ""Ending the HIV Epidemic"" now becomes primarily a challenge of will and implementation. This review maps the extent to which implementation research (IR) has been integrated into HIV research by reviewing the recent funding portfolio of the NIH. We searched NIH RePORTER for HIV and IR-related research projects funded from January 2013 to March 2018. The 4629 unique studies identified were screened using machine learning and manual methods. 216 abstracts met the eligibility criteria of HIV and IR. Key study characteristics were then abstracted. NIH currently funds HIV studies that are either formally IR (n = 109) or preparatory for IR (n = 107). Few (13%) projects mentioned a guiding implementation model, theory, or framework, and only 56% of all studies explicitly mentioned measuring an implementation outcome. Considering the study aims along an IR continuum, 18 (8%) studies examined barriers and facilitators, 43 (20%) developed implementation strategies, 46 (21%) piloted strategies, 73 (34%) tested a single strategy, and 35 (16%) compared strategies. A higher proportion of formal IR projects involved established interventions (e.g., integrated services) compared to newer interventions (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis). Prioritizing HIV-related IR in NIH and other federal funding opportunity announcements and expanded training in implementation science could have a substantial impact on ending the HIV pandemic. This review serves as a baseline by which to compare funding patterns and the sophistication of IR in HIV research over time.","Smith, Justin D; Li, Dennis H; Hirschhorn, Lisa R; Gallo, Carlos; McNulty, Moira; Phillips, Gregory; Birkett, Michelle; Rafferty, Miriam; Rao, Amrita; Villamar, Juan A; Baral, Stefan; Mustanski, Brian; Brown, C Hendricks; Benbow, Nanette D",AIDS and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-019-02764-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31845078/,241

Honeybees were inoculated with spores preincubated with porphyrins or with untreated spores (control). A significantly lower level of infection was observed in the bees infected with the porphyrin-treated spores than in the infected control. Porphyrins 1 and 2 reduced the infectious capability of microsporidia more efficiently than porphyrin 3, with bee mortality declining to almost 50%. Confocal analysis of the midguts of infected bees revealed distinct differences in the number of spores between the control group and the group infected with PP[Lys(TFA)-Lys(TFA)-OH]2-treated spores. Notably, bees with a reduced level of infection consumed less sucrose syrup than the control bees, indicating a reduction in digestive disorders and an improvement in food absorption.","Buczek, Katarzyna; Deryło, Kamil; Kutyła, Mateusz; Rybicka-Jasińska, Katarzyna; Gryko, Dorota; Borsuk, Grzegorz; Rodzik, Beata; Trytek, Mariusz",Insects,https://doi.org/10.3390/insects11080504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764215/,241
105998,Dysregulation of Key Proteinases in Aspergillus fumigatus Induced by Blood Platelets.,2021-04-01,"ConspectusFuel cells are among the cutting-edge energy technologies. Their commercial development is still hindered by noble platinum (Pt) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode, which not only determine the energy conversion efficiency and service life but also are closely related to the cost and broad application of fuel cells. Given the bright and enormous future of fuel cells, ORR catalysts should possess highly efficient performance yet meet the acceptable Pt costs for large-scale application. Extensive efforts are concentrated on the optimization of Pt-based nanostructures and upgradation of functional carriers to achieve the low-cost and high-activity Pt-based catalysts. By improving the Pt utilization and accessible surface, reducing Pt consumption and catalyst costs, accelerating mass exchange and electron transfer, alleviating the corrosion and agglomeration of carriers and Pt, accompanying with the assistance of robust yet effective functional supports, the service level and life of Pt-based electrocatalysts would be significantly improved and fuel cells could get into commercial market covering broader applications.In this Account, we focus on the recent development of Pt-based catalysts to figure out the problems associated with ORR catalysts in fuel cells. Recent development of Pt-based catalysts is discussed in different stages: (1) multiscale development of Pt-based nanostructures; (2) multielement regulation over Pt-based alloy composition; (3) upgradation of carbon and noncarbon support architectures; (4) development of integrated Pt-based catalysts for fuel cells. Finally, we propose some future issues (such as reaction mechanism, dynamic evolutions, and structure-activity relationship) for Pt-based catalysts, which mainly involve the preparation strategy of Pt-integrated catalysts (combination of Pt nanostructures with nanocarbons), performance evaluation (standard measurement protocols, laboratory-level rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements, application-level membrane electrode assembly (MEA) service test), advanced interpretation techniques (spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and in situ monitoring), and cutting-edge simulation/calculations and artificial intelligence (simulation, calculations, machine learning, big data screening). This Account calls for the comprehensive development of multiscale, multicomponent, and high-entropy Pt-based alloy nanostructures, and novel and stable carriers, which provide more available options for rational design of low-cost and high-performance Pt-integrated ORR catalysts. More importantly, it will give an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism, dynamic development, and structure-performance relationship for Pt-based catalysts in fuel cells and related energy technologies.","Huang, Lei; Zaman, Shahid; Tian, Xinlong; Wang, Zhitong; Fang, Wensheng; Xia, Bao Yu",Accounts of chemical research,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411505/,241

Severe pediatric COVID-19 disease is rare, limiting potential data accumulation on associated respiratory failure in children. Pediatric intensivists and pulmonologists managing COVID-19 patients look to adult guidelines and pediatric-specific consensus statements to guide management. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature and recommended strategies for the escalation of noninvasive and invasive respiratory support for acute respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 disease in children. RECENT FINDINGS There are no prospective studies comparing COVID-19 treatment strategies in children. Adult and pediatric ventilation management interim guidance is based on evidence-based guidelines in non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome, with considerations of (1) noninvasive positive pressure ventilation versus high-flow nasal cannula and (2) high versus lower positive end expiratory pressure strategies related to lung compliance and potential lung recruitability. SUMMARY Management of acute respiratory failure from COVID-19 requires individualized titration of noninvasive and invasive ventilation modalities with consideration of preserved or compromised pulmonary compliance. Research regarding best practices in the management of pediatric severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure is lacking and is acutely needed as the pandemic surges and vaccination of the pediatric population will be delayed compared to adults.","Blumenthal, Jennifer A; Duvall, Melody G",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0000000000001021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851935/,241

OBJECTIVES Here, we investigated the molecular and biological characteristics of intestinal influenza viruses and their potential role in virus transmission. METHODS Fecal samples were first screened for the presence of influenza viral RNA using RT-qPCR. Positive fecal samples were subjected to cell culture. Isolated viruses were then sequenced using MiSeq platform. Replication kinetics and receptor binding affinity were also evaluated. RESULTS Influenza RNA was detected in stool samples of 41% (36/87) of influenza A positive patients. Among the 36 stool samples subjected to viral isolation, 5 showed virus growth. Sequence analysis of isolated viruses revealed two distinct mutation patterns in fecal viruses. Set I viruses was able to replicate to higher titers in cell culture despite the limited number of mutations (6 mutations) compared to set II viruses (>10 mutations). Functional analysis of both sets revealed the ability to replicate efficiently in differentiated human bronchial cells. Receptor binding testing has also demonstrated their ability to bind α 2,3 and α 2,6 sialic acid receptors. CONCLUSION The ability of fecal influenza viruses to replicate in intestinal cells and human 3D bronchial cells might suggest their possible contribution in virus transmission.","Al Khatib, Hebah A; Coyle, Peter V; Al Maslamani, Muna A; Al Thani, Asmaa A; Pathan, Sameer A; Yassine, Hadi M","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104972; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34153546/,241

Notre étude portait sur les facteurs prédictifs de mortalité intrahospitalière, les caractéristiques de l’arythmie et les effets des traitements qui allongent l’intervalle QT chez les patients ayant une atteinte cardiaque. MÉTHODES: Nous avons fait une étude de cohorte rétrospective des cas graves de COVID-19 admis à l’hôpital Tongji, à Wuhan, en Chine, entre le 29 janvier et le 8 mars 2020. En examinant ceux qui avaient une atteinte cardiaque, définie ici comme un taux élevé de troponine I cardiaque (TnIc), nous avons déterminé les caractéristiques biologiques et cliniques associées à la mortalité et au besoin de ventilation invasive. RÉSULTATS: Parmi les 1284 cas graves de COVID-19, 1159 avaient au dossier un taux de TnIc mesuré à l’admission, qui pour 170 (14,7 %) participants indiquait une atteinte cardiaque. Les patients ayant une atteinte cardiaque avaient un taux de mortalité nettement plus élevé que les autres patients (71,2 % c. 6,6 %; p < 0,001). Nous avons constaté que le taux de TnIc initial (pour chaque augmentation d’un facteur 10, rapport de risque [HR] 1,32, intervalle de confiance [IC] à 95 % 1,06–1,66) et le taux de TnIc maximal atteint au cours de la maladie (pour chaque augmentation d’un facteur 10, HR 1,70, IC à 95 % 1,38–2,10) étaient associés à de minces chances de survie. Le taux de TnIc maximal était aussi associé au besoin de ventilation invasive (rapport de cotes 3,02, IC à 95 % 1,92–4,98). Sur les 170 patients ayant une atteinte cardiaque, 44 (25,9 %) présentaient une arythmie. Les 6 qui souffraient de tachycardie ou de fibrillation ventriculaires sont morts.

Results demonstrate differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a reliable quantitative method for straight-forward and rapid evaluation of ligand binding constants for HSA and modified derivatives. DSC measured the thermodynamic stability of free and ligand-bound HSA and HSAB at pH = 6.0, 7.4 and 8.0. DSC analysis provided a quantitative gauge of responses of HSA and HSAB thermodynamic stability to ligand binding. The influence of different levels of biotinylation of HSAB on ligand binding, and how ligand binding varied as a function of pH for these molecules was also examined. In the three pH environments, biotinylation increased stability of HSAB alone compared to free HSA at pH 7.4. Stabilities of free protein and ligand-bound complexes varied with pH in the order, pH = 6.0>7.4>8.0. Our analytical approach provided very accurate estimates for known binding constants of these ligands for HSA. Results revealed, for both ligands, extent of biotinylation of HSAB affected binding, reducing binding constants from three to 100-fold. Naproxen binding was less sensitive to increased levels of biotinylation compared to bromocresol green. DSC analysis was able to delineate inter-relationships between molecular structure and thermodynamic stability of HSA and HSAB bound by ligands; and their variations with pH. This study provides another example of the general utility of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for evaluating ligand binding constants for Human Serum Albumin (HSA).","Eskew, Matthew W; Koslen, Megan M; Benight, Albert S",Analytical biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2020.113843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726582/,241

METHODS The study population included a random list of 3000 individuals with T2D derived from 30,748 individuals who had visited a large tertiary diabetes centre during the past year. The survey was carried out through telephonic interview. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on changes in lifestyle, access and challenges to diabetes care and use of technologies such as telemedicine facilities and use of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) etc. Results: Of the 2510 individuals successfully interviewed(83.7% response rate), 382 (15.2%) reported having attempted to consult their healthcare providers during the lockdown, of whom only 30.6% utilized telemedicine facility. However, 96 (82%) of those who utilized telemedicine facility(n=117) were happy with their experience and 68 (58.1%) were willing to continue to use the facility in the future. Only 11.4% of participants utilized online support for management of diabetes. Use of self-monitoring of blood glucose(SMBG) increased significantly from 15.5% to 51.3% during the lockdown. There was an improvement in glycemic control during the lockdown [HbA1c:Before vs. during lockdown:8.2±1.9% vs.7.7±1.7%, p<0.001] in a non-randomly selected subset of subjects (n= 205). CONCLUSIONS Acceptance of telemedicine facilities remains suboptimal in this Asian Indian population, in spite of high levels of satisfaction among those who utilized it.

117522,"Serotype assignment by sero-agglutination, ELISA, and PCR.",2014,"BACKGROUND Lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of lipoprotein metabolism that results in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) necessitating transplantation. As LCAT is produced in the liver, combined kidney and liver transplantation was proposed to cure the clinical syndrome of LCAT deficiency. METHODS A 29-year-old male with ESRD secondary to LCAT deficiency underwent a sequential kidney-liver transplantation from the same living donor (LD). One year following the kidney transplant, auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant (APOLT) of a left lateral segment from the same donor was performed. RESULTS At 5 years follow-up, there have been no major complications, readmissions, or rejection episodes. Serum lipid abnormalities recurred within the first year, but liver and kidney allograft function remains intact. CONCLUSION Few cases of sequential transplantation from the same LD have been performed in adults. This is the first APOLT and multi-organ transplant performed for LCAT deficiency. Sequential organ transplant from the same LD for ESRD secondary to a metabolic disorder of the liver is feasible in adults and should be further investigated.","Ahmad, Sarwat B; Miller, Michael; Hanish, Steven; Bartlett, Stephen T; Hutson, William; Barth, Rolf N; LaMattina, John C",Clinical transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.12826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27490864/,241
117805,Genetic Polymorphisms in the Host and COVID-19 Infection.,2021,"There is a growing concern about the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during wastewater treatment and their potential impacts on the receiving water bodies. We hypothesised that the quantity of ARGs in effluents may be related to the size of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and sampling season. To date, only several attempts have been made to investigate the impact of the above factors at the catchment scale. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to explore possible differences in the quantity of ARGs in treated wastewater from small, medium-sized and large WWTPs in the catchment of the Pilica River (9258 km2). The impact of treated wastewater on the concentration of ARGs was also determined along the river continuum from upland to lowland segments to the point of confluence with the Vistula (342 km). Treated effluent was sampled in 17 WWTPs, and river water was sampled in 7 sampling sites in four seasons. The concentrations of blaTEM, tet(A), ermF, sul1 and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes, the integrase gene intI1 and the 16S rRNA gene were analysed by quantitative PCR. The physical and chemical parameters and nutrient concentrations (23 various parameters) in the analysed samples were determined. The highest absolute concentrations of the studied genes were noted in effluent samples from small WWTPs (p < 0.01). The concentration of ARGs (gene copies/mL) peaked in winter and spring samples (p < 0.04). The results of statistical analyses indicate that in small WWTPs, the absolute concentration of ARGs can be predicted based on the biochemical oxygen demand, in routine water analyses. However, none of the studied parameters supported predictions of ARG abundance in medium-sized and large WWTPs or in river water.","Harnisz, Monika; Kiedrzyńska, Edyta; Kiedrzyński, Marcin; Korzeniewska, Ewa; Czatzkowska, Małgorzata; Koniuszewska, Izabela; Jóźwik, Adam; Szklarek, Sebastian; Niestępski, Sebastian; Zalewski, Maciej",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886993/,241

118945,Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of virulent and avirulent multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolated from diarrheic neonatal calves.,2012,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is associated with an outbreak of more than 90 cases of severe pneumonia with high mortality (greater than 50%). To date, there are no antiviral drugs or specific therapies to treat MERS-CoV. To rapidly identify potential inhibitors of MERS-CoV replication, we expressed the papain-like protease (PLpro) and the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) from MERS-CoV and developed luciferase-based biosensors to monitor protease activity in cells. We show that the expressed MERS-CoV PLpro recognizes and processes the canonical CoV-PLpro cleavage site RLKGG in the biosensor. However, existing CoV PLpro inhibitors were unable to block MERS-CoV PLpro activity, likely due to the divergence of the amino acid sequence in the drug binding site. To investigate MERS-CoV 3CLpro activity, we expressed the protease in context with flanking nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) and the amino-terminal portion of nsp6 and detected processing of the luciferase-based biosensors containing the canonical 3CLpro cleavage site VRLQS. Importantly, we found that a small-molecule inhibitor that blocks replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV and murine CoV also inhibits the activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. Overall, the protease expression and biosensor assays developed here allow for rapid evaluation of viral protease activity and the identification of protease inhibitors. These biosensor assays can now be used to screen for MERS-CoV-specific or broad-spectrum coronavirus PLpro and 3CLpro inhibitors.","Kilianski, Andy; Mielech, Anna M; Deng, Xufang; Baker, Susan C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02105-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23986593/,241
119817,Plant-derived virus-like particles as vaccines.,2013,"BACKGROUND Postoperative fascial dehiscence and open abdomen are severe postoperative complications and are associated with surgical site infections, fistula, and hernia formation at long-term follow-up. This study was designed to investigate whether intraperitoneal implantation of a composite prosthetic mesh is feasible and safe. METHODS A total of 114 patients with postoperative fascial dehiscence and open abdomen who had undergone surgery between 2001 and 2009 were analyzed retrospectively. Contaminated (wound class 3) or dirty wounds (wound class 4) were present in all patients. A polypropylene-based composite mesh was implanted intraperitoneally in 51 patients, and in 63 patients the abdominal wall was closed without mesh implantation. The primary endpoint was incidence of incisional hernia, and the incidence of enterocutaneous fistula was a secondary endpoint. RESULTS The incidence of enterocutaneous fistulas after wound closure post-fascial dehiscence (13% vs. 6% without and with mesh, respectively) or post-open abdomen (22% vs. 28% without and with mesh, respectively) was not significantly different. The incidence of incisional hernia was significantly lower with mesh implantation compared with no-mesh implantation in both contaminated (4% vs. 28%; p = 0.025) and dirty abdominal cavities (5% vs. 34%; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Intra-abdominal contamination is not a contraindication for intra-abdominal mesh implantation. The incidence of enterocutaneous fistula is not elevated despite the presence of contamination. The rate of incisional hernias is significantly reduced after intraperitoneal mesh implantation for postoperative fascial dehiscence or open abdomen.","Scholtes, Moritz; Kurmann, Anita; Seiler, Christian A; Candinas, Daniel; Beldi, Guido",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-012-1534-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22402974/,241

METHODS Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were tested throughout a large psychiatric hospital to determine penetrance. The hospital followed initial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. RESULTS Seventy-eight percent (N=51 of 65) of tested patients in the building where the first positive patient was housed (building zero) tested positive for COVID-19. Eighty-eight percent (N=14 of 16) of tested asymptomatic patients in building zero were positive, compared with 12% (N=6 of 51) of randomly selected asymptomatic patients in a sample from the rest of the hospital.

The objective of this study was to compare the pathogenicity differences of the US PEDV prototype and S-INDEL-variant strains in conventional neonatal piglets under experimental infections. Fifty PEDV-negative 5-day-old pigs were divided into five groups of ten pigs each and were inoculated orogastrically with three US PEDV prototype isolates (IN19338/2013, NC35140/2013 and NC49469/2013), an S-INDEL-variant isolate (IL20697/2014), and virus-negative culture medium, respectively, with virus titres of 104 TCID50 ml- 1, 10 ml per pig. All three PEDV prototype isolates tested in this study, regardless of their phylogenetic clades, had similar pathogenicity and caused severe enteric disease in 5-day-old pigs as evidenced by clinical signs, faecal virus shedding, and gross and histopathological lesions. Compared with pigs inoculated with the three US PEDV prototype isolates, pigs inoculated with the S-INDEL-variant isolate had significantly diminished clinical signs, virus shedding in faeces, gross lesions in small intestines, caeca and colons, histopathological lesions in small intestines, and immunohistochemistry staining in ileum. However, the US PEDV prototype and the S-INDEL-variant strains induced similar viraemia levels in inoculated pigs. Whole genome sequences of the PEDV prototype and S-INDEL-variant strains were determined, but the molecular basis of virulence differences between these PEDV strains remains to be elucidated using a reverse genetics approach.","Chen, Qi; Gauger, Phillip C; Stafne, Molly R; Thomas, Joseph T; Madson, Darin M; Huang, Haiyan; Zheng, Ying; Li, Ganwu; Zhang, Jianqiang",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26841768/,241

Treatment goals may be more effectively achieved if multiple disease factors are targeted with combination treatment. We enrolled 202 patients who were randomly divided into the following three groups: telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg, telmisartan 80 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg, and telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg. The primary efficacy variables were changes from baseline in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (MSSBP) between telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg and telmisartan 80 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg at 8 weeks, and the percent changes from baseline in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol between telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg and telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg at 8 weeks. The secondary efficacy variables were changes in MSSBP, mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (MSDBP), LDL cholesterol and other lipid levels at 4 weeks and 8 weeks, as well as observed adverse events during follow-up. There were no significant differences between the three groups in demographic characteristics and no significant difference among the three groups in terms of baseline characteristics for the validity evaluation variables. The mean overall treatment compliance in the three groups was, respectively, 98.42%, 96.68%, and 98.12%, indicating strong compliance for all patients. The Least-Square (LS) mean (SE) for changes in MSSBP in the two (telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg and telmisartan 80 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg) groups were -19.3 (2.68) mm Hg and -6.69 (2.76) mm Hg. The difference between the two groups was significant (-12.60 (2.77) mm Hg, 95% CI -18.06 to -7.14, P < .0001). The LS Mean for the percent changes from baseline in LDL cholesterol in the two (telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg + rosuvastatin 20 mg and telmisartan/amlodipine 80/5 mg) groups were -52.45 (3.23) % and 2.68 (3.15) %. The difference between the two groups was significant (-55.13 (3.20) %, 95% CI -61.45 to -48.81, P < .0001). There were no adverse events leading to discontinuation or death.

125403,Isolation and Evaluation of Anti-Listeria Lactococcus lactis from Vegetal Sources.,2021,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has represented a human health threat since 2012. Although several MERS-related CoVs that belong to the same species as MERS-CoV have been identified from bats, they do not use the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Here, we screened 1,059 bat samples from at least 30 bat species collected in different regions in south China and identified 89 strains of lineage C betacoronaviruses, including Tylonycteris pachypus coronavirus HKU4, Pipistrellus pipistrelluscoronavirus HKU5, and MERS-related CoVs. We sequenced the full-length genomes of two positive samples collected from the great evening bat, Ia io, from Guangdong Province. The two genomes were highly similar and exhibited genomic structures identical to those of other lineage C betacoronaviruses. While they exhibited genome-wide nucleotide identities of only 75.3 to 81.2% with other MERS-related CoVs, their gene-coding regions were highly similar to their counterparts, except in the case of the spike proteins. Further protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that the spike proteins of these MERS-related CoVs bind to the receptor DPP4. Recombination analysis suggested that the newly discovered MERS-related CoVs have acquired their spike genes from a DPP4-recognizing bat coronavirus HKU4. Our study provides further evidence that bats represent the evolutionary origins of MERS-CoV.IMPORTANCE Previous studies suggested that MERS-CoV originated in bats. However, its evolutionary path from bats to humans remains unclear. In this study, we discovered 89 novel lineage C betacoronaviruses in eight bat species. We provide evidence of a MERS-related CoV derived from the great evening bat that uses the same host receptor as human MERS-CoV. This virus also provides evidence for a natural recombination event between the bat MERS-related CoV and another bat coronavirus, HKU4. Our study expands the host ranges of MERS-related CoV and represents an important step toward establishing bats as the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV. These findings may lead to improved epidemiological surveillance of MERS-CoV and the prevention and control of the spread of MERS-CoV to humans.","Luo, Chu-Ming; Wang, Ning; Yang, Xing-Lou; Liu, Hai-Zhou; Zhang, Wei; Li, Bei; Hu, Ben; Peng, Cheng; Geng, Qi-Bin; Zhu, Guang-Jian; Li, Fang; Shi, Zheng-Li",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00116-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29669833/,241

This method has led to stimulate a specific immune response and achieve advanced vaccine formulations. In this study, we identified peptides that were potentially immunostimulatory and highly conserved in HIV-1 main group. The analyses included were CTL assay, Tap transport, and the potential allergenicity. The highest population coverage rate was also found for all potential T-cell epitopes in 16 specified geographic regions of the world. The current study is the first attempt to explore peptide-protein flexible docking across all the major epitopes of HIV-1. Our data indicated that REV54-63 and VPU58-66 with the highest epitope identification scores, GP16037-46 and VPR38-47 with the highest conservation (98.89%), and NEF134-144 and GP16037-46 epitopes with a higher quality of peptide-protein interaction models in docking procedure were chosen as putative epitopes among all HLA class I epitopes. TAT40-67 , VPR65-82 , and VPU30-44 with the highest score of binding affinity, VPR65-82 with the highest conservation (97.55%), and GP160481-498 epitope with a higher quality of peptide-protein interaction models in docking procedure were determined as putative epitopes among all HLA-DR epitopes. Furthermore, two epitopes of GP160481-498 and VIF144-159 were predicted to bind 22 and 21 HLA-II alleles, respectively. Accumulative population coverage of potential helper T-cell epitopes and CTL epitopes varied between 90.82% and 100%.

127630,Into the eye of the cytokine storm.,2012,"Virulent respiratory infectious diseases may present a life-threatening risk for health care professionals during aerosol-generating procedures, including endotracheal intubation. The 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) brings this concern to the immediate forefront. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have stated that, when performing or participating in aerosol-generating procedures on patients with virulent contagious respiratory diseases, health care professionals must wear a minimum of the N95 respirator, and they may wish to consider using the powered air purifying respirator (PAPR). For influenza and other diseases transmitted by both respiratory and contact modes, protective respirators must be combined with contact precautions. The PAPR provides 2.5 to 100 times greater protection than the N95, when used within the context of an Occupational Safety and Health Administration-compliant respiratory protection program. The relative protective capability of a respirator is quantified using the assigned protection factor. The level of protection designated by the APF can only be achieved with appropriate training and correct use of the respirator. Face seal leakage limits the protective capability of the N95 respirator, and fit testing does not assure the ability to maintain a tight face seal. The protective capability of the PAPR will be defeated by improper handling of contaminated equipment, incorrect assembly and maintenance, and improper don (put on) and doff (take off) procedures. Stress, discomfort, and physical encumbrance may impair performance. Acclimatization through training will mitigate these effects. Training in the use of PAPRs in advance of their need is strongly advised. ""Just in time"" training is unlikely to provide adequate preparation for groups of practitioners requiring specialized personal protective equipment during a pandemic. Employee health departments in hospitals may not presently have a PAPR training program in place. Anesthesia and critical care providers would be well advised to take the lead in working with their hospitals' employee health departments to establish a PAPR training program where none exists. User instructions state that the PAPR should not be used during surgery because it generates positive outward airflow, and may increase the risk of wound infection. Clarification of this prohibition and acceptable solutions are currently lacking and need to be addressed. The surgical hood system is not an acceptable alternative. We provide on line a PAPR training workshop. Supporting information is presented here. Anesthesia and critical care providers may use this workshop to supplement, but not substitute for, the manufacturers' detailed use and maintenance instructions.","Tompkins, Bonnie M; Kerchberger, John P",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e3181e780f8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20810676/,241

The improved dexterity offered by robotic assistance provides the opportunity to see whether laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy can be performed safely when faithfully reproducing the open operation. METHODS Patients were selected for robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy when generally suitable for laparoscopy. Obese patients were excluded, and those with pancreatic cancer were highly selected. A prospectively designed database was used for data collection and analysis. RESULTS Of 238 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy, 34 (14·3 per cent) were operated on robotically. No procedure was converted to conventional laparoscopy or open surgery, despite three patients requiring segmental resection of the superior mesenteric/portal vein and reconstruction. The mean duration of operation was 597 (range 420-960) min. The mean number of lymph nodes retrieved and analysed from patients with neoplasia was 32 (range 15-76).

In order to effectively set up such registries, it is necessary to create a system of data collection that permits to record health-related information from patients who are diagnosed with cancer. Given the sensitive nature of such data, it is debated whether their recording should be based on consent or whether alternative arrangements are possible (eg, opt-out systems where information is automatically collected but patients can later withdraw). In the recent reform of the Swiss cancer registration legislation, the lawmaker set out to implement rules about the recording of data in cancer registries that would allegedly go beyond a consent-based model, in order to balance accurate registration with respect of patient rights. However, by analysing the operational norms of the new legislation and comparing them with those of other systems, it emerges that the Swiss rules de facto closely resemble a system of registration based on informed consent-in partial contradiction with the objective pursued by the lawmaker. In this paper, we show how the details of a policy are crucial to determine its true nature and we highlight some critical elements-from an ethical standpoint-of the recently reformed Swiss policy on cancer registration.","Martani, Andrea; Erard, Frédéric; Casonato, Carlo; Elger, Bernice Simone",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34610980/,241

Through numerical experiments, the effects of quarantine, social distancing, and COVID-19 testing on the dynamics of the outbreak varies. We herein present the documentation of the work in a perinatology clinic during COVID-19 pandemic to find the reflection in a pandemic hospital as even in the pandemic, pregnancy complications and fetal diagnosis/therapy are time-sensitive and cannot be delayed. During the prevention of the horizontal transmission to the health-care workers (HCWs), testing all pregnant women with nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) undergoing birth, ultrasound examinations, invasive procedures appear to be the gold standard so that appropriate precautions can be taken if the screen is positive. Though it is logical, it may be incompatible with a busy obstetric practise as a pending polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result should never delay any emergent procedure. OBJECTIVE We aim to describe the development of COVID-19 disease of 408 HCW out of 1462 by the exposure to pregnant women while providing obstetric care in a single tertiary perinatology unit under strict clinical triage, recommended precautions and wearing personal protective equipment and compare the maternal and perinatal outcome with those of the preceding three months. STUDY DESIGN A prospective cohort study involving the pregnant women and the HCW with positive PCR for SARS-COV-2 were carried out to correlate with the horizontal transmission while documenting the perinatal work. RESULTS 25 HCW, including nurses/midwives: 11, doctors: 7 and health technicians: 3 and support staff: 4 developed positive PCR for SARS-COV-2 while providing healthcare to 162 cases: mild-moderate (n = 146), severe (n = 12) and critical (n = 1) and asymptomatic (n = 3) in obstetric population. 22 out of 25 HCW were working in the perinatology unit. COVID-19 clinic was asymptomatic (n = 8), mild-moderate (13) or severe (n = 2) in HCW. However, ""Exposed"" group in the SuEIR model, both the pregnant women and the HCW that have already been infected and have not been tested, which have been also capable of infecting the ""Susceptible"" group could not be determined. Some of the HCW and the pregnant women in the ""Exposed"" group were tested and transferred to the ""Infectious"" group (which were reported to be PCR positive), while the rest of them who recovered, transitted to the so-called ""Unreported Recovered"" group. The ratio of the women with severe pre-eclampsia admitted to intensive care unit increased significantly during the lockdown (p = .01). CONCLUSIONS In a nonstop pandemic perinatology clinic, exposure to 162 PCR positive pregnant women may be correlated with a 5.4% (22/408) documented horizontal transmission in the frontline HCW despite clinical triage and personal protective equipment.","Yapar Eyi, Elif Gul; Moraloglu Tekin, Ozlem; Buglagil, Arda; Sahin, Dilek; Yucel, Aykan; Tanacan, Atakan; Halici Ozturk, Filiz; Yakistiran, Betul; Yucel Yetiskin, Didem; Unlu, Serpil; Gokcinar, Derya","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1875440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33645392/,241

Conventionally, autophagy is known for co-ordinated degradation and recycling of intracellular components and removal of cytosolic pathogens. More recently, several lines of evidence have indicated an unconventional, non-degradative role of autophagy for secretion of cargo that lacks a signal peptide. This process referred to as secretory autophagy has also been implicated in the infection cycle of several virus species. This review focuses on the current evidence available on the non-degradative features of autophagy, emphasizing its potential role and unresolved questions in the release and spread of (-) and (+) RNA viruses.","Teo, Qi Wen; van Leur, Sophie Wilhelmina; Sanyal, Sumana",The FEBS journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33044763/,241

We hypothesized that sacubitril/valsartan, effective in the treatment of chronic HF, prevents development of HF and reduces cardiovascular death following high-risk AMI compared to a proven ACE inhibitor. This paper describes the study design and baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the Prospective ARNI versus ACE inhibitor trial to DetermIne Superiority in reducing heart failure Events after Myocardial Infarction (PARADISE-MI) trial. METHODS AND RESULTS PARADISE-MI, a multinational (41 countries), double-blind, active-controlled trial, randomized patients within 0.5-7 days of presentation with index AMI to sacubitril/valsartan or ramipril. Transient pulmonary congestion and/or LVEF ≤ 40% and at least one additional factor augmenting risk of HF or death (age ≥70 years, eGFR <60ml/min/1.73m2 , diabetes, prior MI, atrial fibrillation, LVEF <30%, Killip class ≥III, STEMI without reperfusion) were required for inclusion. PARADISE-MI was event-driven targeting 708 primary endpoints [cardiovascular (CV) death, HF hospitalization or outpatient development of HF]. Randomization of 5669 patients occurred 4.3 ± 1.8 days from presentation with index AMI. The mean age was 64 ± 12 years, 24% were women. The majority (76%) qualified with ST-segment elevation MI; acute percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 88% and thrombolysis in 6%. LVEF was 37 ± 9% and 58% were Killip class ≥2. CONCLUSIONS Baseline therapies in PARADISE-MI reflect advances in contemporary evidence-based care. With enrollment complete PARADISE-MI is poised to determine whether sacubitril/valsartan is more effective than a proven ACE inhibitor in preventing development of HF and CV death following AMI.","Jering, Karola S; Claggett, Brian; Pfeffer, Marc A; Granger, Christopher; Køber, Lars; Lewis, Eldrin F; Maggioni, Aldo P; Mann, Douglas; McMurray, John J V; Rouleau, Jean-Lucien; Solomon, Scott D; Steg, Philippe G; van der Meer, Peter; Wernsing, Margaret; Carter, Katherine; Guo, Weinong; Zhou, Yinong; Lefkowitz, Martin; Gong, Jianjian; Wang, Yi; Merkely, Bela; Macin, Stella M; Shah, Urmil; Nicolau, Jose C; Braunwald, Eugene",European journal of heart failure,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.2191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33847047/,241

Despite these achievements, many countries failed to meet the MDG target levels, between-country inequalities in health outcomes did not improve, and many countries making progress in average indicator levels did so while at the same time seeing increasing within-country inequalities. We build on the existing literature documenting levels and trends in health inequalities by expanding the number of data-points under focus, and we contribute to this literature by analyzing the extent to which inequalities in child health outcomes are related to socioeconomic inequalities, and to aggregate income growth. The objective of this paper is to examine long-run trends in average population levels and within-country inequalities for two child health outcomes-the under-five mortality rate (U5MR) and stunting-in 102 countries across 6 regions. We find that only about a third of countries in our sample managed to both reduce U5MR levels and inequalities, and only a quarter did so for stunting. The fact that inequality in service coverage seems to follow a more favorable trend than inequality in health outcomes suggests that policies aiming to reduce health inequities should not only foster more equitable service coverage but also focus on the social determinants of health. Moreover, there is no strong correlation between changes in health inequalities and income growth, suggesting that income generating development policies alone will typically not suffice to improve health outcomes and reduce health inequalities.","Eozenou, Patrick Hoang-Vu; Neelsen, Sven; Lindelow, Magnus",Health systems and reform,https://doi.org/10.1080/23288604.2021.1934955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34402412/,241

Nanotechnology approaches are being developed both to design new vaccines against these diseases as well as to facilitate their global implementation. The reasons why a given pathogen may present difficulties for vaccine design are unique and tied to the co-evolutionary history of the pathogen and humans, but there are common challenges that nanotechnology is beginning to help address. In each case, a successful vaccine will need to raise immune responses that differ from the immune responses raised by normal infection. Nanomaterials, with their defined compositions, commonly modular construction, and length scales allowing the engagement of key immune pathways, collectively facilitate the iterative design process necessary to identify such protective immune responses and achieve them reliably. Nanomaterials also provide strategies for engineering the trafficking and delivery of vaccine components to key immune cells and lymphoid tissues, and they can be highly multivalent, improving their engagement with the immune system. This Review will discuss these aspects along with recent nanomaterial advances towards vaccines against infectious disease, with a particular emphasis on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.","Fries, Chelsea N; Curvino, Elizabeth J; Chen, Jui-Lin; Permar, Sallie R; Fouda, Genevieve G; Collier, Joel H",Nature nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41565-020-0739-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807876/,241

STUDY DESIGN Prospective study. SAMPLE POPULATION Sixteen first-year veterinary students. METHODS Veterinary students were taught 3 knots: surgeon's, Miller's, and strangle. After having demonstrated competence, students tied each knot twice in a vascular ligation model at physiologic pressure. The system was tested for completeness of occlusion and volume of fluid lost over 10 seconds. Time, reattempts, repositioning, correctness, and difficulty score were documented. Students were surveyed before and after training regarding their experience. RESULTS Students correctly tied 75% of all knots and achieved complete occlusion of the model with 56% of knots. No difference was identified among knot types in correctness, difficulty, complete occlusion, or time to construct the knot. The first surgeon's knot placed by students had more fluid loss than the Miller's knot, but this was not true of the second knot. CONCLUSION Incomplete occlusion was common among all knot types, but students generally achieved similar knot security when placing surgeon's, Miller's, and strangle knots on a model. More surgeon's knots failed catastrophically during the first attempt, evidenced by a greater volume of fluid loss. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This study does not provide evidence to recommend any of the 3 tested knots as superior to the others to improve the security of ligatures during surgeries performed by students. The prevalence of incomplete occlusion among student knots illustrates the requirement for education regarding knot security and vigilant monitoring of students performing live animal surgeries.","Shaver, Stephanie L; Yamada, Nalani; Hofmeister, Erik H",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.13143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30570156/,241

However, making high-resolution bathymetric charts requires measuring underwater depths at many points in sea areas, and thus, is time-consuming and costly. In this work, treating gridded bathymetric data as digital images, we employ the image-processing technique known as superresolution to enhance the resolution of bathymetric charts by estimating high-resolution images from low-resolution ones. Specifically, we use the recently-developed deep-learning methodology to automatically learn the geometric features of ocean floors and recover their details. Through an experiment using bathymetric data around Japan, we confirmed that the proposed method outperforms naive interpolation both qualitatively and quantitatively, observing an eight-dB average improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio. Deep-learning-based bathymetric image superresolution can significantly reduce the number of sea areas or points that must be measured, thereby accelerating the detailed mapping of the seafloor and the creation of high-resolution bathymetric charts around the globe.","Sonogashira, Motoharu; Shonai, Michihiro; Iiyama, Masaaki",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609752/,241

Computational methods for imputing the missing values using RNA expression data usually allow only for imputations of proteins measured in at least some of the samples. In silico methods for comprehensively estimating abundances across all proteins are still missing. RESULTS We propose a novel method using deep learning to extrapolate the observed protein expression values in label-free MS experiments to all proteins, leveraging gene functional annotations and RNA measurements as key predictive attributes. We tested our method on four datasets, including human cell lines and human and mouse tissues. Our method predicts the protein expression values with average R2 scores between 0.46 and 0.54, which is significantly better than predictions based on correlations using the RNA expression data alone. Moreover, we demonstrate that the derived models can be ""transferred"" across experiments and species. For instance, the model derived from human tissues gave a R2 = 0.51 when applied to mouse tissue data. We conclude that protein abundances generated in label free MS experiments can be computationally predicted using functional annotated attributes and can be used to highlight aberrant protein abundance values.

140983,Inference of Chromosome-Length Haplotypes Using Genomic Data of Three or a Few More Single Gametes.,2020-07-15,"OBJECTIVESomatosensory and motor evoked potentials (SEPs and MEPs) are often used to prevent ischemic complications during aneurysm surgeries. However, surgeons often encounter cases with suspicious false-positive and false-negative results from intraoperative evoked potential (EP) monitoring, but the incidence and possible causes for these results are not well established. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and reliability of EP monitoring in the microsurgical treatment of intracranial aneurysms by evaluating false-positive and false-negative cases.METHODSFrom January 2012 to April 2016, 1514 patients underwent surgery for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) with EP monitoring at the authors' institution. An EP amplitude decrease of 50% or greater compared with the baseline amplitude was defined as a significant EP change. Correlations between immediate postoperative motor weakness and EP monitoring results were retrospectively reviewed. The authors calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of intraoperative MEP monitoring, as well as the incidence of false-positive and false-negative results.RESULTSEighteen (1.19%) of the 1514 patients had a symptomatic infarction, and 4 (0.26%) had a symptomatic hemorrhage. A total of 15 patients showed motor weakness, with the weakness detected on the immediate postoperative motor function test in 10 of these cases. Fifteen false-positive cases (0.99%) and 8 false-negative cases (0.53%) were reported. Therefore, MEP during UIA surgery resulted in a sensitivity of 0.10, specificity of 0.94, positive predictive value of 0.01, and negative predictive value of 0.99.CONCLUSIONSIntraoperative EP monitoring has high specificity and negative predictive value. Both false-positive and false-negative findings were present. However, it is likely that a more meticulously designed protocol will make EP monitoring a better surrogate indicator of possible ischemic neurological deficits.","Chung, Jaewoo; Park, Wonhyoung; Hong, Seok Ho; Park, Jung Cheol; Ahn, Jae Sung; Kwun, Byung Duk; Lee, Sang-Ahm; Kim, Sung-Hoon; Jeon, Ji-Ye",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2017.8.jns17791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29570008/,241

144211,Structural biology of coronavirus ion channels.,2021-04-01,"INTRODUCTION As the body's first line of defense, innate immunity is armed with interferons (IFNs) that link innate immunity to adaptive immunity to generate long-term and protective immune responses against invading pathogens and tumors. However, regulation of IFN production is crucial because chronic IFN responses can have deleterious effects on both antitumor and antimicrobial immunity in addition to provoking autoinflammatory or autoimmune conditions. Therefore, further understanding of the mechanisms regulating IFN production is necessary for developing better vaccines and immunotherapies. AREAS COVERED In this review, we focus on the accumulated evidence on antimicrobial and antitumor activities of type I and II IFNs acquired before the COVID-19 era. We first summarize the intracellular and intercellular mechanisms regulating IFN production and signaling. Then, we discuss the mechanisms modulating the dual nature of IFNs for both antitumor and antimicrobial immune responses. Finally, we review the detrimental role of IFNs for induction of autoinflammation and autoimmunity. EXPERT OPINION Vaccines and immunotherapies activate the immune system for IFN production, which is indispensable for boosting robust antigen-specific immune responses. The current evidence suggests that the dual role of IFNs for antimicrobial and antitumor immunity is dependent not only on the timing, administration route, and dose of IFNs but also on the type of pathogen/tumor. Nevertheless, chronic IFN production may have devastating effects, such as provocation of autoinflammation that could be followed by autoimmunity. Therefore, designing vaccines or immunotherapies requires a deliberate consideration of the mechanisms modulating the dual role of IFN for each specific disease. Indeed, combinatorial therapies involving IFN-inducing adjuvants and immune-checkpoint blockers may offer therapeutic potential, especially for cancer, whereas infectious diseases require fine adjustment of timing, dose, and route of the administration for candidate IFN-based vaccines or immunotherapies.","Temizoz, Burcu; Ishii, Ken J",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1927724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993812/,241

METHODS Overall, 231 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 as proven by PCR were included in this study. Based on the duration of hospitalization, patients were divided into three groups as follows: Group 1, patients receiving outpatient treatment or requiring hospitalization <7 days; Group 2, requiring hospitalization ≥7 days; Group 3, patients requiring at least 1 day of intensive care at any time. Chest CT findings at first admission were evaluated for the following features: typical/atypical involvement of the disease, infiltration patterns (ground-glass opacities, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation), distribution and the largest diameters of the lesions, total lesion numbers, number of affected lung lobes, and affected total lung parenchyma percentages. The variability of all these findings according to the groups was analyzed statistically. RESULTS In this study, 172 patients were in Group 1, 39 patients in Group 2, and 20 patients in Group 3. The findings obtained in this study indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in ground-glass opacity rates among the groups (p = 0.344). The rates of crazy-paving and consolidation patterns were significantly higher in Groups 2 and 3 than in Group 1 (p = 0.001, p = 0.002, respectively). The rate of right upper, left upper lobe, and right middle lobe involvements as consolidation pattern was significantly higher in Group 3 than in Group 1 (p = 0.148, p = 0.935, p = 0.143, respectively). A statistically significant difference was also found between the affected lobe numbers, total lesion numbers, the diameter of the largest lesion, and the affected lung parenchyma percentages between the groups (p = 0.001). The average number of impacted lobes in Group 1 was 2; 4 in Group 2 and Group 3. The mean percentage of affected lung parenchyma percentage was 25% in Group 1 and Group 2, and 50% in Group 3. CONCLUSION In case of infiltration dominated by right middle or upper lobe involvement with a consolidation pattern, there is a higher risk of future intensive care need. Also, the need for intensive care increases as the number of affected lobes and percentage of affected parenchymal involvement increase.","Tekcan Sanli, Deniz Esin; Yildirim, Duzgun; Sanli, Ahmet Necati; Erozan, Neval; Husmen, Guray; Altundag, Aytug; Tuzuner, Filiz; Dikensoy, Oner; Erel Kirisoglu, Ceyda",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.5152/dir.2020.20421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33290242/,241

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Prolonged respiratory failure is common in symptomatic patients with COVID-19, the disease process caused by infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Tracheostomy, although posing potential risk to the operative team and other healthcare workers, may be beneficial for safe weaning of sedation and ventilator support. However, short- and long-term outcomes remain largely unknown. METHODS A prospectively collected database of patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheostomy at a major medical center in New York City between April 4 and April 30, 2020 was reviewed. The primary endpoint was need for continued mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, sedation weaning, and need for intensive care unit (ICU) level of care. Patient characteristics, perioperative conditions, and outcomes between percutaneous and open groups were analyzed. RESULTS During the study period, 67 consecutive patients underwent tracheostomy, including 48 males and 19 females with a median age of 66 years [interquartile range (IQR) 52-72]. Two surgeons alternated techniques, with 35 tracheostomies performed percutaneously and 32 via an open approach. The median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 23 days (IQR 20-26). At a median follow-up of 26 days, 52 patients (78%) no longer required mechanical ventilation and 58 patients (87%) were off continuous sedation. Five patients (7.5%) died of systemic causes. There were 11 total complications (16%) in 10 patients, most of which involved minor bleeding. There were no significant differences in outcomes between percutaneous and open methods. CONCLUSIONS Tracheostomy under apneic conditions by either percutaneous or open technique can be safely performed in patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Tracheostomy facilitated weaning from continuous intravenous sedation and mechanical ventilation. Continued follow-up of these patients to ascertain long-term outcome data is ongoing.","Long, Sallie M; Chern, Alexander; Feit, Noah Z; Chung, Sei; Ramaswamy, Apoorva T; Li, Carol; Cooley, Victoria; Hill, Shanna; Rajwani, Kapil; Villena-Vargas, Jonathan; Scheneck, Edward; Stiles, Brendon; Tassler, Andrew B",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889885/,241
149122,Teaching experimental disciplines to biochemistry majors in COVID times: The dos and don'ts.,2020-08-29,"Malnutrition is common in oncology patients, with age, disease stage and tumour type all influencing malnutrition risk. There are several detrimental effects of malnutrition in oncology patients, including weight loss, which is associated with negative oncological outcomes, and reduced survival. The causes of malnutrition in this group may be multifactorial and include effects from the tumour itself, altered metabolism, increased nutritional requirements, and cancer treatments and their associated side effects, which can impact on an individual's ability and desire to eat. Nutritional screening to identify early nutritional risk is essential and should involve the use of a validated screening tool, with commonly used tools usually assessing nutritional risk and weight loss over a period of months, for example a 3- to 6-month period. It is also important to consider weight changes over a shorter time period to identify rapid weight changes. Multidisciplinary teamworking is essential in tackling malnutrition, with collaborative working between the dietitians and the nutrition nurses shown to be beneficial in the authors' practice to develop community pathways and improve their service and manage increasing patient numbers. Malnutrition within oncology can often be managed with additional supplementation with oral nutritional supplements or enteral nutrition, where indicated. A low-volume, energy-dense, high-protein supplement can help to meet nutritional needs and to achieve dietetic aims, with compliance improved by the use of a low-volume product.","Atkinson, Emma; Atkinson, Judith",British journal of nursing,https://doi.org/10.12968/bjon.2021.30.10.s16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34037443/,241

An appreciation of the differences in the complication rates between different surgical techniques and timing of repair is essential in optimizing cleft palate management. METHOD A comprehensive electronic database search will be conducted on the complication rates associated with cleft palate repair using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Two independent reviewers with expertise in cleft pathology will screen all appropriate titles, abstracts, and full-text publications prior to deciding whether each meet the predetermined inclusion criteria. The study findings will be tabulated and summarized. The primary outcomes will be the rate of palatal fistula, the incidence and severity of velopharyngeal insufficiency, and the rate of maxillary hypoplasia with different techniques and also the timing of the repair. A meta-analysis will be conducted using a random effects model. DISCUSSION The evidence behind the optimal surgical approach to cleft palate repair is minimal, with no gold standard technique identified to date for a certain type of cleft palate. It is essential to appreciate how the complication rates differ between each surgical technique and each time point of repair, in order to optimize the management of these patients. A more critical evaluation of the outcomes of different cleft palate repair methods may also provide insight into more effective surgical approaches for different types of cleft palates.","Zhang, Zach; Stein, Michael; Mercer, Nigel; Malic, Claudia",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-017-0438-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28279195/,241

This study is designed to specifically find out the effect of Covid-19 on the socioeconomic well-being of Nigerians, the health sector preparedness to handle the pandemic, and the role of Nigerian social workers in the fight against Covid-19 in Nigeria. The study employed a phenomenological and exploratory research design in its inquiry. Sixteen respondents made up the sample size for the study. A Focus Group Discussion Guide and an In-Depth Interview Guide were the instruments for data collection. The result of the study shows that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the socioeconomic well-being of Nigerians. Second, the Nigerian health system is ill equipped and underprepared to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. Third, Nigerian social workers, most especially medical social workers, have played a significant role in passing out information on Covid-19 preventive measures to the general public. The study recommends that the Nigerian government should wake up and fix the health sector and make it proactive to handle epidemics/pandemics in the future. Social work practice in Nigeria should be promoted by the government through institutionalization of the profession.","Ajibo, Henry",Social work in public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/19371918.2020.1806168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970546/,241

STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo experimental study, randomized, unblocked. ANIMALS Lung lobes (n = 18) from 4 canine cadavers. METHODS Eighteen lung lobes were harvested from 4 dogs immediately after euthanasia and randomized to 1 of 3 staples (n = 6 per stapler type). Each lung lobe was intubated and maintained inflated at 10 cmH2O. A biopsy of the periphery of each lung lobe was taken approximately 3 cm from the edge with a stapling device; the Tri-Staple™ medium/thick (TST), Tri-Staple™ vascular/medium (TSV), and Endo GIA™ 45-2.5 (EG). Each lobe was inflated to a maximum of 45 cmH2O of water to determine the pressure at which air leakage occurred (leak pressure). RESULTS The mean (95% confidence interval) leak pressure was 38.0 cmH2O (33.1-42.9) for EG, 29.2 (24.3-34.0) for TSV, and 26.0 (21.1-30.9) for TST. The mean leak pressure was significantly higher for EG than TSV (P = .016) and for EG than TST (P = .002), but was not different between TSV and TST (P = .344). One TSV leaked at 20 cmH2O and 1 TST leaked at 17 cmH2O. The surface area of the biopsy samples was not significantly different for staple types (P = .183). CONCLUSION Both TST and TSV leaked at significantly lower airway pressures than EG and may not be suitable for canine lung biopsy as some specimens leaked at pressures of 20 cmH2O or less.","Imhoff, Darren J; Monnet, Eric",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26594855/,241

The TT are composed of TT cells with dark secretory granules and proacinar cells with lighter secretory granules, the latter being considered the immediate precursor of mature acinar cells. TT cells contain a specific secretory protein, submandibular gland protein C (SMGC) and they decrease in number postnatally at a higher rate in males than in females. In the present study, in order to clarify the biological roles of TT cells and their secretory product SMGC, we generated a knockout (KO) mouse strain deficient in SMGC. The KO mice of both sexes grew normally, had normal reproductive capacity and had normal acinar and duct systems in the SMG in adult ages. However, through the neonatal and early postnatal stages, the KO mice were deficient not only in the production of SMGC but also in TT cells. With electron microscopy of the SMG of newborn KO mice, TT cells with characteristic granules were absent and replaced by undifferentiated ductal cells, whereas proacinar cells were normal. These results suggested that the absence of SMGC inhibits the development of TT cells and that the absence of SMGC and TT cells has no notable influence on the postnatal development of the acinar and duct systems in the SMG.","Nakata, Hiroki; Terakawa, Jumpei; Horike, Shin-Ichi; Daikoku, Takiko; Iseki, Shoichi",Cell and tissue research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03205-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418130/,241

The system has proven to be effective in full-thickness porcine small-bowel anastomoses. The aim of this study was to show the feasibility of the MAGNAMOSIS system in hybrid endoscopic colorectal surgery and to compare magnetic and conventional stapled anastomoses. METHODS A total of 16 swine weighing 35 - 50 kg were used following animal ethical committee approval. The first animal was an acute model to establish the feasibility of the procedure. The subsequent 15 animals were survival models, 10 of which underwent side-to-side anastomoses (SSA) and 5 of which underwent end-to-side (ESA) procedures. Time to patency, surveillance endoscopy, burst pressure, compression force, and histology were assessed. Histology was compared with conventional stapled anastomoses. Magnetic compression forces were measured in various anastomosis configurations. RESULTS Colorectal anastomoses were performed in all cases using a hybrid NOTES technique. The mean operating time was 71 minutes. Mean time to completion of the anastomosis was similar between the SSA and ESA groups. Burst pressure at 10 days was greater than 95 mmHg in both groups. One complication occurred in the ESA group. Compression force among various configurations of the magnetic rings was significantly different (P < 0.05). Inflammation and fibrosis were similar between magnetic SSA and conventional stapled anastomoses. CONCLUSION MAGNAMOSIS was feasible in performing a hybrid NOTES colorectal anastomosis. It has the advantage over circular staplers of precise endoscopic delivery throughout the entire colon. SSA was reliable and effective. A minimum initial compression force of 4 N appears to be required for reliable magnetic anastomoses.","Wall, J; Diana, M; Leroy, J; Deruijter, V; Gonzales, K D; Lindner, V; Harrison, M; Marescaux, J",Endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0033-1344119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23807805/,241
158246,Endothelial Permeability Assays In Vitro.,2020-07-21,"Background Malnutrition is recognised as a preoperative risk factor for patients undergoing hepatic resection. It is important to identify malnourished patients and take preventive therapeutic action before surgery. However, there is no evidence regarding which existing nutritional assessment score (NAS) is best suited to predict outcomes of liver surgery. Methods All patients scheduled for elective liver resection at the surgical department of the University Hospital of Heidelberg and the Municipal Hospital of Karlsruhe were screened for eligibility. Twelve NASs were calculated before operation, and patients were categorised according to each score as being either at risk or not at risk for malnutrition. The association of malnutrition according to each score and occurrence of at least one major complication was the primary endpoint, which was achieved using a multivariate logistic regression analysis including established risk factors in liver surgery as covariates. Results The population consisted of 182 patients. The percentage of patients deemed malnourished by the NAS varied among the different scores, with the lowest being 2.20% (Mini Nutritional Assessment) and the highest 52.20% (Nutritional Risk Classification). Forty patients (22.0%) had a major complication. None of the scores were significantly associated with major complications. Conclusions None of the twelve investigated NAS defined a state of malnutrition that was independently associated with postoperative complications. Other means of measuring malnutrition in liver surgery should be investigated prospectively.","Probst, Pascal; Fuchs, Juri; Schön, Michael R; Polychronidis, Georgios; Stravodimos, Christos; Mehrabi, Arianeb; Diener, Markus K; Knebel, Philipp; Büchler, Markus W; Hoffmann, Katrin",Hepatobiliary surgery and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.21037/hbsn.2019.06.11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832492/,241

The elevated risk of thromboembolic complications associated with the device necessitates the need for administration of antiplatelet agents. We sought to assess current dual-antiplatelet therapy practices patterns and their associated costs after PED placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS An online questionnaire that assessed dual-antiplatelet regimens after flow diversion for treatment of intracranial aneurysms was developed and disseminated to 80 neurosurgeons at major academic cerebrovascular centers. Pricing information from 2 of the largest prescription payers in Massachusetts was used to calculate the monthly cost of these agents. RESULTS Twenty-six responses (32.5%) were received. All respondents (100%) affirmed using clopidogrel and aspirin dual-antiplatelet therapy as a first-line regimen. Twenty-three (88.5%) routinely use platelet function testing. Eleven respondents (42.3%) each identified that they administer aspirin/ticagrelor and aspirin/prasugrel to clopidogrel hypo- or nonresponders. For uninsured patients, prasugrel was found to have the highest cumulative monthly cost ($471), followed by ticagrelor ($396), clopidogrel ($149), and ticlopidine ($110). CONCLUSIONS Significant heterogeneity in dual-antiplatelet regimens after PED placement and associated costs exists at major academic neurovascular centers. The most commonly used first-line dual-antiplatelet regimen consists of aspirin and clopidogrel. Two major alternate protocols involving ticagrelor and prasugrel are administered to clopidogrel hyporesponders. The optimal dual-antiplatelet regimen for patients with cerebrovascular conditions has not been established, given limited prospective data within the neurointerventional literature.","Gupta, Raghav; Moore, Justin M; Griessenauer, Christoph J; Adeeb, Nimer; Patel, Apar S; Youn, Roy; Poliskey, Karen; Thomas, Ajith J; Ogilvy, Christopher S",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2016.09.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27641263/,241

160871,Online discussions in biochemistry to increase peer interactions and student interest.,2021-01-12,"BACKGROUND The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is responsible for thousands of deaths and hospitalizations. To curb the spread of this highly transmissible disease, governments enacted protective guidelines for its citizens, including social distancing and stay-at-home orders. These restrictions on social interactions can be especially problematic for individuals managing or recovering from addiction given that treatment often involves access to services and resources that became limited or even unavailable at this time. Social media sites like Twitter serve as a space for users to post questions and concerns about timely topics and allow for researchers to track common themes among the public. The goal of this study was to identify how the public was discussing addiction on Twitter during the COVID pandemic. Methods: We performed a text mining analysis to analyze tweets that contained ""addiction"" and ""covid"" to capture posts from the public that illustrated comments and concerns about addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic. We report on 3,301 tweets captured between January 31 and April 23, 2020. The study was conducted in the United States, but contained tweets from multiple countries. Results: The most prevalent topics had to do with services offered by Acadia Healthcare and Serenity Healthcare Centers, attempts to manage time while home, difficulties of coping with alcoholism amidst rising sales of alcohol, and attention to ongoing health crises (e.g.,., opioids, vaping). Additional topics included affordable telehealth services, research from France on the relationship between nicotine and COVID-19, concerns about gambling addiction, and changing patterns in substance misuse as drug availability varies. Conclusions: Analyzing Twitter content enables health professionals to identify the public's concerns about addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from text mining studies addressing timely health topics can serve as preliminary analyses for building more comprehensive models, which can then be used to generate recommendations for the larger public and inform policy.","Glowacki, Elizabeth M; Wilcox, Gary B; Glowacki, Joseph B",Substance abuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2020.1822489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970973/,241

In the present study, the biocompatibility of PLDLA suture was compared with that of coated braided polyester suture in the rabbit flexor digitorum profundus tendon repaired within the tendon sheath. Postoperative unrestricted active mobilization was allowed. The tendons were studied histologically after 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, 26-, and 52-week follow-ups. No differences were found in the biocompatibility between the suture materials, with only scattered multinuclear giant cells near the sutures in both groups from 6 weeks onwards. At 52 weeks, most of the PLDLA material was absorbed and the histological structure of the tendon appeared normal, whereas in the polyester repairs the suture knots filled the repair site, causing bulking of the tendon surface, and the collagen alignment appeared disoriented. The results suggest that the PLDLA 96/4 is a suitable suture material for flexor tendon repair.","Viinikainen, Anna; Göransson, Harry; Taskinen, Hanna-Stina; Röyttä, Matias; Kellomäki, Minna; Törmälä, Pertti; Rokkanen, Pentti",Journal of materials science.

Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAPs) regarding the COVID19 outbreak among the personnel providing emergency services in India and also assess their perception toward government measures during this pandemic. Materials and Methods: An online survey was conducted among individuals providing services during the period of COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 234 people consented to continue with the survey. Data collection was carried out from April 2020 to June 2020. Data analysis was carried out using Chi-square statistics and Fisher-Freeman-Halton test. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05 with a confidence interval of 95%. Results: Majority of the participants were male and belonged to the age group of 18-54 years. Almost all were aware that COVID-19 is a virus and had knowledge regarding its mode of spread and modes of prevention. Precautions such as covering face with mask, avoiding shaking hands, and washing hands before touching the eyes, nose, and mouth were undertaken by 34.6% of the total participants. Around 70.5% of the males, 53.7% of the females, and 33.3% of the participants from the others' category felt that the funds released by the government to combat corona were efficiently reaching the poor or the needy. Some of the barriers preventing the fair distribution of funds/services to the poor and needy as reported by the participants were corruption, lack of knowledge, delay in delivery and lack of personal protective kits, limited workforce, and no bank account of poor people. Conclusion: KAP of personnel providing emergency services is crucial to the containment of this disease. Understanding of the barriers shall aid policymakers to assess the impact of their preventive programs and also take crucial decisions toward its management.

An online learning environment demands more from students' self-regulation skills. Self-regulation skills allow students to achieve their goals and continue to develop cognitively and personally. In order to achieve effective learning in an online environment, we argue that increasing students' self-regulatory skills must be a central tenet in designing online education. Based on students' and lecturers' experience, we identify three issues regarding self-regulated learning in an online environment: 1) disrupted curriculum structure and study rhythm, 2) less feedback, and 3) fewer opportunities to reflect together. Subsequently, we make recommendations to provide a solid online environment in which self-regulation can occur. Each recommendation empowers students to enhance their self-regulation skills by going through the self-regulated learning cycle. The different recommendations reinforce each other in achieving effective learning in an online environment.","Boor, I.; Cornelisse, S.",Communications of the Association for Information Systems,https://doi.org/10.17705/1cais.04827,241

Here we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences and viral loads from 1,373 persons with COVID-19 from the San Francisco Bay Area from February 1 to June 30, 2021, of which 125 (9.1%) were vaccine breakthrough infections. Fully vaccinated were more likely than unvaccinated persons to be infected by variants carrying mutations associated with decreased antibody neutralization (L452R, L452Q, E484K, and/or F490S) (78% versus 48%, p = 1.96e-08), but not by those associated with increased infectivity (L452R and/or N501Y) (85% versus 77%, p = 0.092). Differences in viral loads were non-significant between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated persons overall (p = 0.99) and according to lineage (p = 0.09 - 0.78). Viral loads were significantly higher in symptomatic as compared to asymptomatic vaccine breakthrough cases (p < 0.0001), and symptomatic vaccine breakthrough infections had similar viral loads to unvaccinated infections (p = 0.64). In 5 cases with available longitudinal samples for serologic analyses, vaccine breakthrough infections were found to be associated with low or undetectable neutralizing antibody levels attributable to immunocompromised state or infection by an antibody-resistant lineage. These findings suggest that vaccine breakthrough cases are preferentially caused by circulating antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants, and that symptomatic breakthrough infections may potentially transmit COVID-19 as efficiently as unvaccinated infections, regardless of the infecting lineage.","Servellita, V.; Morris, M.-K.; Sotomayor-Gonzalez, A.; Gliwa, A.; Torres, E.; Brazer, N.; Zhou, A.; Hernandez, K.; Sankaran, M.; Wang, B.; Wong, D.; Wang, C.; Zhang, Y.; Reyes, K.; Glasner, D.; Deng, W.; Streithorst, J.; Miller, S.; Frias, E.; Hackett, J.; Hanson, C.; Wadford, D.

As part of these developments, automation and smart systems are important part of everyday life. Smart card systems are one of the well-known types of smart automation technology being used by the majority of the population in public transportation in most developed countries. Even though automated fare payment systems have been widely integrated into public transportation in developed countries, integration of smart card systems is still under consideration in most developing countries. The aim of this study is to propose a framework to evaluate different smart card systems to determine the best one and additionally validate their benefits when compared with the traditional fare payment system. For this purpose, an integrated multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) framework is used that combines two recent and popular methodologies together. The proposed methodology employs Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method for determination of criteria weights in the decision model and the Weighted Additive Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method for comparison of alternatives. Research results revealed that all smart card systems show improvements under performance, reliability, and user satisfaction related criteria. However, traditional fare payment systems are found to be safer under consideration of personal data protection. Findings of this study can be used to select the best smart card system and as a guide for deciding on areas of improvement during the implementation phase to ensure higher user satisfaction.","Baç, Uğur",Mathematics,https://doi.org/10.3390/math8101723,241

Many guidelines on chronic liver diseases have been released to optimize the use of medical resources and patient management. However, most of these guidelines have been established through expert consensus because the existing data do not provide strong evidence for developing effective recommendations. As Wilson disease (WD) is a rare chronic liver disease, the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical status of patients with WD is unclear. The present study showed a marked shortage of medical resources for clinically managing patients with WD during the pandemic. Although patients with WD who consistently took anticopper therapy showed no significant differences in hepatic and extrahepatic markers before and after the pandemic, their complication incidences, especially the infection incidence, were significantly increased during the study period. Therefore, patients with WD should be encouraged to adhere to anticopper therapy and be closely monitored to prevent infections and other complications.

Anti-malarial drugs like hydroxychloroquine are indicated in several rheumatic diseases such as RA. Some reports have suggested hydroxychloroquine for prevention of COVID-19. Objectives: Whether hydroxychloroquine has prophylactic effects for COVID-19 in rheumatic patients. Patients and Methods: In this multicenter cohort-based observational study the preventive effect of hydroxychloroquine regarding the incidence and severity of COVID-19 was investigated in patients with RA who referred to rheumatology clinics of academic hospitals of Isfahan between April and July 2020 and already have been treated with hydroxychloroquine for more than three months. Around 215 patients with RA and current use of hydroxychloroquine were recruited and followed for three months. Patients' information was gathered using the medical record or by phone call. Results: The incidence of COVID-19 in this selected sample was 4.2% (n=9). Only one in nine patients needed hospitalization, without need for intubation or ICU care. Symptoms including dry cough, headache, body pain, malaise, dyspnea, fever, sore throat, chills, and chest pain, were reported to be statistically higher in COVID-19+ group. Conclusion: In contrast to the mortality rate in the general population of Isfahan, Iran (4.8% - until June 2020), no mortality has been reported in these patients. Therefore, it seems that the use of hydroxychloroquine has been able to reduce the incidence and severity of the disease after reaching steady-state levels. This finding has clinical importance, especially for rheumatic patients using immunomodulatory drugs.","Naderi, Z.; Sadeghi, B.; Farajzadegan, Z.; Sami, R.; Salesi, M.; Mansouri, V.; Amra, B.",Immunopathologia Persa,https://doi.org/10.34172/ipp.2021.29,241

As a direct result of the pandemic, the hospitality and tourism sectors have shut down, and business failure rates have occurred exponentially. The franchise hospitality industry has experienced significant impact and challenged a basic understanding of knowledge management (KM) implementation in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak. A strategic KM implementation practice can not only guide a large-scale operation, but also adjust an organization’s performance and competitiveness. The purpose of this study is to examine the influential criteria of success through effective KM implementation and to predict the probability of successful KM in a post-pandemic era. The conceptual framework for KM applies an analytic hierarchical prediction model reliant upon consistent fuzzy preference relations to assist the franchise hospitality sector’s consciousness of the influential criteria. An empirical case study is used to apply pairwise comparisons used to determine the priority weights and two possible outcomes. The case study will assist franchise organizations to analyze whether or not to implement KM, interdict application, or adopt revised actions. This assistance will enhance the success possibility of KM implementation within such a crisis environment. This study uses a case setting by assessing 15 franchises hospitality experts’ opinions in Taiwan relevant to KM implementation.","Hsieh, Hsiu-Chin Xuan-Huynh Nguyen Tien-Chin Wang Jen-Yao Lee",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208755,241

Active sites of proteins were performed using CASTp. For docking the PyRx was used. Pharmacokinetic parameters of ADMET were evaluated using SwissADME and pkCSM. Results: β-cryptoxanthin exhibited the highest binding energy:-7.4 kcal/mol in the active site of Mpro. In PLpro active site, the highest binding energy had canthaxanthin of-9.4 kcal/mol, astaxanthin-9.3 kcal/mol, flavoxanthin-9.2 kcal/mol and violaxanthin-9.2 kcal/mol. ADMET studies presented lower toxicity of xanthophylls in comparison to ritonavir and ivermectin. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that xanthophylls can be used as potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease and papain-like protease. © 2021 Tomasz M.

Identifying the precise nature of the dynamics for the spike proteins enables, in principle, the use of further in silico design methods to quickly screen for existing and novel drug molecules that might prohibit the natural protein dynamics. We employ a recent protein flexibility modeling approach, combining methods for deconstructing a protein structure into a network of rigid and flexible units with a method that explores the elastic modes of motion of this network, and a geometric modeling of flexible motion. Our results thus far indicate that the overall motion of wild-type and mutated spike protein structures remains largely the same.","Panayis, James; Römer, Navodya S.; Bellini, Dom; Wallis, A.

It is ubiquitous in scientific, professional and day-to-day life. Mathematicians have strong intuitions about whether a theorem is true well before a proof is found – intuition that also drives the direction of new proofs. Engineers use various approximations and can often tell where a structure will fail. In computation we deal with order of magnitude arguments in complexity theory and data science practitioners need to match problems to the appropriate neural architecture or statistical method. Even in the supermarket, we may have a pretty good idea of about how much things will cost before we get to the checkout. This paper will explore some of the different forms of QQ–reasoning through examples including the author’s own experience numerically modelling agricultural sprays and formally modelling human–computer interactions. We will see that it is often the way in which formal and mathematical results become useful and also the importance for public understanding of key issues including Covid and climate change. Despite its clear importance, it is a topic that is left to professional experience, or sheer luck. In early school years pupils may learn estimation, but in later years this form of reasoning falls into the gap between arithmetic and formal mathematics despite being more important in adult life than either.

Characterized by pronounced market movements and extreme volatility, the unprecedented disruption to the economy in early 2020 has inspired a rich, burgeoning literature on the financial and economic ramifications of pandemic risk. Financial economists have cultivated fresh perspectives regarding the transmission of pandemic-induced uncertainty to financial markets via channels related to the beliefs and behaviors of investors as well as corporate strategies and outcomes. These findings also highlight the imperative role of government policy responses in regulating the market volatility triggered by large-scale disasters such as the pandemic. In this article, the authors take stock of this emerging literature, focusing on the implications for volatility and risk management. In doing so, they discuss the unique nature of the uncertainty induced by COVID-19 relative to that of past crises. They also review cutting-edge studies that use innovative analytical approaches and novel sources of data, offering fruitful avenues for future research.

185411,Regulation of persistent infections with human coronavirus OC43.,1987,"Context: SARS-COV-2 is a coronavirus belonging to the beta-coronavirus group that primarily targets the human respiratory system and causes symptoms similar to those of pneumonia. It should be noted that clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 vary in different people. These patients do not only experience respiratory problems. In fact, COVID-19 infection may show a variety of symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue (muscular and mental), joint swelling, headache, diarrhea, as well as some musculoskeletal symptoms. Therefore, the aim of this article was to investigate the major musculoskeletal problems in patients with COVID-19 through a narrative review study. Evidence Acquisition: This study collected the related published studies in the PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar sources between 2019-2020. The main keywords were COVID-19, coronavirus, and musculoskeletal problems such as muscle fatigue, myal-gia, arthralgia, and joint swelling. Results: The major musculoskeletal symptoms included muscle fatigue (25.6%), myalgia and arthralgia (15.5%), joint swelling (as reactive arthritis), and such conditions as joint limitations, tendon shortening, and muscle weakness due to prolonged bed rest. Conclusions: Our findings revealed that attention to musculoskeletal rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19 is as essential as their respiratory rehabilitation. Besides, it would be effective in reducing the physical complications of hospitalization, returning to independence and functional activities, as well as improving the quality of the patients’ life. © 2021, Author(s).","Motaqi, M.; Hatef, B.; Ashtiani, A.

Early reports found Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing declined nearly 50% among patients with diabetes from March to May in 2020 compared with 2019. At-home sample collection aligns with social distancing practices and mitigates potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in public settings, including clinics. This study sought to characterize utilization of at-home lab tests and resulting HbA1c and lipid profiles in pre-pandemic and pandemic cohorts. Methods: Results from individuals who used at-home collection to measure HbA1c, total cholesterol, calculated LDL-C, HDL, triglycerides, and hs-CRP between October 2017 and December 2020 were identified from a commercial consumer database. A total of 19,076 test-takers were included, of which 12,587 had HbA1c measurements and 13,624 had lipid measurements. Results: Use of tests measuring HbA1c increased 60.3% in February-May 2020, around the time of pandemic declaration, and to a lesser degree from June-December when compared with 2019 use. Use of tests measuring lipids increased 61.9% during the same time periods. The mean HbA1c (%) in the pre-pandemic vs. pandemic cohort was 5.47 ± 0.72 (N = 3476) vs. 5.69 ± 0.87 (N = 2851) among users ages 18-44, 5.85 ± 1.04 (N = 2740) vs. 6.12 ± 1.17 (N = 1709) among users ages 45-64, and 6.05 ± 0.91 (N = 703) vs. 6.47 ± 1.34 (N = 513) among users ages 65+. Overall, the percent of individuals with an HbA1c characteristic of prediabetes and diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 5.7% and ≥ 6.5%, respectively) was 23.4% and 7.0% in 2018 (N = 2342), 26.6% and 8.5% in 2019 (N = 3751), and 38.8% and 14.7% of total users in 2020 (N = 6173). Conclusions: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on at-home lab testing demonstrates the feasibility and increased usage of at-home sample collection for routine health monitoring particularly among people with elevated HbA1c.","Dion, Emma J.; Humphreys, Devon Olds Kaylan Siriwardhane Thushani Bauer Timothy",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-167-lb,241

METHODS A total of 45 clinical diagnosed SARS patients were enrolled in the study. RESULTS 43 (95.6%) of all 45 patients had exposure to SARS patients and the average incubation time was (7.3 +/- 4.7) days (range 2 to 20 days). The clinical features including fatigue (60%), dry cough (68.9%), dyspnea (53.3%), joint pain (26.7%) and diarrhea (26.7%). The laboratory test show that 33% patients with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, 53.3% with elevated serum aminotransferase and 26.6% with increased creatinine kinase levels. The occurrence of abnormal chest radiographs was (4.2 +/- 2.9) days from the onset, and CT scanning was better than X-ray in the early diagnosis. The average time for the progression and improvement of the chest radiographs were (9.3 +/- 4.1) and (14.5 +/- 5.0) days, respectively. The administration of corticosteroids was started (4.8 +/- 3.5) days from the onset and the maximal dosage using of steroids was (8.4 +/- 3.9) days. There was a significant difference in the dosage of steroid between severe and mild patients [(610.6 +/- 212.4) mg/day vs (268.1 +/- 202.5) mg/day, P < 0.001)]. The IgG antibody was detected in 22 out of 34 (64.7%) patients and the average time for the occurrence of antibody was (18.2 +/- 6.4) days (range 9-27 days). CONCLUSION Exposure to the SARS patients happened in most patients. The most common clinical features were fever and fatigue. The most common laboratory abnormalities were leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Serum antibody was not detected until on the 9th day of the course of illness; CT is a more sensitive method for detection of the abnormal chest radiographs than regular X-ray test. The early usage of cortiscosteroids was an efficient method for the treatment, and the dosage of steroids should be individualized.","Huo, Na; Lu, Haiying; Xu, Xiaoyuan; Wang, Guangfa; Li, Haichao; Wang, Guiqiang; Li, Jianping; Wang, Jun; Nie, Ligong; Gao, Xiaoming; Zhang, Zhendong; Li, Jie; Li, Yonghua; Zhuang, Hui",Beijing da xue xue bao.

We developed a dual enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of serum antibodies directed against either of the two PRRSV types. This tandem PRRS ELISA is based on affinity-purified recombinant nucleocapsid protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed by using the IDEXX HerdChek PRRS ELISA and the indirect immunofluorescence assay as reference tests. A total of 1571 sera originating from the United States, Europe, and two PRRS-free countries, i.e., Switzerland and New Zealand, were used for validation of the tandem PRRS ELISA. The new test performed at least as well as the reference tests in regard to sensitivity (0.94 for the US PRRS ELISA and 0.93 for the EU PRRS ELISA) and specificity (0.96 for the US PRRS ELISA and 0.99 for the EU PRRS ELISA). Positive sera were correctly differentiated in 582 of 591 cases, indicating a high differentiation capability of this dual ELISA. The robustness and repeatability of the test were assessed and found to be appropriate for diagnostic applications. Taken together, the data indicate that the tandem PRRS ELISA described here is the first differentiation ELISA for PRRSV serology based on recombinant antigen. It is convenient with respect to antigen production, and it is reliable, economical, and highly sensitive and specific. Thus, it is considered to be a powerful tool for routine diagnostics, epidemiological surveys, and outbreak investigations.","Seuberlich, Torsten; Tratschin, Jon-Duri; Thür, Barbara; Hofmann, Martin A",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12414748/,241

However, many adult humans have neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against AdH5 as a result of natural infection with this virus. Therefore, a chimpanzee adenovirus C7 (AdC7) vector was developed to circumvent interference by preexisting immunity to AdH5. This study evaluated the impact of preexisting immunity to human adenovirus on the efficacy of adenovirus-based vaccines against the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). Efficacy was assessed after intramuscular injection of the vector into mice and was measured as the frequency of SARS-CoV-specific T cells and NAbs against SARS-CoV. Immunogenicity of the AdH5-based vaccine was significantly attenuated or completely abolished when the preexisting anti-AdH5 NAb titer was higher than 40. Because 27% of human serum samples from the United States tested so far have an anti-AdH5 NAb titer higher than 40, our results suggested that a significant percentage of humans with preexisting anti-AdH5 immunity would not be candidates for vaccination with an AdH5-based genetic vaccine. In contrast, preexisting anti-AdH5 NAbs have a minimal effect on the potency of the AdC7-based genetic vaccine. Taken together, our studies warrant the further development of AdC7 as a vaccine carrier for human trials.","Zhi, Yan; Figueredo, Joanita; Kobinger, Gary P; Hagan, Heather; Calcedo, Roberto; Miller, James R; Gao, Guangping; Wilson, James M",Human gene therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16716107/,241

187950,Molecular biology and pathogenesis of coronaviruses.,1984,"AIM To obtain the information of protein-protein interaction between the SARS-CoV proteins and caveolin-1, identify the possible caveolin-binding sites in SARS-CoV proteins. METHODS On the basis of three related caveolin-binding motifs, amino acid motif search was employed to predict the possible caveolin-1 related interaction domains in the SARS-CoV proteins. The molecular modeling and docking simulation methods were used to confirm the interaction between caveolin-1 and SARS-CoV proteins. RESULTS Thirty six caveolin-binding motifs in the SARS-CoV proteins have been mapped out using bioinformatics analysis tools. Molecular modeling and simulation have confirmed 8 caveolin-binding sites. These caveolin-binding sites located in replicase 1AB, spike protein, orf3 protein, and M protein, respectively. CONCLUSION Caveolin-1 may serve as a possible receptor of the SARS-CoV proteins, which may be associated with the SARS-CoV infection, replication, assembly, and budding.","Cai, Quan-Cai; Jiang, Qing-Wu; Zhao, Gen-Ming; Guo, Qiang; Cao, Guang-Wen; Chen, Teng",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14531951/,241

188441,Protective effect of orally administered immunoglobulins against experimental calf diarrhea.,1986,"A number of epidemiological studies have shown human metapneumovirus (hMPV) to be one of the most important viral agents associated with acute respiratory infections in humans. However, due to the difficulty in growing the virus, all epidemiological studies of hMPV infection have been performed on the basis of the molecular method. Thus, the development of a cell line suitable for the isolation of hMPV from clinical specimens is a crucial step for further research. Using the Vero E6 cell line, which could be stably maintained for 1 month without passage or medium change, we succeeded in isolating 79 strains from 4,112 specimens obtained in Yamagata, Japan, in 2004 and 2005. The total isolation rate was 1.9% (79/4,112). The monthly distribution revealed that hMPV infections occurred between February and April in 2004 and throughout most of the year in 2005. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that subgenogroup B2 was predominant in 2004, whereas three subgenogroups, A2, B1, and B2, had cocirculated in 2005. Although multiple subgenogroups cocirculated in 2005, each individual subgenogroup strain was found to predominate at specific sites. An infectivity assay of hMPV strains also indicated that the infection efficiency in Vero E6 cells was better than that in LLC-MK2 cells. Finally, we found that Vero E6 cells are useful for the isolation of hMPVs and that this utility might aid further research into hMPVs beyond the epidemiological data shown in this study.","Abiko, C; Mizuta, K; Itagaki, T; Katsushima, N; Ito, S; Matsuzaki, Y; Okamoto, M; Nishimura, H; Aoki, Y; Murata, T; Hoshina, H; Hongo, S; Ootani, K",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17460056/,241

The aim of this work was to study the protein expression pattern of CEACAM1 in cervical cancer and precursor lesions in the context of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. We used immunohistochemistry to analyze CEACAM1 expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cervical tissues from 15 healthy women, 15 patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), 15 patients with high-grade SIL, and 15 patients with squamous carcinomas. HPV types were identified by PCR. CEACAM1 was either undetectable (13/15) or low (2/15) in normal cervical tissues. By contrast, CEACAM1 expression was increased in high-grade SIL (10 samples staining intermediate/high and 4 samples staining low) as compared with low-grade SIL with undetectable (n=3) or low (n=12) expression. CEACAM1 expression was undetectable or low in cervical carcinoma. Our results suggest that CEACAM1 may be an interesting progression marker in SIL and cervical cancer, in particular due to reported immunoregulatory properties.","Albarran-Somoza, Benibelks; Franco-Topete, Ramon; Delgado-Rizo, Vidal; Cerda-Camacho, Felipe; Acosta-Jimenez, Lourdes; Lopez-Botet, Miguel; Daneri-Navarro, Adrian",The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16924126/,241

METHODS Chest radiography and CT were performed in 28 patients with SARS within one to three days after onset of the disease. CT examinations included conventional spiral CT and high-resolution CT (HRCT). The radiographic and CT findings of these patients were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Abnormal CT findings were noted in all the patients, but abnormal chest radiographic findings in 17 cases (60.7%, 17/28). CT showed single small focal patchy opacities in 23 patients (82.1%, 23/28), including oval ground-glass opacities in 20 patients, lobular distribution ground-glass opacities in 2 and small patchy consolidation in one. Multi-focal ground-glass opacities were found in 2 patients and extensive opacities in three. In the 28 patients, a total of 31 lesions were found in the upper (7, 22.6%), middle (3, 9.7%), and lower lobes (21, 67.7%). The diameter of the lesions ranged from 20 to 35 mm. CONCLUSION The dominant feature of early SARS patients is focal patchy opacity in the lung, and oval small ground-glass opacities are the common morphological findings on CT.","Zhao, Dawei; Ma, Daqing; Wang, Wei; Wu, Hao; Yuan, Chunwang; Jia, Cuiyu; He, Wen; Liu, Chunhong; Chen, Jianghong",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12877787/,241
189288,Persistent infection of neural cell lines by human coronaviruses.,1998,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) core protein was detected in both the nucleoli and cytoplasm of mammalian and insect cell lines infected with JEV or transfected with the expression plasmid of the core protein. Mutation analysis revealed that Gly(42) and Pro(43) in the core protein are essential for the nuclear and nucleolar localization. A mutant M4243 virus in which both Gly(42) and Pro(43) were replaced by Ala was recovered by plasmid-based reverse genetics. In C6/36 mosquito cells, the M4243 virus exhibited RNA replication and protein synthesis comparable to wild-type JEV, whereas propagation in Vero cells was impaired. The mutant core protein was detected in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus of either C6/36 or Vero cell lines infected with the M4243 virus. The impaired propagation of M4243 in mammalian cells was recovered by the expression of wild-type core protein in trans but not by that of the mutant core protein. Although M4243 mutant virus exhibited a high level of neurovirulence comparable to wild-type JEV in spite of the approximately 100-fold-lower viral propagation after intracerebral inoculation to 3-week-old mice of strain Jcl:ICR, no virus was recovered from the brain after intraperitoneal inoculation of the mutant. These results indicate that nuclear localization of JEV core protein plays crucial roles not only in the replication in mammalian cells in vitro but also in the pathogenesis of encephalitis induced by JEV in vivo.","Mori, Yoshio; Okabayashi, Tamaki; Yamashita, Tetsuo; Zhao, Zijiang; Wakita, Takaji; Yasui, Kotaro; Hasebe, Futoshi; Tadano, Masayuki; Konishi, Eiji; Moriishi, Kohji; Matsuura, Yoshiharu",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15731239/,241
189698,Strong antiviral activity of heated and hydrated dolomite--preliminary investigation.,2007,"Wondering is a cousin of curiosity and the parent of inventiveness. Almost everything learned in the course of professional education and in the processes of professional life has been discovered or developed because of wondering. A host of creative individuals once wondered in ways that made today's medicine possible, and make the medicine of tomorrow feasible. Wondering is also integral to clinical decision making in general, to diagnosis, therapeutic choices, and management priorities. It is central to broader themes and to opportunities to seek the larger issues of which the daily problems of clinical practice and research are manifestations. Oddly enough, it is important to decide to wonder in this way to harvest its benefits. It is useful to identify one or two big things to wonder about from time to time to use as bases for the development of fractals of interest and professional growth. The author discusses in depth two such opportunities for wondering, both of which concern issues that underlie the immediate clinical event: (1) why individuals' health, disease outcomes, and life expectancy vary, and (2) why disease patterns change. He concludes that developing a capacity for wondering exercises the mind and the spirit, broadens the horizon, and in the long run is not only good for the doctor but also for his or her patients, for patients to come, and for the health of the profession itself, because it opens the door to change.","Barondess, Jeremiah A",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15618095/,241
190184,"Lesions in the small intestine of newborn pigs inoculated with porcine, feline, and canine coronaviruses.",1981,"Experimental viral disease studies in volunteers have clarified many aspects of the pathogenesis of human viral disease. Recently, interest has focused on rhinovirus-associated asthma exacerbations, and new volunteer studies have suggested that airway responsiveness (AR) is enhanced during a cold. For scientific, ethical and safety reasons, it is important to use validated methods for the preparation of a virus inoculum and that the particular virological characteristics and host responses should not be altered. We have prepared a new human rhinovirus (HRV) inoculum using recent guidelines and assessed whether disease characteristics (for example, severity of colds or changes in AR) were retained. Studies were conducted in 25 clinically healthy volunteers using a validated HRV inoculum in the first 17 and a new inoculum in the subsequent eight subjects. Severity of cold symptoms, nasal wash albumin levels and airway responsiveness were measured, and the new inoculum was prepared from nasal washes obtained during the cold. The new inoculum was tested using standard virological and serological techniques, as well as a polymerase chain reaction for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. No contaminating viruses or organisms were detected and the methods suggested were workable. Good clinical colds developed in 20 of the 25 subjects and median symptom scores were similar in the validated and new inoculum groups (18 and 17.5, respectively; p=0.19). All subjects shed virus, and there were no differences noted in viral culture scores, nasal wash albumin and rates of seroconversion in the two groups. Although airway responsiveness increased in both groups (p=0.02 and p=0.05), the degree of change was similar. We have performed experimental rhinovirus infection studies and demonstrated similar clinical disease in two inoculum groups. Amplified airway responsiveness was induced; continuing studies will define the mechanisms and suggest modes of treatment.","Bardin, P G; Sanderson, G; Robinson, B S; Holgate, S T; Tyrrell, D A",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8947068/,241

RESULTS The estimated transmission rate decreased dramatically from 20 to 30 April 2003. The total number of cases in the epidemic in Beijing was estimated to be 2521. Hierarchical clustering revealed that risk-exposures were widespread, but clustered in a pattern that is distinctly related to the Beijing urban ring roads.

190797,Cell-mediated immunity against turkey coronaviral enteritis (bluecomb).,1980,"The F protein is the major glycoprotein present in the envelopes of budded virus (BV) of members of the family Baculoviridae. The F protein mediates low-pH-activated fusion with insect cell membranes. Baculovirus F proteins are synthesized as a precursor (F(0)) and cleaved post-translationally into two disulfide-bonded subunits, F(1) (C-terminal, large subunit) and F(2) (N-terminal, small subunit). Recently, N-linked glycosylation of the F(1) and F(2) subunits of Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) was demonstrated [Long, G., Westenberg, M., Wang, H., Vlak, J. M. & Hu, Z. (2006). J Gen Virol 87, 839-846]. Sequence analysis frequently predicts that one or more N-linked glycosylation sites are present in the F(2) subunit of baculovirus F proteins. N-glycans on envelope fusion proteins are usually required for proper conformational integrity and biological function, such as infectivity. This study examined the importance of N-linked glycosylation of the F(2) subunit of HearNPV by site-directed mutagenesis. The only putative N-linked glycosylation site in F(2) was eliminated by mutating asparagine (N(104)) to glutamine (Q), resulting in the mutant HearNPV(fN104Q). When inserted into an f-null HearNPV and a gp64-null bacmid of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus, infectious BV could be retrieved that contained unglycosylated F(2). The virulence of HearNPV(fN104Q) was enhanced, as BV was produced earlier after infection and yielded larger plaques than f-null HearNPV repaired with the wild-type f gene. HearNPV(fN104Q) BV also induced much more efficient low-pH-activated syncytium formation. These results indicate that N-linked glycosylation of the HearNPV baculovirus F(2) subunit is not essential for viral infectivity and suggest that it is involved in BV production and fusogenicity.","Long, Gang; Pan, Xiaoyu; Vlak, Just M",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17251561/,241

METHODS Based on the information officially announced on the official website of the Health Commission of Hebei Province, epidemiological data were collected from 133 children, aged 0-18 years, who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shijiazhuang from January 2 to January 30, 2021. A statistical analysis was performed for general status, regional distribution, presence or absence of clusters, and results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests. RESULTS Among the 133 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were 65 boys and 68 girls, with a male/female ratio of 0.96:1. The youngest age of onset was 3 months and 7 days, and the mean age of onset was (9±5) years. Of all the 133 children, 90(67.7%) were the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection among their family members. Of all the children, 108(81.2%) came from the Gaocheng District in Shijiazhuang, among whom 38(28.6%) were from Xiaoguozhuang Village where the first patient with a confirmed diagnosis lived. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test at week 2 after the outbreak showed positive results in 88 children (66.2%), and only 5 children had clinical symptoms before positive SARS-CoV-2 results were obtained. Of all the 133 children, 19(14.3%) were found positive in the first SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test after the outbreak, and 70(52.6%) had positive results for ≥4 times. There were 98 school students with infection, among whom 74(75.5%) were the first confirmed case in their family, and among 35 non-school students, 16(45.7%) were the first confirmed case in their family (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Among the children confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shijiazhuang, there is a high proportion of children who are the first confirmed case in their family, and the children are mainly distributed in the rural areas of Gaocheng. Most of these children are students, so the prevention and control of cluster infection in schools should be taken seriously. There are often no symptoms before SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, with a low positive rate of the first nucleic acid test, which increases the difficulty of early discovery of the epidemic.","Lu, Su-Kun; Niu, Bo; Ji, Li-Li; Liu, Jian-Hua; Shuai, Jin-Feng",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34020733/,241

However, the exact mechanism of action of NB-DNJ remains to be determined. In this study we have examined the impairment of HIV infectivity mediated by NB-DNJ. By two independent HIV entry assays [PCR-based HIV entry assay and entry of Cocal(HIV) pseudotypes], the reduction in infectivity was found to be due to an impairment of viral entry. No effect of NB-DNJ treatment was seen on the kinetics of the interaction between gp120 and CD4 (surface plasmon resonance; BIAcore) or on the binding of virus particles to H9 cells (using radiolabeled virions). We therefore conclude that a major mechanism of action of NB-DNJ as an inhibitor of HIV replication is the impairment of viral entry at the level of post-CD4 binding, due to an effect on viral envelope components.","Fischer, P B; Collin, M; Karlsson, G B; James, W; Butters, T D; Davis, S J; Gordon, S; Dwek, R A; Platt, F M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7543588/,241

Four species were glycosylated and had apparent molecular weights of 140,000, 120,000, 100,000, and 26,000. The glycoproteins were susceptible to proteolytic cleavage and enzymatic iodination when intact virions were studied and are thus at least partially external to the virion envelope. The 140,000-molecular-weight glycoprotein is apparently a dimer of 65,000-molecular-weight glycopolypeptides held together by disulfide linkages. Species 5 was phosphorylated and had an apparent molecular weight of 52,000. In the intact virion, it was unaffected by protease and was not enzymatically iodinated.

It is therefore surprising to learn that TAP2-deficient patients suffer from autoimmune manifestations only occasionally in later stages of life. We have previously described that the CEACAM1-mediated inhibitory mechanism of NK cytotoxicity plays a major role in controlling NK autoreactivity in three newly identified TAP2-deficient siblings. This novel mechanism probably compensates for the lack of MHC class I-mediated inhibition. The CEACAM1 protein can also be present in a soluble form and the biological function of the soluble form of CEACAM1 with regard to NK cells has not been investigated. Here we show that the homophilic CEACAM1 interactions are abrogated in the presence of soluble CEACAM1 protein in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the amounts of soluble CEACAM1 protein detected in sera derived from the TAP2-deficient patients were dramatically reduced as compared to healthy controls. This dramatic reduction does not depend on the membrane-bound metalloproteinase activity. Thus, the expression of CEACAM1 and the absence of soluble CEACAM1 observed in the TAP2-deficient patients practically maximize the inhibitory effect and probably help to minimize autoimmunity in these patients.","Markel, Gal; Achdout, Hagit; Katz, Gil; Ling, Khoon-Lin; Salio, Mariolina; Gruda, Raizy; Gazit, Roi; Mizrahi, Sa'ar; Hanna, Jacob; Gonen-Gross, Tsufit; Arnon, Tal I; Lieberman, Niva; Stren, Noam; Nachmias, Boaz; Blumberg, Richard S; Steuer, Guy; Blau, Hanna; Cerundolo, Vincenzo; Mussaffi, Huda; Mandelboim, Ofer",European journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15259011/,241
192411,Antigenic relationship of turkey coronavirus isolates from different geographic locations in the United States.,2002,"Functional motifs within the cytoplasmic tails of the two glycoproteins G(N) and G(C) of Uukuniemi virus (UUK) (Bunyaviridae family) were identified with the help of our recently developed virus-like particle (VLP) system for UUK virus (A. K. Overby, V. Popov, E. P. Neve, and R. F. Pettersson, J. Virol. 80:10428-10435, 2006). We previously reported that information necessary for the packaging of ribonucleoproteins into VLPs is located within the G(N) cytoplasmic tail (A. K. Overby, R. F. Pettersson, and E. P. Neve, J. Virol. 81:3198-3205, 2007). The G(N) glycoprotein cytoplasmic tail specifically interacts with the ribonucleoproteins and is critical for genome packaging. In addition, two other regions in the G(N) cytoplasmic tail, encompassing residues 21 to 25 and 46 to 50, were shown to be important for particle generation and release. By the introduction of point mutations within these two regions, we demonstrate that leucines at positions 23 and 24 are crucial for the initiation of VLP budding, while leucine 46, glutamate 47, and leucine 50 are important for efficient exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent transport to the Golgi complex. We found that budding and particle generation are highly dependent on the intracellular localization of both glycoproteins. The short cytoplasmic tail of UUK G(C) contains a lysine at position -3 from the C terminus that is highly conserved among members of the Phlebovirus, Hantavirus, and Orthobunyavirus genera. Mutating this single amino acid residue in G(C) resulted in the mislocalization of not only G(C) but also G(N) to the plasma membrane, and VLP generation was compromised in cells expressing this mutant.

192766,"Some serum acute phase proteins and immunoglobulins concentrations in calves with rotavirus, coronavirus, E. coli F5 and Eimeria species.",2014,"Bovine enteric caliciviruses (BEC) are associated with diarrhea in young calves. The BEC strains detected in Europe form a third genogroup within the genus ""Norwalk-like viruses"" (NLV) of the family Caliciviridae. In this report, we present sequence, clinical, and histological data characterizing a novel enteropathogenic BEC strain, NB, detected in fecal specimens from calves in the United States. The complete RNA genome of the NB virus is 7,453 bases long and is organized into two open reading frames (ORFs). ORF-1 is 2,210 amino acids long and encodes a large nonstructural polyprotein contiguous with the major capsid protein (VP1), similar to the lagoviruses and ""Sapporo-like viruses"" (SLV). The conserved calicivirus motifs were identified in the nonstructural proteins. ORF-2 is located at the 3' end of the genome and encodes a small basic protein (VP2) of 225 amino acids. The 5' and 3' untranslated regions are 74 and 67 bases long, respectively. Among caliciviruses, NB virus shows amino acid identities of 14.1 to 22.6% over the entire ORF-1 nonstructural-protein sequence with NLV, SLV, vesivirus, and lagovirus strains, while the overall sequence identity of the complete NB VP-1 with other caliciviruses is low, varying between 14.6 and 26.7%. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete VP1 protein, including strains from all four calicivirus genera, showed the closest grouping of NB virus to be with viruses in the genus Lagovirus, which cause liver infections and systemic hemorrhage in rabbits. In gnotobiotic calves, however, NB virus elicited only diarrhea and intestinal lesions that were most severe in the upper small intestine (duodenum and jejunum), similar to the NLV BEC strains. The tissues of major organs, including the lung, liver, kidney, and spleen, had no visible microscopic lesions.","Smiley, J R; Chang, K O; Hayes, J; Vinjé, J; Saif, L J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12239283/,241

Flexible molecular alignments of the 11 cleavable peptides have provided useful insights into the chemical properties of their amino acid residues close to the cleavage site. Moreover, it was found through the ligand-receptor docking studies that of the 11 cleavable peptides, NH2-ATLQ / AIAS-COOH and NH2-ATLQ / AENV-COOH had the highest affinity with SARS CoV M(pro). The two octapeptides were selected as initial templates for further chemical modification to make them become effective inhibitors against the SARS enzyme according to the ""distorted key"" theory [K.

Remote experts can examine samples directly, and unique instruments can be utilized from anywhere. In the case of diagnostic dilemmas, the second-opinion expert is no longer constrained by problems inherent in the interpretation of preselected images. The remote examiner can independently choose the area of interest on the sample as well as select the appropriate magnification for an accurate diagnosis. With these capabilities and together with teleconferencing tools and securely accessible databases on-line, telepathology can provide increased effectiveness and support for diagnostics, research, and teaching in many areas. The authors report their experience with remote electron microscope diagnoses of pathological samples using two different dynamic imaging systems and discuss the main technical issues encountered.

After i.v. administration, Ad5 rapidly binds to circulating platelets, which causes their activation/aggregation and subsequent entrapment in liver sinusoids. Virus-platelet aggregates are taken up by Kupffer cells and degraded. Ad sequestration in organs can be reduced by platelet depletion prior to vector injection. Identification of this new sequestration mechanism and construction of vectors that avoid it could improve levels of target cell transduction at lower vector doses.","Stone, Daniel; Liu, Ying; Shayakhmetov, Dmitry; Li, Zong-Yi; Ni, Shaoheng; Lieber, André",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17301138/,241

METHODS We propose a novel, integrative, and neural network-based literature-based discovery (LBD) approach to identify drug candidates from both PubMed and COVID-19-focused research literature. Our approach relies on semantic triples extracted using SemRep (via SemMedDB). We identified an informative subset of semantic triples using filtering rules and an accuracy classifier developed on a BERT variant, and used this subset to construct a knowledge graph. Five SOTA, neural knowledge graph completion algorithms were used to predict drug repurposing candidates. The models were trained and assessed using a time slicing approach and the predicted drugs were compared with a list of drugs reported in the literature and evaluated in clinical trials. These models were complemented by a discovery pattern-based approach. RESULTS Accuracy classifier based on PubMedBERT achieved the best performance (F1= 0.854) in classifying semantic predications. Among five knowledge graph completion models, TransE outperformed others (MR = 0.923, Hits@1=0.417). Some known drugs linked to COVID-19 in the literature were identified, as well as some candidate drugs that have not yet been studied. Discovery patterns enabled generation of plausible hypotheses regarding the relationships between the candidate drugs and COVID-19. Among them, five highly ranked and novel drugs (paclitaxel, SB 203580, alpha 2-antiplasmin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and butylated hydroxytoluene) with their mechanistic explanations were further discussed. CONCLUSION We show that an LBD approach can be feasible for discovering drug candidates for COVID-19, and for generating mechanistic explanations. Our approach can be generalized to other diseases as well as to other clinical questions.","Zhang, Rui; Hristovski, Dimitar; Schutte, Dalton; Kastrin, Andrej; Fiszman, Marcelo; Kilicoglu, Halil",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564698/,241

Conversely, pulse flow (PF) devices do not require the AR. The purpose of this study was to compare the F(IO(2)) delivered by a nasal cannula supplied by CF via oxygen tank with that delivered by PF delivered via portable oxygen concentrator. Hypotheses were (1) a lung model of COPD with non-zero end-expiratory flow decreases F(IO(2)) for CF more than for PF, and (2) CF and PF perform differently in terms of F(IO(2)) delivery, despite having equivalent settings. METHODS Normal and COPD lung models were simulated (IngMar Medical ASL 5000) using published human data: normal: breathing frequency = 15 breaths/min, R(in) = 4 cm H2O · s · L(-1), R(out) = 4 cm H2O · s · L(-1), C = 60 mL · cm H2O(-1), tidal volume (VT) = 685 mL, P(max) = 11.95 cm H2O, increase = 33%, and release = 28; COPD: breathing frequency = 20 breaths/min, R(in) = 12 cm H2O · s · L(-1), R(out) = 25 cm H2O · s · L(-1), C = 66 mL · cm H2O(-1), VT = 685 mL, Pmax = 24.52 cm H2O, increase = 35%, and release = 23%. CF was 1-5 L/min. Portable oxygen concentrators used were Solo2 (Invacare), XPO2 (Invacare), FreeStyle (AirSep), Focus (AirSep), One G3 (Inogen), and LifeChoice ActivOx (Inova Labs). RESULTS CF produced significantly higher F(IO(2)) at all settings for normal lungs but lower for COPD lungs compared with Solo2. COPD reduced the F(IO(2)) for CF but had a smaller variable effect for PF. Data show there is no equivalency between PF setting and CF rates for the portable oxygen concentrators tested. CONCLUSIONS CF oxygen delivery via a nasal cannula is significantly reduced by elimination of the AR in a model of COPD, yielding clinically important decreases in F(IO(2)). PF (delivered with a portable oxygen concentrator) is relatively unaffected. This study supports the recommendation that clinicians and caretakers should titrate the PF setting to each patient's unique oxygen requirements.","Zhou, Steven; Chatburn, Robert L",Respiratory care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24803496/,241

Routine surveillance of these pathogens is necessary to determine virus activity, monitor for changes in circulating strains, and plan for public health preparedness. The Southern Nevada Health District in Las Vegas, Nevada, recruited five pediatric medical practices to serve as sentinel sites for the Pediatric Early Warning Sentinel Surveillance (PEWSS) program. METHODS Sentinel staff collected specimens throughout the year from ill children who met the influenza-like illness case definition and submitted specimens to the Southern Nevada Public Health Laboratory for molecular testing for influenza and six non-influenza viruses. RESULTS Laboratory results were analyzed and reported to the medical and general communities in weekly bulletins year-round. PEWSS data were also used to establish viral respiratory seasonal baselines and in influenza vaccination campaigns. The surveillance program was evaluated using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems. PEWSS met three of six program usefulness criteria and seven of nine surveillance system attributes, which exceeded the CDC Guidelines evaluation criteria for a useful and complete public health surveillance program.

Pandemic influenza is a worldwide epidemic usually caused by a new virus variant to which the majority of the population has no immunity. As demonstrated in the devastating pandemic of 1918 to 1919, a pandemic virus may infect 30 to 50% of the worlds population and kill 1 to 2% of those infected. Pandemic control must be a concerted and co-ordinated world strategy and under the auspices of the World Health Organization, pandemic preparedness plans have been formulated, including: intensified surveillance for more rapid identification of new reassortant viruses with potential human virulence and infectivity, laboratory characterization of the new viruses so that vaccine may be prepared, development of techniques for more rapid vaccine production and the manufacture and stock piling of antiviral drugs. The H5N1 outbreak of virulent chicken influenza in 1997 in Hong Kong which resulted in the deaths of six of 18 infected persons serves as a wake-up call. Should such a virus attain high transmissibility in humans, a pandemic of tragic proportions might ensue. Even though the timing of onset of the next pandemic cannot be precisely predicted, world governments must understand the urgency of the problem and increase funding for influenza pandemic control.","Stiver, H Grant",Expert review of vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14761242/,241

194308,Follow up of feline immunodeficiency virus-infected cats.,2001,"Although DNA vaccines are already in use for treatment of some animal diseases, they suffer from lower immunogenicity in humans which limits their effectiveness. Thus, recent studies have been focused on strategies to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. However, there is little known about the molecular and immunological mechanisms by which DNA vaccines work. It has long been the central dogma that DNA vaccine immunogenicity can be attributed to its immunostimulatory CpG motifs acting as 'a built-in adjuvant"", which is recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9, the sole receptor for CpG motifs. Recent research, however, has provided evidence for a new mechanism of action for DNA vaccines. It was reported that the adjuvant effect of plasmid DNA is mediated by its double-stranded structure, which activates TBK1-dependent innate immune signaling pathways in the absence of TLRs. Moreover, TBK1-signaling may delineate direct or indirect (cross) antigen presentation through distinct types of cells in vivo, critical for the induction of antigen-specific CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells, respectively. This additional information about the mechanism of action of DNA vaccines will lead to improvements in their efficacy and safety.","Coban, Cevayir; Koyama, Shohei; Takeshita, Fumihiko; Akira, Shizuo; Ishii, Ken J",Human vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18535407/,241

We report the emergence of an outbreak of HAdV infections in Singapore, presumably caused by a change of the predominating type to HAdV-7. We examined the clinical features of children admitted with HAdV infection to 1 institution and the risk factors for severe infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective case-control study of all HAdV-infected children admitted during weeks 1 to 19 in 2013, as identified from laboratory records. A descriptive retrospective analysis of epidemiology, clinical data and the outcome of these children was also performed. Patients with severe infections were defined as cases, those with non-severe infections as controls, and the 2 groups were compared to find possible independent risk factors. RESULTS Eighty-five patients with HAdV infection were studied, including 11 (12.9%) cases and 74 (87.1%) controls. Binary logistic regression showed that cases were more likely to be <2 years old (adjusted OR 10.6, 95% CI, 1.8 to 63.2) and to have significant comorbidities (adjusted OR 19.9, 95% CI, 3.4 to 116.1) compared to controls. The predominant type in 2013 was HAdV-7, which differed from 2011 and 2012, when HAdV-3 was more common. There was a trend towards pneumonia being more common in patients infected with HAdV-7 than in patients infected with other types, although this did not reach statistical significance (OR 2.8, 95% CI, 0.9 to 8.7). CONCLUSION The emergence of HAdV-7 in a population where other HAdV types had circulated previously may have caused the outbreak in Singapore, and this was associated with more serious infections in children.

Case reports and retrospective studies were gathered by searching Medline/Pubmed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases. 11 articles were selected for review. Results COVID-19 myocarditis affected patients over the age of 50 and incidences among both genders were equally reported. Patients presented with dyspnea, cough, fever with hypotension and chest pain. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with increased C-reactive protein, while arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated respiratory acidosis. All cardiac markers were elevated. Radiographic imaging of the chest showed bilateral ground glass opacities or bilateral infiltrates, while cardiac magnetic resonance imaging produced late gadolinium enhancements. Electrocardiography demonstrated ST-segment elevation or inverted T waves, while echocardiography revealed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with cardiomegaly or increased wall thickness. Management with corticosteroids was favored in most cases, followed by antiviral medication. The majority of studies reported either recovery or no further clinical deterioration.

195343,The infectivity and pathogenicity of a group 2 bovine coronavirus in pups.,2007,"Poliovirus interactions with host cells were investigated by studying the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes at the 3' end of poliovirus negative-strand RNA which are presumed to be involved in viral RNA synthesis. It was previously shown that two host cell proteins with molecular masses of 36 and 38 kDa bind to the 3' end of viral negative-strand RNA at approximately 3 to 4 h after infection. We tested the hypothesis that preexisting cellular proteins are modified during the course of infection and are subsequently recruited to play a role in viral replication. It was demonstrated that the 38-kDa protein, either directly or indirectly, is the product of processing by poliovirus 3CD/3C proteinase. Only the modified 38-kDa protein, not its precursor protein, has a high affinity for binding to the 3' end of viral negative-strand RNA. This modification depends on proteolytically active proteinase, and a direct correlation between the levels of 3CD proteinase and the 38-kDa protein was demonstrated in infected tissue culture cells. The nucleotide (nt) 5-10 region (positive-strand numbers) of poliovirus negative-strand RNA is important for binding of the 38-kDa protein. Deletion of the nt 5-10 region in full-length, positive-strand RNA renders the RNA noninfectious in transfection experiments. These results suggest that poliovirus 3CD/3C proteinase processes a cellular protein which then plays an essential role during the viral life cycle.","Roehl, H H; Parsley, T B; Ho, T V; Semler, B L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8985386/,241

Probability of contracting this highly contagious infection is similar across age groups but disease severity and fatality among aged patients with or without comorbidities are reportedly higher. Previous studies suggest that age associated transcriptional changes in lung and immune system results in a proinflammatory state and increased susceptibility to infectious lung diseases. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infection could augment ageing-related gene expression alterations resulting in severe outcomes in elderly patients. To identify genes that can potentially increase covid-19 disease severity in ageing people, we compared age associated gene expression changes with disease-associated expression changes in lung/BALF and whole blood obtained from publicly available data. We observed (i) a significant overlap of gene expression profiles of patients' BALF and blood with lung and blood of the healthy group, respectively; (ii) a more pronounced overlap in blood compared to lung; and (iii) a similar overlap between host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 and ageing blood transcriptome. Pathway enrichment analysis of overlapping gene sets suggest that infection alters expression of genes already dysregulated in the elderly, which together may lead to poor prognosis. eQTLs in these genes may also confer poor outcome in young patients worsening with age and comorbidities. Further, the pronounced overlap observed in blood may explain clinical symptoms including blood clots, strokes, heart attack, multi-organ failure etc. in severe cases. This model based on a limited patient dataset seems robust and holds promise for testing larger tissue specific datasets from patients with varied severity and across populations.","Bhattacharyya, Upasana; Thelma, B K",Journal of genetics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33168795/,241

These antibodies, via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, are able to facilitate dengue virus (DENV) growth in Fc-bearing host cells. The mechanism of ADE-enhanced DENV production is believed to be mediated through increasing the infected-cell mass. In the present work, the effect of ADE infection was explored further, focusing on the post-entry events of ADE infection. It was hypothesized that the higher virus production in ADE infection compared with DENV infection may be due to the ability of this infection pathway to suppress key antiviral molecules. Therefore, the influence of ADE infection on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-12 (IL-12), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6 and IL-10, was investigated and it was found that DENV infection via the Fc receptor-mediated pathway was able to suppress the transcription and translation of IL-12, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. In contrast, infection via this route facilitated expression and synthesis of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Moreover, this study demonstrates that the ADE infection pathway also suppresses an innate anti-DENV mediator, nitric oxide radicals, by disrupting the transcription of the iNOS gene transcription factor, IRF-1, and blocking the activation of STAT-1. In conclusion, ADE infection not only facilitates the entry process, but also modifies innate and adaptive intracellular antiviral mechanisms, resulting in unrestricted DENV replication in THP-1 cells.","Chareonsirisuthigul, Takol; Kalayanarooj, Siripen; Ubol, Sukathida",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17251552/,241

METHODS According the clinical diagnostic standard of atypical pneumonia of Ministry of Health P. R. China, liver function was assessed in 110 SARS patients admitted from February 2003 to June 2003. Of them 8 SARS patients died, and the livers were pathologically examined, and their liver function parameters were compared with that of the 35 healthy controls. RESULTS Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin (TBil) of patients with SARS were higher than those of controls, they were (91.61+/-50.53) U/L vs. (32.91+/-10.56) U/L, (78.68+/-33.32) U/L vs. (29.43+/-8.89) U/L, (429.95+/-188.94) U/L vs. (200.83+/-44.86) U/L, (11.67+/-4.26) micromol/L vs. (8.44+/-3.86) micromol/L, all P<0.001. Albumin (ALB) and pro-albumin (PAB) of patients with SARS were lower than those of controls, they were (34.40+/-5.13) g/L vs. (42.09+/-6.79) g/L, (0.20+/-0.06) g/L vs. (0.34+/-0.05) g/L, both P<0.001. Direct reaction bilirubin (DBil), total bile acid (TBA), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) showed no marked difference between SARS patients and controls, all P>0.05. Non-specific inflammation in the liver was observed in pathological examination in 4 cases. ALT, AST, GGT and LDH were always 4 to 9 times of normal. The ratio of abnormality of ALT, AST and PAB were more than 80.0 percent, the ratio of abnormality of ALB was 42.7 percent, and less than 30.0 percent for other indexes. The average of LDH, ALT, and AST of dead patients were higher than those of the survivors. Histopathology of liver was non-specific hepatitis. CONCLUSION The patients with SARS are prone to have mild non-specific hepatitis. It seldom causes the typical symptoms of hepatitis and it is easy to be ignored in clinic.","Guan, Yu-juan; Tang, Xiao-ping; Yin, Chi-biao; Yi, Zheng-qing",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15132787/,241

METHODS The throat swab samples from 40 hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 16 hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients were recruited. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected in throat swab samples with RT-PCR test kits from Sansure Biotech (""Sansure"" for short), Jiangsu Bioperfectus Technologies (""Bioperfectus"" for short) and BGI Genomics (""BGI"" for short). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and Kappa value were analyzed. The viral nucleic acid was extracted from the throat swab samples by one-step cleavage and magnetic bead methods, and the efficacy of two extraction methods was also compared. The results of magnetic bead method for nucleic acid extraction by two different extractors (Sansure Natch CS S12C Fully Automated Nucleic Acid Extraction System vs. Tianlong NP968-C Nucleic Acid Extractor) were also compared. RESULTS The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and kappa value were 95.00%, 87.50%, 95.00%, 87.50%and 0.825 for Sansure kit; 90.00%, 87.50%, 94.74%, 77.78%and 0.747 for the Bioperfectus kit, and 82.50%, 81.25%, 91.67%, 65.00%and 0.593 for the BGI kit, respectively. The positive, negative and total coincident rates and kappa value of viral nucleic acid detection results using the samples extracted by one-step cleavage and magnetic bead methods were 95.24%, 100.00%, 96.43%and 0.909, respectively, but the one-step cleavage method took only 25 min, while the magnetic bead method required 180 min. The positive, negative and total coincident rates and kappa value of viral nucleic acid detection results using the samples extracted by the two different nucleic acid extractors were 85.00%, 100.00%, 89.29% and 0.764, respectively.

A single-stranded helix of diam. 14 to 16 nm and up to 320 nm in length was released from disrupted particles of human coronavirus strain 229E and mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 after incubation in mild conditions. The helical complexes appeared to be composed of globular subunits with long axes of 5 to 7 nm surrounding a hollow core of diam. 3 to 4 nm. The complexes were shown to be sensitive to both pancreatic RNase and to pronase. No undegraded internal component was obtained from disrupted avian infectious bronchitis virus particles. We conclude that these structures are RNP complexes.

METHODS This was a single-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo (sham)-controlled pilot trial. Patients with ALS were randomized to receive either sham NIV or active NIV and underwent active surveillance approximately every 3 months until they reached a forced vital capacity (FVC) <50% or required NIV for clinical symptom management. RESULTS In total, 54 participants were randomized. The mean NIV use was 2.0 hours (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.0) per day in the sham NIV treatment group and 3.3 hours (CI 2.0-4.6) per day in the active NIV group, which did not differ by treatment group (p = 0.347). The majority of sham NIV participants (88%) and active NIV participants (73%) reported only mild or no problem with NIV use. Difference of change in FVC through the treatment period by group (0.44 per month) favored active NIV (p = 0.049). Survival and changes in maximal inspiratory or expiratory pressure did not differ between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS The efficacy of early NIV in ALS should be tested in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00580593). CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with ALS, adherence with NIV and sham NIV are similar.","Jacobs, Teresa L; Brown, Devin L; Baek, Jonggyu; Migda, Erin M; Funckes, Timothy; Gruis, Kirsten L",Neurology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27581221/,241

Regulation of the number of circulating monocytes thus has implications for disease pathogenesis. However, the mechanisms controlling monocyte emigration from the bone marrow niche where they are generated remain undefined. We demonstrate here that the chemokine receptor CCR2 was required for emigration of Ly6C(hi) monocytes from bone marrow. Ccr2(-/-) mice had fewer circulating Ly6C(hi) monocytes and, after infection with Listeria monocytogenes, accumulated activated monocytes in bone marrow. In blood, Ccr2(-/-) monocytes could traffic to sites of infection, demonstrating that CCR2 is not required for migration from the circulation into tissues. Thus, CCR2-mediated signals in bone marrow determine the frequency of Ly6C(hi) monocytes in the circulation.","Serbina, Natalya V; Pamer, Eric G",Nature immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16462739/,241

We have labelled, with 35S-methionine, the structural polypeptides of 12 of the European isolates during growth in de-embryonated eggs. The S2, spike-anchoring, polypeptide of isolates of all four serotypes had a molecular weight of 87 000 (87K) whereas the US IBV-M41 strain had S2 of 84K. When the isolates were grouped according to the molecular weight of the other spike glycopolypeptide, S1, and the membrane (M) glycopolypeptide four groups emerged which corresponded to the serotypes based on neutralisation tests. Serotypes A (isolates D207, 1, 5 and 6) and B (isolates 7, 8 and D3896) had S1 of 91.5K while serotypes C (isolates 9 and D3128) and D (isolates D212 and D1466) had S1 of 90K. The M of serotypes A and D had a molecular weight of 30K while that of serotypes B and C was 27K. Chymotrypsin and protease V8 were used for limited proteolysis, the hydrolysis of S1 giving the greatest discrimination between serotypes. After proteolysis of S1 the UK isolates of serotype A gave identical profiles which were very similar to the Dutch serotype A isolate D207. Isolates of serotype B gave S1 profiles very similar to those of serotype A, as did D274 which is serologically related to both groups A and B. Serotypes C and D were distinguishable from each other and from serotypes A and B on the basis of the S1 peptide profiles. These results strengthen the view that the UK and Dutch isolates are closely related and that serotypes A and B are more closely related to each other than to either group C or D serotypes.","Cavanagh, D; Davis, P J",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18766585/,241

The active species is undissociated hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Hypochlorites are lethal to most microbes, although viruses and vegetative bacteria are more susceptible than endospore-forming bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Activity is reduced by the presence of heavy metal ions, a biofilm, organic material, low temperature, low pH, or UV radiation. Clinical uses in health-care facilities include hyperchlorination of potable water to prevent Legionella colonization, chlorination of water distribution systems used in hemodialysis centers, cleaning of environmental surfaces, disinfection of laundry, local use to decontaminate blood spills, disinfection of equipment, decontamination of medical waste prior to disposal, and dental therapy.

With a special focus on Austria, we analyze specific politics of im-/mobilities concerning the organization of paid work and show how the socio-spatial conditions of who is permitted, denied or urged to work are inextricably linked to inequalities. It becomes apparent that while in principle all bodies are equally dependent on collective social relations and enduring infrastructure, not everybody contributes equally to their maintenance. In fact, the governance of im-/mobilities follows and reinforces already prevalent inequality regimes based on class, gender and migration relations, thereby differentiating between bodies perceived as highly valuable and worth protecting and those categorized as less valued and potentially disposable.","Dobusch, Laura; Kreissl, Katharina","Gender, work and organization",,241
205362,A Novel Computational Approach for the Discovery of Drug Delivery System Candidates for COVID-19,2021,"Introduction. Despite the existence of generally accepted diagnostic protocols, when a new coronavirus infection is suspected, in some cases, it is increasingly difficult to detect changes in the lung tissue in a timely manner due to the heavy workload of the main method of radiation diagnostics – computed tomography. Purpose of the study. To determine the effectiveness of the appointment of an X-ray examination as first-line metgod, as well as to carry out a comparative analysis of the use of radiation diagnostics methods – computed tomography and radiography in relation to the diagnostic sensitivity to changes in lung tissue when a person is infected with the SARS-COV-2 virus. Materials and methods. 150 patients (63.0 ± 8.4 years) with confirmed coronavirus infection were examined. Each of the participants underwent X-ray examination and computed tomography of the chest organs. The percentage of subjects studied for each of the degrees of severity of lung damage was determined to identify the proportion of involvement of lung tissue in the pathological process in the bulk of the examined individuals. Results. Of the 150 patients, changes in the lung tissue during chest X-ray were detected in 97 (65%), respectively, in 53 (35%), pathological changes in the lungs were not visualized. When examining patients by computed tomography, changes in the lungs were detected in 143 patients (95%), X-ray morphological changes were not detected in 7 subjects (5%). When detecting the volume of lung damage, it turned out that the majority of the subjects – 86 people (57%) – had the degree of damage CT-2. The degree of CT-1 and CT-3 was determined in 26 (17%) and 25 (17%) patients, respectively. CT-4 was observed in 6 patients (4%), and in 5% of cases, CT was not able to detect pathological changes in the lung tissue, the degree of CT-0 was established. Conclusion. In the assessment of viral lung damage, radiography takes a significant place, but in 35% of cases, radiographic examination failed to identify the existing pathological changes. CT of the chest organs confirms its value as the “gold standard” in the study of pulmonary pathology in coronavirus infection, but if it is impossible to perform it, radiography is recommended. © 2021 Vigne et Vin Publications Internationales.

Randomized controlled trials examining the effects of a driving intervention among older adults &#8805; 50 years of age were included. Thirty-one studies were identified using a systematic literature review, and 26 were included in meta-analyses. The following types of driving interventions were identified: physical retraining/exercise (e.g., flexibility and coordination training); visual-perceptual training (e.g., improving figure-ground discrimination); cognitive training (e.g., Useful Field of View cognitive training); education (e.g., classroom driver refresher course); context-specific training (i.e., on-road training in car, driving simulator training); combined intervention approaches (e.g., education and context-specific training combined). Effect sizes were calculated for each driving intervention type relative to control groups using random-effects. Physical retraining/exercise, visual-perceptual training, and combined intervention approaches demonstrated medium to large effects on on-road driving performance, ds = 0.564-1.061, ps < .050. Cognitive training approaches reduced at-fault crashes by almost 30 %, OR = 0.729, 95 % CI [0.553, 0.962], p = .026. Education and context-specific approaches were not efficacious to improve driving safety outcomes, ps> .050. In summary, skill-specific interventions (physical retraining/exercise, visual-perceptual training, cognitive training) and combined intervention approaches improved on-road driving performance and reduced at-fault crashes. Optimizing interventions that target age-related functional declines and combined intervention approaches is recommended.","Fausto, Bernadette A; Adorno Maldonado, Pedro F; Ross, Lesley A; Lavallière, Martin; Edwards, Jerri D",Accid Anal Prev,,241

To quantify and describe the impact of a number of prognostic factors, including frailty and inflammatory markers. SETTING: Five acute National Health Service Hospitals in east London. DESIGN: Prospectively defined observational study using registry data. PARTICIPANTS: 1737 patients aged 16 years or over admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 1 January and 13 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from time of first hospital admission with COVID-19 diagnosis during or prior to admission. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU and hospital length of stay and type and duration of organ support. Multivariable survival analyses were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: 1737 were included in our analysis of whom 511 had died by day 30 (29%). 538 (31%) were from Asian, 340 (20%) black and 707 (40%) white backgrounds. Compared with white patients, those from minority ethnic backgrounds were younger, with differing comorbidity profiles and less frailty. Asian and black patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU and to receive invasive ventilation (OR 1.54, (95% CI 1.06 to 2.23); p=0.023 and OR 1.80 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.71); p=0.005, respectively). After adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian (HR 1.49 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.86); p<0.001) and black (HR 1.30 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.65); p=0.036) backgrounds were more likely to die. These findings persisted across a range of risk factor-adjusted analyses accounting for major comorbidities, obesity, smoking, frailty and ABO blood group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds had higher mortality from COVID-19 infection despite controlling for all previously identified confounders and frailty. Higher rates of invasive ventilation indicate greater acute disease severity. Our analyses suggest that patients of Asian and black backgrounds suffered disproportionate rates of premature death from COVID-19.","Apea, Vanessa J; Wan, Yize I; Dhairyawan, Rageshri; Puthucheary, Zudin A; Pearse, Rupert M; Orkin, Chloe M; Prowle, John R",BMJ Open,,241

The pathophysiology of neuropathic pain is very complex, and more research needs to be done to find the exact mechanism. Patients that have preexisting conditions such as cancer and diabetes are at high-risk of developing NP. Many NP patients are misdiagnosed and receive delayed treatment due to a lack of a standardized classification system that allows clinicians to identify, understand, and utilize pain management in these patients.

A key feature of the model is that all assets have \textit{co-integration}, which, if sustained, allows for long-term positive profits with low probability of losses. Optimal portfolios are found by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, to which we can introduce portfolio constraints such as market neutral or dollar neutral. Under specific conditions of the parameters, we can prove there is long-term stability for an optimal portfolio with stable growth rate. Historical prices of the S\&P500 constituents can be tested for co-integration and our model calibrated for analysis, from which we find that co-integration strategies require a terminal investment horizon sufficiently far into the future in order for the optimal portfolios to gain from co-integration. The data also demonstrates that statistical arbitrage portfolios will have improved in-sample Sharpe ratios compared to multivariate Merton portfolios, and that statistical arbitrage portfolios are naturally immune to market fluctuations.","Li, T.

The diagnostic value of CT is unclear. We aimed to compare the performance of CT and initial RT-PCR for clinically suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epicentre-Wuhan, China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 infection who underwent initial RT-PCR and chest CT at the same time were retrospectively enrolled. Two radiologists with specific training reviewed the CT images independently and final diagnoses of the presence or absence of COVID-19 was reached by consensus. With serial RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed. A strategy of combining initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed to study the additional benefit. RESULTS: 82 patients admitted to hospital between Jan 10, 2020 to Feb 28, 2020 were enrolled. 34 COVID-19 and 48 non-COVID-19 patients were identified by serial RT-PCR. The sensitivity, specificity was 79% (27/34) and 100% (48/48) for initial RT-PCR and 77% (26/34) and 96% (46/48) for chest CT. The image readers had a good interobserver agreement with Cohen's kappa of 0.69. No statistical difference was found in the diagnostic performance between initial RT-PCR and chest CT. The comprehensive strategy had a higher sensitivity of 94% (32/34). CONCLUSIONS: Initial RT-PCR and chest CT had comparable diagnostic performance in identification of suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epidemic center. To compensate potential risk of false-negative PCR, chest CT should be applied for clinically suspected patients with negative initial RT-PCR.","He, Jian-Long; Luo, Lin; Luo, Zhen-Dong; Lyu, Jian-Xun; Ng, Ming-Yen; Shen, Xin-Ping; Wen, Zhibo",Respir Med,,241

The Department of Diagnostic Imaging (DDI) conceived an organizational approach based on three different pathways for low-risk, high-risk, and confirmed Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) patients to accomplish three main targets: guarantee a safe pathway for non-COVID-19 patients, ensure health personnel safety, and maintain an efficient workload. Thus, an additional pathway was created with the aid of a trailer-mounted Computed Tomography (CT) scanner devoted to positive patients. We evaluated the performance of our approach from February 21 through April 12 in terms of workload (e.g., number of CT examinations) and safety (COVID-19-positive healthcare workers). There was an average of 72.2 and 17.8 COVID-19 patients per day in wards and the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), respectively. A total of 176 high-risk and positive patients were examined. High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) was one of the most common exams, and 24 pulmonary embolism scans were performed. No in-hospital transmission occurred in the DDI neither among patients nor among health personnel. The weekly number of in-patient CT examinations decreased by 27.4%, and the surgical procedures decreased by 29.5%. Patient screening and dedicated diagnostic pathways allowed the maintenance of high standards of care while working in safety.","Cester, Giacomo; Giraudo, Chiara; Causin, Francesco; Boemo, Deris Gianni; Anglani, Mariagiulia; Capizzi, Alfio; Carretta, Giovanni; Cattelan, Annamaria; Cecchin, Diego; Cianci, Vito; Crisanti, Andrea; De Conti, Giorgio; Donato, Daniele; Flor, Luciano; Gabrieli, Joseph-Domenico; Munari, Marina; Navalesi, Paolo; Ponzoni, Alberto; Scapellato, Maria Luisa; Tiberio, Ivo; Vianello, Andrea; Stramare, Roberto",,,241

However, the susceptibility of the brain to SARS-CoV-2, and the mechanisms underlying neurological infection are still elusive. Here, we utilized human embryonic stem cell-derived brain organoids and monolayer cortical neurons to investigate infection of brain with pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. Spike-containing SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infected neural layers within brain organoids. The expression of ACE2, a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was sustained during the development of brain organoids, especially in the somas of mature neurons, while remaining rare in neural stem cells. However, pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the axon of neurons, which lack ACE2. Neural infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus did not increase in proportion to viral load, but only 10% of neurons were infected. Our findings demonstrate that brain organoids provide a useful model for investigating SARS-CoV-2 entry into the human brain and elucidating the susceptibility of the brain to SARS-CoV-2.","Yi, Sang Ah; Nam, Ki Hong; Yun, Jihye; Gim, Dongmin; Joe, Daeho; Kim, Yong Ho; Kim, Han-Joo; Han, Jeung-Whan; Lee, Jaecheol",Viruses,,241

It has a potential to be explosive, with high secondary attack rate (SAR) and cause significant morbidity and mortality. This study compares control measures instituted on-board two ships with similar outbreaks and recommends a standardized evidence-based outbreak response against them. Methods: This is a descriptive study, showing comparative analysis of control measures instituted on-board two ships, a cruise ship in case of COVID-19 and a warship in case of H1N1 influenza, with novel viral respiratory disease outbreak, at different span of time. Data of the date of onset, clinical details, laboratory results, history of travel, history of contact with positive case and control measures initiated were collected, analysed and compared. Results: Of the two ships compared, one was a cruise ship with 712 COVID-19 cases, with an attack rate (AR) of 19.2% and 13 deaths, and other a warship with 14 cases of H1N1 influenza and an AR of 4.83%. The epidemic curve for both the outbreaks was plotted to study time distribution. Conclusion: Active surveillance, early self-reporting and immediate disembarkation of the suspects, along with strict compliance of hand hygiene, cough etiquettes and disinfection enhancement, will help in early mitigation of the outbreak. Health education should be undertaken to impart evidence-based knowledge and alleviate fear of the unknown.

As these queries are not limited to the synchronous time frame of a lecture, there is a high chance of many of them being related or even equivalent. One way to deal with this problem is to cluster these questions depending on their topic. In our previous work, we aimed to find an improved method of clustering that would give us a high efficiency, using a recurring LDA model. Our data set contained questions posted online from a Computer Science course at the University of Bath. A significant number of these questions contained code excerpts, which we found caused a problem in clustering, as certain terms were being considered as common words in the English language and not being recognised as specific code terms. To address this, we implemented tagging of these technical terms using Python, as part of preprocessing the data set. In this paper, we explore the realms of tagging data sets, focusing on identifying code excerpts and providing empirical results in order to justify our reasoning.","Gkolia, Alexandra; Fernandes, Nikhil; Pizzo, Nicolas; Davenport, James; Nair, Akshar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08127v1.pdf,241

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the predictive properties of common community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) severity scores and COVID-19 specific indices. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort, COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a teaching hospital between 18 March-20 May 2020 were included. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics related to severity and mortality were measured and CURB-65, PSI, A-DROP, CALL, and COVID-GRAM scores were calculated as defined previously in the literature. Progression to severe disease and in-hospital/overall mortality during the follow-up of the patients were determined from electronic records. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard regression model was used. The discrimination capability of pneumonia severity indices was evaluated by receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-eight patients were included in the study. Sixty-two patients (20.8%) presented with severe COVID-19 while thirty-one (10.4%) developed severe COVID-19 at any time from the admission. In-hospital mortality was 39 (13.1%) while the overall mortality was 44 (14.8%). The mortality in low-risk groups that were identified to manage outside the hospital was 0 in CALL Class A, 1.67% in PSI low risk, and 2.68% in CURB-65 low-risk. However, the AUCs for the mortality prediction in COVID-19 were 0.875, 0.873, 0.859, 0.855, and 0.828 for A-DROP, PSI, CURB-65, COVID-GRAM, and CALL scores respectively. The AUCs for the prediction of progression to severe disease was 0.739, 0.711, 0,697, 0.673, and 0.668 for CURB-65, CALL, PSI, COVID-GRAM, A-DROP respectively. The hazard ratios (HR) for the tested pneumonia severity indices demonstrated that A-DROP and CURB-65 scores had the strongest association with mortality, and PSI, and COVID-GRAM scores predicted mortality independent from age and comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) scores can predict in COVID-19. The indices proposed specifically to COVID-19 work less than nonspecific scoring systems surprisingly. The CALL score may be used to decide outpatient management in COVID-19.","Ucan, E S; Ozgen Alpaydin, A; Ozuygur, S S; Ercan, S; Unal, B; Sayiner, A A; Ergan, B; Gokmen, N; Savran, Y; Kilinc, O; Avkan Oguz, V",Respir Med Res,,241

The following factors were associated with less utilization of virtual healthcare tools in multivariable logistic regression: older age (continuous odds ratio [OR] with increasing age: 0.987; 95% CI: 0.984-0.990), African-American race (OR for African American vs white race: 0.608; 95% CI: 0.517-0.715), unmarried status (OR for unmarried compared with married status: 0.689; 95% CI: 0.642-0.739), lower level of education (OR for education &#8804;high school vs >high school: 0.284; 95% CI: 0.259-0.311), weaker English proficiency (OR for no proficiency vs very good proficiency: 0.224; 95% CI: 0.091-0.552) and lower yearly earnings (OR for earnings <$45,000 vs earnings >$45,000: 0.582; 95% CI: 0.523-0.647). Conclusion: Older patients, those with African-American race, lower education, lower earnings and weak English proficiency are less likely to access the above studied virtual healthcare tools. Further efforts are needed to tackle disparities in telemedicine access.","Abdel-Rahman, Omar",J Comp Eff Res,,241

384575,Synchronous and collaborative online concept mapping of membrane transport,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the relevance of adequate decision making at both public health and healthcare levels. A bioethical response to the demand for medical care, supplies and access to critical care is needed. Ethically sound strategies are required for the allocation of increasingly scarce resources, such as rationing critical care beds. In this regard, it is worth mentioning the so-called 'last bed dilemma'. In this paper, we examine this dilemma, pointing out the main criteria used to solve it and argue that we cannot face these ethical issues as though they are only a dilemma. A more complex ethical view regarding the care of COVID-19 patients that is focused on proportional and ordinary treatments is required. Furthermore, discussions and forward planning are essential because deliberation becomes extremely complex during an emergency and the physicians' sense of responsibility may be increased if it is faced only as a moral dilemma.","Valera, Luca; Carrasco, María A; Castro, Ricardo",J. med. ethics,,241

Technological innovation has been one of the main driving forces leading to the continuous improvement of crime control and crime prevention strategies (e.g. GPS tracking and tagging, video surveillance, etc.). Given this, it is a moral obligation for the research community to consider how the contemporary technological developments (i.e. Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning, Edge Computing)might help reduce crime worldwide. In line with this, this paper provides a discussion of how a sample of contemporary hardware and software-based technologies might help further reduce criminal actions. After a thorough analysis of a wide array of technologies and a number of workshops with organisations of interest, we believe that the adoption of novel technologies by vulnerable individuals, victim support organisations and law enforcement can help reduce the occurrence of criminal activity.","Anderez, Dario Ortega; Kanjo, Eiman; Amnwar, Amna; Johnson, Shane; Lucy, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04204v1.pdf,241
385941,"Emergence of Thailand-like strains of porcine deltacoronavirus in Guangxi Province, China",2020,"OBJECTIVES: The main goal of the COVIDENZA trial is to evaluate if inhibition of testosterone signalling by enzalutamide can improve the outcome of patients hospitalised for COVID-19. The hypothesis is based on the observation that the majority of patients in need of intensive care are male, and the connection between androgen receptor signalling and expression of TMPRSS2, an enzyme important for SARS-CoV-2 host cell internalization. TRIAL DESIGN: Hospitalised COVID-19 patients will be randomised (2:1) to enzalutamide plus standard of care vs. standard of care designed to identify superiority. PARTICIPANTS: Included participants, men or women above 50 years of age, must be hospitalised for PCR confirmed COVID-19 symptoms and not in need of immediate mechanical ventilation. Major exclusion criteria are breast-feeding or pregnant women, hormonal treatment for prostate or breast cancer, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, current symptomatic unstable cardiovascular disease (see Additional file 1 for further details). The trial is registered at Umeå University Hospital, Region Västerbotten, Sweden and 8 hospitals are approved for inclusion in Sweden. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomised to the treatment arm will be treated orally with 160 mg (4x40 mg) enzalutamide (Xtandi®) daily, for five consecutive days. The study is not placebo controlled. The comparator is standard of care treatment for patients hospitalised with COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoints of the study are (time to) need of mechanical ventilation or discharge from hospital as assessed by a clinical 7-point ordinal scale (up to 30 days after inclusion). RANDOMISATION: Randomisation was stratified by center and sex. Each strata was randomized separately with block size six with a 2:1 allocation ratio (enzalutamide + ""standard of care"": ""standard of care""). The randomisation list, with consecutive subject numbers, was generated by an independent statistician using the PROC PLAN procedure of SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The trial is designed to have three phases. The first, an exploration phase of 45 participants (30 treatment and 15 control) will focus on safety and includes a more extensive laboratory assessment as well as more frequent safety evaluation. The second prolongation phase, includes the first 100 participants followed by an interim analysis to define the power of the study. The third phase is the continuation of the study up to maximum 600 participants included in total. TRIAL STATUS: The current protocol version is COVIDENZA v2.0 as of September 10, 2020.

It is known that in a plate with a symmetric discontinuity, with respect to the plate's mid-plane, mode conversion is restricted to modes that share the same symmetry as the incident mode. In this paper, we use an analytical model based on the reciprocity principle and finite element analysis to investigate mode conversion due to the interaction with different types of discontinuity, namely, non-symmetric, symmetric and geometrically symmetric but with opposite boundary conditions, that is one side of the discontinuity free and the other rigidly fixed. We show that the reflected field due to interaction with the latter is virtually restricted to modes with the opposite symmetry of the incident one, acting as a symmetry inverter discontinuity. Unlike fully symmetric discontinuities, the effectiveness of a symmetry inverter discontinuity depends on the frequency. This was proved with aid of the analytical model for a full-depth discontinuity and verified for partial depth discontinuities. Finally, symmetry inversion of SH waves was experimentally verified in acrylic plates which were symmetrically machined and filled with steel in one side to mimic a fixed boundary condition.","Kubrusly, Alan C; Tovar, Pedro; von der Weid, Jean Pierre; Dixon, Steve",Ultrasonics,,241

The study findings indicated that the university 's culture of innovation resulting from institutional support in the form of governances, grants, and services led to university administrators ' decision to outsource. The study findings also indicated that university administrators did not trust OPMs because the OPMs did not meet university administrators ' expectations. University administrators expected OPM staff to (a) have advanced degrees and experience working in higher education, (b) understand the academic discipline for the program they were supporting, and (c) understand higher education practices and policies.

406420,Biochemical characterization of a novel α-L-fucosidase from Pedobacter sp. and its application in synthesis of 3'-fucosyllactose and 2'-fucosyllactose,2020,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy presents an obstacle to the campaign to control COVID-19. It has previously been found to be associated with youth, female gender, low income, low education, low medical trust, minority ethnic group membership, low perceived risk from COVID-19, use of certain social media platforms and conspiracy beliefs. However, it is unclear which of these predictors might explain variance associated with others. METHODS: An online survey was conducted with a representative sample of 4343 UK residents, aged 18-75, between 21 November and 21 December 2020. Predictors of vaccine hesitancy were assessed using linear rank-order models. RESULTS: Coronavirus vaccine hesitancy is associated with youth, female gender, low income, low education, high informational reliance on social media, low informational reliance on print and broadcast media, membership of other than white ethnic groups, low perceived risk from COVID-19 and low trust in scientists and medics, as well as (to a much lesser extent) low trust in government. Coronavirus conspiracy suspicions and general vaccine attitudes appear uniquely predictive, jointly explaining 35% of variance. Following controls for these variables, effects associated with trust, ethnicity and social media reliance largely or completely disappear, whereas the effect associated with education is reversed. CONCLUSIONS: Strengthening positive attitudes to vaccination and reducing conspiracy suspicions with regards to the coronavirus may have a positive effect on vaccine uptake, especially among ethnic groups with heightened vaccine hesitancy. However, vaccine hesitancy associated with age and gender does not appear to be explained by other predictor variables tested here.","Allington, Daniel; McAndrew, Siobhan; Moxham-Hall, Vivienne; Duffy, Bobby",Psychol Med,,241
416656,Identification and expression analysis of MicroRNAs in chicken spleen in a corticosterone-induced stress model,2021,"COVID-19--a viral infectious disease--has quickly emerged as a global pandemic infecting millions of people with a significant number of deaths across the globe. The symptoms of this disease vary widely. Depending on the symptoms an infected person is broadly classified into two categories namely, asymptomatic and symptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals display mild or no symptoms but continue to transmit the infection to otherwise healthy individuals. This particular aspect of asymptomatic infection poses a major obstacle in managing and controlling the transmission of the infectious disease. In this paper, we attempt to mathematically model the spread of COVID-19 in India under various intervention strategies. We consider SEIR type epidemiological models, incorporated with India specific social contact matrix representing contact structures among different age groups of the population. Impact of various factors such as presence of asymptotic individuals, lockdown strategies, social distancing practices, quarantine, and hospitalization on the disease transmission is extensively studied. Numerical simulation of our model is matched with the real COVID-19 data of India till May 15, 2020 for the purpose of estimating the model parameters. Our model with zone-wise lockdown is seen to give a decent prediction for July 20, 2020.","Barman, Madhab; Nayak, Snigdhashree; Yadav, Manoj K.; Raha, Soumyendu; Mishra, Nachiketa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07988v2.pdf,241

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) has been particularly successful in evading our evolved defenses. The outcome has been tragic-across the globe, millions have been sickened and hundreds of thousands have died. Moreover, the quarantine has radically changed the structure of our lives, with devastating social and economic consequences that are likely to unfold for years. An evolutionary perspective can help us understand the progression and consequences of the pandemic. Here, a diverse group of scientists, with expertise from evolutionary medicine to cultural evolution, provide insights about the pandemic and its aftermath. At the most granular level, we consider how viruses might affect social behavior, and how quarantine, ironically, could make us susceptible to other maladies, due to a lack of microbial exposure. At the psychological level, we describe the ways in which the pandemic can affect mating behavior, cooperation (or the lack thereof), and gender norms, and how we can use disgust to better activate native ""behavioral immunity"" to combat disease spread. At the cultural level, we describe shifting cultural norms and how we might harness them to better combat disease and the negative social consequences of the pandemic. These insights can be used to craft solutions to problems produced by the pandemic and to lay the groundwork for a scientific agenda to capture and understand what has become, in effect, a worldwide social experiment.","Seitz, Benjamin M; Aktipis, Athena; Buss, David M; Alcock, Joe; Bloom, Paul; Gelfand, Michele; Harris, Sam; Lieberman, Debra; Horowitz, Barbara N; Pinker, Steven; Wilson, David Sloan; Haselton, Martie G",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,241

There are currently no antiviral therapies approved for the treatment or prevention of mild to moderate COVID-19 as remdesivir is only approved for severe COVID-19 cases. Here, we evaluated the antiviral potential of a Propylamylatin formula, which is a mixture of propionic acid and isoamyl hexanoates. The Propylamylatin formula was investigated in gaseous and liquid phases against 1 mL viral suspensions containing 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2. Viral suspensions were sampled at various times post-exposure and infectious virus was quantified by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Propylamylatin formula vapors were effective at inactivating infectious SARS-CoV-2 to undetectable levels at room temperature and body temperature, but the decline in virus was substantially faster at the higher temperature (15 min versus 24 h). The direct injection of liquid Propylamylatin formula into viral suspensions also completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and the rapidity of inactivation occurred in an exposure dependent manner. The overall volume that resulted in 90% viral inactivation over the course of the direct injection experiment (EC90) was 4.28 µls. Further investigation revealed that the majority of the antiviral effect was attributed to the propionic acid which yielded an overall EC90 value of 11.50 µls whereas the isoamyl hexanoates provided at most a 10-fold reduction in infectious virus. The combination of propionic acid and isoamyl hexanoates was much more potent than the individual components alone, suggesting synergy between these components. These findings illustrate the therapeutic promise of the Propylamylatin formula as a potential treatment strategy for COVID-19 and future studies are warranted.","Brown, Ashley N; Strobel, Gary; Hanrahan, Kaley C; Sears, Joe",Viruses,,241
467227,Challenges in Biomaterial-Based Drug Delivery Approach for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases: Opportunities for Extracellular Vesicles,2020,"Introduction and objectives Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in acute situations, where it is associated with more complications and higher mortality.Methods Analysis of the international HOPE registry (NCT04334291). The objective was to assess the prognostic information of AF in COVID-19 patients. A multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed to assess the relationship between AF and mortality. We also evaluated the impact on mortality and embolic events of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in these patients.Results Among 6217 patients enrolled in the HOPE registry, 250 had AF (4.5%). AF patients had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities. After propensity score matching, these differences were attenuated. Despite this, patients with AF had a higher incidence of in-hospital complications such as heart failure (19.3% vs 11.6%, P = .021) and respiratory insufficiency (75.9% vs 62.3%, P = .002), as well as a higher 60-day mortality rate (43.4% vs 30.9%, P = .005). On multivariate analysis, AF was independently associated with higher 60-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.234; 95%CI, 1.003-1.519). CHA2DS2-VASc score acceptably predicts 60-day mortality in COVID-19 patients (area ROC, 0.748; 95%CI, 0.733-0.764), but not its embolic risk (area ROC, 0.411; 95%CI, 0.147-0.675).Conclusions AF in COVID-19 patients is associated with a higher number of complications and 60-day mortality. The CHA2DS2-VASc score may be a good risk marker in COVID patients but does not predict their embolic risk.","Uribarri, Aitor; Núñez-Gil, Iván J; Aparisi, Álvaro; Arroyo-Espliguero, Ramón; Eid, Charbel Maroun; Romero, Rodolfo; Becerra-Muñoz, Víctor M; Feltes, Gisela; Molina, María; García-Aguado, Marcos; Cerrato, Enrico; Capel-Astrua, Thamar; Alfonso-Rodríguez, Emilio; Castro-Mejía, Alex F; Raposeiras-Roubín, Sergio; Espejo, Carolina; Pérez-Solé, Nerea; Bardají, Alfredo; Marín, Francisco; Fabregat-Andrés, Óscar; D039,; ascenzo, Fabrizio; Santoro, Francesco; Akin, Ibrahim; Estrada, Vicente; Fernández-Ortiz, Antonio; Macaya, Carlos",Rev. esp. cardiol.

The first case in Turkey was detected on March 11, 2020. The aim of the current study was to reveal the effects of COVID-19 on cranial nerves by monitoring people infected with the disease based on repeated examinations and surveys. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The data of 356 patients with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test who received treatment between June 2020 and August 2020 in our hospital were prospectively evaluated after the study was approved by the relevant ethics committee. RESULTS: Of the 356 patients included in the study, 47 under the age of 18 years were excluded due to their unreliable examination and anamnesis findings. In addition, seven patients that died while in hospital were excluded from the study due to the lack of examination and survey records during their hospitalization. The data of the remaining 302 patients were statistically analyzed. Symptoms of cranial nerve involvement were observed in 135 patients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus commonly results in cranial nerve symptoms. The fact that these findings are more common and severe in COVID-19 than previous SARS and MERS outbreaks suggests that it has a more neurotrophic and more aggressive neuroinvasion. While the negative effects of the virus on sensory functions resulting from cranial nerve involvement are evident, motor functions are rarely affected.","Doblan, Ahmet; Kaplama, Mehmet Erkan; Ak, Semih; Basmaci, Nazli; Tarini, Emine Zeynep; Göktas, Seniz Engür; Güler, Süleyman; Müderris, Togay",Am J Otolaryngol,,241

ANIMALS: 40 neonatal calves that were healthy (n = 10) or had diarrhea (30). PROCEDURES: The study was a cross-sectional study. Results of hematologic analyses and serum concentrations of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), trefoil factor 3 (TFF-3), Claudin-3 (CLDN-3), Î³-enteric smooth muscle actin (ACTG2), intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), interleukin-8 (IL-8), platelet-activating factor (PAF), and leptin (LP) were compared among calves grouped according to whether they were healthy (control group; G-1) or had diarrhea caused by K99 Escherichia coli (G-2; n = 10), bovine rota- or coronavirus (G-3; 5 each), or Cryptosporidium spp (G-4; 10). RESULTS: Across the 3 time points at which blood samples were obtained and evaluated, the groups of calves with diarrhea generally had markedly higher mean serum concentrations of L-FABP, TFF-3, IAP, IL-8, and LP, compared with the control group. In addition, G-2 also consistently had markedly higher mean serum concentrations of I-FAB and ACTG2 and lower mean serum concentrations of CLDN-3, compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated that degree of intestinal epithelial damage differed among calves grouped by the etiologic agent of diarrhea and that such damage might have been more severe in calves with diarrhea caused by K99 E coli. Additionally, our results indicated that serum concentrations of I-FABP, L-FABP, TFF-3, IAP, IL-8, ACTG2, LP, and CLDN-3 were useful biomarkers of intestinal epithelial damage in calves of the present study.","Ok, Mahmut; Yildiz, Ramazan; Hatipoglu, Fatih; Baspinar, Nuri; Ider, Merve; Üney, Kamil; Ertürk, Alper; Durgut, Murat K; Terzi, Funda",Am J Vet Res,,241

ARDS is caused and sustained by an uncontrolled inflammatory activation characterized by a massive release of cytokines (cytokine storm), diffuse lung oedema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and disseminated coagulation. Macrophage and T lymphocyte dysfunction plays a central role in this syndrome. In several experimental in vitro and in vivo models, many of these pathophysiological changes are triggered by stimulation of the P2X7 receptor. We hypothesize that this receptor might be an ideal candidate to target in Covid-19-associated severe pneumonia.

590283,Relationship between rate of infection and markers of inflammation/immunity in Holy Birman cats with feline coronavirus,2014-09-03,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, has brought extensive challenges to the scientific community in recent months. Several studies have been undertaken in an attempt to minimize the impact of the disease worldwide. Although new knowledge has been quickly disseminated, including viral mechanisms, pathophysiology, and clinical findings, there is a lack of information on the effective pharmacological management of this disease. In vitro studies have shown some benefits related to the use of antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. However, the data from open clinical trials on COVID-19 patients are controversial. OBJECTIVE: We present the protocol for a research project that compares the potential protective effect of antimalarials in preventing moderate-to-severe forms of COVID-19 in two groups: (1) patients treated chronically with antimalarials for rheumatic diseases and (2) other members of the patients’ household who have not been diagnosed with rheumatic diseases and are not taking antimalarials. METHODS: This is a 24-week, prospective, observational cohort study comprising patients from public and private health services across Brazil, who chronically use antimalarials for the treatment of immune-mediated rheumatic diseases, osteoarthritis, or chikungunya-related arthropathy. A total of six sequential phone interviews were scheduled during the COVID-19 outbreak in five different regions of Brazil. Information regarding social, epidemiological, and demographic data, as well as details about rheumatic diseases, antimalarials, comorbidities, and concomitant medication, is being recorded using a specific online form in the REDCap database. Symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, including fever, cough, dyspnea, anosmia, and dysgeusia, are being self-reported and collected via phone interviews. Our main outcomes are hospitalization, need of intensive care unit, and death. RESULTS: Recruitment began at the end of March 2020, and the inclusion was done during an 8-week period (from March 29 to May 17) with a total of 10,443 individuals enrolled at baseline, 5166 of whom have rheumatic diseases, from 23 tertiary rheumatology centers across 97 Brazilian cities. Data analysis is scheduled to begin after all inclusion data have been collected. CONCLUSIONS: This study, which includes a large sample of chronic antimalarial users, will allow us to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases and long-term antimalarial usage.

590643,Quantitative and Chemical Fingerprint Analysis for the Quality Evaluation of Isatis indigotica based on Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Photodiode Array Detector Combined with Chemometric Methods,2012-07-20,"Hormones like testosterone and progesterone in the humans play significant role in the regulation of various biological processes like the body growth, reproduction, and others. In last two decades, researchers are using ionic liquids (ILs) extensively in different areas of sciences, and they are a novel class of compounds as well as their polarity can be tuned. ILs are multidisciplinary in nature and can be used in chemistry, materials science, chemical engineering, and environmental science. Further, ILs are being explored to increase the solubility of drugs or biological potential molecules. Testosterone and progesterone are found to be not very polar in nature; therefore, the authors attempt to increase the solubility of testosterone and progesterone via interaction with ILs. It was studied with density functional theory calculations using Gaussian, and an increase in the value of dipole moment is observed for the complex of testosterone/progesterone with the ILs in comparison of individual one. The optimization energy and other thermodynamic energies of the ILs (IL1‐IL3), testosterone (T), testosterone‐IL (T‐IL1 to T‐IL3), progesterone (P), and progesterone‐ILs (P‐IL1 to P‐IL3) are found to be negative. Further, the change in free energy for the formation of complexes at room temperature is calculated. Further, the authors have investigated the synergistic effect of testosterone and progesterone against the main protease of new coronavirus using molecular docking. It is observed that the testosterone‐IL1 {IL1‐3‐(2‐hydroxyethyl)‐1‐methyl‐1H‐imidazol‐3‐ium 2,4,6‐trinitrophenolate} is found to be prominent against the main protease of SARS‐CoV‐2.","Kumari, Kamlesh; Kumar, Ajay; Bahadur, Indra; Singh, Prashant",J Phys Org Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511718/; https://doi.org/10.1002/poc.4273,241

The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. METHODS: : A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed. RESULTS: : We received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for depression. CONCLUSIONS: : The COVID-19 epidemic has induced stress levels for HCW, and high percentages of HCW have anxiety and depression.

Little is known about its exact impact on medical care workers and related factors in China. This study aims to identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical care workers in China. METHODS From February 23 to March 5, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 863 medical care workers from seven provinces in China using standard questionnaires measuring adverse psychological outcomes including Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale(DASS)and related psychosocial factors like perceived threat, social support and coping strategies. Exploratory Factor analysis was performed to identify the dimensions of perceived threat by study participants. Multivariate regression was used to examine the determinants of adverse psychological outcomes. RESULTS Posttraumatic stress (PTS) were prevalent in this sample of health care professionals, and 40.2% indicated positive screens for significant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. The proportion of having mild to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were 13.6, 13.9 and 8.6%, respectively. Perceived threat and passive coping strategies were positively correlated to PTS and DASS scores, while perceived social support and active coping strategies were negatively correlated to DASS scores. Nurses were more likely to be anxious than others among medical care workers during the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSIONS Adverse psychological symptoms were prevalent among medical care workers in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. Screening for adverse psychological outcomes and developing corresponding preventive measures would be beneficial in decreasing negative psychological outcomes.","Si, Ming-Yu; Su, Xiao-You; Jiang, Yu; Wang, Wen-Jun; Gu, Xiao-Fen; Ma, Li; Li, Jing; Zhang, Shao-Kai; Ren, Ze-Fang; Ren, Ran; Liu, Yuan-Li; Qiao, You-Lin",Infectious diseases of poverty,https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40249-020-00724-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32787929/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00724-0,241

593764,Changes in some acute phase protein and immunoglobulin concentrations in cats affected by feline infectious peritonitis or exposed to feline coronavirus infection,2003-04-26,"The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak is upending current life and generating much anxiety and uncertainty. The effects of home confinement, social isolation, cancelled schools, closed businesses, and negative economic impacts have had serious consequences. Hematologic patients (HP) are a subset of highly vulnerable population with increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms due to their immunocompromised status. These risks have been augmented during the COVID outbreak because of deviations from current standards of care, e.g., reduced visits, treatment supply and access to routine exams. This study investigated the impact of the current pandemic on HP assessing demographics, medical information, mental health and caregiver practical management. In collaboration with AIL (Italian Association against Leukemia) and CNR (National Research Council), a survey was generated and distributed to Italian HP. The general population (GP) were used as controls. The assessment used the DASS-21 questionnaire, a self-reported, 21 item screening instrument that provides independent measures of depression, stress and anxiety with recommended severity thresholds subscales. The survey was self-administered between April and August, 2020. The questionnaires' reliability was verified based on an analysis of its internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha. As of 30 June 2020, 1113 HP and 1125 GP completed the survey from 20 Italian Regions. The two population groups were homogeneous by age, gender and distribution and included regions at both high (CHP) and low (CLP) prevalence of infections at the time of the survey. HP and GP median age was 50 years (range: HP 11- 93; GP 13-85). 61% HP and 68% GP were female; the rest were male. The year of diagnosis of hematological disease ranged from 1965 to 2020; 21.9% had chronic myeloid leukemia, followed by Hodgkin (15.7%) and non-Hodgkin (15.9%) lymphomas, chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (15.9%), multiple myeloma (8.9%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (4.9%), acute myeloid (5.6%) and lymphoblastic (3.25%) leukemias, other (7%). 1071 HP and 1125 GP responded about their occupation as follows: employed full/part time (38.7% HP , 47.7% GP), retired (19.2% HP,10.8% GP), freelancer (9.2% HP, 12.2% GP), unemployed (6.2% HP, 3.4% GP) , students (4.6% HP, 3.2% GP), company executive (4.1% HP, 4.8% GP), manager (2% HP, 4.7 % GP), cooperative member (0.7% HP , 0.7% GP), housewife (8.5% HP 4.8% GP), other (6.8% HP,7.7% GP). During the pandemic 63.7% HP didn't work and 36.3% did work compared to the GP group (33.8% didn't; 66.2 % did). Where specified, the reasons for not working were: layoffs (10.9% HP, 15.9% GP), lack of work (8.1%HP, 15.6 % GP), vacation/ parental leave (4.4% HP, 3.5% GP), reduced business activity for economic reasons (2.2% HP, 3.3% GP), occasional work (2.1% HP, 5.7% GP), seasonal employment, (0.6% HP,1.1 % GP). 625/1073 HP (58.2%) were in active treatment. Of these, 40.1% were in Day Hospital, 56.4% were outpatient; and 3.5% inpatients. The remaining HP were off therapy (448/1073; 41.8%). 1105 HP and 1127 GP responded to the DASS questionnaire. Extremely severe depression was found in 12.9% HP vs 7% GP; 18.1% HP expressed severe anxiety vs 9.6% GP and extremely severe stress was present in 7.1% HP and 5.3% GP. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the internal homogeneity of the questionnaire was 0.95, confirming the cohorts correctness (0.8 or greater, indicates a very good level of reliability). Providing care to HP during the pandemic has been challenging for both patients and doctors. Restrictions on visits and lab/instrumental exams, reduced equipment supply and a paucity of personal protection equipment (PPEs) for health care providers and patients have penalized normal routine care. As a result, 38.2% HP postponed or did not attend scheduled therapy and >50% had difficulty obtaining PPEs through normal sources; 57% in CHP and 36% in CLP regions had to buy them themselves. To our knowledge this is the first report of the impact of the pandemic on psychological distress, work consequences and illness management in HP. Most of HP in this study are outpatients in active treatment. Interesting data emerged from job losses, which is more common among HP. The DASS-21 instrument revealed higher anxiety and depression levels in HP. Detailed results including longitudinal analysis and high versus low geographic prevalence of COVID-19 infections will be presented.

596034,Dorsal spinous process impingement syndrome (‘kissing spine’) in a cat: imaging appearance and surgical management,2011-06-30,"Priority setting represents an even bigger challenge during public health emergencies than routine times. This is because such emergencies compete with routine programmes for the available health resources, strain health systems and shift health-care attention and resources towards containing the spread of the epidemic and treating those that fall seriously ill. This paper is part of a larger global study, the aim of which is to evaluate the degree to which national COVID-19 preparedness and response plans incorporated priority setting concepts. It provides important insights into what and how priority decisions were made in the context of a pandemic. Specifically, with a focus on a sample of 18 African countries’ pandemic plans, the paper aims to: (1) explore the degree to which the documented priority setting processes adhere to established quality indicators of effective priority setting and (2) examine if there is a relationship between the number of quality indicators present in the pandemic plans and the country’s economic context, health system and prior experiences with disease outbreaks. All the reviewed plans contained some aspects of expected priority setting processes but none of the national plans addressed all quality parameters. Most of the parameters were mentioned by less than 10 of the 18 country plans reviewed, and several plans identified one or two aspects of fair priority setting processes. Very few plans identified equity as a criterion for priority setting. Since the parameters are relevant to the quality of priority setting that is implemented during public health emergencies and most of the countries have pre-existing pandemic plans; it would be advisable that, for the future (if not already happening), countries consider priority setting as a critical part of their routine health emergency and disease outbreak plans. Such an approach would ensure that priority setting is integral to pandemic planning, response and recovery.","Kapiriri, Lydia; Kiwanuka, Suzanne; Biemba, Godfrey; Velez, Claudia; Razavi, S Donya; Abelson, Julia; Essue, Beverley M; Danis, Marion; Goold, Susan; Noorulhuda, Mariam; Nouvet, Elysee; Sandman, Lars; Williams, Iestyn",Health Policy Plan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34545395/; https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czab113,241

597844,Serum biomarkers of oxidative stress in cats with feline infectious peritonitis,2015-02-16,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly pathogenic alphacoronavirus. In the United States, highly virulent PEDV strains cause between 80 and 100% mortality in suckling piglets and are rapidly transmitted between animals and farms. To study the genetic factors that regulate pathogenesis and transmission, we developed a molecular clone of PEDV strain PC22A. The infectious-clone-derived PEDV (icPEDV) replicated as efficiently as the parental virus in cell culture and in pigs, resulting in lethal disease in vivo. Importantly, recombinant PEDV was rapidly transmitted to uninoculated pigs via indirect contact, demonstrating virulence and efficient transmission while replicating phenotypes seen in the wild-type virus. Using reverse genetics, we removed open reading frame 3 (ORF3) and replaced this region with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) gene to generate icPEDV-ΔORF3-RFP. icPEDV-ΔORF3-RFP replicated efficiently in vitro and in vivo, was efficiently transmitted among pigs, and produced lethal disease outcomes. However, the diarrheic scores in icPEDV-ΔORF3-RFP-infected pigs were lower than those in wild-type-virus- or icPEDV-infected pigs, and the virus formed smaller plaques than those of PC22A. Together, these data describe the development of a robust reverse-genetics platform for identifying genetic factors that regulate pathogenic outcomes and transmission efficiency in vivo, providing key infrastructural developments for developing and evaluating the efficacy of live attenuated vaccines and therapeutics in a clinical setting.","Beall, Anne; Yount, Boyd; Lin, Chun-Ming; Hou, Yixuan; Wang, Qiuhong; Saif, Linda; Baric, Ralph",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01451-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26733065/,241
598382,Identifying genetic markers of adaptation for surveillance of viral host jumps,2010-10-12,"SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) infection has recently become a worldwide challenge with dramatic global economic and health consequences. As the pandemic is still spreading, new data concerning Covid-19 complications and related mechanisms become increasingly available. Accumulating data suggest that the incidence of cardiac arrest and its outcome are adversely affected during the Covid-19 period. This may be further exacerbated by drug-related cardiac toxicity of Covid-19 treatment regimens. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms that lead to Covid-19 associated cardiac arrest is imperative, not only in order to improve its effective management but also to maximize preventive measures. Herein we discuss available epidemiological data on cardiac arrest during the Covid-19 pandemic as well as possible associated causes and pathophysiological mechanisms and highlight gaps in evidence warranting further investigation. The risk of transmission during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is also discussed in this review. Finally, we summarize currently recommended guidelines on CPR for Covid-19 patients including CPR in patients with cardiac arrest due to suspected drug-related cardiac toxicity in an effort to underscore the most important common points and discuss discrepancies proposed by established international societies.","Mavraganis, Georgios; Aivalioti, Evmorfia; Chatzidou, Sofia; Patras, Raphael; Paraskevaidis, Ioannis; Kanakakis, Ioannis; Stamatelopoulos, Kimon; Dimopoulos, Meletios-Athanasios",Food Chem Toxicol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916218/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278691520306323; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2020.111742; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691520306323,241

They hold similar potential to advance COVID-19 control and prevention, but SARS-CoV-2 viral load tests are not yet widely available. SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic tests, which typically employ real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), yield semi-quantitative results only. Droplet digital RT-PCR (RT-ddPCR) offers an attractive platform for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. We evaluated eight primer/probe sets originally developed for real-time RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests for use in RT-ddPCR, and identified three (Charité-Berlin E-Sarbeco and Pasteur Institute IP2 and IP4) as the most efficient, precise and sensitive for RT-ddPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. For example, E-Sarbeco primer/probe set analytical efficiency was approximately 83%, while assay precision, measured as coefficient of variation, was approximately 2% at 1000 input copies/reaction. Lower limits of quantification and detection for this primer/probe set were 18.6 and 4.4 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral loads in a convenience panel of 48 COVID-19-positive diagnostic specimens spanned a 6.2log(10) range, confirming substantial viral load variation in vivo. We further calibrated RT-ddPCR-derived SARS-CoV-2 E gene copy numbers against cycle threshold (C(t)) values from a commercial real-time RT-PCR diagnostic platform. This log-linear relationship can be used to mathematically-derive SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers from C(t) values, allowing the wealth of available diagnostic test data to be harnessed to address foundational questions in SARS-CoV-2 biology.","Kinloch, Natalie N.; Ritchie, Gordon; Dong, Winnie; Cobarrubias, Kyle D.; Sudderuddin, Hanwei; Lawson, Tanya; Matic, Nancy; Montaner, Julio S.G.; Leung, Victor; Romney, Marc G.; Lowe, Christopher F.; Brumme, Chanson J.; Brumme, Zabrina L.",J Mol Diagn,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2021.04.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34062285/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525157821001367; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525157821001367?v=s5,241

Findings indicate a strong correlation between the scale of SARS infections and level of rumour activities across regions. As for channels of dissemination, the rumour process still found a natural habitat in word of mouth, while internet‐based platforms and cell phone text messaging emerged as viable grapevines. Our particular typology of SARS‐incurred rumours leads us to identify four distinct types of rumours: legendary rumours; aetiological narratives; proto‐memorates; and bogies. The four types of rumours are discussed against the background of superstitious beliefs, folklore practices, popular mentalities, and China’s particular socio‐political information environment.","Tai, Zixue; Sun, Tao",Sociol Health Illn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21592140/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9566.2011.01329.x,241

Yet, while zoonotic diseases originate from a primary reservoir, most theoretical studies have principally focused on single-host processes, either exclusively humans or exclusively animals, without considering the importance of animal to human transmission for understanding the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases. Here we aim to investigate the importance of spillover transmission for explaining the number and the size of outbreaks. We propose a simple stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with a recurrent infection of an incidental host from a reservoir (e.g. humans by a zoonotic species), considering two modes of transmission, (1) animal-to-human and (2) human-to-human. The model assumes that (i) epidemiological processes are faster than other processes such as demographics or pathogen evolution and (ii) that an epidemic occurs until there are no susceptible individuals left. The results show that during an epidemic, even when the pathogens are barely contagious, multiple outbreaks are observed due to spillover transmission. Overall, the findings demonstrate that the only consideration of direct transmission between individuals is not sufficient to explain the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in an incidental host.","Voinson, Marina; Alvergne, Alexandra; Billiard, Sylvain; Smadi, Charline",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/213579,241

The secondary aim was to investigate differences between those who frequently included their children in cooking activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and those who included their children less, on a number of factors such as working from home, parents’ diet quality and cooking skills confidence. DESIGN: Cross-continental survey with Wilcoxon-signed ranks, Independent t tests, Mann–Whitney U, χ (2) and a binomial logistic regression used for assessment. SETTING: Online. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of parents over 18 years from the island of Ireland (n 180), Great Britain (n 312), the USA (n 120) and New Zealand (n 166). RESULTS: In three regions, parents’ time spent cooking and inclusion of children in everyday cooking activities increased (P < 0·001). Country (OR = 3·6, 95 % CI 1·7, 7·6), education (OR = 1·6, 95 % CI 1·1, 2·4), cooking skills confidence (OR = 1·02, 95 % CI 1·009, 1·032) and a parental higher intake of vegetables (OR = 1·3, 95 % CI 1·1, 1·5) were significant predictors of a more frequent inclusion of children in cooking activities. CONCLUSIONS: While there a number of key benefits to including children in cooking for the children such as providing life skills and increases in diet quality, this study highlighted a higher intake of vegetables by parents who included children more frequently in cooking activities. With continued lockdowns due to COVID-19 and perhaps more flexibility in working from home in the future, including children in cooking activities should be a key public health message for both children and parents.","Benson, Tony; Murphy, Blain; McCloat, Amanda; Mooney, Elaine; Dean, Moira; Lavelle, Fiona",Public health nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980021001932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947495/,241

While universal face mask wearing is a useful non-pharmaceutical preventive strategy, little is known about the perception of mask wearing during a pandemic. This study aimed to examine people’s face mask use in China and Europe. An online survey was conducted among residents in China, Austria, Germany, and Switzerland from the 1st to 10th of April 2020. With a convenience sampling approach, 655 valid answers were received including 267 Chinese and 388 European residents (261 from Austria, 101 from Germany, 26 from Switzerland). Self-reported face mask wearing status and related perceptions were assessed. Compared with the Europeans, Chinese participants showed a stronger pro-masking tendency. Subjective norm was an important predictor of face mask wearing in public. Wearing of face masks in the Chinese sample was also associated with risk perception as well as obedience to advice from local health authority. Discrepancies in face mask wearing suggest that targeted measures to promote face mask wearing are needed in Europe.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study of patients having urgent or cancer surgery at a NHS Trust from 1st March to 30th April 2020 who had been prioritised by a multi-disciplinary COVID Surgery group. Rates of post-operative PCR positive and suspected COVID-19 infections within 30 days, 30-day mortality and any death related to COVID-19 are reported. RESULTS: Overall 597 patients underwent surgery with a median age of 65 years (interquartile range (IQR) 54–74 years). Of these, 86.1% (514/597) had a current cancer diagnosis. During the period, 60.8% (363/597) of patients had surgery at the NHS Trust whilst 39.2% (234/597) had surgery at Independent Sector hospitals.

On April 8, 2020, our hospital began screening patients via pre-admission reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and chest computed tomography (CT). Although no patients exhibited apparent pneumonia, treatment delay or changes in treatment plans were required for a few patients based on the results of screening tests. During an emerging infectious disease pandemic, the likelihood of being infected, as well as the disease itself, affects clinical decision making in several ways. We summarized and presented our experience. CASE PRESENTATION: After the introduction of pre-admission screening, RT-PCR and CT were performed in 200 and 76 patients, respectively, as of June 30, 2020. The treatment of five patients, including two patients with cervical cancer, two patients with ovarian tumors, and one patient with ovarian cancer, was affected by the results. Two asymptomatic RT-PCR-positive patients did not develop COVID-19, but their treatment was delayed until the confirmation of negative results. The other three patients were RT-PCR-negative, but abnormal CT findings suggested the possibility of COVID-19, which delayed treatment. The patients receiving first-line preoperative chemotherapy for ovarian cancer had clinically evident exacerbations because of the treatment delay. CONCLUSION: During the epidemic phase of an emerging infectious disease, we found that COVID-19 has several other effects besides its incidence. The postponing treatment was the most common, therefore, treatment of ovarian tumors and ovarian cancer was considered to be the most likely to be affected among gynecological diseases. Protocols that allow for easy over-diagnosis can be disadvantageous, mainly because of treatment delays, and therefore, the protocols must be developed in light of the local infection situation.","Nogami, Yuya; Kobayashi, Yusuke; Tsuji, Kosuke; Yokota, Megumi; Nishio, Hiroshi; Nakamura, Masaru; Yamagami, Wataru; Morisada, Tohru; Tominaga, Eiichiro; Banno, Kouji; Aoki, Daisuke",J Ovarian Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13048-020-00711-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917254/,241

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as the most common mental illness after an epidemic, must be seriously addressed. This study aimed to investigate the subjective fear of the Chinese general public during COVID-19 and to explore how it affected the development of PTSD. Methods: An online questionnaire survey was conducted among 1,009 people from January 30 to February 14, 2020 (about 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak). The subjective fear was measured by a self-reported single-choice question. Four items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were selected to measure the subjects' sleep quality. Their post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Pearson correlation, hierarchical multivariate regression analysis, multiple mediator model, and bootstrapping were used in statistical analyses. Results: Different people showed different levels of subjective fear in response to the outbreak. There was a significant positive correlation between subjective fear and the total score of PCL-5 (R = 0.513, P < 0.01), meaning that the higher the degree of subjective fear, the more severe the symptoms of post-traumatic stress are. Subjective fear was an important predictor of PTSS, accounting for 24.3% of the variance. The total effect of subjective fear on PCL-5 scores was significant (total effect = 7.426, SE = 0.405, 95% CI = 6.631–8.221). The total indirect effect of subjective fear on PCL-5 scores through sleep quality was also significant (total indirect effect = 1.945, SE = 0.258, 95% CI = 1.436–2.470). Conclusions: Subjective fear has an important predictive effect on PTSS. In addition to the direct effect, our findings firstly demonstrate the mediating role of sleep quality in the relationship between subjective fear and PTSS.","Guo, Xin; Liu, Tuanjie; Xing, Chenqi; Wang, Yan; Shang, Zhilei; Sun, Luna; Jia, Yanpu; Wu, Lili; Ni, Xiong; Liu, Weizhi",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34093250/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.560602,241

609119,Induction and sequencing of Rousette bat interferon α and β genes,2008-07-15,"Summary Non-infectious UV-inactivated transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was previously shown to induce interferon alpha (IFIMα) secretion following in vitro incubation with blood mononuclear cells. In this study, pig foetuses at different stages of gestation were injected in utero with (a) partially UV-inactivated wild TGEV or (b) fully UV-inactivated wild or dm49-4 mutant TGEV Coronavirus. Nucleated cells from foetal liver, bone marrow, spleen and blood were isolated 10 or 20 h after injection and assayed ex vivo for IFNα secretion by ELISPOT and ELISA techniques. The administration of TGEV induced IFNα-secreting cells in foetal lymphohaematopoietic organs at mid-gestation. In contrast, IFNα was not detected in control sham-operated foetuses. A specific point mutation in the amino acid sequence of the viral membrane glycoprotein M of TGEV mutant dm49-4 was associated with lower or absent IFNα in utero inducibility by mutant virus as compared with wild virus. Row cytometry analysis did not show differences in leukocyte surface marker expression between control and TGEV- or between dm49-4 and wild virus-treated foetus cells, with the exception of a reduction in percentages of polymorphonuclear cells in TGEV-treated lymphohaematopoietic tissues, which is probably due to IFNα secretion. The present data provided in vivo evidence of IFNα secretion at the cell level in foetal lymphohaematopoietic organs. Such IFNα-secreting cells in lymphohaematopoietic tissues may be the source of IFNα detected during foetal infections.","Šplíchal, I.; Řeháková, Z.; Šinkora, M.; Šinkora, J.; Trebichavský, I.; Laude, H.; Charley, B.",Research in Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9300531/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0923249497808668; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923249497808668,241

This article contributes to a new application of social impact in social media (SISM) methodology. This study focuses on the social impact of the research to identify what type of health information is false and what type of information is evidence of the social impact shared in social media. The analysis of social media includes Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. This analysis contributes to identifying how interactions in these forms of social media depend on the type of information shared. The results indicate that messages focused on fake health information are mostly aggressive, those based on evidence of social impact are respectful and transformative, and finally, deliberation contexts promoted in social media overcome false information about health. These results contribute to advancing knowledge in overcoming fake health-related news shared in social media.","Pulido, Cristina M.; Ruiz-Eugenio, Laura; Redondo-Sama, Gisela; Villarejo-Carballido, Beatriz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32260048/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17072430,241

This study longitudinally compared changes in alcohol consumption before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and the impact of sociodemographic and mental health variables on such changes among a community sample of young adults. Data were collected in the context of a larger, ongoing longitudinal study. The sample consisted of 305 young adults from Spain aged between 18 and 26 years (mean age = 21.27, (SD = 2.21), female = 53.4%; college students = 61.6%) who completed first (November-2019 and February-2020; i.e., before the outbreak of COVID-19) and second follow-up questionnaires (March 2021, a year after the COVID-19 outbreak). Alcohol use (quantity and drinking frequency), depression and anxiety symptoms were measured. Quantity and frequency of alcohol use decreased from the pre- to post-COVID-19 period. A decrease in drinking frequency was observed among college students, but not in noncollege peers. Although we found no effect of pre-COVID-19 anxiety on alcohol use changes, those with more depressive symptoms at the pre-COVID assessment were more resistant to decreasing their drinking quantity and frequency after the COVID-19 outbreak. This information will be of value when designing interventions aimed at reducing harmful alcohol use and highlights the role of mental health status when identifying high risk populations of young-adults during this, and future, public health crises.","Vera, Belén del Valle; Carmona-Márquez, José; Lozano-Rojas, Óscar Martín; Parrado-González, Alberto; Vidal-Giné, Claudio; Pautassi, Ricardo Marcos; Fernández-Calderón, Fermín",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640485/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194468,241

We identify and discuss three potential use cases of HCTs in the current pandemic: evaluating efficacy, converging on correlates of protection, and improving understanding of pathogenesis and the human immune response. We outline the limitations of HCTs and find that HCTs are likely to be most useful for vaccine candidates currently in preclinical stages of development. We conclude that, while currently limited in their application, there are scenarios in which HCTs would be extremely beneficial. Therefore, the option of conducting HCTs to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development should be preserved. As HCTs require many months of preparation, we recommend an immediate effort to (1) establish guidelines for HCTs for COVID-19; (2) take the first steps toward HCTs, including preparing challenge virus and making preliminary logistical arrangements; and (3) commit to periodically re-evaluating the utility of HCTs.","Nguyen, Linh Chi; Bakerlee, Christopher W; McKelvey, T Greg; Rose, Sophie M; Norman, Alexander J; Joseph, Nicholas; Manheim, David; McLaren, Michael R; Jiang, Steven; Barnes, Conor F; Kinniment, Megan; Foster, Derek; Darton, Thomas C; Morrison, Josh",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32628748/,241

School-based alcohol and tobacco use prevention programmes that have demonstrated efficacy are most often based on psychosocial skill development, individuals’ experiential learning strategies, and community resources. Furthermore, early and prolonged interventions have been recommended. Primavera is a pluri-annual, generic, multimodal, experiential-oriented prevention program. It runs over a three-year period from the last year of primary school to the second year of secondary school. This randomized controlled cluster study aimed at assessing the effects of the Primavera programme compared to a control prevention intervention among schoolchildren from 10 to 12 years in eight secondary schools in a particular French geographical area. The primary outcomes were lifetime tobacco use and past-month alcohol use. Data were collected at baseline and over three follow-up time points. In all, 287 and 266 questionnaires, respectively, were collected at baseline from the Primavera group and from the control group. Attrition was 45% and 41%, respectively. The SARS-COV2 pandemic crisis made it impossible for questionnaires to be collected during the final year. After adjustment, children from the Primavera group were less likely to report current alcohol use at the end of the first year (odds ratio = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.18–0.78) and past-month alcohol use at the end of the second year (odds ratio = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01–0.66) compared to those from the control group. The results for psychosocial skills and alcohol and tobacco use denormalization were contrasted. Primavera is shown to be effective in reducing alcohol use among schoolchildren.","Diaz Gomez, Cristina; Morel, Alain; Sedano, Isabelle; Aubin, Henri-Jean",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33916906/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18083852,241

METHODS: Mathematical functions are employed to describe the number of cases and demises in each region and to predict their final numbers, as well as the dates of maximum daily occurrences and the local stabilization date. The model parameters are calibrated using a computational methodology for numerical optimization. Trend analyses are run, allowing to assess the effects of public policies. Easy to interpret metrics over the quality of the fitted curves are provided. Country-wise data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) concerning the daily number of cases and demises around the world are used, as well as detailed data from Johns Hopkins University and from the Brasil.io project describing individually the occurrences in United States counties and in Brazilian states and cities, respectively. U. S. and Brazil were chosen for a more detailed analysis because they are the current focus of the pandemic. RESULTS: Illustrative results for different countries, U. S. counties and Brazilian states and cities are presented and discussed. CONCLUSION: The main contributions of this work lie in (i) a straightforward model of the curves to represent the data, which allows automation of the process without requiring interventions from experts; (ii) an innovative approach for trend analysis, whose results provide important information to support authorities in their decision-making process; and (iii) the developed computational tool, which is freely available and allows the user to quickly update the COVID-19 analyses and forecasts for any country, United States county or Brazilian state or city present in the periodic reports from the authorities.","Paiva, Henrique Mohallem; Afonso, Rubens Junqueira Magalhães; Caldeira, Fabiana Mara Scarpelli de Lima Alvarenga; Velasquez, Ester de Andrade",Appl Soft Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723487/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156849462100212X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S156849462100212X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107289,241

Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the Google search volumes of selected keywords and COVID-19 case and deaths. In addition, repeated ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc tests were performed to compare the differences in search volumes of selected keywords before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Correlation analysis showed that the strongest variables in each category were vitamin C, zinc, Zoom, online shopping, hotel, market, gym, unemployment and unemployment benefit. Compared to previous years, during the pandemic, there was a significant increase or decrease in the search volumes of almost all words. These results showed that the COVID-19 significantly changed people's online interests regarding lifestyle behaviours and socio-economic conditions.

However, rates of COVID-19 among front-line home health and hospice clinicians are relatively unknown. METHODS: Visit data from a home health care and hospice agency in New Jersey early in the pandemic was analyzed to examine COVID-19 infection rates separately for clinicians exposed to COVID-19-contagious patients, and those without exposure to known COVID-19 contagious patients. RESULTS: Between March 5 and May 31, 2020, among home health clinicians providing in-person care, clinicians treating at least one COVID-19 contagious patient had a case rate of 0.8% compared to 15.7% for clinicians with no exposure to known COVID-19 contagious patients. Among hospice clinicians providing in-person care, those who treated at least one COVID-19 contagious patient had a case rate of 6.5%, compared to 12.9% for clinicians with no known exposure to COVID-19 contagious patients. Non-White clinicians had a higher COVID-19 case rate than White clinicians (10.9% vs 6.2%) DISCUSSION: Lower rates of COVID-19 infection among clinicians providing care to COVID-19-contagious patients may result from greater attentiveness to infection control protocols and greater precautions in clinicians’ personal lives. Greater exposure to COVID-19-contagious patients prior to patient diagnosis (“unknown exposures”) may explain differences in infection rates between home health and hospice clinicians with workplace exposures. CONCLUSION: Clinicians providing in-person care to COVID-19-contagious patients experience lower rates of COVID-19 infection than clinicians providing face-to-face care with no known exposure to COVID-19 contagious patients.

In this study, we explored the effects of possible food additives and use of worm frass as potential plant fertilizers. We found that small amounts of sucrose and bran increased PS consumption and that the worm frass alone could support dragon fruit cacti (Hylocereus undatus) growth, with superworm frass in particular, supporting better growth and rooting than mealworm frass and control media over a fortnight.

This study aims at doing that by applying qualitative and participatory-based system analysis and mapping to elicit the system’s emergent properties. METHODS: In two experts’ workshops, the system was sketched and refined. This system was represented through a causal loop diagram, where the identification of leverage points was done using network analysis. RESULTS: 45 determinants interplaying through 56 linkages, and three subsystems: urbanization-related transmission, infection-prone behaviour and healthcare efficiency, and Plasmodium resistance were identified. Apart from the number of breeding sites and malaria-positive cases, other determinants such as drug prescription and the awareness of householders were identified by the network analysis as leverage points and emergent properties of the system of transmission and persistence of malaria. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings, the ongoing efforts to control malaria, such as the use of insecticide-treated bed nets and larvicide applications should continue, and new ones focusing on the public awareness and malaria literacy of city dwellers should be included.

Most existing data come from single clinical sites seeing returning travelers, or relate to single events. METHODS: Investigators evaluated ill travelers returning from a mass gathering, and presenting to a GeoSentinel site between August 2015 and April 2019, and collected data on the nature of the event and the relation between final diagnoses and the mass gathering. RESULTS: Of 296 ill travelers, 51% were female and the median age was 54 years (range: 1–88). Over 82% returned from a religious mass gathering, most frequently Umrah or Hajj. Only 3% returned from the Olympics in Brazil or South Korea. Other mass gatherings included other sporting events, cultural or entertainment events, and conferences. Respiratory diseases accounted for almost 80% of all diagnoses, with vaccine preventable illnesses such as influenza and pneumonia accounting for 26% and 20% of all diagnoses respectively. This was followed by gastrointestinal illnesses, accounting for 4.5%. Sixty-three percent of travelers reported having a pre-travel encounter with a healthcare provider.

Tinoco",2001-07-27,"Subunit vaccines based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, are among the most promising strategies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The detailed characterization of the protein primary structure by mass spectrometry (MS) is mandatory, as described in ICHQ6B guidelines. In this work, several recombinant RBD proteins produced in five expression systems were characterized using a non-conventional protocol known as in-solution buffer-free digestion (BFD). In a single ESI-MS spectrum, BFD allowed very high sequence coverage (≥ 99 %) and the detection of highly hydrophilic regions, including very short and hydrophilic peptides (2-8 amino acids), the His6-tagged C-terminal peptide carrying several post-translational modifications at Cys538 such as cysteinylation, glutathionylation, cyanilation, among others. The analysis using the conventional digestion protocol allowed lower sequence coverage (80-90 %) and did not detect peptides carrying some of the above-mentioned post-translational modifications. The two C-terminal peptides of a dimer [RBD(319-541)-(His)6]2 linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond (Cys538-Cys538) with twelve histidine residues were only detected by BFD. This protocol allows the detection of the four disulfide bonds present in the native RBD and the low-abundance scrambling variants, free cysteine residues, O-glycoforms and incomplete processing of the N-terminal end, if present. Artifacts that might be generated by the in-solution BFD protocol were also characterized. BFD can be easily implemented and we foresee that it can be also helpful to the characterization of mutated RBD.","Espinosa, Luis Ariel; Ramos, Yassel; Andújar, Ivan; Torres, Enso Onill; Cabrera, Gleysin; Martín, Alejandro; González, Diamilé; Chinea, Glay; Becquet, Mónica; González, Isabel; Canaán-Haden, Camila; Nelson, Elías; Rojas, Gertrudis; Pérez-Massón, Beatriz; Pérez-Martínez, Dayana; Boggiano, Tamy; Palacio, Julio; Lozada-Chang, Sum Lai; Hernández, Lourdes; de la Luz Hernández, Kathya Rashida; Markku, Saloheimo; Marika, Vitikainen; Valdés-Balbín, Yury; Santana-Medero, Darielys; Rivera, Daniel G.; Vérez-Bencomo, Vicente; Emalfarb, Mark; Tchelet, Ronen; Guillén, Gerardo; Limonta, Miladys; Pimentel, Eulogio; Ayala, Marta; Besada, Vladimir; González, Luis Javier",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.10.443404,241

Alternative foods that do not require much or any sunlight have been proposed as a more cost-effective solution than increasing food stockpiles, given the long duration of many global catastrophic risks (GCRs) that could hamper conventional agriculture for 5 to 10 years. Microbial food from single cell protein (SCP) produced via hydrogen from both gasification and electrolysis is analyzed in this study as alternative food for the most severe food shock scenario: a sun-blocking catastrophe. Capital costs, resource requirements and ramp up rates are quantified to determine its viability. Potential bottlenecks to fast deployment of the technology are reviewed. The ramp up speed of food production for 24/7 construction of the facilities over 6 years is estimated to be lower than other alternatives (3-10% of the global protein requirements could be fulfilled at end of first year), but the nutritional quality of the microbial protein is higher than for most other alternative foods for catastrophes. Results suggest that investment in SCP ramp up should be limited to the production capacity that is needed to fulfill only the minimum recommended protein requirements of humanity during the catastrophe. Further research is needed into more uncertain concerns such as transferability of labor and equipment production. This could help reduce the negative impact of potential food-related GCRs.","Martínez, Juan B.

619508,Bovine coronavirus,1993-12-31,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the infection fatality rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from seroprevalence data. METHODS: I searched PubMed and preprint servers for COVID-19 seroprevalence studies with a sample size ≥ 500 as of 9 September 2020. I also retrieved additional results of national studies from preliminary press releases and reports. I assessed the studies for design features and seroprevalence estimates. I estimated the infection fatality rate for each study by dividing the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths by the number of people estimated to be infected in each region. I corrected for the number of immunoglobin (Ig) types tested (IgG, IgM, IgA). FINDINGS: I included 61 studies (74 estimates) and eight preliminary national estimates. Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.02% to 53.40%. Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 1.63%, corrected values from 0.00% to 1.54%. Across 51 locations, the median COVID-19 infection fatality rate was 0.27% (corrected 0.23%): the rate was 0.09% in locations with COVID-19 population mortality rates less than the global average (< 118 deaths/million), 0.20% in locations with 118–500 COVID-19 deaths/million people and 0.57% in locations with > 500 COVID-19 deaths/million people. In people younger than 70 years, infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 0.31% with crude and corrected medians of 0.05%. CONCLUSION: The infection fatality rate of COVID-19 can vary substantially across different locations and this may reflect differences in population age structure and case-mix of infected and deceased patients and other factors.

619745,The Molecular Biology of Coronaviruses,2006-07-28,"When surveying the current literature on COVID-19, the “cytokine storm” is considered to be pathogenetically involved in its severe outcomes such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and eventually multiple organ failure. In this review, the similar role of DAMPs is addressed, that is, of those molecules, which operate upstream of the inflammatory pathway by activating those cells, which ultimately release the cytokines. Given the still limited reports on their role in COVID-19, the emerging topic is extended to respiratory viral infections with focus on influenza. At first, a brief introduction is given on the function of various classes of activating DAMPs and counterbalancing suppressing DAMPs (SAMPs) in initiating controlled inflammation-promoting and inflammation-resolving defense responses upon infectious and sterile insults. It is stressed that the excessive emission of DAMPs upon severe injury uncovers their fateful property in triggering dysregulated life-threatening hyperinflammatory responses. Such a scenario may happen when the viral load is too high, for example, in the respiratory tract, “forcing” many virus-infected host cells to decide to commit “suicidal” regulated cell death (e.g., necroptosis, pyroptosis) associated with release of large amounts of DAMPs: an important topic of this review. Ironically, although the aim of this “suicidal” cell death is to save and restore organismal homeostasis, the intrinsic release of excessive amounts of DAMPs leads to those dysregulated hyperinflammatory responses—as typically involved in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in respiratory viral infections. Consequently, as briefly outlined in this review, these molecules can be considered valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to monitor and evaluate the course of the viral disorder, in particular, to grasp the eventual transition precociously from a controlled defense response as observed in mild/moderate cases to a dysregulated life-threatening hyperinflammatory response as seen, for example, in severe/fatal COVID-19. Moreover, the pathogenetic involvement of these molecules qualifies them as relevant future therapeutic targets to prevent severe/ fatal outcomes. Finally, a theory is presented proposing that the superimposition of coronavirus-induced DAMPs with non-virus-induced DAMPs from other origins such as air pollution or high age may contribute to severe and fatal courses of coronavirus pneumonia.","Land, Walter Gottlieb",Genes Immun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140652/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41435-021-00140-w,241

Our study aimed to investigate the social and mobility impact of confinement on the Algerian population using a cross-sectional survey launched after 3 days of the start of confinement to quickly assess the impacts during the period of March 23 to April 12, 2020. SUBJECT AND METHODS: We used an online questionnaire to obtain 678 responses from internet users, who were living in confinement in Algeria. According to the gender variable, our sample included 405 men (59.7%) and 273 women (40.3%). RESULTS: The statistical analysis performed showed that road interactions and mobility are only part of the social interactions, and that 95.1% of the respondents avoided family visits during these first 3 weeks of confinement. Of respondents, 85.5% spend a considerable amount of time chatting with family, 66.6% found the diet beneficial during this period, 57% participated in sports to preserve their health, 87.2% of respondents respected the travel ban, only 20.2% of those surveyed used a bicycle for travel, and 55.9% traveled on foot to go shopping.

METHODS: This observational study enrolled 20 patients with COVID-19, who were hospitalized between January 20–April 6, 2020, in the two COVID-19 designated hospitals of Zhoushan, Zhejiang and Rushan, Shandong, China, The laboratory findings, imaging, serum response to viral infection, and viral RNA level in the throat and stool samples were assessed from onset to recovery phase in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: SARS-COV-2 RNA was positive as early as day four. It remained positive until day 55 post-onset in the sputum-throat swabs and became negative in most cases (55%) within 14 days after onset. Lymphocytopenia occurred in 40% (8/20) of patients during the peak infection period and returned to normal at week five. The most severe inflammation in the lungs appeared in week 2 or 3 after onset, and this was completely absorbed between week 6 and 8 in 85.7% of patients. All patients had detectable antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD), and 95% of these patients had IgG to viral N proteins. The antibody titer peaked at week four. Anti-S IgM was positive in 7 of 20 patients after week three. CONCLUSIONS: All COVID-19 patients in this study were self-limiting and recovered well though it may take as long as 6–8 weeks. Our findings on the kinetic changes in imaging, serum response to viral infection and viral RNA level may help understand pathogenesis and define clinical course of COVID-19.

Yet there are multiple barriers to harnessing the power of data. The Learning Health System (LHS) has emerged as a model to overcome these barriers, yet there remains limited evidence of impact on delivery or outcomes of healthcare. OBJECTIVE: To gather evidence on the effects of LHS data hubs or aligned models that use data to deliver healthcare improvement and impact. Any reported impact on the process, delivery or outcomes of healthcare was captured. METHODS: Systematic review from CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Medline in-process and Web of Science PubMed databases, using learning health system, data hub, data-driven, ehealth, informatics, collaborations, partnerships, and translation terms. English-language, peer-reviewed literature published between January 2014 and Sept 2019 was captured, supplemented by a grey literature search.

624682,Photoinactivation of mycobacteria to combat infection diseases: current state and perspectives,2021-05-17,"Severe respiratory viral infections are associated with spread to the alveoli of the lungs. There are multiple murine models of severe respiratory viral infections that have been used to identify viral and host factors that contribute to disease severity. Primary cultures of murine alveolar epithelial cells provide a robust in vitro model to perform mechanistic studies that can be correlated with in vivo studies to identify cell type-specific factors that contribute to pathology within the alveoli of the lung during viral infection. In this study, we established an in vitro model to compare the responses of type I (ATI) and type II (ATII) alveolar epithelial cells to infection by respiratory viruses used in murine models: mouse-adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV, v2163), murine coronavirus MHV-1, and influenza A (H1N1) virus, strain PR8. Murine alveolar cells cultured to maintain an ATII cell phenotype, determined by expression of LBP180, were susceptible to infection by all three viruses. In contrast, ATII cells that were cultured to trans-differentiate into an ATI-like cell phenotype were susceptible to MHV-1 and PR8, but not mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. Epithelial cells produce cytokines in response to viral infections, thereby activating immune responses. Thus, virus-induced cytokine expression was quantified in ATI and ATII cells. Both cell types had increased expression of IL-1β mRNA upon viral infection, though at different levels. While MHV-1 and PR8 induced expression of a number of shared cytokines in ATI cells, there were several cytokines whose expression was induced uniquely by MHV-1 infection. In summary, ATI and ATII cells exhibited differential susceptibilities and cytokine responses to infection by respiratory viruses. This in vitro model will be critical for future studies to determine the roles of these specialized cell types in the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infection.","Kebaabetswe, Lemme P.; Haick, Anoria K.; Miura, Tanya A.",Virus Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23639425/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170213001251; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3683362?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170213001251; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2013.04.008,241

In the present study, the nonlinearity is determined between financial development and carbon dioxide emissions in the long-run and short-run periods. According to the finding, the continued financial development initially increases the carbon dioxide emissions in the short and long run. Simultaneously, the square term of financial development reduces carbon dioxide emissions and proves the inverted U-shaped hypothesis in the short and long periods. The consumption of fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide emissions, leading to environmental pollution. In contrast, renewable energy sources have fostered ecological sustainability by reducing CO(2) emissions in the long and short term. At the same time, a positive response from labor productivity to carbon dioxide emissions causes environmental pollution, while capital formation is not acknowledged as a significant contributor to CO(2) emissions. The Error Correction term has ascertained the reduction in error and convergence of the model from short to long term with a speed of 8% per annum. The study suggested that renewable energy and financial development should be indorsed for environmental preservation in developing European and Central Asian economies. Financial development in favor of low-cost renewables, advancing cleaner production methods, solar paneling, and electrification are a few possible remedies to achieve environmental sustainability in the short-run as well as long-run time frame.

However, safety data of tocilizumab in pregnant women and their newborn are scarce. We aimed to describe maternal and neonatal safety outcomes associated with tocilizumab treatment in pregnant women with severe COVID‐19. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of severe COVID‐19 pregnant women, treated with tocilizumab in two Spanish hospitals between 1 March and 31 April 2020. Demographics, medical history, clinical and radiologic findings, treatment information and laboratory data of mothers and their newborns were collected from electronic medical records. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 12 pregnant women were identified to have received tocilizumab during pregnancy in the two hospitals. Median gestational age at admission was 27.7 weeks (interquartile range, 18.0–36.4). Most of them received lopinavir/ritonavir, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, two patients received corticosteroids and one received interferon beta 1B. All 12 pregnancies resulted in live births. Somatometric values were normal for all newborns, and evolution at 14 and 28 days was favourable for all of them. Hepatotoxicity was observed in 2 patients, which improved or resolved at discharge. Cytomegalovirus reactivation was detected in another patient who had also received corticosteroids for 15 days, causing a congenital infection in her newborn. Both hepatotoxicity and viral reactivation adverse events were classified as possibly related to tocilizumab administration according to Naranjo's causality algorithm.

The limit of detection was 47.6 copies/reaction for wild-type H275 RNA and 52.9 copies/reaction for the mutant H275Y RNA. The assay did not cross-react with other respiratory pathogens. The clinical sensitivity and specificity of the assay was compared to the gold standard Sanger sequencing method using 25 sensitive, 15 resistant and 20 negative samples. The sensitivity and specificity was 88.0% and 100% respectively with the SOIV_Osel_SEN probe designed to detect the H275 allele and 100% for the SOIV_Osel_RES probe detecting the 275Y allele. The sensitivity of the assay using nine admixtures of sensitive and resistant alleles was 88.9% and 77.8% with the SOIV_Osel_SEN probe and SOIV_Osel_RES probe respectively.

However, this metric is often misused or misinterpreted. Moreover, the complexity of the process of estimating R(0) has caused difficulties for a substantial number of researchers. In this article, in order to increase the accessibility of this concept, we address several misconceptions related to the threshold characteristics of R(0) and the effective reproduction number (R(t)). Moreover, the appropriate interpretation of the metrics is discussed. R(0) should be considered as a population-averaged value that pools the contact structure according to a stochastic transmission process.

Furlough has been supported in the UK by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which represents a novel, but temporary, state‐led shift from the UK's market‐orientated restructuring regime. We argue that the withdrawal of state‐financed furlough may mean a quick return in UK firms to the management of redundancy. Yet, if the crisis is to generate any benefit it must create the conditions for a more collaborative HRM that delivers for workers as well as business, with job retention as a core priority.

Studies showed that the viral infection induces a vascular process in the lung, which included vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Further, the proportions of CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes were strongly reduced in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Estradiol is connected with CD4+ T cell numbers and increases T-reg cell populations, affecting immune responses to infection. It is known that estradiol exerts a protective effect on endothelial function, activating the generation of nitric oxide (NO) via endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Estrogen attenuates the vasoconstrictor response to various stimuli and induces vasodilation in the pulmonary vasculature during stress situations like hypoxia. It exerts a variety of rapid actions, which are initiated after its coupling with membrane receptors, which in turn, may positively modulate vascular responses in pulmonary disease and help to maintain microvascular flow. Direct and indirect mechanisms underlying the effects of estradiol were investigated, and the results point to a possible protective effect of estradiol against COVID-19, indicating that it may be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic element for the treatment of patients affected by the novel coronavirus.","Breithaupt-Faloppa, Ana Cristina; Correia, Cristiano de Jesus; Prado, Carla Máximo; Stilhano, Roberta Sessa; Ureshino, Rodrigo Portes; Moreira, Luiz Felipe Pinho",Clinics (Sao Paulo),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32490931/; https://doi.org/10.6061/clinics/2020/e1980,241
636222,Recombinant feline coronaviruses as vaccine candidates confer protection in SPF but not in conventional cats(),2014-03-14,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer survival rates in the UK are among the lowest in Europe, principally due to late-stage diagnosis. Alternative routes to earlier diagnosis of lung cancer are needed in socioeconomically deprived communities that are disproportionately affected by poor lung cancer outcomes. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a community-based pharmacy referral service to encourage earlier symptomatic referral for chest X-rays. METHODS: Seventeen community pharmacies located in a deprived area of Wales participated between March 2019 and March 2020. Stakeholder interviews were conducted with four patients, seven pharmacy professionals and one general practitioner. Four focus groups were conducted, including one with healthcare professionals (n=6) and three with members of the public who were current and former smokers (n=13). Quantitative data regarding patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were collected from hospital records and patient referral questionnaires completed by pharmacists and analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data sets were analysed thematically and triangulated. RESULTS: Twelve patients used the pharmacy referral service, all of whom were male. Average length of the pharmacy consultation was 13 min, with a mean 3 days to accessing chest X-rays in secondary care. Patients experienced a mean 46-day wait for results, with no lung cancer detected. Participants found the service to be acceptable and considered the pharmacy element to be broadly feasible. Perceived barriers included low awareness of the service and concerns about the role and capacity of pharmacists to deliver the service. Facilitators included perceived approachability and accessibility of pharmacists. A well-publicised, multifaceted awareness campaign was recommended. CONCLUSIONS: A community pharmacy referral service for lung symptoms was considered an acceptable alternative pathway to symptomatic diagnosis of lung cancer in deprived communities. Wider implementation of the service would require workforce capacity and training to be addressed to ensure optimum utilisation and promotion of the service.","Holland-Hart, Daniella; McCutchan, Grace M; Quinn-Scoggins, Harriet Dorothy; Brain, Kate; Hill, Lucy; Shanbag, Savita; Abel, Michael; White, Kelly; Evans, Angela; Rees, Sarah; Bowen, Sarah; Gemine, Rachel; Collier, Gareth",BMJ Open Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34376398/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2020-000772,241
636370,Pathogenicity of concurrent infection of pigs with porcine respiratory coronavirus and swine influenza virus,1992-11-30,"BACKGROUND: Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) is the second most important legume crop in the world after soybean. Consequently, yield losses due to fungal infection, like Uromyces appendiculatus (bean rust), have strong consequences. Several resistant genes were identified that confer resistance to bean rust infection. However, the downstream genes and mechanisms involved in bean resistance to infection are poorly characterized. RESULTS: A subtractive bean cDNA library composed of 10,581 unisequences was constructed and enriched in sequences regulated by either bean rust race 41, a virulent strain, or race 49, an avirulent strain on cultivar Early Gallatin carrying the resistance gene Ur-4. The construction of this library allowed the identification of 6,202 new bean ESTs, significantly adding to the available sequences for this plant. Regulation of selected bean genes in response to bean rust infection was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Plant gene expression was similar for both race 41 and 49 during the first 48 hours of the infection process but varied significantly at the later time points (72–96 hours after inoculation) mainly due to the presence of the Avr4 gene in the race 49 leading to a hypersensitive response in the bean plants. A biphasic pattern of gene expression was observed for several genes regulated in response to fungal infection. CONCLUSION: The enrichment of the public database with over 6,000 bean ESTs significantly adds to the genomic resources available for this important crop plant. The analysis of these genes in response to bean rust infection provides a foundation for further studies of the mechanism of fungal disease resistance. The expression pattern of 90 bean genes upon rust infection shares several features with other legumes infected by biotrophic fungi. This finding suggests that the P. vulgaris-U. appendiculatus pathosystem could serve as a model to explore legume-rust interaction.","Thibivilliers, Sandra; Joshi, Trupti; Campbell, Kimberly B; Scheffler, Brian; Xu, Dong; Cooper, Bret; Nguyen, Henry T; Stacey, Gary",BMC Plant Biol,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-9-46; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19397807/,241

We reviewed the medical records of cases in which RT-LAMP was performed. Standard ICSs and LAMP-based ICSs were implemented during the study period. The strategies were intended to impose longer periods of infection control precautions (ICPs) for specific patients, such as those with a history of exposure to COVID-19 patients and/or bilateral ground glass opacities (bGGO) on chest computed tomography (CT). Of 212 patients, which included 13 confirmed COVID-19 patients in the diagnostic cohort, exposure to COVID-19 patients (P <0.0001) and chest CT bGGO (P = 0.0022) were identified as significant predictors of COVID-19. In the 173 hospitalized patients in which the results of the first RT-LAMP were negative, the duration of ICPs was significantly longer in patients with exposure to COVID-19 and/or a high clinical index of suspicion and patients with bGGO than in the remaining patients (P = 0.00046 and P = 0.0067, respectively). Additionally, no confirmed COVID-19 cases indicating nosocomial spread occurred during the study period. Establishing a comprehensive system that combines rational LAMP-based ICSs with standard ICSs might be useful for preventing nosocomial spread.","Kimura, Muneyoshi; Baba, Masaru; Maruyama, Shunichiro; Ogura, Sho; Yamamuro, Ryosuke; Sakoh, Takashi; Kishida, Toshiyuki; Nagamine, Yumi; Endo, Yusuke; Okada, Chikako; Takahashi, Namiko; Araoka, Hideki",Jpn J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2020.808; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33390432/,241

This study was conducted to determine rates of COVID‐19–related PTSD in the Irish general population, the level of comorbidity with depression and anxiety, and the sociodemographic risk factors associated with COVID‐19–related PTSD. A nationally representative sample of adults from the general population of the Republic of Ireland (N = 1,041) completed self‐report measures of all study variables. The rate of COVID‐19–related PTSD was 17.7% (n = 184), 95% CI [15.35%, 19.99%], and there was a high level of comorbidity with generalized anxiety (49.5%) and depression (53.8%). Meeting the diagnostic requirement for COVID‐19–related PTSD was associated with younger age, male sex, living in a city, living with children, moderate and high perceived risk of COVID‐19 infection, and screening positive for anxiety or depression.

This research proposed an integrated model based on the theory of planned behavior and norm activation theory to explain compliance towards COVID-19 prevention guidelines. Data from a survey of 652 individuals were used to test the proposed integrated model. Results showed that three factors: personal norms, attitude towards compliance- behavior, and perceived behavior control, directly influence compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. Awareness of the risk of the COVID-19 pandemic and feelings of responsibility in the COVID-19 fight drives social and moral obligations, respectively, and also influences compliance behavior.

643332,Role of L-Arginine in Nitric Oxide Synthesis and Health in Humans.,2021,"BACKGROUND: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is variably performed before atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation to evaluate left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus. We describe our experience with transitioning to the pre-ablation cardiac computed tomography (CT) approach for the assessment of LAA thrombus during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We studied consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation at our center. The study cohort was divided into pre- versus post-COVID groups. The pre-COVID cohort included ablations performed during the 1 year before the COVID-19 pandemic; pre-ablation TEE was used routinely to evaluate LAA thrombus in high-risk patients. Post-COVID cohort included ablations performed during the 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic; pre-ablation CT was performed in all patients, with TEE performed only in patients with LAA thrombus by CT imaging. The demographics, clinical history, imaging, and ablation characteristics, and peri-procedural cerebrovascular events (CVEs) were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 637 patients (pre-COVID n = 424, post-COVID n = 213) were studied. The mean age was 65.6 ± 10.1 years in the total cohort, and the majority were men. There was a significant increase in pre-ablation CT imaging from pre- to post-COVID cohort (74.8% vs. 93.9%, p ≤ .01), with a significant reduction in TEEs (34.6% vs. 3.7%, p ≤ .01). One patient in the post-COVID cohort developed CVE following negative pre-ablation CT. However, the incidence of peri-procedural CVE between both cohorts remained statistically unchanged (0% vs. 0.4%, p = .33). CONCLUSION: Implementation of pre-ablation CT-only imaging strategy with selective use of TEE for LAA thrombus evaluation is not associated with increased CVE risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Akhtar, Tauseef; Wallace, Ryan; Daimee, Usama A; Hart, Erica; Arbab-Zadeh, Armin; Marine, Joseph E; Berger, Ronald; Calkins, Hugh; Spragg, David",J. cardiovasc. electrophysiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34453377/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jce.15227,241

The correct diagnosis of viral diseases represents a crucial step towards effective treatments and control. Biosensors have been successfully implemented as accessible and accurate detection tests for some of the most important viruses. While most biosensors are based on physical or chemical interactions of cell-free components, the complexity of living microorganisms holds a poorly explored potential for viral detection in the face of the advances of synthetic biology. Indeed, cell-based biosensors have been praised for their versatility and economic attractiveness, however, yeast platforms for viral disease diagnostics are still limited to indirect antibody recognition. Here we propose a novel strategy for viral detection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which combines the transductive properties of G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) with the Yeast Surface Display (YSD) of specific enzymes enrolled in the viral recognition process. The GPCR/YSD complex might allow for active virus detection through a modulated signal activated by a GPCR agonist, whose concentration correlates to the viral titer. Additionally, we explore this methodology in a case study for the detection of highly pathogenic coronaviruses that share the same cell receptor upon infection (i.e. the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2, ACE2), as a conceptual example of the potential of the GPCR/YSD strategy for the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Maneira, Carla; Bermejo, Pamela Magalí; Pereira, Gonçalo Amarante Guimarães; de Mello, Fellipe da Silveira Bezerra",FEMS Yeast Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/femsyr/foab004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469649/,241

We sought to describe pediatric hospital admissions associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Canada and identify risk factors for more severe disease. METHODS: We conducted a national prospective study using the infrastructure of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). Cases involving children who were admitted to hospital with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported from Apr. 8 to Dec. 31 2020, through weekly online questionnaires distributed to the CPSP network of more than 2800 pediatricians. We categorized hospital admissions as related to COVID-19, incidental, or for social or infection control reasons and determined risk factors for disease severity in hospital. RESULTS: Among 264 hospital admissions involving children with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the 9-month study period, 150 (56.8%) admissions were related to COVID-19 and 100 (37.9%) were incidental infections (admissions for other reasons and found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 on screening). Infants (37.3%) and adolescents (29.6%) represented most cases. Among hospital admissions related to COVID-19, 52 (34.7%) had critical disease, 42 (28.0%) of whom required any form of respiratory or hemodynamic support, and 59 (39.3%) had at least 1 underlying comorbidity. Children with obesity, chronic neurologic conditions or chronic lung disease other than asthma were more likely to have severe or critical COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Among children who were admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Canada during the early COVID-19 pandemic period, incidental SARS-CoV-2 infection was common.

METHODS: Data on sociodemographics, occupational situation, contact to COVID-19 patients, mental burden, stressors, resilience, risk and protective factors were assessed among a convenience sample of healthcare personnel in spring 2020 (5 April 2020–7 May 2020). A comparison with the general population in Germany before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. RESULTS: After the evaluation of 650 completed questionnaires, an increased mental burden was found compared to the German general population before the pandemic, while the mental burden was reduced compared to the general population during the pandemic. The self-reported resilience was slightly higher compared to the general population before and during the pandemic. The COVID-19-related stressors and worries were the most important risk factors, self-efficacy and optimism the most important protective factors. The mental burden was moderately correlated with the intention to change the profession and the tendency towards absenteeism.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) gene indicate the second highest odds-ratios for sporadic AD, exceeded only by APOE variants. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of BIN1 and the SNP rs744373 on COVID-19-relaetd survival using UKB-derived data. In addition, the interaction and alignment of BIN1 and SARS-Cov-2 were evaluated. For this purpose, the major (non-Alzheimer’s) BIN1 allele was designated as BIN and the SNP rs744373 minor (Alzheimer’s) allele as RS7. To evaluate the interaction and alignment of BIN1 and SARS-Cov-2, Protein Data Bank (pdb) entries were searched on the RCSB Protein Data Bank. The results revealed that the BIN RS7 heterozygote was associated with the lowest mortality rate (11.7%), followed by the BIN BIN homozygote (17.2%). The RS7 RS7 homozygote was associated with the highest mortality rate (28.1%). Logistic regression analysis was also performed using survival or mortality as the dependent variable, and sex, age, genotype, AD and coronary heart disease (CHD) as independent variables. The effects of sex, age and genotype were significant at the 95% level. The male sex and older-aged subjects were more likely to succumb to test-confirmed COVID-19 than females and younger subjects. The effects of AD and CHD were insignificant. Protein molecule alignment analyses suggested that the BIN allele may interfere with the replication of the SARs-Cov2 virus. The findings of the present study demonstrate that the risks for COVID-19 mortality are not simply related to an advanced chronological age or the comorbidities commonly observed in aged subjects, such as CHD and AD, but also with AD genes.","LEHRER, STEVEN; RHEINSTEIN, PETER H.",World Acad Sci J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33521641/; https://doi.org/10.3892/wasj.2021.84,241

Therefore, authentication of medicinal plants is of utmost importance. Morphological, anatomical, chemical and DNA markers solve the problem by differentiating the genuine material from the adulterants, substitutes and spurious drugs. DNA markers use nucleotide sequences to identify species; it takes preference over the other two markers being not age dependent, tissue specific and having a higher discriminating power. Therefore, characterization of plants with such markers is an ideal approach for identification of medicinal plant species and populations/varieties of the same species.

In addition, Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were employed to inspect the mild steel surface in the blank and inhibited medium. For the optimization tool, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model was developed to predict the inhibition efficiency. The experimental data was categorized into two different sections for training and testing the ANFIS model. The developed model aimed to evaluate the fitness between the experimental and predicted values. From the results generated, optimum value (IE%) of DM was recorded as 80%, 81% and 83% at concentration of 0.4 g/L for weight loss, EIS and PDP respectively. Potentiodynamic polarization results reveal that Dexamethasone functions as a mixed-type inhibitor, whereas studies of EIS show that the inhibition mechanism is by the transfer of charges. Mild steel surface examination confirmed the presence of a protective adsorbed film on the mild steel surface. Thermodynamic parameters obtained imply that Dexamethasone is adsorbed on the steel surface by a physiochemical process and obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Also the MD-simulation results evidenced that DM forms a metallic surface adsorbed film on the steel surface. From the ANFIS model, the sensitivity analysis shows that time and inhibitor concentration were the most important input variable while other input variables could not be neglected. ANFIS model coefficient of determination (R(2) 0.993) was found between the observed and predicted values. ANFIS model gave optimum prediction (80%) with high degree accuracy and robustness.

Through bioinformatics tools, we also used available sequences and 3D structure of MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein to predict MERS-CoV epitopes and assess antibody binding affinity. Phylogenetic analysis showed the eight new sequences have close relationships with existing strains detected in camels and humans in Arabian Gulf countries. The 2019-nCov strain appears to have higher homology to both bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV strains. The spike protein tree exhibited clustering of MERS-CoV sequences similar to the complete genome tree, except for one sequence from Qatar (KF961222). B cell epitope analysis determined that the MERS-CoV spike protein has 24 total discontinuous regions from which just six epitopes were selected with score values of >80%. Our results suggest that the virus circulates by way of camels crossing the borders of Arabian Gulf countries. This study contributes to finding more effective vaccines in order to provide long-term protection against MERS-CoV and identifying neutralizing antibodies.","Al-Shomrani, Badr M.; Manee, Manee M.; Alharbi, Sultan N.; Altammami, Mussad A.; Alshehri, Manal A.; Nassar, Majed S.; Bakhrebah, Muhammed A.; Al-Fageeh, Mohamed B.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12060611; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32503352/,241

COVID-19 significantly affects multiple systems including the cardiovascular system. Most importantly, in addition to the direct injury from the virus per se, the subsequent cytokine storm, an overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds, causes devastating damage. To date, emerging anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments are warranted to control epidemics. Several candidate drugs have been screened and are currently under investigation. These primarily include antiviral regimens and immunomodulatory regimens. However, beyond the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, these drugs may also have risks to the cardiovascular system, especially altering cardiac conduction.

Secondary data from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2007 were obtained from the Ghana National AIDS Control Programme and Biostatistics Department of the Health Ministry. Intervention time series analysis was applied separately to the data from the northern and southern sectors due to data collection mechanism and location of two tertiary teaching hospitals. The impact of GAC activities is measured by the statistical significance of the coefficients of the intervention variable. The intervention variable is coded as zero (0) for the period before and one (1), the period after the GAC activities commenced. It was shown that the HIV incidence in the northern follows an integrated moving average model, whilst in the southern sectors an autoregressive integrated moving average model was the appropriate model. No significant impact of GAC activities was observed in the northern sector. In contrast the GAC activities in the southern sector were associated with a reduction in new HIV infections (male=−0.20±0.13, p <0.05; female=0.14±0.10, p <0.05), corresponding to a 15% and 18% reduction in male and female new HIV infections respectively in the sector. It can therefore be concluded that the GAC activities were a success. However, greater focus of GAC efforts in the northern sector is required to ensure that its activities have an impact on the incidence there.","Aboagye-Sarfo, Patrick; Mueller, Ute; Cross, James",HIV & AIDS Review,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1730127015000314; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1730127015000314,241

We conduct a quasi-difference-in-differences (DID) analysis of the impacts of lockdown measures on air pollution during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Our study covers 367 cities from the beginning of the lockdown on 23 January 2020 until April 22, two weeks after the lockdown in the epicenter was lifted. Static and dynamic analysis of the average treatment effects on the treated is conducted for the air quality index (AQI) and six criteria pollutants. The results indicate that, first, on average, the AQI decreased by about 7%. However, it was still over the threshold set by the World Health Organization. Second, we detect heterogeneous changes in the level of different pollutants, which suggests heterogeneous impacts of the lockdown on human activities: carbon monoxide (CO) had the biggest drop, about 30%, and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) had the second-biggest drop, 20%. In contrast, ozone (O(3)) increased by 3.74% due to the changes in the NO(x)/VOCs caused by the decrease in NO(x), the decrease of O(3) titration, and particulate matter concentration. Third, air pollution levels rebounded immediately after the number of infections dropped, which indicates a swift recovery of human activities. This study provides insights into the implementation of environmental policies in China and other developing countries.","Zhang, Tuo; Tang, Maogang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33806039/,241

In recent years, microRNAs have also been associated with regulation across kingdoms, demonstrating that exogenous miRNAs can function in mammals in a fashion similar to mammalian miRNAs. The growing interest in microRNAs and the increasing amount of literature and molecular and biomedical data available make it difficult to identify records of interest and keep up to date with novel findings. For these reasons, we developed the microRNA Analysis Portal (MAP). MAP selects relevant miRNA-focused articles from PubMed, links biomedical and molecular data and applies bioinformatics modules. At the time of this writing, MAP represents the richest, most complete and integrated database focused on microRNAs. MAP also integrates an updated version of MirCompare (2.0), a computational platform used for selecting plant microRNAs on the basis of their ability to regulate mammalian genes. Both MAP and MirCompare functionalities were used to predict that microRNAs from Moringa oleifera have putative roles across kingdoms by regulating human genes coding for proteins of the immune system. Starting from a selection of 94 human microRNAs, MirCompare selected 6 Moringa oleifera functional homologs. The subsequent prediction of human targets and areas of functional enrichment highlighted the central involvement of these genes in regulating immune system processes, particularly the host-virus interaction processes in hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, papillomavirus and coronavirus. This case of use showed how MAP can help to perform complex queries without any computational background.

Since, they are characterized by a rapid evolution, worldwide surveillance of HBoVs’ genetics is necessary. This study explored the prevalence of HBoV genotypes in pediatric patients with respiratory tract infection in Croatia and studied their phylogeny. Using multiplex PCR for 15 respiratory viruses, we investigated 957 respiratory samples of children up to 18 years of age with respiratory tract infection obtained from May 2017 to March 2021 at two different hospitals in Croatia. Amplification of HBoV near-complete genome or three overlapping fragments was performed, sequenced, and their phylogenetic inferences constructed. HBoV was detected in 7.6% children with a median age of 1.36 years. Co-infection was observed in 82.2% samples. Sequencing was successfully performed on 29 HBoV positive samples, and all belonged to HBoV1. Croatian HBoV1 sequences are closely related to strains isolated worldwide, and no phylogenetic grouping based on mono- or co-infection cases or year of isolation was observed. Calculated rates of evolution for HBoV1 were 10(−4) and 10(−5) substitutions per site and year.

Intranasal vaccination is an attractive strategy to prevent COVID-19 as the nasal mucosa represents the first-line barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry before viral spread to the lung. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development is rapidly progressing, the current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. Here, we show that AdCOVID, an intranasal adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, elicits a strong and focused immune response against RBD through the induction of mucosal IgA, serum neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th1-like cytokine expression profile.

High level IgG, IgM and IgA reactivity to structural proteins S, M and N, as well as accessory proteins, of SARS-CoV-2 were observed that was specific to COVID-19 patients. Overlapping 100, 50 and 30 amino acid fragments of SARS-CoV-2 proteins identified antigenic regions. Numerous proteins of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the endemic human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 were also more reactive with IgG, IgM and IgA in COVID-19 patient sera than in unexposed control sera, providing further evidence of immunologic cross-reactivity between these viruses.

HCWs are chronically exposed to very intense stress, both and physically and mentally. Hospitals must reduce both the physical and mental burden of HCWs on the front lines and ensure their safety. No prospective study has focused on the physical health complaints among HCWs engaged in the care of critically ill COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to investigate the occupational risk among HCWs of experiencing physical symptoms during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A twice-weekly questionnaire targeting HCWs who care for COVID-19 patients was performed at Osaka City University Hospital from April 30 to May 31, 2020 using a shareable Research Electronic Data Capture tool. The demographic characteristics of the participants, frequency of exposure to at-risk care, and physical complaints were evaluated. Results: A total of 35 doctors, 88 nurses, and 35 technicians were engaged in the care of these critically ill COVID-19 patients. 76 HCWs participated in this study, of whom 24 (31.6%) were doctors, 43 (56.6%) were nurses, and 9 (11.8%) were technicians. The frequency of experiencing any physical symptom was 25.0% among HCWs. Exposure to at-risk care was significantly higher among nurses than among doctors (p < 0.001); likewise, the frequency of experiencing physical symptoms was higher among nurses than among doctors (p < 0.01). The multivariate analysis revealed that nurses (odds ratio 8.29; p = 0.01) might be independently at risk of experiencing physical symptoms.

Home-confinement and primary-care phone follow-up was the first-level regional policy for preventing EDs to collapse. But when X-rays were needed, the traditional outpatient workflow at the radiology department was inefficient and potential interpersonal infections were of concern. We aimed to assess the efficiency of a primary-care high-resolution radiology service (pcHRRS) for ppCOVID-19 in terms of time at hospital and decision’s reliability. METHODS: We assessed 849 consecutive ppCOVID-19 patients, 418 through the pcHRRS (home-confined ppCOVID-19 with negative—group 1- and positive—group 2-X-rays) and 431 arriving with respiratory symptoms to the ED by themselves (group 3). The pcHRRS provided X-rays and oximetry in an only-one-patient agenda. Radiologists made next-step decisions (group 1: pneumonia negative, home-confinement follow-up; group 2: pneumonia positive, ED assessment) according to X-ray results. We used ANOVA and Bonferroni correction, Student T, Chi(2) tests to analyse changes in the ED workload, time-to-decision differences between groups, potential delays in patients acceding through the ED, and pcHRRS performance for deciding admission. RESULTS: The pcHRRS halved ED respiratory patients (49.2%), allowed faster decisions (group 1 vs. home-discharged group 2 and group 3 patients: 0:41 ± 1:05 h; 3:36 ± 2:58 h; 3:50 ± 3:16 h; group 1 vs. all group 2 and group 3 patients: 0:41 ± 1:05 h; 5.25 ± 3.08; 5:36 ± 4:36 h; group 2 vs. group 3 admitted patients: 5:27 ± 3:08 h vs. 7:42 ± 5:02 h; all p < 0.001) and prompted admission (84/93, 90.3%) while maintaining time response for ED patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our pcHRRS may be a more efficient entry-door for ppCOVID-19 by decreasing ED patients and making expedited decisions while guaranteeing social distance.","García Santos, José M.; Plasencia Martínez, Juana M.; Fabuel Ortega, Pablo; Lozano Ros, Marina; Sánchez Ayala, María Carmen; Pérez Hernández, Gloria; Menchón Martínez, Pedro",Insights Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13244-020-00954-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398669/,241

The objective is to determine the extent of infection in the general population and the cumulative incidence by age group. METHODS: It was carried out with a longitudinal analytical study, in the population of the Lambayeque region, located in the north of Peru. The selection was carried out in multistages (districts, area, household, and finally choosing the interviewee within the house). Seroprevalence was estimated as a positive result of the rapid test whether it was positive IgM or positive IgG. An adjustment was made for the sampling weights used. RESULTS: The seroprevalence found in the region was 29.5%. Young people between 21 and 50 years old presented the highest seroprevalence frequencies. A total of 25.4% were asymptomatic. The most frequent complaint was dysgeusia and dysosmia (85.3% and 83.6%). Dysosmia (PR = 1.69), chest pain (PR = 1.49), back pain (PR = 1.45), cough (PR = 1.44), fever (PR = 1.41), general malaise (PR = 1.27) were associated factors with the higher the frequency of seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2. Reporting of complete isolation at home decreased the frequency of positivity (PR = 0.80), however, reporting having ARI contact (PR = 1.60), having contact with a confirmed case (PR = 1.51), and going to market (PR = 1.26) increased the frequency of positivity for SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: 518 participants from a University community in Brazil answered an online survey with questions related to demographic data, psychological responses, and preventive measures. Absolute and relative frequencies described the sample, Chi-square and z-test tested associations between the variables, adopting p<0.05.

Women, young age, and students had a significantly higher rate of negative feelings in all psychological questions. Curiously, negative feelings during social distances affect the participants, independent of living quarantine alone or with family/friends during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that the COVID-19 outbreak affected the psychological responses in the Brazilian academic community, also, women, young age, and students appear to be a risk group to negative psychological responses. The long-term quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic may cause further worsening in the psychological responses, especially in those in the risk group.","Paludo, A. C.; Silva, M. P.; Souza, J.

663247,Btk Inhibitors: A Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Delivery Perspective,2021-07-16,"Obesity is a preventable chronic condition that, in 2016, affected more than 1.9 billion people globally. Several factors have been identified that have a positive impact on long-term weight loss programs such as personalized recommendations, adherence strategies, weight and diet follow-up or physical activity tracking. Recently, various applications have been developed which help patients to self-manage their condition. These apps implement either one or some of these identified factors; however, there is not a single application that combines all of them following a holistic approach. In this context, we developed the OBINTER platform, which assists patients during the weight loss process by targeting user engagement during the longer term. The solution includes a mobile application which allows users to fill out dietetic questionnaires, receive dietetic and nutraceutical plans, track the evolution of their weight and adherence to the diet, as well as track their physical activity via a wearable device. Furthermore, an adherence strategy has been developed as a tool to foster the app usage during the whole weight loss process. In this paper, we present how the OBINTER approach gathers all of these features as well as the positive results of a usability testing study performed to assess the performance and usability of the OBINTER platform.","Álvarez, Roberto; Torres, Jordi; Artola, Garazi; Epelde, Gorka; Arranz, Sara; Marrugat, Gerard",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s20185060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899921/,241

A systematic search using PubMed/Medline and Scopus databases and preprint servers was performed. The articles were classified according to their type, subject and country of origin. Up to 31 March 2020, a total of 2062 papers published in 578 peer-reviewed journals and 1425 preprints posted mostly on medRxiv (55.4%), were identified. The mean number of published journal papers and preprints per day in the considered period was 27 and 12, respectively, and reached a maximum of 51 and 46 per day in March, respectively. The identified articles, journal papers and preprints, mostly covered the epidemiology of COVID-19 (35.7%), clinical aspects of infection (21.0%), preventative measures (12.8%), treatment options (12.5%), diagnostics (12.2%), mathematical modeling of disease transmission and mitigation (9.6%), and molecular biology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 (8.7%). The majority of the journal papers were commentaries (38.5%), reviews (33.6%) and original research (21.3%), while preprints predominantly presented original results (89.8%). Chinese scientists contributed the highest share of original research and were responsible for 32.9% journal papers and 43.9% preprints published in the considered period. A high number of contributions was also seen from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy. The benefits and potential risks of such a massive publication output are discussed. The scientific response seen during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 outbreak is a demonstration of the capabilities of modern science to react rapidly to emerging global health threats by providing and discussing the essential information for understanding the etiological factor, its spread, preventative measures, and mitigation strategies.","Nowakowska, Joanna; Sobocińska, Joanna; Lewicki, Mateusz; Lemańska, Żaneta; Rzymski, Piotr",Biomed Pharmacother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32603887/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110451; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220306442?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332220306442,241

Here, we aimed to determine the effect of COVID-19 severity on the memory B cell response and characterize changes in the memory B cell compartment between recovery and five months post-symptom onset. Using high-parameter spectral flow cytometry, we analyzed the phenotype of memory B cells with reactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) in recovered individuals who had been hospitalized with non-severe (n=8) or severe (n=5) COVID-19. One month after symptom onset, a substantial proportion of spike-specific IgG(+) B cells showed an activated phenotype. In individuals who experienced non-severe disease, spike-specific IgG(+) B cells showed increased expression of markers associated with durable B cell memory, including T-bet, FcRL5, and CD11c, which was not observed after severe disease. Five months post-symptom onset, the majority of spike-specific memory B cells had a resting phenotype and the percentage of spike-specific T-bet(+) IgG(+) memory B cells decreased to baseline levels. Collectively, our results suggest that the memory B cell response elicited during non-severe COVID-19 may be of higher quality than the response after severe disease.","Reyes, Raphael A.; Clarke, Kathleen; Gonzales, S.

To investigate transmission dynamics and then determine control methodology, we took epidemic in Wuhan as a study case. Unfortunately, to our best knowledge, the existing models are based on the common assumption that the total population follows a homogeneous spatial distribution, which is not the case for the prevalence occurred both in the community and in hospital due to the difference in the contact rate. To solve this problem, we propose a novel epidemic model called SEIR-HC, which is a model with two different social circles (i.e., individuals in hospital and community). Using the model alongside the exclusive optimization algorithm, the spread process of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city is reproduced and then the propagation characteristics and unknown data are estimated. The basic reproduction number of COVID-19 is estimated to be 7.9, which is far higher than that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Furthermore, the control measures implemented in Wuhan are assessed and the control methodology of COVID-19 is discussed to provide guidance for limiting the epidemic spread.","Zhu, Hongjun; Li, Yan; Jin, Xuelian; Huang, Jiangping; Liu, Xin; Qian, Ying; Tan, Jindong",Appl Math Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982019/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0307904X20304972; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X20304972?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2020.08.056,241

ABCD guidelines on prevention and management,2009-07-31,"Independent air dehumidification provides an attractive alternative to traditional coupled air dehumidification with reduced energy use, better humidity control and indoor air quality. According to this concept, latent load is treated by an independent system and the sensible load is treated by chilled-ceiling panels. In this work, four independent air dehumidification systems with energy recovery strategies are proposed. They are as follows: system 1, mechanical dehumidification with heat pump; system 2, mechanical dehumidification with sensible heat exchanger; system 3, mechanical dehumidification with membrane-based total heat exchanger; and system 4: a heat pump incorporating an active desiccant wheel and evaporative cooler. They are compared with a mechanical dehumidification system with no heat recovery. Hour-by-hour energy analysis is performed on the systems proposed. The results show that the system of mechanical dehumidification with membrane total heat recovery (system 3) consumes the least primary energy. However, since, the systems employ energy recovery measures, the energy savings for the four systems are in the same order, around 4.40×10(6) kJ per person.","Zhang, L.Z.",Energy (Oxf),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054420500143X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2005.05.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288041/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S036054420500143X,241

666813,Myxovirus- and coronavirus-induced in vitro stimulation of spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity by porcine blood leukocytes,1983-03-31,"ABSTRACT: Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) are seriously affecting human health all over the world. Nucleotide inhibitors have promising results in terms of its efficacy against different viral polymerases. In this study, detailed molecular docking and dynamics simulations are used to evaluate the binding affinity of a clinically approved drug, sofosbuvir, with the solved structure of the viral protein RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and compare it to the clinically approved drug, Remdesivir. These drugs are docked onto the three-dimensional structure of the nsp12 protein of SARS-CoV-2, which controls the polymerization process. Hence, it is considered one of the primary therapeutic targets for coronaviruses. Sofosbuvir is a drug that is currently used for HCV treatment; therefore, HCV RdRp is used as a positive control protein target. The protein dynamics are simulated for 100 ns, while the binding is tested during different dynamics states of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Additionally, the drug-protein complexes are further simulated for 20 ns to explore the binding mechanism. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as a target with the active form of sofosbuvir as a ligand demonstrates binding effectiveness. One of the FDA-approved antiviral drugs, such as sofosbuvir, can help us in this mission, aiming to limit the danger of COVID-19. Sofosbuvir was found to bind nsp12 with comparable binding energies to that of Remdesivir, which has been reported for its potential against COVID-19 RdRp and is currently approved by the FDA.

667683,Inhibition of nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking by RNA viruses: targeting the nuclear pore complex,2003-07-18,"For more than a year the whole world is suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic with no treatment option in sight. Administration of plasma from convalescent donors containing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, though promising according to case reports, failed to show a clear benefit in a greater number of trials. One reason could be varying and low antibody contents in a majority of plasma units hampering standardization and clinical efficacy. Besides, other plasma components unnecessarily transfused like coagulation factors might promote hypercoagulation seen in severe COVID-19 etiopathology. We therefore hypothesized that instead of collecting whole plasma units, convalescent donors could donate solely immunoglobulins by undergoing immunoadsorption, a mode of therapy regularly applied in autoimmune diseases. Here, we report the results of the first two antibody donations performed at the University Hospital Düsseldorf. In both cases, immunoadsorptions were very well tolerated with no side effects. Collected and neutralized eluates were concentrated using tangential flow filtration increasing the concentration of immunoglobulins 10fold as compared to peripheral blood and leading to probably eight times more neutralizing antibodies than in one plasma unit. Therefore, immunoadsorption can be used as a method of antibody donation. Whether these donated antibodies can be used as passive immunization in acutely infected patients remains to be elucidated.","Rothenburg, Jannik; Rink-Baron, Silke; Mueller, Lisa; Ostermann, Philipp Niklas; Fischer, Johannes; Stegbauer, Johannes; Moldenhauer, Anja",Transfus Apher Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34147358/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473050221001671; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transci.2021.103193; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473050221001671?v=s5,241

669410,Dexamethasone for Severe COVID-19: How Does It Work at Cellular and Molecular Levels?,2021-06-23,"Since the emergence of COVID-19, many publications have reported associations with ABO blood types. Despite between-study discrepancies, an overall consensus has emerged whereby blood group O appears associated with a lower risk of COVID-19, while non-O blood types appear detrimental. Two major hypotheses may explain these findings: First, natural anti-A and anti-B antibodies could be partially protective against SARS-CoV-2 virions carrying blood group antigens originating from non-O individuals. Second, O individuals are less prone to thrombosis and vascular dysfunction than non-O individuals and therefore could be at a lesser risk in case of severe lung dysfunction. Here, we review the literature on the topic in light of these hypotheses. We find that between-study variation may be explained by differences in study settings and that both mechanisms are likely at play. Moreover, as frequencies of ABO phenotypes are highly variable between populations or geographical areas, the ABO coefficient of variation, rather than the frequency of each individual phenotype is expected to determine impact of the ABO system on virus transmission. Accordingly, the ABO coefficient of variation correlates with COVID-19 prevalence. Overall, despite modest apparent risk differences between ABO subtypes, the ABO blood group system might play a major role in the COVID-19 pandemic when considered at the population level.","Pendu, Jacques Le; Breiman, Adrien; Rocher, Jézabel; Dion, Michel; Ruvoën-Clouet, Nathalie",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33499228/,241

A review of recent Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 medical reports, as well as described characteristics of HP, lead us to postulate a theory for SARS-CoV-2 severe disease. We propose that the novel SARS-CoV-2 can act as a trigger and substrate of an HP-like severe immune reaction especially in genetically vulnerable individuals in addition to those with immune senescence and dysregulation. Accordingly, the purpose of our letter is to shift the emphasis of concern surrounding immune activity from viral infection to an HP-like severe immune reaction. We review similarities in disease presentation between infection and allergy, relevant immunopathology, and outline phases of SARS-CoV-2 disease with perspectives on therapy and critical care. Altogether, the favored course is to begin treatments that address the disease at the earliest phase before immune dysregulation leading to uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation.","Sanchez-Gonzalez, Marcos A.; Moskowitz, Dave; Issuree, Priya D.; Yatzkan, George; Rizvi, Syed A.

The lower group showed a lower thymic output (sj/β-TREC ratio) and frequency of naïve T-cells, concomitant with increased mature T-cells. In these subjects, the CD4 T-cell subset was enriched in CD95+ but depleted of CD98+ cells. The regulatory T-cell (Treg) compartment was enriched in CTLA-4+ cells. The CD8 T-cell pool exhibited increased frequencies of CD95+ cells but decreased frequencies of integrin-β7+ cells.

Efficient publicity is key to successful epidemic prevention and control. This study explores the role of creative publicity by comparing the influence of creative publicity and general publicity in different periods of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The effects of creative and general publicity differed across varying periods of the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, compared to general publicity, creative publicity had a significant impact on individuals' emotional arousal in the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak while it significantly promoted individuals' emotional arousal, behavioral regulation, and willingness to actively disseminate information in the middle period. In the stable period of the COVID-19 outbreak, creative publicity performed better than general publicity in regulating individuals' behavior. On the other hand, general publicity was more effective than creative publicity in regulating individuals' behavior and actively disseminating information about the epidemic in the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak. In conclusion, creative and general publicity had differing effects in different periods of the COVID-19 outbreak, which may relate to the characteristics of the publicity format and people's psychological conditions in different periods of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Jia, Dandan; Sun, Cuicui; Zhou, Zhijin; Zhao, Qingbai; Yu, Quanlei; Liu, Guanxiong; Wang, Yi",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643133/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.600818,241

681232,Flow Cytometry: From Experimental Design to Its Application in the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Respiratory Diseases,2020-11-22,"Emerging studies from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients indicate a preponderant role of monocytes/macrophages in the pathogenesis of this viral infection, in a similar way to that previously observed in other coronavirus outbreaks (SARS and MERS). The clinical presentation of severe patients resembles viral-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, a rare condition previously seen during lethal influenza pandemics and during previous SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers an over-exuberant inflammatory response due to the development of a cytokine storm and the depletion of the adaptative immune compartment, which may prelude sepsis in many cases. The present review summarizes past evidence on the role of monocytes/macrophages in previous coronavirus outbreaks and the emerging knowledge on their role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Treatment strategies incorporating the blockade of migration and differentiation of monocyte-macrophage, such as granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor inhibitors, might enhance the promising results seen so far with selective cytokine blockade.","Gómez-Rial, Jose; Rivero-Calle, Irene; Salas, Antonio; Martinón-Torres, Federico",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32801787/; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s258639,241

Infection-related fears, inevitable loneliness, disturbed routine making way for adverse lifestyle habits, stressors such as financial crisis faced by their families, and many more further accentuate their vulnerability to mental health issues. AIM: The aim was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of medical undergraduate students about the COVID-19 outbreak, and to assess their stress, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QOL). The study also explored the correlation between the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of the medical undergraduate students about the pandemic and their mental health issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online questionnaire-based survey was carried out on medical undergraduate students. The survey tool comprised a semi-structured proforma; General Health Questionnaire-12 items; Depression, Anxiety, and Stress scale-21 items; and European Health Interview Survey-Quality of Life-8 items. RESULTS: Nearly 61.8% of the students seemed well read and had good knowledge about the medical aspects of the pressing issue of COVID-19, and majority of the students had adaptive attitudes and behaviors toward the pandemic. Almost 23.2% of the students had depression, 20.7% had anxiety, and 13.0% had stress ranging from mild to extremely severe. Nearly 75.1% of the students experienced changes in appetite and 53.6% had changes in appetite. Nearly half of the students expressed excessive worries regarding studies. The mean score of QOL of students was 3.9 ± 0.6. Students with adaptive attitudes and behavior experienced relatively less severe depression, anxiety, and stress compared to their counterparts. CONCLUSION: A significant portion of the medical undergraduates are experiencing mental health issues and study related concerns due to the adversity brought by the pandemic. The concerned educational bodies and institutes must take up necessary steps to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic on students.","Shailaja, B; Singh, Hemendra; Chaudhury, Suprakash; Thyloth, Murali",Ind Psychiatry J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776276/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ipj.ipj_117_20,241

684445,High prevalence of non-productive FeLV infection in necropsied cats and significant association with pathological findings,2010-03-25,"BACKGROUND: In Italy, in recent years, vaccination coverage for key immunizations as MMR has been declining to worryingly low levels, with large measles outbreaks. As a response in 2017, the Italian government expanded the number of mandatory immunizations introducing penalties to unvaccinated children’s families. During the 2018 general elections campaign, immunization policy entered the political debate with the government in-charge blaming oppositions for fuelling vaccine scepticism. A new government (formerly in the opposition) established in 2018 temporarily relaxed penalties and announced the introduction of forms of flexibility. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: First, we supplied a definition of disorientation, as the “lack of well-established and resilient opinions among individuals, therefore causing them to change their positions as a consequence of sufficient external perturbations”. Second, procedures for testing for the presence of both short and longer-term collective disorientation in Twitter signals were proposed. Third, a sentiment analysis on tweets posted in Italian during 2018 on immunization topics, and related polarity evaluations, were used to investigate whether the contrasting announcements at the highest political level might have originated disorientation amongst the Italian public. RESULTS: Vaccine-relevant tweeters’ interactions peaked in response to main political events. Out of retained tweets, 70.0% resulted favourable to vaccination, 16.4% unfavourable, and 13.6% undecided, respectively. The smoothed time series of polarity proportions exhibit frequent large changes in the favourable proportion, superimposed to a clear up-and-down trend synchronized with the switch between governments in Spring 2018, suggesting evidence of disorientation among the public. CONCLUSIONS: The reported evidence of disorientation for opinions expressed in online social media shows that critical health topics, such as vaccination, should never be used to achieve political consensus. This is worsened by the lack of a strong Italian institutional presence on Twitter, calling for efforts to contrast misinformation and the ensuing spread of hesitancy. It remains to be seen how this disorientation will impact future parents’ vaccination decisions.","Ajovalasit, Samantha; Dorgali, Veronica Maria; Mazza, Angelo; d’Onofrio, Alberto; Manfredi, Piero",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242253/,241
686044,Detection of virus particles resembling circovirus and porcine circovirus 2a (PCV2a) sequences in feces of dogs,2017-01-21,"Abstract Protein sequence alignments have become an important tool for molecular biologists. Local alignments are frequently constructed with the aid of a “substitution score matrix” that specifies a score for aligning each pair of amino acid residues. Over the years, many different substitution matrices have been proposed, based on a wide variety of rationales. Statistical results, however, demonstrate that any such matrix is implicitly a “log-odds” matrix, with a specific target distribution for aligned pairs of amino acid residues. In the light of information theory, it is possible to express the scores of a substitution matrix in bits and to see that different matrices are better adapted to different purposes. The most widely used matrix for protein sequence comparison has been the PAM-250 matrix. It is argued that for database searches the PAM-120 matrix generally is more appropriate, while for comparing two specific proteins with suspected homology the PAM-200 matrix is indicated. Examples discussed include the lipocalins, human α 1B-glycoprotein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the globins.","Altschul, Stephen F.",Journal of Molecular Biology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/002228369190193A; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2051488/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002228369190193A,241

Objectives: To investigate the characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and assess factors associated with poor outcomes. Design: Patient-level retrospective cohort study Setting: University of California five academic hospitals. Participants: Patients [≥]18 years old with a confirmed test result for SAR-CoV-2 virus hospitalized at five UC hospitals. Exposure: Confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive results on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample among patients requiring hospital admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Admission to the intensive care unit, death during hospitalization, and the composite of both outcomes. Results: Outcomes were assessed for 4,730 patients who were discharged or died during a hospitalization. A total of 846 patients were treated at UC Davis, 1,564 UC Irvine, 1,283 UC Los Angeles, 471 UC San Diego, and 566 UC San Francisco. More than 20% of patients were [≥]75 years of age (75-84: 12.3%, [≥]85: 10.5%), male (56.5%), Hispanic/Latino (45.7%), and Asian (10.3%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (35.2%), cardiac disease (33.3%), and diabetes (24.0%). The ICU admission rate was 25.2% (1194/4730), with 7.0% (329/4730) in-hospital mortality. Among patients admitted to the ICU, 18.8% (225/1194) died; 2.9% (104/3536) died without ICU admission. The rate of the composite outcome (ICU admission and/or death) was 27.4% (1,298/4,730). While controlling for comorbidities, patients of age 75-84 (OR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.11-1.93) and 85-59 (OR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.04-1.87) were more likely to experience a composite outcome than 18-34 year-olds. Males (OR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.21-1.59), and patients identifying as Hispanic/Latino (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.14-1.61), and Asian (OR 1.43, 95% CI: 1.23-1.82), were also more likely to experience a composite outcome than White. Patients with 5 or more comorbidities were exceedingly likely to experience a composite outcome (OR 2.74, 95% CI: 2.32-3.25). Conclusions: Males, older patients, those with pre-existing comorbidities, and those identifying as Hispanic/Latino or Asian experienced an increased risk of ICU admission and/or death.","Nuno, M.; Garcia, Y.; Rajasekar, G.; Pinheiro, D.; Schmidt, A.

688889,Antiviral activities of whey proteins,2015-07-22,"Yoga-based interventions have been implemented in schools and demonstrated promising results on students’ self-regulation outcomes. Nevertheless, there is limited literature on the effects that yoga may have for children in the early primary grades, despite the evidence demonstrating that this is an opportune period in development for early self-regulation. Few studies have focused on young children living in the context of economic difficulty, which can hinder children’s development of self-regulatory skills and educational trajectories. The effects of an eight-week yoga intervention on economically disadvantaged pre-kindergarten and kindergarten children’s self-regulation and emotion regulation were examined via a paired within-subjects comparison study. Nine classrooms were assigned to the yoga intervention (Treatment First, TxFirst; n = 90) or a wait-list control group (Treatment Second, TxSecond; n = 64). All children were assessed at pre-intervention (Time 1), post-intervention assessment for TxFirst (Time 2), and post-intervention assessment for TxSecond (Time 3). Children demonstrated significant predicted gains on a behavioral task of self-regulation and declines in teacher-rated submissive venting and total behavior problems. Implications for future research are discussed, with a focus on including follow-up assessments and multiple dimensions of fidelity of implementation.","Rashedi, Roxanne N.; Rowe, Susan E.; Thompson, Ross A.; Solari, Emily J.; Schonert-Reichl, Kimberly A.",J Child Fam Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127901/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-021-01992-6,241
