This study aims to systematically identify and examine choice-based experiments assessing (differences in) vaccine preferences of vaccinees, representatives and health advisors. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched on choice-based conjoint analysis studies or discrete choice experiments capturing vaccine preferences of children, adolescents, parents, adults and healthcare professionals for attributes of vaccines or vaccine settings up to September 2020. Data was extracted using a standardized form covering all important aspects of choice experiments. A quality assessment was used to assess the validity of studies. Attributes were categorized into outcome, process, cost and other. The importance of attributes was assessed by the frequency of reporting and statistical significance. Results were compared between high-quality studies and lower-quality studies. RESULTS: A total of 42 studies were included, with the majority conducted in high-income countries after 2010 (resp. n = 34 and n = 37). Preferences of representatives were studied in nearly half of the studies (47.6%), followed by vaccinees (35.7%) and health advisors (9.5%). Sixteen high-quality studies passed the quality assessment. Outcome- and cost- related attributes such as vaccine effectiveness, vaccine risk, cost and protection duration were most often statistically significant across both target groups, with vaccine effectiveness being the most important. Risks associated with vaccination, such as side effects, were more often statistically significant in studies targeting vaccinees, while cost-related attributes were more often statistically significant in studies of representatives. Process-related attributes such as vaccine accessibility and time were least important across both target groups. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review in which vaccine preferences of different target groups were assessed and compared. The same attributes were most important for vaccine decisions of vaccinees and representatives, with only minor differences in level of evidence for vaccine risk and cost. Future research on vaccine preferences of health advisors and/or among target groups in low-resource settings would give insight into the generalizability of current findings.

There is no licensed vaccine for the disease and the most promising current candidates are modified live viruses that have been attenuated by deletion of virulence factors. Like many viruses African swine fever virus significantly alters the host cell machinery to benefit its replication and viral genes that modify host pathways represent promising targets for development of gene deleted vaccines. Autophagy is an important cellular pathway that is involved in cellular homeostasis, innate and adaptive immunity and therefore is manipulated by a number of different viruses. Autophagy is regulated by a complex protein cascade and here we show that African swine fever virus can block formation of autophagosomes, a critical functional step of the autophagy pathway through at least two different mechanisms. Interestingly this does not require the A179L gene that has been shown to interact with Beclin-1, an important autophagy regulator.","Shimmon, Gareth L.; Hui, Joshua Y.

The advantages of the use of allograft include reduced donor-site morbidity, shorter operative time, smaller incisions, and no size restrictions. The disadvantages include increased cost, slower graft embodiment, and the risk of viral or bacterial infection, which may occur either by transmission from an infected donor or by contamination by the healthcare provider. Careful donor selection, aseptic graft procurement and processing, and tissue sterilization, by irradiation or proprietary chemical processing, are the three major steps of the graft preparation procedure. Successful allograft implantation depends on sterility, reduction of antigenicity, and preservation of the biomechanical properties of the graft. To date, reports on the clinical and functional outcomes of allograft compared to autograft ACL reconstruction are controversial. Overall, graft choice depends on surgeon and patient preference, since no graft can perfectly match the properties of the native ACL.","Iosifidis, Michael I.; Tsarouhas, Alexandros",Sports Injuries,704,30

Simultaneously, Government-directed initiatives aim to increase public participation in recreational winter sport. These parallel developments allow research to advance knowledge and understanding of the physiological determinants of performance and health related to winter sport. Winter sport athletes often conduct a substantial amount of training with high volumes of low-to-moderate exercise intensity and lower volumes of high-intensity work. Moreover, much of the training occur at low ambient temperatures and winter sport athletes have high risk of developing asthma or asthma-related conditions, such as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. The high training volumes require optimal nutrition with increased energy and dietary protein requirement to stimulate muscle protein synthesis response in the post-exercise period. Whether higher protein intake is required in the cold should be investigated. Cross-country skiing is performed mostly in Northern hemisphere with a strong cultural heritage and sporting tradition. It is expected that innovative initiatives on recruitment and training during the next few years will target to enhance performance of Chinese athletes in classical endurance-based winter sport. The innovation potential coupled with resourcing and population may be substantial with the potential for China to become a significant winter sport nation. This paper discusses the physiological aspects of endurance training and performance in winter sport highlighting areas where innovation may advance in athletic performance in cold environments. In addition, to ensure sustainable development of snow sport, a quality ski patrol and rescue system is recommended for the safety of increasing mass participation.","Wang, Jun; Guan, Hongwei; Hostrup, Morten; Rowlands, David S.; González-Alonso, José; Jensen, Jørgen",J,704,30

The result should be a balanced and symmetric lip with scars that are hidden or are placed in natural anatomical lines. Several methods have been described to repair the lip. The most popular repairs at present are the rotation-advancement or its modifications and the various versions of the straight-line repair. METHODS In the author's unit, a method has evolved entitled the symmetric philtral column repair. In this method, the author attempts to achieve a philtral column that mirrors the philtral column on the normal side, producing a balanced appearing lip. This method has been used for the past 14 years in over 500 patients. RESULTS The results have been satisfying, with a lip revision rate of 6 percent. CONCLUSIONS The symmetric philtral column repair of a unilateral cleft lip is an effective and safe repair. The repair is easy to understand and produces results that minimize the stigmata of a cleft lip deformity.","Madaree, Anil",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,704,1

Hakai acts through its phosphotyrosine-binding (HYB) domain, which bears a dimeric fold that recognizes the phosphotyrosine motifs of E-cadherin, cortactin, DOK1, and other Src substrates. Unlike the monomeric nature of the SH2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains, the architecture of the HYB domain consists of an atypical, zinc-coordinated tight homodimer. Here, we report a C-terminal truncation mutant of the HYB domain (HYB(ΔC)), comprising amino acids 106-194, which exists as a monomer in solution. The NMR structure revealed that this deletion mutant undergoes a dramatic structural change caused by a rearrangement of the atypical zinc-coordinated unit in the C terminus of the HYB domain to a C2H2-like zinc finger in HYB(ΔC). Moreover, using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that dimerization of HYB(ΔC) can be induced using a phosphotyrosine substrate peptide. This ligand-induced dimerization of HYB(ΔC) is further validated using analytical ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion chromatography, NMR relaxation studies, dynamic light scattering, and circular dichroism experiments. Overall, these observations suggest that the dimeric architecture of the HYB domain is essential for the phosphotyrosine-binding property of Hakai.","Mukherjee, Manjeet; Jing-Song, Fan; Ramachandran, Sarath; Guy, Graeme R; Sivaraman, J",The Journal of biological chemistry,704,1

Solid phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM) allowed quantification of NA1 virions and identification of faecal samples with optimal virus levels. NA1 particles were 36.6 nm in diameter, had an indefinite surface structure resembling that of human small round structured viruses (SRSVs), and a buoyant density of 1.34 g ml(-1). A single capsid protein of 49.4 kDa was detected by Western blotting in purified NA1 preparations prepared from post-infection but not pre-infection faecal samples and with post- but not pre-infection sera. NA1 was antigenically unrelated to the bovine enteric calicivirus NA2 by SPIEM. These properties were consistent with classification of NA1 within the Caliciviridae but demonstrated heterogeneity in the capsid composition of bovine enteric caliciviruses.","Dastjerdi, A M; Snodgrass, D R; Bridger, J C",FEMS microbiology letters,704,22
