2155,Human temperatures for syndromic surveillance in the emergency department: data from the autumn wave of the 2009 swine flu (H1N1) pandemic and a seasonal influenza outbreak,2016-03-09,"BACKGROUND: The emergency department (ED) increasingly acts as a gateway to the evaluation and treatment of acute illnesses. Consequently, it has also become a key testing ground for systems that monitor and identify outbreaks of disease. Here, we describe a new technology that automatically collects body temperatures during triage. The technology was tested in an ED as an approach to monitoring diseases that cause fever, such as seasonal flu and some pandemics. METHODS: Temporal artery thermometers that log temperature measurements were placed in a Boston ED and used for initial triage vital signs. Time-stamped measurements were collected from the thermometers to investigate the performance a real-time system would offer. The data were summarized in terms of rates of fever (temperatures ≥100.4 °F [≥38.0 °C]) and were qualitatively compared with regional disease surveillance programs in Massachusetts. RESULTS: From September 2009 through August 2011, 71,865 body temperatures were collected and included in our analysis, 2073 (2.6 %) of which were fevers. The period of study included the autumn–winter wave of the 2009–2010 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic, during which the weekly incidence of fever reached a maximum of 5.6 %, as well as the 2010–2011 seasonal flu outbreak, during which the maximum weekly incidence of fever was 6.6 %. The periods of peak fever rates corresponded with the periods of regionally elevated flu activity. CONCLUSIONS: Temperature measurements were monitored at triage in the ED over a period of 2 years. The resulting data showed promise as a potential surveillance tool for febrile disease that could complement current disease surveillance systems. Because temperature can easily be measured by non-experts, it might also be suitable for monitoring febrile disease activity in schools, workplaces, and transportation hubs, where many traditional syndromic indicators are impractical. However, the system’s validity and generalizability should be evaluated in additional years and settings.

3855,Iranian Emergency Medical Service Response in Disaster; Report of three Earthquakes,2019-01-14,"INTRODUCTION: The earthquake is one of the most natural catastrophic crises that can cause a lot of casualties. Considering an earthquake-prone country, Iran is ranked as one of the world's most dangerous countries OBJECTIVE: In this article, we describe the actions taken by emergency medical service (EMS) after the earthquake in Kermanshah, Varzaghan, and Bam and compared the strengths and weaknesses of the emergency response program and the limitations and challenges of this system in dealing with these major crises. METHOD: This study is a cross-sectional study that compares some of the information and findings related to three earthquakes that occurred in Iran, including Bam, Varzaghan and Sarpol-e-Zahab earthquakes. The data reported in the present article is descriptive and is based on various independent sources such as National Emergency Operation Center, Local Emergency Operations Center (EOC), the EMS of the country, the World Health Organization, the United Nations, the statistics website, the Forensic Data website, the International Institute of Seismology and Earthquake Engineering, conferences and personal interviews. To ensure the credibility of the information, the authors reported data that had been verified by two or more sources. RESULTS: The characteristics of the geographic area of the 3 earthquakes has been described. Post-earthquake response activities were described in details in subheadings including rapid warning and response, surge capacity plan, rapid response teams, emergency medical teams, increasing the capacity of health facilities, increasing transfer capacity, and handling, transportation and distribution of injuries. CONCLUSION: In the recent earthquake, had been occurred in Sarpol-e-Zahab, the health response of the country was largely satisfactory. The existence of structures such as EOC at various levels, the unified incident command system, emergency operations plan, and Medical Care Monitoring Center are among the most important reasons for satisfactory performance.","Saberian, Peyman; Kolivand, Pir-Hossein; Hasani-Sharamin, Parisa; Dadashi, Fatemeh; Farhoud, Amir Reza",Adv J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6548112/,339
8297,What Has SARS Taught Us About Infection Control in Nursing Homes?,2005-02-23,"A sensitive and convenient immunoassay that can directly differentiate pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1) virus from seasonal influenza virus can play an important role in the clinic. In the presented study, a double-sandwich ELISA (pH1N1 ELISA), based on two monoclonal antibodies against haemagglutinin (HA) of the pH1N1 virus, was developed. After laboratory determination of the sensitivity and specificity characteristics, the performance of this assay was evaluated in a cohort of 904 patients with influenza-like illness. All seven strains of pH1N1 virus tested were positive by pH1N1 ELISA, with an average lower detection limit of 10(3.0 ± 0.4) tissue culture infective dose (TCID)(50)/mL (or 0.009 ± 0.005 HA titre). Cross-reaction of the assay with seasonal influenza virus and other common respiratory pathogens was rare. In pH1N1-infected patients, the sensitivity of the pH1N1 ELISA was 92.3% (84/91, 95% CI 84.8–96.9%), which is significantly higher than that of the BD Directigen EZ Flu A + B test (70.3%, p <0.01). The specificity of pH1N1 ELISA in seasonal influenza A patients was 100.0% (171/171, 95% CI 97.9–100.0%), similar to that in non-influenza A patients (640/642, 99.7%, 95% CI 98.9–100.0%). The positive predictive value for pH1N1 ELISA was 97.7% and the negative predictive value was 99.1% in this study population with a pH1N1 prevalence of 10.1%. In conclusion, detection of HA of pH1N1 virus by immunoassay appears to be a convenient and reliable method for the differential diagnosis of pH1N1 from other respiratory pathogens, including seasonal influenza virus.","Yuan, Q.; Cheng, X.-D.; Yang, B.-C.; Zheng, Q.-B.; Chen, Y.-X.; Chen, Q.-R.; Zeng, F.; Zhang, R.; Ge, S.-X.; Hao, X.-K.; Chen, H.; Zhang, J.; Xia, N.-S.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129098/,339
10723,Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications for COVID-19 pandemic,2020-04-14,"BACKGROUND: RESP score and PRESERVE score have been validated for veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in severe ARDS to assume individual mortality risk. ARDS patients with low-flow Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal, especially pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist, have also a high mortality rate, but there are no validated specific or general outcome scores. This retrospective study tested whether these established specific risk scores can be validated for pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist in ARDS patients in comparison to a general organ dysfunction score, the SOFA score. METHODS: In a retrospective single center cohort study we calculated and evaluated RESP, PRESERVE, and SOFA score for 73 ARDS patients with pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist treated between 2002 and 2016 using the XENIOS iLA Membrane Ventilator. Six patients had a mild, 40 a moderate and 27 a severe ARDS according to the Berlin criteria. Demographic data and hospital mortality as well as ventilator settings, hemodynamic parameters, and blood gas measurement before and during extracorporeal therapy were recorded. RESULTS: Pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist of mechanical ventilated ARDS patients resulted in an optimized lung protective ventilation, significant reduction of P(aCO2), and compensation of acidosis. Scoring showed a mean score of alive versus deceased patients of 3 ± 1 versus − 1 ± 1 for RESP (p < 0.01), 3 ± 0 versus 6 ± 0 for PRESERVE (p < 0.05) and 8 ± 1 versus 10 ± 1 for SOFA (p < 0.05). Using receiver operating characteristic curves, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67–0.89, p < 0.01) for RESP score, 0.80 (95% CI 0.70–0.90, p < 0.0001) for PRESERVE score and 0.66 (95% CI 0.53–0.79, p < 0.05) for SOFA score. CONCLUSIONS: RESP and PRESERVE scores were superior to SOFA, as non-specific critical care score. Although scores were developed for veno-venous ECMO, we could validate RESP and PRESERVE score for pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist. In conclusion, RESP and PRESERVE score are suitable to estimate mortality risk of ARDS patients with an arterio-venous pumpless Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal.","Petran, Jan; Muelly, Thorsten; Dembinski, Rolf; Steuer, Niklas; Arens, Jutta; Marx, Gernot; Kopp, Ruedger",BMC Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7195797/,339

The resistance to aging is a key factor for outdoor and medical applications (UV light sterilization). Nonwovens were placed in special chamber with UV light. Changes of physicochemical properties were recorded using differential scanning calorimetry and attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The fibers’ morphology was studied by using scanning electron microscopy. Obtained results clearly showed that only PLA fibers with ZnO particles gained an increase in UV resistance. The paper presents a description of structural changes taking place under the influence of UV aging processes and describes the mechanisms of this process and the effect of ceramic addition on the lifetime of such materials.","Kosowska, Karolina; Szatkowski, Piotr",J Therm Anal Calorim,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223675/,339
12108,Conference Didactic Planning and Structure: An Evidence-based Guide to Best Practices from the Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors,2020-07-03,"BACKGROUND: Despite the tremendous impact of swallowing disorders on outcome following ischemic stroke, little is known about the incidence of dysphagia after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and its contribution to hospital complications, length of intensive care unit stay, and functional outcome. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of an ongoing prospective cohort study. Swallowing ability was assessed in consecutive non-traumatic SAH patients admitted to our neurological intensive care unit using the Bogenhausen Dysphagia Score (BODS). A BODS > 2 points indicated dysphagia. Functional outcome was assessed 3 months after the SAH using the modified Rankin Scale with a score > 2 defined as poor functional outcome. RESULTS: Two-hundred and fifty consecutive SAH patients comprising all clinical severity grades with a median age of 57 years (interquartile range 47–67) were eligible for analysis. Dysphagia was diagnosed in 86 patients (34.4%). Factors independently associated with the development of dysphagia were poor clinical grade on admission (Hunt & Hess grades 4–5), SAH-associated parenchymal hematoma, hydrocephalus, detection of an aneurysm, and prolonged mechanical ventilation (> 48 h). Dysphagia was independently associated with a higher rate of pneumonia (OR = 4.32, 95% CI = 2.35–7.93), blood stream infection (OR = 4.3, 95% CI = 2.0–9.4), longer ICU stay [14 (8–21) days versus 29.5 (23–45) days, p < 0.001], and poor functional outcome after 3 months (OR = 3.10, 95% CI = 1.49–6.39). CONCLUSIONS: Dysphagia is a frequent complication of non-traumatic SAH and associated with poor functional outcome, infectious complications, and prolonged stay in the intensive care unit. Early identification of high-risk patients is needed to timely stratify individual patients for dysphagia treatment.

Progress in defining the ion channel function of GluDs in neurons has been hindered by a lack of pharmacological tools. Here, we used a chemo-genetic approach to engineer specific and photo-reversible pharmacology in GluD2 receptor. We incorporated a cysteine mutation in the cavity located above the putative ion channel pore, for site-specific conjugation with a photoswitchable pore blocker. In the constitutively open GluD2 Lurcher mutant, current could be rapidly and reversibly decreased with light. We then transposed the cysteine mutation to the native receptor, to demonstrate with high pharmacological specificity that metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling triggers opening of GluD2. Our results assess the functional relevance of GluD2 ion channel and introduce an optogenetic tool that will provide a novel and powerful means for probing GluD2 ionotropic contribution to neuronal physiology.","Lemoine, Damien; Mondoloni, Sarah; Tange, Jérome; Lambolez, Bertrand; Faure, Philippe; Taly, Antoine; Tricoire, Ludovic; Mourot, Alexandre",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7679134/,339

In this study, we have developed mathematical models to investigate transmission dynamics between humans, animals, and a contaminated environment. We compared different leptospire transmission models involving flooding and weather conditions, shedding and multiplication rate in a contaminated environment. We found that the model in which the transmission rate depends on both flooding and temperature, best-fits the reported human data on leptospirosis in Thailand. Our results indicate that flooding strongly contributes to disease transmission, where a high degree of flooding leads to a higher number of infected individuals. Sensitivity analysis showed that the transmission rate of leptospires from a contaminated environment was the most important parameter for the total number of human cases. Our results suggest that public education should target people who work in contaminated environments to prevent Leptospira infections.","Chadsuthi, Sudarat; Chalvet-Monfray, Karine; Wiratsudakul, Anuwat; Modchang, Charin",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7810882/,339
14770,A Virtual Book Club for Professional Development in Emergency Medicine,2020-12-14,"Colorectal cancer and other cancers often metastasize to the liver in later stages of the disease, contributing significantly to patient death. While the biomechanical properties of the liver parenchyma (normal liver tissue) are known to affect tumor cell behavior in primary and metastatic tumors, the role of these properties in driving or inhibiting metastatic inception remains poorly understood, as are the longer-term multicellular dynamics. This study adopts a multi-model approach to study the dynamics of tumor-parenchyma biomechanical interactions during metastatic seeding and growth. We employ a detailed poroviscoelastic model of a liver lobule to study how micrometastases disrupt flow and pressure on short time scales. Results from short-time simulations in detailed single hepatic lobules motivate constitutive relations and biological hypotheses for a minimal agent-based model of metastatic growth in centimeter-scale tissue over months-long time scales. After a parameter space investigation, we find that the balance of basic tumor-parenchyma biomechanical interactions on shorter time scales (adhesion, repulsion, and elastic tissue deformation over minutes) and longer time scales (plastic tissue relaxation over hours) can explain a broad range of behaviors of micrometastases, without the need for complex molecular-scale signaling. These interactions may arrest the growth of micrometastases in a dormant state and prevent newly arriving cancer cells from establishing successful metastatic foci. Moreover, the simulations indicate ways in which dormant tumors could “reawaken” after changes in parenchymal tissue mechanical properties, as may arise during aging or following acute liver illness or injury. We conclude that the proposed modeling approach yields insight into the role of tumor-parenchyma biomechanics in promoting liver metastatic growth, and advances the longer term goal of identifying conditions to clinically arrest and reverse the course of late-stage cancer.","Wang, Yafei; Brodin, Erik; Nishii, Kenichiro; Frieboes, Hermann B.; Mumenthaler, Shannon M.; Sparks, Jessica L.; Macklin, Paul",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7813881/,339
15197,Extracellular vesicles as mediators and markers of acute organ injury: current concepts,2021-02-03,"BACKGROUND: To strengthen medicines management capacity, including supply chain management, at public sector health facilities in Uganda, the Ministry of Health introduced a multipronged supervision, performance assessment, and recognition strategy (SPARS). The aim of this study was to assess the impact of SPARS on improving supply chain management. A series of four papers on SPARS described the SPARS concept, its impact on overall and domain practices and appropriate medicines use, and now in the fourth paper describing the effect on supply chain management. METHODS: District-based health workers trained as supervisors build facility-level capacity in medicines management using an indicator-based performance assessment followed by targeted supervisory visits. From 2010 to 2013, 1222 SPARS visits were implemented, and the SPARS performance indicator scores determined. This article assesses impact on 13 indicators in three of the five SPARS domains—stock management, storage management, and ordering and reporting quality—using a pre–post design. We also explored factors that may have influenced these outcomes. RESULTS: Between the first and last visit within one year of SPARS implementation, we found an average improvement of 16 percentage points (p < 0.001) in supply chain management measures across all levels of care. The improvement in scores for stock management, storage management, and ordering and reporting was 22 (ns), 16 (p < 0.001), and 11 (p = 0.032) percentage points, respectively. The study identified the key predictors of positive change as a low initial indicator score, frequent supervisory visits, and engagement of the district health officer. CONCLUSIONS: The multipronged SPARS approach was effective in building supply chain management capacity in lower-level health care facilities with statistically significant improvements in supply chain management overall and in almost all stock and storage- management and ordering and reporting measures after one year of implementation. We recommend broad dissemination of the SPARS approach as an effective strategy to strengthen supply chain management in low-income countries. Trial registration: The study did not involve or use human participants or identifiable personal data, human tissue, or animals and thus did not require ethical approval or a waiver. It is a study implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and does not require trial registration.","Ladwar, Denis Okidi; Sembatya, Moses Nixon; Amony, Nancy Miriam; Seru, Morries; Ross-Degnan, Dennis; Garabedian, Laura; Trap, Birna",J Pharm Policy Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7857862/,339
15281,"Efficacy of a Transdiagnostic Self-Help Internet Intervention for Reducing Depression, Anxiety, and Suicidal Ideation in Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial",2021-01-22,"PURPOSE: The objective of this systematic review is to compare the safety and efficacy of surgical fixation of rib fractures against non-surgical interventions for the treatment of flail chest in the adult population. METHODS: A search was performed on the 22nd of July 2020 to identify articles comparing surgical fixation versus clinical management for flail chest in adults, with a description of the outcome parameters (resource utility, mortality, adverse effects of the intervention and adverse progression in pulmonary status). Relevant randomised controlled trials were selected, their risk of bias assessed, and the data then extracted and analysed. RESULTS: 157 patients were included from four studies in the analyses, with 79 and 78 patients in the surgical and non-surgical groups, respectively. The pooled effects of all outcomes tended towards favouring surgical intervention. Surgical intervention was associated with lower rates of pneumonia (I(2) = 46%, Tau(2) = 0.16, p = 0.16), significantly lower rates of tracheostomy (I(2) = 76%, Tau(2) = 0.67, p = 0.02), and a significantly lower duration of mechanical ventilation (I(2) = 88%, Tau(2) = 33.7, p < 0.01) in comparison to the non-surgical management methods. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that surgical intervention reduces the need for tracheostomy, reduces the time spent in the intensive care unit following a traumatic flail chest injury and could reduce the risk of acquiring pneumonia after such an event. There is a need for further well-designed studies with sufficient sample sizes to confirm the results of this study and also detect other possible effects of surgical intervention in the treatment of traumatic flail chest in adults.

17241,Effects of a School-Based Physical Activity Intervention for Obesity and Health-Related Physical Fitness in Adolescents With Intellectual Disability: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,2021-03-22,"BACKGROUND: The aims were to compare: (1) baseline weights and weight gain trajectories; (2) sociodemographic, behavioural and health characteristics driving weight gain; and (3) estimated average weight in 20 years’ time, in two cohorts of young women. METHODS: Data were from 16066 participants in two population-based cohorts of young adult women, born in 1973–78 (“GenX”) and 1989–95 (“millennials”). Weight was reported at baseline (age 18–23 in both cohorts) and 4 years later. High weight gain was defined as >2.5% per year. Data were analysed in 2020. RESULTS: Women born in 1989–95 were almost 4 kg heavier at age 18–23 and gained weight over 4 years 1.7 times faster than those born in 1973–78. Prevalence of high weight gain was 34.2% in the 1989–95 cohort and 24% in the 1973–78 cohort. In both cohorts, older age, higher education and high physical activity were associated with lower odds of high weight gain, and more hours in paid work, poorer self-rated health and higher baseline BMI were associated with higher odds of high weight gain. Five factors (outer regional areas, one child, ex or current smoker, high stress and depression) were determinants of high weight gain in the 1989–95 cohort, but not in the 1973–78 cohort. Based on average weight at age 21 and annual percentage weight gain, we estimate that women born in 1989–95 will, on average, be 16.7 kg heavier at age 41 (93.2 kg), than women in the 1973–78 cohort (76.5 kg). CONCLUSION: High weight gain was evident in every sociodemographic group in both cohorts but most evident in millennial women with high levels of stress and depression. Without effective weight gain prevention strategies we estimate that more than 50% of the millennial women will be in the obese BMI category in 20 years. This will have serious economic, health and societal consequences.","Brown, Wendy J.; Flores, Thaynã R.; Keating, Shelley E.; Mielke, Gregore I.",Int J Obes (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090508/,339

Recent evidence has shown a promising role of colchicine in patients with coronary artery disease. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of colchicine in post–acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Methods: We searched five electronic databases from inception to January 18, 2021, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating colchicine in post–acute MI patients. Primary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality and recurrent MI. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, urgent coronary revascularization, levels of follow-up high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and drug-related adverse events. All meta-analyses used inverse-variance random-effects models. Results: Six RCTs involving 6,005 patients were included. Colchicine did not significantly reduce cardiovascular mortality [risk ratio (RR), 0.91; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.52–1.61; p = 0.64], recurrent MI (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.62–1.22; p = 0.28), all-cause mortality (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.61–1.85; p = 0.78), stroke (RR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.07–1.09; p = 0.05), urgent coronary revascularization (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.02–8.89; p = 0.19), or decreased levels of follow-up hs-CRP (mean difference, −1.95 mg/L; 95% CI, −12.88 to 8.98; p = 0.61) compared to the control group.

18849,Improving the oral health of older people in care homes (TOPIC): a protocol for a feasibility study,2021-07-02,"Certainly there can be no argument against every woman being attended at birth by a skilled birth attendant. Currently, as elsewhere, the Ugandan government favors a biomedical model of care to achieve this aim, even though the logistical realities in certain regions mitigate against its realisation. This article addresses the Indigenous midwives of the Karamojong tribe in Northeastern Uganda and their biosocial model of birth, and describes the need British midwife Sally Graham, who lived and worked with the Karamojong for many years, identified to facilitate “mutual accommodation” between biomedical staff and these midwives, who previously were reluctant to refer women to the hospital that serves their catchment area due to maltreatment by the biomedical practitioners there. This polarisation of service does not meet that society’s needs. We do not argue for the provision of a unilateral, top-down educational service, but rather for one that collaborates between the biosocial model of the Karamojong and the biomedical model supported by government legislation. We show that such a partnership is practical, safer, and harnesses the best and most economical and effective use of resources. In this article, we demonstrate the roles of the Indigenous midwives/traditional birth attendants (TBAs) and show that not only is marriage of the two systems both possible and desirable, but is also essential for meeting the needs of Karamojong women. The TBA is frequently all the skilled assistance available to these women, particularly during the rainy season when roads are impassable in rural South Karamoja. Without this skilled help, the incidence of maternal and infant mortality would undoubtedly increase. Ongoing training and supervision of the TBA/Indigenous midwife in best practices will ensure better care. We offer a way forward via the Partnership Paradigm (PP) that lead author Sally Graham designed in conjunction with the Indigenous midwives and biomedical staff with whom she worked, the development and characteristics of which this article describes.","Graham, Sally; Davis-Floyd, Robbie",Front Sociol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8249798/,339

19758,Emergency medical staffs’ knowledge and attitude about organ donation after circulatory determined death (DCD) and its related factors,2021-08-03,"INTRODUCTION: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a sudden inflammatory process in the pancreas with variable involvement of nearby organs or other organ systems, and it is a common cause for hospitalization of gastrointestinal origin. Early prediction of the prognosis of patients with AP is important to help physicians triage the patients and decrease mortality. Red cell distribution width (RDW) and total serum calcium (TSC) have been reported to be useful predictors of the severity of AP, but if these parameters are associated with the prognosis of AP is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate whether RDW/TSC can be used to predict the prognosis of patients with AP at an early stage. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled AP patients admitted to the emergency department of West China Hospital of Sichuan University from January 1, 2016, to June 30, 2016. According to the prognosis, AP patients were divided into ICU group and non-ICU group, surgery group and nonsurgery group, and hospital survival group and hospital death group. Demographic information and clinical and laboratory parameters of all enrolled patients after being admitted to ED were compared between the groups. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the prognostic values of RDW, TSC, and RDW/TSC in patients with AP. RESULTS: A total of 666 AP patients were enrolled in this study, with an average age of 47.99 ± 14.11 years, including 633 patients who survived to discharge and 33 patients who died during hospitalization. The areas under the curve (AUC) of RDW and RDW/TSC predict that patients need to be admitted to ICU (0.773 vs. 0.824 vs. 0.723), patients need surgery treatment (0.744 vs. 0.768 vs. 0.690), and patients survived to hospital discharge (0.809 vs. 0.855 vs. 0.780) were greater than that of TSC, with RDW/TSC being the greatest. CONCLUSIONS: RDW/TSC may be a new method to identify the AP patients who need to be transferred to the ICU, accompanying complications which need surgery treatment, or may be died in hospital at an early stage, and we should pay more attention to RDW/TSC in patients with AP, for they may have a worse prognosis.","Han, Tian-Yong; Cheng, Tao; Liu, Bo-Fu; He, Ya-Rong; Pan, Pan; Yang, Wen-Tao; Qiang-Lai,; Cao, Yu",Gastroenterol Res Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8331275/,339
19949,Prevalence of spine surgery navigation techniques and availability in Africa: A cross-sectional study,2021-07-29,"Fecal pollution of surface water may introduce bacteria and bacteriophages harboring antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) into the aquatic environment. Watercourses discharging into the marine environment, especially close to designated bathing waters, may expose recreational users to fecal pollution and therefore may increase the likelihood that they will be exposed to ARGs. This study compares the bacterial and bacteriophage ARG profiles of two rivers (River Tolka and Liffey) and two small urban streams (Elm Park and Trimleston Streams) that discharge close to two marine bathing waters in Dublin Bay. Despite the potential differences in pollution pressures experienced by these waterways, microbial source tracking analysis showed that the main source of pollution in both rivers and streams in the urban environment is human contamination. All ARGs included in this study, bla(TEM), bla(SHV), qnrS, and sul1, were present in all four waterways in both the bacterial and bacteriophage fractions, displaying a similar ARG profile. We show that nearshore marine bathing waters are strongly influenced by urban rivers and streams discharging into these, since they shared a similar ARG profile. In comparison to rivers and streams, the levels of bacterial ARGs were significantly reduced in the marine environment. In contrast, the bacteriophage ARG levels in freshwater and the marine were not significantly different. Nearshore marine bathing waters could therefore be a potential reservoir of bacteriophages carrying ARGs. In addition to being considered potential additional fecal indicators organism, bacteriophages may also be viewed as indicators of the spread of antimicrobial resistance.","Sala-Comorera, Laura; Nolan, Tristan M.; Reynolds, Liam J.; Venkatesh, Anjan; Cheung, Lily; Martin, Niamh A.; Stephens, Jayne H.; Gitto, Aurora; O’Hare, Gregory M.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of face‐to‐face training on self‐reported school staff preparedness in managing the severely allergic child and whether it would stimulate schools' allergy policy review. METHODS: A preparedness survey was conducted prior and 2 months post‐intervention to assess the effect of training on self‐reported preparedness and perceived confidence to manage children with food allergies. RESULTS: A sample of 18 primary schools that consented to participate were selected. Of the trained schools, 89% of the head teachers felt confident in dealing with an allergy emergency compared to 39% prior training (p = 0.016). Post‐intervention all but one had arranged/were considering introducing allergy awareness sessions to help pupils manage their allergies (45% pre‐training vs. post‐training 93%, p = 0.003). Preventative measures for accidental exposure to food allergens (i.e., no food sharing policy) were adopted by all (pre‐training 61% vs. post‐training 100%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: A face‐to‐face school allergy training programme enhances self‐reported staff preparedness and promotes internal allergy policy review in managing the needs of these children, hence addressing the current gap between recommendations and practice in schools.","Raptis, George; Totterdell, Rebecca; Gerasimidis, Konstantinos; Michaelis, Louise Jane; Perez‐Botella, Mercedes",Clin Transl Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8451729/,339

Thus, cytokines are needed to be used as early markers of prolongation of the QTc interval in RR-TB patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the correlation of inflammatory cytokines on QTc interval in RR-TB patients who received shorter regimens. METHODS: This study uses a case-control study with a time series conducted in the period September 2019 to February 2020 in one of the referral hospitals for Tuberculosis in Indonesia. Cytokines levels from blood samples were measured using the ELISA method, while QTc intervals were automatically recorded using an electrocardiography machine. The statistical analysis used was the Chi-square test, Man Whitney test, Independence t-test, and Spearman-rank test with p < 0.05. RESULTS: There was no significant correlation between inflammatory cytokines and QTc prolongation in intensive phase which TNF-α value (6.8 pg/ml; r = 0.207; p = 0.281), IL-1β (20.13 pg/ml; r = 0.128; p = 0.509), and IL-6 (43.17 pg/ml; r = −0.028; p = 0.886).

Revascularization therapy can relieve angina pectoris to some extent, but it is not widely accepted in China due to the cost and secondary events. The Chinese proprietary medicine Danlou tablet has been widely used to treat angina pectoris, but previous trials had inadequate methodologies. In this study, we aim to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate its efficacy and safety on stable angina. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a WeChat-based randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial in China. Eligible participants are adults (aged 30–75 years) with CT-confirmed stable angina and traditional Chinese medicine-diagnosed intermingled phlegm and blood stasis syndrome. A total of 76 participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the oral Danlou tablet group (1.5 mg a time, 3 times daily for 28 days) or the placebo group. Patients are permitted concomitant use of routine medications during these 28 days. The primary outcome is angina frequency per week. The secondary outcomes include angina severity, angina duration, traditional Chinese medicine efficacy, the withdrawal rate of emergency medications, blood lipids, and electrocardiograph efficacy. The WeChat app will be used to remind patients to take their medicines and fill out the forms. All data will be recorded in case report forms and analyzed by Statistical Analysis System software.

Till today most of the ECG records are available in paper form. It can be challenging and time-consuming to manually assess the ECG paper records. Hence, automated diagnosis and analysis are possible if we digitize such paper ECG records. METHODS: The proposed work aims to convert ECG paper records into a 1-D signal and generate an accurate diagnosis of heart-related problems using deep learning. Camera-captured ECG images or scanned ECG paper records are used for the proposed work. Effective pre-processing techniques are used for the removal of shadow from the images. A deep learning model is used to get a threshold value that separates ECG signal from its background and after applying various image processing techniques threshold ECG image gets converted into digital ECG. These digitized 1-D ECG signals are then passed to another deep learning model for the automated diagnosis of heart diseases into different classes such as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), and T-wave abnormality. RESULTS: The accuracy of deep learning-based binarization is 97%. Further deep learning-based diagnosis approach of such digitized paper ECG records was having an accuracy of 94.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The digitized ECG signals can be useful to various research organizations because the trends in heart problems can be determined and diagnosed from preserved paper ECG records. This approach can be easily implemented in areas where such expertise is not available.

So the present study was aimed know the risk factors responsible for hearing loss in NICU and WBN babies and to assess the incidence of deafness. A total of 800 babies from NICU (n = 402) and WBN (n = 398) underwent hearing screening from a tertiary care center. Hearing screening was done using two staged screening protocol as per JCIH guidelines with Distortion product Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) and Automated Auditory Brainstem Responses (A-ABR). According to DPOAE test, 311 from NICU and 383 from WBN passed the test and during second screening, 80 out of 91 from NICU and 11 out of 13 from WBN passed the DPOAE test. Further BERA was done at the 3(rd) month of corrected age where 6 out of 11 showed positive responses from NICU and 3 babies from WBN had profound hearing loss. Data analysis revealed that family history of deafness, anemia and hypertension in ANC, TORCH in mother, low Apgar score and hyperbillirubinemia in newborns were a major risk factor for hearing impairment. We conclude that the diagnoses of auditory disorders at early stage due to various risk factors are important since appropriate therapeutic intervention and rehabilitation would help in better development of children.","Hajare, Priti; Mudhol, Ramesh",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8205201/,339
54879,Circadian Biology in Obstructive Sleep Apnea,2021-06-13,"Regulatory efforts to introduce effective intramodal competition to the rail sector, in particular to the long-distance intercity market segment, have so far achieved only very limited success in most countries. Germany is a case in point. Even 25 years after the fundamental 1994 ‘rail structure reform’, which eliminated the legal network monopoly of the former Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB), the combined market share of all competitors for long-distance passenger services remains stuck at “significantly below one per cent” (Bundesnetzagentur 2018, 22). This figure stands in stark contrast to the competitors’ market shares of some 26% for short-distance (regional) services — where a competition for the market regime has been established — and around 50% of the rail cargo segment — which is governed by an open access regime. In this paper, we make the case for an alternative regulatory regime to substantially increase effective intramodal competition in the intercity rail passenger market. Our proposal addresses, and helps to overcome, the two major entry barriers faced by competitors: the massive investment needs in rolling stock on the one hand and reliable infrastructure access on the other.","Eisenkopf, Alexander; Knorr, Andreas",Wirtschaftsdienst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8218292/,339

On the other hand, daydreaming can progress to a maladaptive state, known as maladaptive daydreaming. The aim of this study was to help understand the full scope of maladaptive daydreaming among medical students at the University of Khartoum, in Sudan, by displaying all maladaptive daydreaming-related statistics among studied population. An analytical cross-sectional university-based study was conducted during the academic year 2020–2021, using a total of 323 self-administered online questionnaires; the questionnaire containing the Arabic Version of Maladaptive Daydreaming Scale and other sociodemographic data were given by stratified random selection to undergraduate medical students at the University of Khartoum, in Sudan, between December and January 2021. RESULTS: 34.3% of medical students at the University of Khartoum have identified themselves as maladaptive daydreamers. More males were found to be maladaptive daydreamers when compared to female medical students. The average Maladaptive Daydreaming Scale score among medical students was found to be 33.6 (sd=22.3). No significant correlation was found between Maladaptive Daydreaming Scale score and gender, and there was a significant correlation between the MDS score and the academic class of medical students at University of Khartoum. CONCLUSIONS: Maladaptive daydreaming was discovered to have a significant impact on the population of medical students at the University of Khartoum, with some alarming rates and correlations among medical students; having more than one-third of total medical students found to be having MD must surely indicate a much larger and more widespread problem. A multifactorial holistic approach covering biological, psychological, social, and academic aspects must be used when hypothesizing the justification for these findings and planning an active intervention strategy.","Bashir, Moez Mohammed Ibrahim",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8352612/,339

As the pathological mechanisms of liver fibrosis are complex, drugs developed for a single target are difficult to be effective in clinical practice, so there are no chemical drugs or biological drugs with clear efficacy available for clinical application at present. Traditional Chinese medicine is a kind of medical science that has been gradually formed during thousands of years and continuously enriched by the people of all ethnic groups in China.

Method: A 62-year-old female with history of GBD and inactive Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) was admitted with progressive exophthalmos in her right eye (RE) and diagnosed with GO reactivation the previous month. Results: On examination, dilated and tortuous conjunctival blood vessels, chemosis and exophthalmos were observed in the RE. There was an asymmetry in the intraocular pressures of 20 mmHg in the RE and 10 mmHg in the LE. Laboratory results showed normal thyroid function and positivity of some of the antibodies related to immune thyroid disorders. Neuroimaging showed an early and abnormal filling of the cavernous sinus (CS) and an enlarged superior ophthalmic vein. Consequently, the diagnosis of CCF was established. Interventional treatment was performed with good clinical outcome and no recurrence after 6 months of follow-up. Conclusions: CCFs are abnormal arteriovenous connections between the carotid arteries and CS. CCF picture can mimic the GO's manifestations. Thus, CCF should be considered in the differential diagnosis of GO, especially in unilateral, asymmetric, and atypical cases. We reported herein a case of CCF in a patient diagnosed with GBD, having a previous history of inactive GO, a diagnostic challenge, since the first presumed diagnosis in patients with GBD is always GO.

Single-port VATS thymectomy using a flexible port and CO2 has been described. However, VATS thymectomy is possible by a single incision of 3 cm without CO2 insufflation or special port device avoiding objections related to CO2 insufflation and allowing instruments to move more freely making procedure easier and cheaper. Our institutional experience in open and CO2-less VATS single-port thymectomy was retrospectively reviewed to evaluate compared to sternotomy, the clinical and oncological outcomes with this novel approach. METHODS A retrospective review consisting of 84 patients who underwent thymectomy because different thymic disorders especially thymoma was performed. Eighteen patients underwent CO2-less VATS single port thymectomy, while 66 underwent thymectomy through open sternotomy. Many clinical factors associated with the surgical and clinical outcomes, including tumor recurrence and clinical remission, were recorded. RESULTS Non major postoperative complications were observed in any group. The median operative time and postoperative hospital stay of CO2-less VATS single port thymectomy were 95 min and 1 day, respectively and 120 min and 7 days for open sternotomy. The thymoma was the most common thymic disorder with 7 patients (38%) in VATS group and 28 patients (42.4%) for the open approach. The median lesion size was 2.6 cm in the VATS group and 3.2 cm in the open approach. No thymoma recurrence in patients undergoing VATS was observed during the follow-up time, while in the open surgery group 14.28% recurrence was observed, distributed as follows: loco-regional 75% and 25% at distance; free disease period of these patients was 8.3 months. Thymectomy associated with myasthenia gravis (MG) was observed in 6 (33%) patients in the VATS group and 32 (48%) patients for sternotomy; our results regarding thymectomy for the treatment of MG were established by the MG post-intervention status [complete stable remission (CSR), pharmacologic remission, minimal manifestations, improved, unchanged and worse exacerbation, and died of MG] and reflected similar results in both approaches. CONCLUSIONS CO2-less VATS single-port thymectomy is a feasible and safe procedure. Oncologic outcomes are similar to open approaches. Complications, surgical time and hospital stay are shorter compared with sternotomy.

This paper contrasts the framework of financial risk-sharing and the configuration and management of health service providers in these two high-income, small-population countries. Two main institutional distinctions emerge from this country case comparison: (1) Key differences exist in the practical configuration of solidarity for payment of health care services, reflecting differing cultural roots and social expectations, which in turn carry substantial implications for financing long-term care and pensions. (2) Differing arrangements exist in the organization of health service institutions, in particular balancing public as against private sector responsibilities for owning, operating and managing these two countries' respective hospitals. These different structural characteristics generate fundamental differences in health sector financial and delivery outcomes in one developed country in Far East Asia as compared with a well-respected tax-funded health system in Western Europe. In the post-COVID era, as Western European policymakers find themselves forced to adjust their publicly funded health systems to (further) reductions in economic growth rates and overall tax receipts, and as the cost of the information revolution continues to rise while efforts to fund better coordinated social and home care services for growing numbers of chronically ill elderly remain inadequate, this two-country case comparison highlights a series of health system design questions that could potentially provide alternative health sector financing and service delivery strategies.","Saltman, Richard B; Yeh, Ming-Jui; Liu, Yu","Health economics, policy, and law",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133120000390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33190673/,339

However, the pathogenesis of most autoimmune diseases is unknown. An explanatory hypothesis for the pathogenesis of infection-initiated autoimmune diseases is provided. Virulent pathogen infections create extensive pathogen antigens that frequently require antibodies. These antibodies create extensive antigen-antibody immune complexes, which some immuno-compromised individuals will not adquately eliminate. This will cause inflammatory type III hypersensitivity symptoms, including protease releases that destroy epithelium, mesothelium, and endothelium basement membranes, express new immunogenic antigens from previously sequestered basement membrane constituents, and ultimately induce new autoantibodies. This can continue after the infection ends, if the first wave of protease attacks on basement membranes induces new autoantibodies that cause new uncleared antigen-antibody immune complexes and type III hypersensitivity reactions. The secreted proteases and other enzymes will have preferred substrates and these proteases or other enzymes by themselves, or by their processed protein substrates, can express immunogenic antigens that induce new autoantibodies and initiate various autoimmune diseases. In summary, several autoimmune diseases can be initiated in immuno-compromised individuals during extensive pathogen infections, if these individuals have two immune problems: (1) slow or weak initial immune responses that result in a reliance on antibodies and (2) an inability to eliminate the resulting antigen-antibody immune complexes by phagocytosis. These two immune problems and the resulting immune system type III hypersensitivity reaction can explain the causation of several autoimmune diseases, including the most common and the rarest autoimmune diseases, both their differences and their similarities.","Roe, Kevin",Scandinavian journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/sji.12994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33151588/,339
64424,Countering Nurse Burnout.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Severe iodine deficiency or excess during pregnancy can cause congenital hypothyroidism (CH). Iodine deficiency is common in pregnant women in the United States. OBJECTIVES We conducted a nested case-control study in a cohort of ∼2.5 million births in California to determine whether iodine status is related to CH in a US population. METHODS Dried blood spots from 907 newborns with CH identified by newborn screening and 909 unaffected controls matched by month of birth were obtained from the California Newborn Screening Program to measure whole-blood iodine concentration. Iodine status was compared between cases and controls, and logistic regression was used to assess the association between CH status and blood iodine concentrations. Iodine status was also compared between cases and controls among infants treated in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) because CH has been reported in infants exposed to high levels of iodine in the NICU. RESULTS Blood iodine concentrations did not differ significantly between cases (median: 20.0 ng/mL; IQR: 12.1-29.8 ng/mL) and controls (median: 20.3 ng/mL; IQR: 12.5-30.9 ng/mL; P = 0.59). Neither extremely high nor extremely low blood iodine concentrations (1st, 5th, 95th, and 99th percentiles of the distribution) were more common in cases. Among infants treated in NICUs, however, cases had significantly (P = 0.01) higher iodine (median: 22.7 ng/mL; IQR: 16.4-32.1 ng/mL) compared with controls (median: 17.3 ng/mL; IQR: 8.3-26.6 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS CH cases did not have significantly higher or lower iodine in this population, which is reassuring given that maternal iodine deficiency is common in the United States. Among newborns in the NICU, CH cases had higher blood iodine concentrations compared with controls, suggesting that excess iodine exposure in the NICU could be causing CH. It may be beneficial to monitor iodine exposure from surgical procedures, imaging, and iodine-containing disinfectants and to consider non-iodine alternatives.","Mills, James L; Reische, Elijah C; Kannan, Kurunthachalam; Gao, Chongjing; Shaw, Gary M; Sundaram, Rajeshwari",The Journal of nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxaa178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633779/,339
64707,Temporal Trends in Lower-Limb Major and Minor Amputation and Revascularization Procedures in People With Diabetes in England During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-05-20,"BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is safe and feasible for benign and malignant colorectal diseases. SILS has comparable or improved outcomes compared to multiport laparoscopy but technical limitations when operating in the pelvis. To address these limitations, we developed an innovative SILS+1 approach using a single Pfannenstiel incision for pelvis access with one additional umbilical port. Our goal was to compare outcomes for SILS and SILS+1 in lower abdominal and pelvic colorectal surgery. METHODS Review of a prospectively maintained database identified patients who underwent an elective reduced port laparoscopic lower abdominal/pelvic colorectal procedure from 2009 to 2014. Cases were stratified by approach: SILS versus SILS+1 then matched 1:2 on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), comorbidity, and procedure. Demographic, perioperative, and postoperative outcome variables were evaluated. The main outcome measures were operative time, conversion rate, length of stay, complication, morbidity, and mortality rates. RESULTS One hundred thirty-two reduced port AR/LAR patients were evaluated-44 SILS and 88 SILS+1. The groups were similar in age, gender, BMI, and ASA class. The primary diagnosis in both cohorts was diverticulitis (90.9 % SILS, 87.5 % SILS+1), and main procedure performed an anterior rectosigmoidectomy (86.4 % SILS, 88.2 % SILS+1). Significantly more SILS+1 patients had previous abdominal surgery (p = 0.01). The operative time was significantly shorter in SILS+1 (mean 166.6 [SD 48.4] vs. 178.0 [SD 70.0], p = 0.03). The conversion rate to multiport or open surgery was also significantly lower with SILS+1 compared to SILS (1.1 vs. 11.4 %, p = 0.02). Postoperatively, the length of stay across the groups was similar. SILS trended towards higher complication and readmission rates (NS). There were no unplanned reoperations or mortality in either group. CONCLUSIONS SILS+1 facilitates pelvic and lower abdominal colorectal surgery, with shorter operative times and lower conversion rates. The additional port improved visualization and outcomes without any impact on length of stay, readmission, or complication rates.","Keller, Deborah S; Flores-Gonzalez, Juan R; Sandhu, Jaideep; Ibarra, Sergio; Madhoun, Nisreen; Haas, Eric M",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-015-2921-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26282851/,339

Case 2: a 64-year-old male with a history of several intra-abdominal surgeries visited our hospital with a complaint of left back pain and fever. Computed tomography demonstrated left marked hydronephrosis, thinning of renal parenchyma, and duplicated inferior vena cava. After antibiotic treatment, transperitoneal reduced port simple nephrectomy and retroperitoneal laparoendoscopic single-site simple nephrectomy were performed in Case 1 and 2, respectively, because the function of the affected kidney was almost lost on renography. Although adhesion was slightly noted around the renal hilum in Case 1, neither conversion to laparotomy nor placement of additional ports was needed.

The mechanisms by which pulmonary lesions and fibrosis are generated during SARS-CoV infection are not known. Using high-throughput mRNA profiling, we examined the transcriptional response of wild-type (WT), type I interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR1-/-), and STAT1 knockout (STAT1-/-) mice infected with a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) to better understand the contribution of specific gene expression changes to disease progression. Despite a deletion of the type I interferon receptor, strong expression of interferon-stimulated genes was observed in the lungs of IFNAR1-/- mice, contributing to clearance of the virus. In contrast, STAT1-/- mice exhibited a defect in the expression of interferon-stimulated genes and were unable to clear the infection, resulting in a lethal outcome. STAT1-/- mice exhibited dysregulation of T-cell and macrophage differentiation, leading to a TH2-biased immune response and the development of alternatively activated macrophages that mediate a profibrotic environment within the lung. We propose that a combination of impaired viral clearance and T-cell/macrophage dysregulation causes the formation of prefibrotic lesions in the lungs of rMA15-infected STAT1-/- mice.","Zornetzer, Gregory A; Frieman, Matthew B; Rosenzweig, Elizabeth; Korth, Marcus J; Page, Carly; Baric, Ralph S; Katze, Michael G",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01130-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20702617/,339

There are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on laparoscopic IPOM procedure, but no RCT so far has examined mesh fixation techniques in open IPOM repair. METHODS In a single-center RCT, 48 patients undergoing open IPOM repair of an abdominal wall hernia were included. After randomization, surgery was performed in a standardized fashion. Hernia size, extent of mesh fixation, and duration of surgery were documented. The primary endpoint was postoperative pain intensity. Secondary endpoints were: complications, length of stay, quality of life, return to work, hernia recurrence. Follow-up was 1 year in all 48 patients. RESULTS After using tacks, mean pain intensity was 16.9, which is slightly lower than after suture fixation (19.6, p = 0.20). The duration of surgery was about the same (83 vs. 85 min). When using tack fixation, significantly more fixation points were applied as compared to sutures (19 vs. 12; p = 0.02), although mesh size was similar. The complication rate was similar (tacks: 6/28 vs. sutures: 3/20). Cost of suture fixation was about 26 €, which is markedly lower than the 180 € associated with tacks. However, surgeons clearly preferred mesh fixation with tacks, because it is more comfortable especially in small hernias. CONCLUSIONS The present study failed to show an advantage of tacks over suture fixation and even there are more severe adverse events. Using tacks significantly increases the costs of hernia repair.","Langenbach, M R; Enz, D",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-019-01991-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31236731/,339

This affected mental health, increasing anxiety and worry about COVID-19 contagion. The aim of this study was assessing the moderation and mediation effect of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) on general anxiety and whether the mediation effect was moderated by gender and/or age. A total of 1753 Spanish adults (78,6% female; M = 40.4 years, SD = 12.9) participated in an online survey that was available from March 26 to April 25 (2020) during the time period in which the population in Spain was confined. Participants completed measures of worry about COVID-19 contagion, the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Short (CERQ-Short) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Several models were tested through structural equation modelling. Moderation analyses reported that maladaptive strategies moderated positively anxiety, whereas adaptive strategies moderated negatively anxiety. Also, the best fitted mediation model found that worry about COVID-19 contagion and general anxiety was mediated by CERS in different directions. Maladaptive CERS increased anxiety, whereas adaptive CERS reduced anxiety. Age (not gender) also moderated this mediation, were younger adults presented an indirect effect only through maladaptive CERS, but older adults through both adaptive and maladaptive. Limitations are related to the study design which was a convenience sample. CERS moderated and mediated between worry about COVID-19 contagion and general anxiety.

67153,"Inclusion, characteristics and outcomes of people requiring palliative care in studies of non-pharmacological interventions for delirium: A systematic review.",2019,"INTRODUCTION Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in association with obesity is an increasing disease burden. Bariatric surgery is the only effective therapy for achieving remission of T2D among those with morbid obesity. It is unclear which of the two most commonly performed types of bariatric surgery, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), is most effective for obese patients with T2D. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether LSG or LRYGB is more effective in achieving HbA1c<6% (<42 mmol/mol) without the use of diabetes medication at 5 years. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Single-centre, double-blind (assessor and patient), parallel, randomised clinical trial (RCT) conducted in New Zealand, targeting 106 patients. Eligibility criteria include age 20-55 years, T2D of at least 6 months duration and body mass index 35-65 kg/m(2) for at least 5 years. Randomisation 1:1 to LSG or LRYGB, used random number codes disclosed to the operating surgeon after induction of anaesthesia. A standard medication adjustment schedule will be used during postoperative metabolic assessments. Secondary outcomes include proportions achieving HbA1c<5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or HbA1c<6.5% (48 mmol/mol) without the use of diabetes medication, comparative weight loss, obesity-related comorbidity, operative complications, revision rate, mortality, quality of life, anxiety and depression scores. Exploratory outcomes include changes in satiety, gut hormone and gut microbiota to gain underlying mechanistic insights into T2D remission.

Effective treatment using antibiotics is achievable, but poor patient compliance constitutes a major challenge impeding successful pharmacotherapeutic outcomes. This is often due to the prolonged treatment periods required and contributes significantly to the rising incidence of drug resistance, which is a major cause of tuberculosis mortality. Thus, innovative interventions capable of encouraging compliance and decreasing lengthy and frequent dosing are needed. Previously, aqueous tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPPIX), a heme oxygenase-1 inhibitor, administered as multiple daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections, showed considerable antitubercular efficacy and treatment shortening capabilities as a host-directed therapy in infected mice. Since daily IP injection is a clinically impractical administration approach, this proof-of-concept study aims to develop a novel, sustained action injectable formulation of SnPPIX for safe intramuscular (IM) administration. Herein, a SnPPIX-loaded poloxamer-poly(acrylic acid)-based thermoresponsive injectable formulation (SnPPIX-TIF) is designed for effective IM delivery. Results show SnPPIX-TIF is microparticulate, syringeable, injectable, and exhibits complete in vitro/in vivo gelation. Administered once weekly, SnPPIX-TIF significantly prolonged absorption and antimicrobial efficacy in infected mice. In addition, SnPPIX-TIF is well-tolerated in vivo; results from treated animals show no significant histopathologic alterations and were indistinguishable from the untreated control group, thus supporting its biocompatibility and preclinical safety. Overall, the IM delivery of the thermoresponsive injectable formulation safely sustains antitubercular effect in an infected murine model and decreases the number of injections required, signifying a potentially practical approach for future clinical translation.","Adeleke, Oluwatoyin A; Fisher, Logan; Moore, Ian N; Nardone, Glenn A; Sher, Alan",ACS pharmacology & translational science,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsptsci.0c00185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615179/,339

In addition to reversal of inspiratory-expiratory ratios, this pressure control mode also allows unrestricted spontaneous breathing. The spontaneous tidal volume (V(T)), as well as the V(T) resulting from transition between the high and low airway pressures, is uncontrolled. There are limited data on the within-patient variation of actual V(T) and the safety of these modes. The authors present a patient with severe ARDS who was managed with biphasic modes (APRV and bi-level positive airway pressure). Serial V(T) measurements showed that V(T) ranged from 4 to 12 mL/kg predicted body weight. Computed tomography scan images and chest radiographs obtained before and following APRV showed lung parenchyma changes that may be related to ventilator-induced lung injury. We also present a mathematical model that is useful for simulating APRV and demonstrating the issues related to volume delivery for mandatory breaths during the transition between the 2 pressure levels. A key finding of this analysis is the interdependence of release volume, autoPEEP, and the T(low) time setting. Furthermore, it is virtually impossible to target a specific P(aCO(2)) with a desired level V(T) and autoPEEP in a passive model, emphasizing the importance of spontaneous breathing with this mode. This case report suggests caution when using these modes, and that end-inspiratory lung volumes and V(T) should be limited to avoid lung injury. The important point of this case study and model analysis is that the application of APRV is more complex than it appears to be. It requires a lot more knowledge and skill than may be apparent from descriptions in the literature.","Sasidhar, Madhu; Chatburn, Robert L",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22348242/,339

When kidney function deteriorated further, despite persistently absent circulating anti-GBM antibodies, a repeat kidney biopsy was performed, showing crescents in 100% of glomeruli with ongoing endocapillary hypercellularity and strong IgG and IgG4 GBM staining. This case highlights complexities in the diagnosis of anti-GBM disease, with clinical and histological features bridging the atypical to typical anti-GBM disease spectrum.

The c-myc-his tag was subsequently replaced by a single cysteine at the C terminus, allowing site-specific conjugation of chelates for radiolabeling. JVZ-007-c-myc-his was conjugated to 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (p-SCN-DTPA) via the lysines, whereas JVZ-007-cys was conjugated to maleimide-DTPA via the C-terminal cysteine. PSMA targeting was analyzed in vitro by cell-binding experiments using flow cytometry, autoradiography, and internalization assays with various PCa cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). The targeting properties of radiolabeled Nanobodies were evaluated in vivo in biodistribution and SPECT/CT imaging experiments, using nude mice bearing PSMA-positive PC-310 and PSMA-negative PC-3 tumors. RESULTS JVZ-007 was successfully conjugated to DTPA for radiolabeling with (111)In at room temperature. (111)In-JVZ007-c-myc-his and (111)In-JVZ007-cys internalized in LNCaP cells and bound to PSMA-expressing PDXs and, importantly, not to PSMA-negative PDXs and human kidneys. Good tumor targeting and fast blood clearance were observed for (111)In-JVZ-007-c-myc-his and (111)In-JVZ-007-cys. Renal uptake of (111)In-JVZ-007-c-myc-his was initially high but was efficiently reduced by coinjection of gelofusine and lysine. The replacement of the c-myc-his tag by the cysteine contributed to a further reduction of renal uptake without loss of targeting. PC-310 tumors were clearly visualized by SPECT/CT with both tracers, with low renal uptake (<4 percentage injected dose per gram) for (111)In-JVZ-007-cys already at 3 h after injection. CONCLUSION We developed an (111)In-radiolabeled anti-PSMA Nanobody, showing good tumor targeting, low uptake in nontarget tissues, and low renal retention, allowing excellent SPECT/CT imaging of PCa within a few hours after injection.","Chatalic, Kristell L S; Veldhoven-Zweistra, Joke; Bolkestein, Michiel; Hoeben, Sander; Koning, Gerben A; Boerman, Otto C; de Jong, Marion; van Weerden, Wytske M","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.115.156729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25977460/,339

In the case of people with dementia, the compliance with sanitary recommendations and the necessary physical isolation can have far-reaching negative consequences in terms of limiting the continuation of tailored care, support and treatment. The recommendations related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic must take into account not only the medical consequences of lack of access to medical care, but also their long-term effects and the disease progression in accordance with the concept of social health. A plan of action for the psychoeducation of informal carers, adapted to the elderly group (including people with dementia), is also necessary. Prepared under the auspices of the Polish Psychiatric Association, the recommendations for people living alone, with their family and in long-term care facilities are intended to draw attention to key epidemiological issues that can be planned by medical staff within the organization of patient care. However, mental and social needs of patients, whose fulfilment is particularly significant in times of restrictions related to everyday activities, are of equal importance. Further monitoring of the epidemiological situation and scientific reports related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are necessary to verify and update the guidelines.","Łuc, Mateusz; Szcześniak, Dorota; Trypka, Elżbieta; Mazurek, Justyna; Rymaszewska, Joanna",Psychiatria polska,https://doi.org/10.12740/pp/122780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33038878/,339
77233,Barriers and Facilitators of Using Quality Improvement To Foster Locally Initiated Innovation in Palliative Care Services in India.,2020-09-08,"OBJECTIVE Craniopharyngiomas can be difficult to remove completely based on their intimate relationship with surrounding visual and endocrine structures. Reoperations are not uncommon but have been associated with higher rates of complications and lower extents of resection. So radiation is often offered as an alternative to reoperation. The endonasal endoscopic transsphenoidal approach has been used in recent years for craniopharyngiomas previously removed with craniotomy. The impact of this approach on reoperations has not been widely investigated. METHODS The authors reviewed a prospectively acquired database of endonasal endoscopic resections of craniopharyngiomas over 11 years at Weill Cornell Medical College, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, performed by the senior authors. Reoperations were separated from first operations. Pre- and postoperative visual and endocrine function, tumor size, body mass index (BMI), quality of life (QOL), extent of resection (EOR), impact of prior radiation, and complications were compared between groups. EOR was divided into gross-total resection (GTR, 100%), near-total resection (NTR, > 95%), and subtotal resection (STR, < 95%). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS Of the total 57 endonasal surgical procedures, 22 (39%) were reoperations. First-time operations and reoperations did not differ in tumor volume, radiological configuration, or patients' BMI. Hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus (DI) were more common before reoperations (82% and 55%, respectively) compared with first operations (60% and 8.6%, respectively; p < 0.001). For the 46 patients in whom GTR was intended, rates of GTR and GTR+NTR were not significantly different between first operations (90% and 97%, respectively) and reoperations (80% and 100%, respectively). For reoperations, prior radiation and larger tumor volume had lower rates of GTR. Vision improved equally in first operations (80%) compared with reoperations (73%). New anterior pituitary deficits were more common in first operations compared with reoperations (51% vs 23%, respectively; p = 0.08), while new DI was more common in reoperations compared with first-time operations (80% vs 47%, respectively; p = 0.08). Nonendocrine complications occurred in 2 (3.6%) first-time operations and no reoperations. Tumor regrowth occurred in 6 patients (11%) over a median follow-up of 46 months and was not different between first versus reoperations, but was associated with STR (33%) compared with GTR+NTR (4%; p = 0.02) and with not receiving radiation after STR (67% vs 22%; p = 0.08). The overall BMI increased significantly from 28.7 to 34.8 kg/m2 over 10 years. Six months after surgery, there was a significant improvement in QOL, which was similar between first-time operations and reoperations, and negatively correlated with STR. CONCLUSIONS Endonasal endoscopic transsphenoidal reoperation results in similar EOR, visual outcome, and improvement in QOL as first-time operations, with no significant increase in complications. EOR is more impacted by tumor volume and prior radiation. Reoperations should be offered to patients with recurrent craniopharyngiomas and may be preferable to radiation in patients in whom GTR or NTR can be achieved.","Dhandapani, Sivashanmugam; Singh, Harminder; Negm, Hazem M; Cohen, Salomon; Souweidane, Mark M; Greenfield, Jeffrey P; Anand, Vijay K; Schwartz, Theodore H",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2016.1.jns152238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27153172/,339
77548,Treatment of Lower Extremity Edema by Controlled Subcutaneous Drainage at Home: A Case Report.,2020-09-17,"Aim There is a wide variety of cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), even in asymptomatic individuals. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and can be considered as a predictor of cardiovascular risk (CVR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between CIMT-determined vascular age (VA), CVR scores, and thyroid function in asymptomatic patients with T2DM. Patients and Methods Clinical laboratory and CIMT parameters were measured in 154 asymptomatic patients with T2DM. The Framingham risk score (FRS) was performed with chronological age (CA) and with VA. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to analyze variables related to CVR reclassification. Results The use of CIMT-determined VA led to the reclassification of 54 (35.52%) out of 152 asymptomatic T2DM patients, being 20 (37.03%) to a lower categorical risk and 34 (62.96%) to a higher categorical risk according to FRS. The variables that were associated to reclassification to a higher categorical risk were positive family history (FH) of premature coronary artery disease (p=0.046), FH of thyroid disease (p=0.010), use of statins (p=0.027), and free T4 levels (p=0.009). Conclusion VA determined from CIMT allowed the reclassification of the CVR in asymptomatic T2DM patients. FH of premature CAD, FH of known thyroid disease, use of statins, and free T4 levels were associated to a reclassification into a higher risk category. The use of doppler to perform CIMT measure is currently more accessible, especially in a low-middle income country like Brazil. However, further prospective studies must be performed to establish the predictive values of CIMT on atherosclerosis and how thyroid function acts like cardiovascular risk marker on CVR scores.","Palma, Cátia Cristina Silva Sousa Vergara; Lopes, Pablo Moura; Silva, Eliete Leão Clemente; Bevilaqua, Maria de Fátima da Matta; Bomfim, Alfredo de Souza; Gomes, Marilia Brito","Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy",https://doi.org/10.2147/dmso.s251780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765029/,339

To develop criteria for crisis leadership in public health, published sources were reviewed to identify attributes of successful crisis leadership in aviation, public safety, military operations, and mining. These sources were abstracted to identify crisis leadership attributes associated with those disciplines and compare those attributes with crisis leadership challenges in public health. Based on this review, the following attributes are proposed for crisis leadership in public health: competence in public health science; decisiveness with flexibility; ability to maintain situational awareness and provide situational assessment; ability to coordinate diverse participants across very different disciplines; communication skills; and the ability to inspire trust. Of these attributes, only competence in public health science is currently a goal of public health education.

The objective of this study was to assess health disparities associated with influenza infection based on median household income and educational attainment. METHODS We geocoded people with documented confirmed influenza infection by home address to identify the US Census 2010 tract in which they lived during 4 influenza surveillance seasons (2013-2014, 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018) in Rhode Island. We dichotomized influenza as severe if the person with influenza infection was hospitalized (ie, inpatient) or as nonsevere if the person was not hospitalized (ie, outpatient). We examined 2 socioeconomic factors: median household income (defined as low, medium low, medium high, and high) and educational attainment (defined as a ratio among people who completed <high school, high school, some college, or ≥bachelor's degree). We calculated relative rates (RRs) to determine the associated level of risk for each socioeconomic factor. RESULTS The incidence of influenza per 100 000 person-years was significantly higher in populations with low vs high median household income (620 vs 303; P < .001) and in populations with low vs high educational attainment (583 vs 323; P < .001). The RR of a severe infection in the quartile with the lowest educational attainment (0.57) was significantly higher than the RR in the other 3 quartiles of educational attainment (range, 0.36-0.39; P = .01). However, the RR of a severe infection was higher in the 3 quartiles of median household income (range, 0.38-0.40) than in the quartile with the lowest median household income (0.29). CONCLUSIONS People in Rhode Island with a lower socioeconomic status are at greater risk of an influenza infection than people with higher socioeconomic status. The reasons for these disparities require further investigation.","Otero, Kori; Mermel, Leonard A",Public health reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354920951151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854565/,339

79960,COVID-19 and the Silver Lining in Health Care Technology.,2020-09-15,"BACKGROUND In epidemics of highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) or SARS, healthcare workers (HCW) are at much greater risk of infection than the general population, due to their contact with patients' contaminated body fluids. Contact precautions by means of personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to remove PPE, and how to make sure HCWs use PPE as instructed. OBJECTIVES To evaluate which type or component of full-body PPE and which method of donning or removing (doffing) PPE have the least risk of self-contamination or infection for HCWs, and which training methods most increase compliance with PPE protocols. SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE (PubMed up to 8 January 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Trials (CENTRAL up to 20 January 2016), EMBASE (embase.com up to 8 January 2016), CINAHL (EBSCOhost up to 20 January 2016), and OSH-Update up to 8 January 2016. We also screened reference lists of included trials and relevant reviews, and contacted NGOs and manufacturers of PPE. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all eligible controlled studies that compared the effect of types or components of PPE in HCWs exposed to highly infectious diseases with serious consequences, such as EVD and SARS, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. This included studies that simulated contamination with fluorescent markers or a non-pathogenic virus.We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or removing PPE, and the effects of various types of training in PPE use on the same outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included trials. We intended to perform meta-analyses but we did not find sufficiently similar studies to combine their results. MAIN RESULTS We included nine studies with 1200 participants evaluating ten interventions. Of these, eight trials simulated the exposure with a fluorescent marker or virus or bacteria containing fluids. Five studies evaluated different types of PPE against each other but two did not report sufficient data. Another two studies compared different types of donning and doffing and three studies evaluated the effect of different types of training.None of the included studies reported a standardised classification of the protective properties against viral penetration of the PPE, and only one reported the brand of PPE used. None of the studies were conducted with HCWs exposed to EVD but in one study participants were exposed to SARS. Different types of PPE versus each otherIn simulation studies, contamination rates varied from 25% to 100% of participants for all types of PPE. In one study, PPE made of more breathable material did not lead to a statistically significantly different number of spots with contamination but did have greater user satisfaction (Mean Difference (MD) -0.46 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -0.84 to -0.08, range 1 to 5, very low quality evidence). In another study, gowns protected better than aprons. In yet another study, the use of a powered air-purifying respirator protected better than a now outdated form of PPE. There were no studies on goggles versus face shields, on long- versus short-sleeved gloves, or on the use of taping PPE parts together. Different methods of donning and doffing procedures versus each otherTwo cross-over simulation studies (one RCT, one CCT) compared different methods for donning and doffing against each other. Double gloving led to less contamination compared to single gloving (Relative Risk (RR) 0.36; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.78, very low quality evidence) in one simulation study, but not to more noncompliance with guidance (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.67, very low quality evidence). Following CDC recommendations for doffing led to less contamination in another study (very low quality evidence). There were no studies on the use of disinfectants while doffing. Different types of training versus each otherIn one study, the use of additional computer simulation led to less errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7) and in another study additional spoken instruction led to less errors (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4). One retrospective cohort study assessed the effect of active training - defined as face-to-face instruction - versus passive training - defined as folders or videos - on noncompliance with PPE use and on noncompliance with doffing guidance. Active training did not considerably reduce noncompliance in PPE use (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.63; 95% CI 0.31 to 1.30) but reduced noncompliance with doffing procedures (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98, very low quality evidence). There were no studies on how to retain the results of training in the long term or on resource use.The quality of the evidence was very low for all comparisons because of high risk of bias in studies, indirectness of evidence, and small numbers of participants. This means that it is likely that the true effect can be substantially different from the one reported here. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found very low quality evidence that more breathable types of PPE may not lead to more contamination, but may have greater user satisfaction. We also found very low quality evidence that double gloving and CDC doffing guidance appear to decrease the risk of contamination and that more active training in PPE use may reduce PPE and doffing errors more than passive training. However, the data all come from single studies with high risk of bias and we are uncertain about the estimates of effects.We need simulation studies conducted with several dozens of participants, preferably using a non-pathogenic virus, to find out which type and combination of PPE protects best, and what is the best way to remove PPE. We also need randomised controlled studies of the effects of one type of training versus another to find out which training works best in the long term. HCWs exposed to highly infectious diseases should have their use of PPE registered and should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection.","Verbeek, Jos H; Ijaz, Sharea; Mischke, Christina; Ruotsalainen, Jani H; Mäkelä, Erja; Neuvonen, Kaisa; Edmond, Michael B; Sauni, Riitta; Kilinc Balci, F Selcen; Mihalache, Raluca C",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011621.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27093058/,339
80427,Characteristics of activity-based therapy interventions for people living with spinal cord injury or disease across the continuum of care: a scoping review protocol.,2020-07-23,"OBJECTIVES Treating acute respiratory failure in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is challenging due to the lack of knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology. Hypoxemia may be explained in part by the loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. The present study assessed the effect of almitrine, a selective pulmonary vasoconstrictor, on arterial oxygenation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. DESIGN Single-center retrospective observational study. SETTING ICU of Lille Teaching Hospital, France, from February 27, 2020, to April 14, 2020. PATIENTS Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia confirmed by positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 and acute respiratory distress syndrome according to Berlin definition. Data focused on clinicobiological features, ventilator settings, therapeutics, outcomes, and almitrine-related adverse events. INTERVENTIONS Almitrine was considered in patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2 ratio < 150 mm Hg) in addition to the recommended therapies, at an hourly IV delivery of 10 μg/kg/min. Comparative blood gases were done before starting almitrine trial and immediately after the end of the infusion. A positive response to almitrine was defined by an increase of PaO2/FIO2 ratio greater than or equal to 20% at the end of the infusion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 169 patients were enrolled. Thirty-two patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome received an almitrine infusion trial. In most cases, almitrine was infused in combination with inhaled nitric oxide (75%). Twenty-one patients (66%) were responders. The median PaO2/FIO2 ratio improvement was 39% (9-93%) and differs significantly between the responders and nonresponders (67% [39-131%] vs 6% [9-16%], respectively; p < 0.0001). The 28-day mortality rates were 47.6% and 63.6% (p = 0.39) for the responders and nonresponders, respectively. Hemodynamic parameters remained similar before and after the trial, not suggesting acute cor pulmonale. CONCLUSIONS Almitrine infusion improved oxygenation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome without adverse effects. In a multistep clinical approach to manage severe hypoxemia in this population, almitrine could be an interesting therapeutic option to counteract the loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and redistribute blood flow away from shunting zones.","Caplan, Morgan; Goutay, Julien; Bignon, Anne; Jaillette, Emmanuelle; Favory, Raphael; Mathieu, Daniel; Parmentier-Decrucq, Erika; Poissy, Julien; Duburcq, Thibault",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33093279/,339
81030,Teleconsultation and Diabetes Care Amid COVID-19 Pandemic in India: Scopes and Challenges.,2020-05-21,"Low yields of H2O2 and a narrow range of appropriate pH values have been two major drawbacks for electro-Fenton (EF) process. Herein, metal-free electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) were developed with nitrogen and sulfur co-doped electrochemically exfoliated graphene (N, S-EEGr) electrocatalysts, which was confirmed as an outstanding bifunctional catalyst for synchronous generation and activation of H2O2 via (2 + 1) e- consecutive reduction reactions. Specifically, two elements (N, S) in metal-free N, S-EEGr-CF cathode synergize to promote the formation of H2O2 followed by its activation. With N, S-EEGr-CF cathode, phenol of initial 50 mg L-1 could be effectively removed within pH 3-11 and 6.25 mA cm-2, and 100% removal efficiency could be achieved within 15-min even at neutral pH. The pseudo-first-order rate constant for phenol removal in metal-free EAOPs with N,S-EEGr-CF at neutral pH was 10 times higher than that with EF process. Detection of active species, coupled with decay kinetics with specific trapping agents, confirmed that OH was the dominant oxidizing species promoting removal efficiencies of organics (phenol, antibiotics and dyes) at pH 3 and pH 7. In the actual wastewater treatment, the synergistic effect of bifunctional catalyst would also be used for improving the degradation efficiency of organics. Thus, the metal-free EAOPs with N,S-EEGr-CF cathode may serve as an alternative in wastewater treatment with a broadened range of solution pH values and avoiding Fe2+ (catalyst) addition.","Yang, Weilu; Zhou, Minghua; Mai, Lei; Ou, Huase; Oturan, Nihal; Oturan, Mehmet A; Zeng, Eddy Y",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118668/,339

85282,Adoption of a novel surgical innovation into clinical practice: protocol for a qualitative systematic review examining surgeon views.,2018,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in fomites which suggests the virus could be transmitted via inanimate objects. However, there is uncertainty about the mechanistic pathway for such transmissions. Our objective was to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from primary studies and systematic reviews assessing the role of fomites in transmission. Methods: This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We conduct ongoing searches using WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, and Google Scholar; assess study quality based on five criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Results: We found 64 studies: 63 primary studies and one systematic review (n=35). The settings for primary studies were predominantly in hospitals (69.8%) including general wards, ICU and SARS-CoV-2 isolation wards. There were variations in the study designs including timing of sample collection, hygiene procedures, ventilation settings and cycle threshold. The overall quality of reporting was low to moderate. The frequency of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests across 51 studies (using RT-PCR) ranged from 0.5% to 75%. Cycle threshold values ranged from 20.8 to 44.1. Viral concentrations were reported in 17 studies; however, discrepancies in the methods for estimation prevented comparison. Eleven studies (17.5%) attempted viral culture, but none found a cytopathic effect. Results of the systematic review showed that healthcare settings were most frequently tested (25/35, 71.4%), but laboratories reported the highest frequency of contaminated surfaces (20.5%, 17/83). Conclusions: The majority of studies report identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on inanimate surfaces; however, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating the recovery of viable virus. Lack of positive viral cultures suggests that the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through fomites is low. Heterogeneity in study designs and methodology prevents comparisons of findings across studies. Standardized guidelines for conducting and reporting research on fomite transmission is warranted.","Onakpoya, Igho J; Heneghan, Carl J; Spencer, Elizabeth A; Brassey, Jon; Plüddemann, Annette; Evans, David H; Conly, John M; Jefferson, Tom",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.51590.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34136133/,339

However, this result remains unexplained. Thus, the aim of this study was to test if the ankle passive torque and gastrocnemius muscle tension are affected by the hip and the head positions. The torque and the muscle shear elastic modulus (measured by elastography to estimate muscle tension) were collected in nine participants during passive ankle dorsiflexions performed in four conditions (by combining hip flexion at 90 or 150°, and head flexed or neutral). Ankle maximum dorsiflexion angle significantly decreased by flexing the hip from 150 to 90° (P < 0.001; mean difference 17.7 ± 2.5°), but no effect of the head position was observed (P > 0.05). Maximal passive torque and shear elastic modulus were higher with the hip flexed at 90° (P < 0.001). During submaximal ROM, no effects of the head and hip positioning (P > 0.05) were found for both torque and shear elastic modulus at a given common ankle angle among conditions. Shifts in maximal ankle angle due to hip angle manipulation are not related neither to changes in passive torque nor tension of the gastrocnemius. Further studies should be addressed to better understand the functional role of peripheral nerves and fasciae in the ankle ROM limits.","Andrade, R J; Lacourpaille, L; Freitas, S R; McNair, P J; Nordez, A",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.12406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25676048/,339

However, these new techniques should not compromise the safety aspect, which imposes higher demands on the integrity insurance and inspection methods. Phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) provides advanced inspection and evaluation processes, whereas qualification is still needed when applied together with new manufacturing techniques. Numerical modeling, as one of the potential qualification methods, has been developed for decades and should be validated before practical applications.

An experimental platform with a mechanized gantry system, which enables stabilized inspection procedure, is built and applied during the validation work. Good correlations can be seen from the comparisons and this model is concluded as an acceptable alternative to the corresponding experimental work. The relation between depth and beam angle is also noticed and investigated, which is essential to guarantee an accurate inspection.","Lei, Xiangyu; Wirdelius, Håkan; Rosell, Anders",Ultrasonics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultras.2020.106217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645519/,339

87352,Costs associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders and related signs and symptoms in infants: a systematic review protocol.,2016,"PURPOSE Although glucose is the main source of energy for the human brain, ketones play an important role during starvation or injury. The purpose of our study was to investigate the metabolic effects of a novel hypertonic sodium ketone solution in normal animals. METHODS Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (420-570 g) were divided into three groups of five, one control and two study arms. The control group received an intravenous infusion of 3 % NaCl at 5 ml/kg/h. The animals in the two study arms were assigned to receive one of the two formulations of ketone solutions, containing hypertonic saline with 40 and 120 mmol/l beta-hydroxybutyrate, respectively. This was infused for 6 h and then the animal was euthanized and brains removed and frozen. RESULTS Both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) demonstrated strong evidence of a change over time (p < 0.0001). There was also strong evidence of a difference between groups (p < 0.0001). Multiple comparisons showed all these means were statistically different (p < 0.05). Measurement of BHB levels in brain tissue found strong evidence of a difference between groups (p < 0.0001) with control: 0.15 mmol/l (0.01), BHB 40: 0.19 mmol/l (0.01), and BHB 120: 0.28 mmol/l (0.01). Multiple comparisons showed all these means were statistically different (p < 0.05). There were no differences over time (p = 0.31) or between groups (p = 0.33) or an interaction between groups and time (p = 0.47) for base excess. CONCLUSION The IV infusions of hypertonic saline/BHB are feasible and lead to increased plasma, CSF and brain levels of BHB without significant acid/base effects.","White, Hayden; Venkatesh, Balasubramanian; Jones, Mark; Worrall, Simon; Chuah, Teong; Ordonez, Jenny",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-012-2790-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23291733/,339

88005,"The specification, acceptability and effectiveness of respite care and short breaks for young adults with complex healthcare needs: protocol for a mixed-methods systematic review.",2019,"Introduction Hispanics significantly underutilize substance abuse treatment and are at greater risk for poor treatment outcomes and dropout. Two decades of research from the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) offers an opportunity to increase our understanding in how to address the disparities experienced by Hispanics in substance abuse treatment. Methods A scoping review was utilized to determine what has been learned from the CTN about Hispanic populations with substance use disorder. A systematic search was conducted within the CTN Dissemination Library and nine databases. Potentially relevant studies were independently assessed by two reviewers for inclusion. Results Twenty-four studies were included in the review. Results identified issues in measurement, characteristics of Hispanic substance use, effective interventions, and gaps for future research. Characteristics that interfere with treatment participation were also identified including low employment rates, less likelihood of having insurance, lower rates of internet access, and increased travel time to services, as were treatment issues such as high rates of alcohol and tobacco use. Effective interventions were identified; however, the effectiveness of these interventions may be limited to specific factors. Conclusions Despite efforts to improve inclusion of minority populations, Hispanics remain underrepresented in clinical trials. Future research including Hispanic populations should examine measurement equivalence and consider how cultural and historical experiences, as well as patient characteristics, influence utilization of services. Finally, more studies are needed that examine the impact of structural factors that act as barriers to treatment access and engagement and result in significant disparities in treatment outcomes.","Eghaneyan, Brittany H; Sanchez, Katherine; Haeny, Angela M; Montgomery, LaTrice; Lopez-Castro, Teresa; Burlew, A Kathleen; Rezaeizadeh, Afsaneh; Killian, Michael O",Addictive behaviors reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2020.100287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32637563/,339
88440,Emergency Medicine Journal COVID-19 monthly top five.,2021-05-11,"Wind energy, as one of the renewable energies with the most potential for development, has been widely concerned by many countries. However, due to the great volatility and uncertainty of natural wind, wind power also fluctuates, seriously affecting the reliability of wind power system and bringing challenges to large-scale grid connection of wind power. Wind speed prediction is very important to ensure the safety and stability of wind power generation system. In this paper, a new wind speed prediction scheme is proposed. First, improved hybrid mode decomposition is used to decompose the wind speed data into the trend part and the fluctuation part, and the noise is decomposed twice. Then wavelet analysis is used to decompose the trend part and the fluctuation part for the third time. The decomposed data are classified. The long- and short-term memory neural network optimized by the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to train the nonlinear sequence and noise sequence, and the autoregressive moving average model is used to train the linear sequence. Finally, the final prediction results were reconstructed. This paper uses this system to predict the wind speed data of China's Changma wind farm and Spain's Sotavento wind farm. By experimenting with the real data from two different wind farms and comparing with other predictive models, we found that (1) by improving the mode number selection in the variational mode decomposition, the characteristics of wind speed data can be better extracted. (2) According to the different characteristics of component data, the combination method is selected to predict modal components, which makes full use of the advantages of different algorithms and has good prediction effect. (3) The optimization algorithm is used to optimize the neural network, which solves the problem of parameter setting when establishing the prediction model. (4) The combination forecasting model proposed in this paper has clear structure and accurate prediction results. The research work in this paper will help to promote the development of wind energy prediction field, help wind farms formulate wind power regulation strategies, and further promote the construction of green energy structure.","Zhang, Yagang; Li, Ruixuan; Zhang, Jinghui",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13516-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763837/,339

Co-exposure to MWCNTs and heavy metal ions is common during water disposal. However, the hepatotoxicity of co-exposure to MWCNTs and lead ions for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) subjects has not been investigated. NAFLD mice were fed intragastrically with MWCNTs and lead acetate (PbAc). Combined administration of MWCNTs and PbAc significantly damaged the liver function, and aggravated the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis phenotype as well as the hepatic fibrosis and steatosis in NAFLD mice. Furthermore, MWCNTs and PbAc significantly induced apoptosis in primary hepatocytes isolated from NAFLD mice. Combined administration of MWCNTs and PbAc also resulted in hepatic lipid peroxidation by inducing antioxidant defense system dysfunction, and significantly enhanced the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in NAFLD mice livers. Meanwhile, combined administration of MWCNTs and PbAc may exert its hepatotoxicity in the NAFLD via inhibiting the adenosine 5'-monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ (PPARγ) pathway. Taken together, we conclude that co-exposure to MWCNTs and PbAc can remarkably aggravate the hepatotoxicity in NAFLD mice via inhibiting the AMPK/PPARγ pathway. This study may provide a biosafety evaluation for the application of nanomaterials in wastewater treatment.","Liu, Enqin; Wang, Xinghui; Li, Xidong; Tian, Ping; Xu, Hao; Li, Zenglian; Wang, Likun",Aging,https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680977/,339
93742,Comparison of illicit drug related presentations to the emergency department: Pre-Covid vs covid.,2020-08-04,"Zoonotic wildlife diseases pose significant health risks not only to their primary vectors but also to humans and domestic animals. Rabies is a lethal encephalitis caused by rabies virus (RV). This RNA virus can infect a range of terrestrial mammals but each viral variant persists in a particular reservoir host. Active management of these host vectors is needed to minimize the negative impacts of this disease, and an understanding of the immune response to RV infection aids strategies for host vaccination. Current knowledge of immune responses to RV infection comes primarily from rodent models in which an innate immune response triggers activation of several genes and signalling pathways. It is unclear, however, how well rodent models represent the immune response of natural hosts. This study investigates the innate immune response of a primary host, the raccoon, to a peripheral challenge using the raccoon rabies virus (RRV). The extent and temporal course of this response during RRV infection was analysed using genes predicted to be upregulated during infection (IFNs; IFN regulatory factors; IL-6; Toll like receptor-3; TNF receptor). We found that RRV activated components of the innate immune system, with changes in levels of transcripts correlated with presence of viral RNA. Our results suggest that natural reservoirs of rabies may not mimic the immune response triggered in rodent models, highlighting the need for further studies of infection in primary hosts.","Srithayakumar, Vythegi; Sribalachandran, Hariharan; Rosatte, Rick; Nadin-Davis, Susan A; Kyle, Christopher J",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.053942-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24085257/,339

Virulence during Toxoplasma infection in mice is mediated by parasite kinase-dependent antagonism of IFN-γ-induced host resistance. Whether avirulence requires expression of parasite factors that induce host tolerance mechanisms or is a default status reflecting the absence of resistance-interfering factors is not known. In this study, we present evidence that avirulence in Toxoplasma requires parasite engagement of the scavenger receptor CD36. CD36 promotes macrophage tropism but is dispensable for the development of resistance mechanisms. Instead CD36 is critical for re-establishing tissue homeostasis and survival following the acute phase of infection. The CD36-binding capacity of T. gondii strains is negatively controlled by the virulence factor, ROP18. Thus, the absence of resistance-interfering virulence factors and the presence of tolerance-inducing avirulence factors are both required for long-term host-pathogen survival.","Zhao, Yanlin; Reyes, Jojo; Rovira-Diaz, Eliezer; Fox, Barbara A; Bzik, David J; Yap, George S",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2100605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400524/,339

However, varying perspectives on how belonging should be conceptualised, assessed, and cultivated has hampered much-needed progress on this timely and important topic. To address these critical issues, we conducted a narrative review that summarizes existing perspectives on belonging, describes a new integrative framework for understanding and studying belonging, and identifies several key avenues for future research and practice. Method We searched relevant databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, PsycInfo, and ClinicalTrials.gov, for articles describing belonging, instruments for assessing belonging, and interventions for increasing belonging. Results By identifying the core components of belonging, we introduce a new integrative framework for understanding, assessing, and cultivating belonging that focuses on four interrelated components: competencies, opportunities, motivations, and perceptions. Conclusion This integrative framework enhances our understanding of the basic nature and features of belonging, provides a foundation for future interdisciplinary research on belonging and belongingness, and highlights how a robust sense of belonging may be cultivated to improve human health and resilience for individuals and communities worldwide.","Allen, Kelly-Ann; Kern, Margaret L; Rozek, Christopher S; McInereney, Dennis; Slavich, George M",Australian journal of psychology,https://doi.org/10.1080/00049530.2021.1883409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33958811/,339

96797,"Pandemic (H1N1 influenza 2009 and Australian emergency departments: implications for policy, practice and pandemic preparedness.",2012,"BACKGROUND Early life maltreatment (ELM) has a high risk of transmission across generations, known as ""the cycle of abuse."" ELM is also an important risk factor for developing mental disorders, and having a mental disorder increases the risk of child abuse. Both the abuse potential in mothers with ELM and in mothers with a history of mental disorders might be associated with a disturbed mother-child interaction. OBJECTIVE The current study examined differences in emotional availability between mothers with a history of ELM and previous or current mental disorders (non-resilient), mothers with ELM without mental disorders (resilient), and control mothers without ELM and without mental disorders. METHODS Thirty-three non-resilient mothers, 18 resilient mothers, and 37 control mothers and their 5- to 12-year-old children participated in a standardized mother-child interaction task. Videotaped interactions were rated by three independent, trained raters based on the Emotional Availability Scales (EA Scales) and compared between the groups. RESULTS The non-resilient mothers and their children showed reduced maternal sensitivity, structuring, non-intrusiveness, non-hostility, responsiveness, and involvement compared to the resilient mothers and their children and the control mothers and their children (p = 0.006, ηp2 = 0.12). No differences on any of the EA Scales were found between resilient mothers and control mothers. CONCLUSIONS These deficits in mother-child interaction in non-resilient mothers might contribute to mechanisms that could explain the cycle of abuse. Interestingly, resilient mothers, who did not develop a mental disorder despite having experienced ELM, did not show these deficits. Thus, prevention programs promoting resilience might be a key to break the cycle of abuse.","Mielke, Emilia Louisa; Neukel, Corinne; Fuchs, Anna; Hillmann, Karen; Zietlow, Anna-Lena; Bertsch, Katja; Reck, Corinna; Möhler, Eva; Herpertz, Sabine C",Psychopathology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000509904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937629/,339

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its functions remain elusive. Here, we show that the protein levels of GPER1 are negatively associated with those of ERα and that higher expression of GPER1 correlated with a better clinical outcome in oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients. Activation of GPER1 decreases ERα protein levels, which subsequently suppresses ERα-mediated transcription and target gene expression but does not affect its mRNA expression in ER + breast cancer cells. A mechanistic study revealed that GPER1 mediates ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome-dependent degradation of ERα via upregulation of the Cullin3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP), and depletion of SPOP abrogates GPER1-induced ERα ubiquitination and degradation. Functionally, GPER1 activation inhibits 17β-oestradiol (E2)-induced ER + breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and tumour growth in vivo. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which GPER1 negatively modulates the ERα signalling pathway via promoting its ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation, which may contribute to its inhibition of breast cancer progression.","Zhang, Nan; Sun, Peng; Xu, Yuanyuan; Li, Haiyan; Liu, Huatao; Wang, Ling; Cao, Yue; Zhou, Kewen; TinghuaiWang,",Cancer letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2020.10.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069770/,339

BACKGROUND Clinicians, patients, and researchers depend on valid measurements of medication adherence to inform the delivery of preemptive care when needed. Technology is routinely used for monitoring medication adherence in both clinical practice and research, yet there is a dearth of research comparing novel App based approaches to traditional approaches used for assessing medication adherence. METHODS Adherence rates were captured on both the EM and the App for 3697 daily observations from 44 participants with acute coronary syndrome over 90 days immediately following discharge from acute care. For EM, adherence was measured using EM equipped pill bottles. For the App, adherence was measured by having participants upload daily photos to the App prior to taking their daily aspirin. Agreement was assessed using a Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS The mean adherence rate was higher on the App, 92%, than the EM, 78% (p < 0.001). The mean difference in adherence rates between these methods was 14% (95% Confidence Interval: -23%, -5%). CONCLUSIONS These findings illustrate a lack of agreement between technological interventions used for measuring adherence in cardiovascular patient populations, with higher adherence rates observed with the App compared to EM.

METHODS Participants formerly testing positive for COVID-19 completed an online questionnaire measuring COVID-19 infection characteristics and complications, self-reported CR fitness level, physical activity, and sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. Self-reported CR fitness was determined as the pace to cover 4.8 km without becoming overly fatigued (with slow walking, brisk walking, jogging, and running corresponding to low, moderate, good, and excellent levels of fitness, respectively). RESULTS A total of 263 individuals completed the survey.

There is uncertainty about the extent to which PCHDs correspond to hemorrhage or contrast staining. Our aim was to evaluate the use of PCHD density on immediate postinterventional CT, and PCHD evolution on follow-up CT for differentiating contrast staining from hemorrhage after endovascular treatment. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the imaging data of 84 patients who underwent endovascular treatment for acute arterial ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation and who received an immediate postinterventional CT, a follow-up CT within 36 h, and a follow-up MRI within 10 days. RESULTS PCHDs were seen in 62 of 84 patients in a total of 130 Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) areas. A specificity of 100% to predict hemorrhage was only seen for PCHDs with densities <40 HU (for ruling hemorrhage out) and ≥140 HU (for ruling hemorrhage in), at the cost of a low sensitivity of 1.1% and 2.4%, respectively. Persisting PCHDs correlated with hemorrhage with a specificity of 93.3% and a sensitivity of 62.5%. When follow-up CT was performed at least 19 h after the first CT, persisting PCHDs correlated with hemorrhage with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 62.5%. CONCLUSIONS There are no density thresholds for PCHDs that allow predicting the absence or presence of hemorrhage with 100% specificity and acceptable sensitivity. A CT scan performed at least 19-24 h after endovascular therapy is the only reliable method to differentiate contrast staining from hemorrhage.","Dekeyzer, Sven; Nikoubashman, Omid; Lutin, Bart; De Groote, Jeroen; Vancaester, Evelien; De Blauwe, Sofie; Hemelsoet, Dimitri; Wiesmann, Martin; Defreyne, Luc",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27036980/,339

107844,Characteristics of frequent paediatric users of emergency departments in England: an observational study using routine national data.,2020-11-16,"This study focused on mussel-like surface adhesion and photoinduced cooperative deformation of a unique type of Janus particles (JPs), composed of an isosorbide-based molecular glass bearing push-pull type azo chromophore (IAC-4) and a 2,6-pyridinedicarboxamide-containing poly(dimethylsiloxane) oligomer (H2pdca-PDMS). The JPs were obtained by the solvent evaporation method in an aqueous medium with the dispersed phase of a solution of IAC-4 and H2pdca-PDMS in dichloromethane (DCM). The JP formation and its mechanism were investigated by electron microscopy, in situ optical microscopy, and theoretical analysis. The results showed that the Janus structures form through gradual segregation between the two components in the droplets induced by the evaporation of DCM, which follows the ternary phase diagrams calculated according to Flory-Huggins theory. In the following stage, the gradual coalescence of small domains in droplets is controlled by dynamic factors. After being deposited on a substrate, the JPs exhibit unidirectional adhesion with the H2pdca-PDMS parts spreading on the substrate, while the IAC-4 parts orientate away from the substrate. The mussel-like adhesion is caused by the interfacial interaction of H2pdca-PDMS with the hard surfaces (i.e., glass and silicon substrates) and its strong ability to spread and wet the surfaces to increase the contact area with the surfaces. Upon irradiation with linearly and circularly polarized laser beams at 488 nm, respectively, a series of unique surface morphologies are observed because of the photoinduced deformation of the IAC-4 parts along the electric vibration direction of the polarized light and the cooperative deformation of the H2pdca-PDMS parts of the JPs. The cooperative deformation reveals the strong interfacial interaction and cohesiveness between the IAC-4 and the H2pdca-PDMS phases in JPs. No peeling-off from the substrate is observed after the large-scale deformation, which also indicates the strong adhesion of the JPs on the substrate surfaces. This study not only demonstrates the mussel-like adhesion and unique cooperative deformation behavior but also supplies new insights into the interfacial interaction in JPs as well as that with hard surfaces, thus opening a new avenue for surface modification and functionalization.","Liao, Chuyi; Hsu, Chungen; Wang, Xiaogong",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c02733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197317/,339
107848,Estimated glucose disposal rate demographics and clinical characteristics of young adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: A cross-sectional pilot study.,2020,"The spread of pandemic COVID-19 has created unprecedented need for information. The pandemic is the cause of significant mortality and with this the need for rapidly disseminated information for palliative care professionals regarding the prevalence of symptoms, their intensity, their resistance or susceptibility to symptom control and the mode of death for patients. METHODS We undertook a systematic review of published evidence for symptoms in patients with COVID-19 (with a specific emphasis on symptoms at end of life) and on modes of death. Inclusion: prospective or retrospective studies detailing symptom presence and/or cause or mode of death from COVID-19. RESULTS 12 papers met the inclusion criteria and gave details of symptom burden: four of these specifically in the dying and two detailed the cause or mode of death. Cough, breathlessness, fatigue and myalgia are significant symptoms in people hospitalised with COVID-19. Dyspnoea is the most significant symptom in the dying. The mode of death was described in two papers and is predominantly through respiratory or heart failure. CONCLUSIONS There remains a dearth of information regarding symptom burden and mode of death to inform decisions regarding end-of-life care in patients dying with COVID-19. Rapid data gathering on the mode of death and the profile of symptoms in the dying and their prevalence and severity in areas where COVID-19 is prevalent will provide important intelligence for clinicians. This should be done urgently, within ethical norms and the practicalities of a public health, clinical and logistical emergency.","Keeley, Paul; Buchanan, Deans; Carolan, Clare; Pivodic, Lara; Tavabie, Simon; Noble, Simon",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32467101/,339
108189,Healthcare providers' views and experiences of non-specialist palliative care in hospitals: A qualitative systematic review and thematic synthesis.,2020-02-05,"Herpesviruses or herpesviral sequences have been identified in various bat species. Here, we report the isolation, cell tropism, and complete genome sequence of a novel betaherpesvirus from the bat Miniopterus schreibersii (MsHV). In primary cell culture, MsHV causes cytopathic effects (CPE) and reaches peak virus production 2 weeks after infection. MsHV was found to infect and replicate less efficiently in a feline kidney cell, CRFK, and failed to replicate in 13 other cell lines tested. Sequencing of the MsHV genome using the 454 system, with a 224-fold coverage, revealed a genome size of 222,870 bp. The genome was extensively analyzed in comparison to those of related viruses. Of the 190 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), 40 were identified as herpesvirus core genes. Among 93 proteins with identifiable homologues in tree shrew herpesvirus (THV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), or rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV), most had highest sequence identities with THV counterparts. However, the MsHV genome organization is colinear with that of RCMV rather than that of THV. The following unique features were discovered in the MsHV genome. One predicted protein, B125, is similar to human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) U94, a homologue of the parvovirus Rep protein. For the unique ORFs, 7 are predicted to encode major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related proteins, 2 to encode MHC class I homologues, and 3 to encode MHC class II homologues; 4 encode the homologues of C-type lectin- or natural killer cell lectin-like receptors;, and the products of a unique gene family, the b149 family, of 16 members, have no significant sequence identity with known proteins but exhibit immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich domains revealed by three-dimensional (3D) structural prediction. To our knowledge, MsHV is the first virus genome known to encode MHC class II homologues.","Zhang, Huajun; Todd, Shawn; Tachedjian, Mary; Barr, Jennifer A; Luo, Minhua; Yu, Meng; Marsh, Glenn A; Crameri, Gary; Wang, Lin-Fa",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00723-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22623774/,339

110832,Comparison of Changes in Respiratory Dynamics Immediately After the Start of Propofol Sedation With or Without Midazolam.,2018,"Employees around the world have experienced sudden, significant changes in their work and family roles due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, applied psychologists have limited understanding of how employee experiences of work-family conflict and enrichment have been affected by this event and what organizations can do to ensure better employee functioning during such societal crises. Adopting a person-centered approach, we examine transitions in employees' work-family interfaces from before COVID-19 to after its onset. First, in Study 1, using latent profile analysis (N = 379; nonpandemic data), we identify profiles of bidirectional conflict and enrichment, including beneficial (low conflict and high enrichment), active (medium conflict and enrichment), and passive (low conflict and enrichment). In Study 2, with data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we replicate Study 1 profiles and explore whether employees transition between work-family profiles during the pandemic. Results suggest that although many remain in prepandemic profiles, positive (from active/passive to beneficial) and negative (from beneficial to active/passive) transitions occurred for a meaningful proportion of respondents. People were more likely to go through negative transitions if they had high segmentation preferences, engaged in emotion-focused coping, experienced higher technostress, and had less compassionate supervisors. In turn, negative transitions were associated with negative employee consequences during the pandemic (e.g., lower job satisfaction and job performance, and higher turnover intent). We discuss implications for future research and for managing during societal crises, both present and future.

110972,Interventions for pregnant women who use tobacco and other substances: a systematic review protocol.,2019-11-11,"Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling psychiatric disorder characterized by disturbances of thought, cognition, and behavior. Despite massive research efforts to date, the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia remain largely unknown. The difficulty of brain research is largely a result of complex interactions between contributory factors at different scales: susceptible gene variants (molecular scale), synaptopathies (synaptic, dendritic, and cell scales), and alterations in neuronal circuits (circuit scale), which together result in behavioral manifestations (individual scale). It is likely that each scale affects the others, from the microscale to the mesoscale to the macroscale, and vice versa. Thus, to consider the intricate complexity of schizophrenia across multiple layers, we introduce a multi-scale, hierarchical view of the nature of this disorder, focusing especially on N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). The reason for placing emphasis on NMDAR is its clinical relevance to schizophrenia, as well as its diverse functions in neurons, including the robust supralinear synaptic integration provided by N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate (NMDA) spikes and the Ca2+ permeability of the NMDAR, which facilitates synaptic plasticity via various calcium-dependent proteins. Here, we review recent evidence implicating NMDARs in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia from the multi-scale perspective. We also discuss recent advances from optical techniques, which provide a powerful tool for uncovering the mechanisms of NMDAR synaptic pathology and their relationships, with subsequent behavioral manifestations.","Hyun, Jo Soo; Inoue, Takafumi; Hayashi-Takagi, Akiko",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10081172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796766/,339

111047,The lab without walls: a deployable approach to tropical infectious diseases.,2013,"The vast majority of human tumors with p53 mutations undergo loss of the remaining wildtype p53 allele (loss-of-heterozygosity, p53LOH). p53LOH has watershed significance in promoting tumor progression. However, driving forces for p53LOH are poorly understood. Here we identify the repressive WTp53-HSF1 axis as one driver of p53LOH. We find that the WTp53 allele in AOM/DSS chemically-induced colorectal tumors (CRC) of p53R248Q/+ mice retains partial activity and represses heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1), the master regulator of the proteotoxic stress response (HSR) that is ubiquitously activated in cancer. HSR is critical for stabilizing oncogenic proteins including mutp53. WTp53-retaining CRC tumors, tumor-derived organoids and human CRC cells all suppress the tumor-promoting HSF1 program. Mechanistically, retained WTp53 activates CDKN1A/p21, causing cell cycle inhibition and suppression of E2F target MLK3. MLK3 links cell cycle with the MAPK stress pathway to activate the HSR response. In p53R248Q/+ tumors WTp53 activation by constitutive stress represses MLK3, thereby weakening the MAPK-HSF1 response necessary for tumor survival. This creates selection pressure for p53LOH which eliminates the repressive WTp53-MAPK-HSF1 axis and unleashes tumor-promoting HSF1 functions, inducing mutp53 stabilization enabling invasion.","Isermann, Tamara; Şener, Özge Çiçek; Stender, Adrian; Klemke, Luisa; Winkler, Nadine; Neesse, Albrecht; Li, Jinyu; Wegwitz, Florian; Moll, Ute M; Schulz-Heddergott, Ramona",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24064-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34188043/,339

More than 7 million world population have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the number of deaths is increasing every day. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients with an acute respiratory infection (ARI). During an outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2, the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 909 hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia, including 517 (56.9%) males and 392 (43.1%) females. All the collected samples were from different cities of Khuzestan province from 19 February to- 27 March 2020. The RNA was extracted from samples and subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2. Simultaneously, the computerized tomography (CT) scan was tested for the presence of ground-glass opacity in the lung among the patients. Of the total number of 909 specimens, 328 (36.08%) cases, including 185 (20.35%) females and 143 (15.73%) males, were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 while, 581 (63.9%) cases, including 374 (41.14%) males and 207 (22.77%) were negative for the SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR (p=0.001).Four hundred sixteen (45.76%) cases were positive for ground-glass opacity in the lung by CT scan, while 328/909 (36.08%) trials proved positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the real-time PCR (p=0.003). In this study, 36.08% of patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2.

The minute-to-minute increasing coronavirus cases (>85 M) and progressive deaths (≈1.8 M) calls for finding a cure to this devastating pandemic. While there have been many attempts to find biologically active molecules targeting SARS-CoV-2 for treatment of this viral infection, none has found a way to the clinic yet. In this study, a 3-feature structure-based pharmacophore model was designed for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro) that plays a vital role in the viral cellular penetration. High throughput virtual screening of the lead-like ZINC library was then performed to find a potent inhibitor employing the predesigned pharmacophore. In-silico pharmacokinetics/toxicity prediction study was subsequently applied towards the best hits. Finally, a 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was carried out for the best hit and compared to the co-crystallized ligand where the hit compound displayed high binding and comparable interactions. The results identified new hits for SARS-CoV-2 MPro inhibition showing good docking score, pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile, drug-likeness, high binding energy in addition to a promising synthetic accessibility. Identifying new small compounds as potential leads for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 is a very important step towards designing a synthesizing of promising drug candidates.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The genome sequences of GD and aGD were also compared and the effects of mutations in the S gene were observed. The results revealed that aGD strain showed no obvious pathogenicity with superior protective efficacy against TW-like and QX-like virulent IBV strains. The genomes of strains aGD and GD shared high similarity (99.87 %) and most of the mutations occurred in S gene. Recombinant IBV strain rGDaGD-S, in which the S gene was replaced with the corresponding regions from aGD, showed decreased pathogenicity compared with its parental strain.

OBJECTIVE To examine the role of the nasopharyngeal microbiome in the development of childhood wheezing illnesses following RSV ARI in infancy. METHODS We conducted a nested cohort study of 118 previously healthy, term infants with confirmed RSV ARI by RT-PCR. We used next-generation sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene to characterize the nasopharyngeal microbiome during RSV ARI. Our main outcome of interest was 2-year subsequent wheeze. RESULTS Of the 118 infants, 113 (95.8%) had 2-year outcome data. Of these, 46 (40.7%) had parental report of subsequent wheeze. There was no association between the overall taxonomic composition, diversity, and richness of the nasopharyngeal microbiome during RSV ARI with the development of subsequent wheeze. However, the nasopharyngeal detection and abundance of Lactobacillus was consistently higher in infants who did not develop this outcome. Lactobacillus also ranked first among the different genera in a model distinguishing infants with and without subsequent wheeze.

Data mining in combination with bioinformatics has provided a scaffold linking all these disciplines to the design of vaccines and vaccine adjuvants. Areas covered: This review provides background knowledge on immunological aspects which have been exploited with informatics for the in silico analysis of immune responses and the design of vaccine antigens. Furthermore, the article presents various databases and bioinformatics tools, and discusses B and T cell epitope predictions, antigen design, adjuvant research and systems immunology, highlighting some important examples, and challenges for the future. Expert opinion: Informatics and data mining have not only reduced the time required for experimental immunology, but also contributed to the identification and design of novel vaccine candidates and the determination of biomarkers and pathways of vaccine response. However, more experimental data is required for benchmarking immunoinformatic tools. Nevertheless, developments in immunoinformatics and reverse vaccinology, which are nascent fields, are likely to hasten vaccine discovery, although the path to regulatory approval is likely to remain a necessary impediment.","Hegde, Nagendra R; Gauthami, S; Sampath Kumar, H M; Bayry, Jagadeesh",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2018.1413088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29226722/,339

HCV elimination in Italy will be possible if immediate action is taken. A health policy was implemented beginning in 2021, consisting of screening among key populations and birth cohorts (1969-1989), estimated to have a high prevalence of undiagnosed individuals. The active screening requires regional governance that manages the processes' complexity integrating a well-organized network between territory assistance and hospital to achieve an effective HCV care cascade. This document aims to support the regional decision-making process by defining paths for screening and linkage-to-care. Implementing active screening strategies beyond a risk-based approach is required as a General Practitioners' task. Simplified paths must be drawn for the key populations screening. The infrastructure built for COVID-19 vaccination could be used also for HCV screening. According to a multidisciplinary care delivery, screening should be supplemented with rapid linkage-to-care and treatment of newly diagnosed patients. The realization of the proactive screening during the first two years is vital because it will define the tracks for the whole HCV cost-effective screening of 1948-1988 birth cohorts in Italy.","Kondili, Loreta A; Aghemo, Alessio; Andreoni, Massimo; Galli, Massimo; Rossi, Alessandro; Babudieri, Sergio; Nava, Felice; Leonardi, Claudio; Mennini, Francesco Saverio; Gardini, Ivan; Russo, Francesco Paolo",Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2021.03.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33926816/,339

123952,T helper type 2 bias and type 17 suppression in primary dengue virus infection in infants and young children.,2013,"Perillyl alcohol (POH) has been extensively studied for the treatment of peripheral and primary brain tumors. The intranasal route of administration has been preferred for dosing POH in early-stage clinical trials associated with promising outcomes in primary brain cancer. However, it is unclear how intranasal POH targets brain tumors in these patients. Multiple studies indicate that intranasally applied large molecules may enter the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through direct olfactory and trigeminal nerve-associated pathways originating in the nasal mucosa that bypass the blood-brain barrier. It is unknown whether POH, a small molecule subject to extensive nasal metabolism and systemic absorption, may also undergo direct transport to brain or CSF from the nasal mucosa. Here, we compared CSF and plasma concentrations of POH and its metabolite, perillic acid (PA), following intranasal or intravascular POH application. Samples were collected over 70 min and assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Intranasal administration resulted in tenfold higher CSF-to-plasma ratios for POH and tenfold higher CSF levels for PA compared to equal dose intravascular administration. Our preclinical results demonstrate POH undergoes direct transport from the nasal mucosa to the CSF, a finding with potential significance for its efficacy as an intranasal chemotherapeutic for brain cancer.","Nehra, Geetika; Andrews, Shannon; Rettig, Joan; Gould, Michael N; Haag, Jill D; Howard, Steven P; Thorne, Robert G",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85293-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737566/,339

125684,SECUre: a multicentre survey of the safety of emergency care in UK emergency departments.,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND The aseptic meningitis caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation was less described in the literature, most of which were detected by means of polymerase chain reaction. The authors presented 4 adult immunocompetent patients with acute aseptic meningitis with VZV infection diagnosed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). CASE PRESENTATION Four patients were admitted to the hospital with headache and fever between March 2018 and August 2019. The median ages were 37 years (range 22-52 years). The median symptoms onset to clinic time was 3.5 days (range 3-6 days). Two patients had signs of meningeal irritation. Rash occurred after the meningitis symptoms in 1 patient (time from meningitis symptoms to rash, 2 days). No other sign or symptom was reported. The brain Magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography were normal in all patients. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained at a median of 4 days (range 3-7 days) from the meningitis symptoms onset. Opening pressure of lumbar puncture after admission were high in these cases (median 256 mm H2O; range 165-400 mm H2O). White blood cell counts and protein levels were significantly elevated in CSF samples (median 317 × 10^6/L, range 147-478 × 10^6/L; median 1.41 g/L, range 0.57-1.79 g/L). The cytology of CSF demonstrated a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and most multinuclear cells. The culture of CSF was negative for all 4 cases, while T-cell spot test was positive for 2 cases, who were administrated with anti-tuberculosis treatment for suspicious tuberculous meningitis. NGS of CSF (the Vision Medical Research Institute) detected specific sequences of VZV in the 4 cases within 72 h after admission. The inappropriate treatment were stopped while acyclovir were continued intravenously for 10-14 days. All patients recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS VZV is an infectious agent that causes aseptic meningitis in immunocompetent adults and could not be accompanied by skin manifestations. The NGS of CSF is a rapid detection for the identification and differentiation of meningitis in patients, which is of great importance for providing the rapid and accurate diagnosis and the targeted antimicrobial therapy for central nervous system infection.","Chen, Lanlan; Xu, Yao; Liu, Chunfeng; Huang, Hong; Zhong, Xingxing; Ma, Cancan; Zhao, Haina; Chen, Yingzhu",BMC infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05155-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32571239/,339

A systematic review protocol.,2020-07-02,"BACKGROUND Acrochordons are benign hypertrophic lesions of the skin of which the pathophysiology is unclear. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to examine the association of acrochordons with autoimmune disorders in patients with a poor obstetric history. METHODS This retrospective cohort involved 350 female patients with poor obstetric history who were included in a preconceptional care program to investigate risk factors for obstetric complications. These patients were further investigated for the co-existence of autoimmune disorders (defined by either a diagnosis of autoimmune diseases or autoimmune antibody positivity) and acrochordons. RESULTS An autoimmune disorder was present in 55.7% (195/350) of the patients. The rate of acrochordons was significantly higher in patients with autoimmune disorders (n= 195) compared to the control group (n= 155) (8.21% versus 2.58%, respectively) (p= 0.043). When the autoimmune disease positive (n= 58) and autoimmune antibody-positive (n= 137) groups were separately analyzed, acrochordons were found more frequently in the autoimmune disease group (p= 0.004). However, there was no statistically significant co-occurrence of autoimmune antibody positivity and the presence of skin tags (p= 0.135). CONCLUSION There may be immune system-related biological mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of acrochordons. Preconceptional counseling is beneficial for women with poor obstetric history and acrochordons.","Beksac, Burcu; Donmez, Hanife Guler; Cagan, Murat; Unal, Canan; Fadiloglu, Erdem; Beksac, Mehmet Sinan",Human antibodies,https://doi.org/10.3233/hab-200426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831198/,339

We adopt the data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the terrestrial flow of people between cities from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics database in two scales: cities from Brazil, without the North region, and from the São Paulo State. Grounded on the complex networks approach, and considering that the mobility network serves as a proxy for the SARS-CoV-2 spreading, the nodes and edges represent cities and flows, respectively. Network centrality measures such as strength and degree are ranked and compared to the list of cities, ordered according to the day that they confirmed the first case of COVID-19. The strength measure captures the cities with a higher vulnerability of receiving new cases. Besides, it follows the interiorization process of SARS-CoV-2 in the São Paulo State when the network flows are above specific thresholds. Some countryside cities such as Feira de Santana (Bahia State), Ribeirão Preto (São Paulo State), and Caruaru (Pernambuco State) have strength comparable to states' capitals. Our analysis offers additional tools for understanding and decision support to inter-cities mobility interventions regarding the SARS-CoV-2 and other epidemics.","Freitas, Vander Luis de Souza; Konstantyner, Thais Cláudia Roma de Oliveira; Mendes, Jeferson Feitosa; Sepetauskas, Cátia Souza do Nascimento; Santos, Leonardo Bacelar Lima",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00184820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33027475/,339
126234,Are Wireless Electronic Stethoscopes Useful for Respiratory Rate Monitoring During Intravenous Sedation?,2018,"OBJECTIVE To assess the utility of computed tomographic (CT) perfusion for selection of patients for endovascular therapy up to 18 hours after symptom onset. METHODS We conducted a multicenter cohort study of consecutive acute stroke patients scheduled to undergo endovascular therapy within 90 minutes after a baseline CT perfusion. Patients were classified as ""target mismatch"" if they had a small ischemic core and a large penumbra on their baseline CT perfusion. Reperfusion was defined as >50% reduction in critical hypoperfusion between the baseline CT perfusion and the 36-hour follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS Of the 201 patients enrolled, 190 patients with an adequate baseline CT perfusion study who underwent angiography were included (mean age = 66 years, median NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS] = 16, median time from symptom onset to endovascular therapy = 5.2 hours). Rate of reperfusion was 89%. In patients with target mismatch (n = 131), reperfusion was associated with higher odds of favorable clinical response, defined as an improvement of ≥8 points on the NIHSS (83% vs 44%; p = 0.002, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 6.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1-20.9). This association did not differ between patients treated within 6 hours (OR = 6.4, 95% CI = 1.5-27.8) and those treated > 6 hours after symptom onset (OR = 13.7, 95% CI = 1.4-140).

Nevertheless, most patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, and about 5% can develop more severe symptoms and involve hypovolemia and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In a pathophysiological perspective, severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by numerous dependent pathways triggered by hypercytokinemia, especially IL-6 and TNF-alpha, leading to systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability, and multiple organ dysfunction. Systemic endotheliitis and direct viral tropism to proximal renal tubular cells and podocytes are important pathophysiological mechanisms leading to kidney injury in patients with more critical infection, with a clinical presentation ranging from proteinuria and/or glomerular hematuria to fulminant AKI requiring renal replacement therapies. Glomerulonephritis, rhabdomyolysis, and nephrotoxic drugs are also associated with kidney damage in patients with COVID-19. Thus, AKI and proteinuria are independent risk factors for mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature emphasizing the impact of acute kidney involvement in the evolutive prognosis and mortality of patients with COVID-19.","Pecly, Inah Maria D; Azevedo, Rafael B; Muxfeldt, Elizabeth S; Botelho, Bruna G; Albuquerque, Gabriela G; Diniz, Pedro Henrique P; Silva, Rodrigo; Rodrigues, Cibele I S",Jornal brasileiro de nefrologia : 'orgao oficial de Sociedades Brasileira e Latino-Americana de Nefrologia,https://doi.org/10.1590/2175-8239-jbn-2020-0204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34057983/,339

METHODS Between July 2011 and March 2013, a prospective randomized trial was conducted involving 127 patients (mean age 67.3±10.2 years; 94 men) with symptomatic VAOS randomly assigned to treatment with SES + EPD (Precise RX or RX Acculink stent + Spider FX EPD; n=61) or BES (Palmaz Blue or Resolute RX; n=66) without EPD. In-stent restenosis (ISR) >50% detected by duplex ultrasound was the primary endpoint. Technical success, clinical success, complications within 30 days, and signal intensity abnormalities on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) after stenting were compared. RESULTS The 30-day technical success rate was 95.5% (63/66) for SES+EPD vs 100% (70/70) for BES without EPD (p=0.072). DWI at 24 hours poststenting showed 2 hyperintense lesions in 2 (3.3%) SES + EPD cases and 15 hyperintense lesions in 13 (18.6%) BES patients (p<0.01). At a mean 18-month follow-up, the clinical success rate was 93.9% (62/66) for the SES + EPD group vs 85.7% (60/70) for the BES group (p=0.115). The ISR was seen in 16/70 (22.9%) arteries in the BES group and 2/66 (3.1%) arteries in SES + EPD group (p<0.01). Target vessel revascularization was performed in 7 (10.0%) BES arteries vs none in the SES + EPD group (p<0.01). CONCLUSION SES with EPD in the treatment of symptomatic VAOS is technically feasible and safe, with low rates of ISR and significantly reduced thromboembolic events on imaging when compared to BES without EPD.","Geng, Xiaokun; Hussain, Mohammed; Du, Huishan; Zhao, Liang; Chen, Jian; Su, Wei; Ma, Linlin; Gao, Zongen; Ding, Yuchuan; Ji, Xunming",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602815579406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25862360/,339

The severe insomnia group presented higher levels of worry and cognitive avoidance strategies. Insomnia was also associated with daytime concerns. The group without insomnia was more vigorous in their academic engagement. Being physically active was associated with lower sleep problems. Insomnia prevalence is high in socially isolated university students. Cognitive avoidance coping strategies are associated with worry, which leads to an alert state that makes sleep difficult.

We aimed to determine if behavioural responses in a food neophobia test (exposure to a novel total mixed ration) reflected boldness and exploratory personality traits derived from 3 traditional tests (open field, novel human and novel object) in dairy calves. We performed two Principal Component Analyses, one using behaviours from 3 traditional tests (3 factors: 'Bold', 'Exploratory' and 'Active'), and one using behaviours from the food neophobia test (3 factors: 'Eating', 'Inspecting', and 'Avoidance'). A regression analysis determined if individual factor scores from the food neophobia test predicted factor scores from the traditional tests. Contrary to our expectations, 'Avoidance' (latencies to approach and eat the novel food) did not predict boldness trait, and the factors 'Inspecting' (time spent inspecting food and empty buckets) and 'Eating' (time spent eating food and total intake) did not predict exploration trait, but they did predict active trait. These results suggest that the food neophobia test in our study resulted in context-specific behaviours, or that behavioural responses to a novel food present different underlying personality traits. The application of food neophobia to assess specific or generalized personality traits of dairy calves deserves further work.","Costa, Joao H C; Neave, Heather W; Weary, Daniel M; von Keyserlingk, Marina A G",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63930-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346003/,339

Preoperative neurological abnormalities as well as sequelae of the open heart operations required to correct structural abnormalities of the heart contribute to these deficits. There are few studies examining the neurocognitive functioning of adults with CHD. This study sought to investigate multiple domains of neurocognitive functioning in adult survivors of CHD who had childhood cardiac surgery with either moderate or severe disease complexity. DESIGN A total of 48 adults (18-49 years of age) who had undergone cardiac surgery for CHD prior to five years of age participated in the study. CHD severity was classified as moderate or severe according to the 32nd Bethesda Guidelines. A computerized battery of standardized neurocognitive tests (CNS-Vital Signs), a validated rating scale of executive functioning, and demographic questionnaires were administered. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the moderate CHD group and normative data on any cognitive measure. In contrast, the severe CHD group differed from norms in multiple domains: psychomotor speed, processing speed, complex attention, reaction time, and on the overall neurocognitive index. Number of surgeries was strongly related to worse executive functioning. There was no association between age at first surgery or time since last surgery and neuropsychological functioning. Number of surgeries was also unrelated to neurocognitive test performance. CONCLUSIONS Patients with severe CHD performed significantly worse on measures of processing speed, attention, and executive functioning. These findings may be useful in the long-term care of adults with congenital heart disease.","Klouda, Leda; Franklin, Wayne J; Saraf, Anita; Parekh, Dhaval R; Schwartz, David D",Congenital heart disease,https://doi.org/10.1111/chd.12409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27650247/,339

Each step of FC measurement can influence the results, leading to misinterpretations and potentially impacting the management of IBD patients. To date, there is high heterogeneity between FC measurements and no current method is universally accepted as a standard. AIMS Our aim was to provide clear position statementsabout the pre-analytical and the analytical phases of FC measurement to homogenize FC levels and to minimize variability and risk of misinterpretation through aninternational consensus. MATERIALS & METHODS Fourteen physicians with expertise in the field of IBD and FC from 11 countries attended a virtual international consensus meeting on July 17th, 2020. A systematic literature was conducted and the literature evidence was shared and discussedamong the participants. Statements were formulated, discussed, and voted. Statements were considered approved if all participants agreed. RESULTS Nine statements were formulated and approved. Based on the available evidence, quantitative tests should be preferred for measuring FC. Furthermore, FC measurement, if possible, should always be performed with the same method and factors influencing FC levels should be taken into account when interpreting the results. DISCUSSION FC has an increasingly important role in the management of patients with IBD. However, large multicenter studies should be conducted to define the reproducibility and to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of the available FC tests. CONCLUSION FC concentrations guide clinicians' treatment decisions. Our statements have a relevant impact in daily practice and could be applied in clinical trials to standardize FC measurement.","D'Amico, Ferdinando; Rubin, David T; Kotze, Paulo Gustavo; Magro, Fernando; Siegmund, Britta; Kobayashi, Taku; Olivera, Pablo A; Bossuyt, Peter; Pouillon, Lieven; Louis, Edouard; Domènech, Eugeni; Ghosh, Subrata; Danese, Silvio; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",United European gastroenterology journal,https://doi.org/10.1002/ueg2.12069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33961734/,339

Because of advances in nursing, medicine, and science, nurses' work is quite different today than it was in 1918. Yet two facts remain the same: In the setting of a pandemic of a dangerous virus for which there are few proven treatments and no vaccine, skilled nursing care is critical to patient outcomes; and support from federal, state, and local governments, community organizations, and volunteers is as important now as it was in 1918.","Keeling, Arlene W",Nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.nurse.0000756352.39139.16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34108413/,339
140235,Using Data and Modeling to Understand the Risks of In-Person Education.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Stenting and flow diversion for aneurysmal sub arachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) require the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). OBJECTIVE To investigate whether DAPT is associated with hemorrhagic complication following placement of external ventricular drains (EVD) in patients with aSAH. METHODS Rates of radiographically identified hemorrhage associated with EVD placement were compared between patients who received DAPT for stenting or flow diversion, and patients who underwent microsurgical clipping or coiling and did not receive DAPT by way of a backward stepwise multivariate analysis. RESULTS Four hundred forty-three patients were admitted for aSAH management. Two hundred ninety-eight patients required placement of an EVD. One hundred twenty patients (40%) were treated with stent-assisted coiling or flow diversion and required DAPT, while 178 patients (60%) were treated with coiling without stents or microsurgical clipping and did not receive DAPT. Forty-two (14%) cases of new hemorrhage along the EVD catheter were identified radiographically. Thirty-two of these hemorrhages occurred in patients on DAPT, while 10 occurred in patients without DAPT. After multivariate analysis, DAPT was significantly associated with radiographic hemorrhage [odds ratio: 4.92, 95% confidence interval: 2.45-9.91, P = .0001]. We did not observe an increased proportion of symptomatic hemorrhage in patients receiving DAPT (10 of 32 [31%]) vs those without (5 of 10 [50%]; P = .4508). CONCLUSION Patients with aSAH who receive stent-assisted coiling or flow diversion are at higher risk for radiographic hemorrhage associated with EVD placement. The timing between EVD placement and DAPT initiation does not appear to be of clinical significance. Stenting and flow diversion remain viable options for aSAH patients.","Hudson, Joseph S; Prout, Benjamin S; Nagahama, Yasunori; Nakagawa, Daichi; Guerrero, Waldo R; Zanaty, Mario; Chalouhi, Nohra; Jabbour, Pascal; Dandapat, Sudeepta; Allan, Lauren; Ortega-Gutierrez, Santiago; Samaniego, Edgar A; Hasan, David",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyy127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29660038/,339

142799,Implementation of interventions targeting the uptake of genetic testing services for breast cancer risk: protocol for a systematic review.,2020-06-28,"BACKGROUND From March 2020, the support and care systems for caregivers and people with dementia (PWD) were suspended or dramatically changed due to the lockdown during the world pandemic of COVID-19. Thus, these changes in living conditions have had deleterious consequences on the behavior of PWD and subsequently on their caregivers' mental health, the two being linked. OBJECTIVE Our study aimed to examine changes in behavior among PWD and to look for associations between the evolution of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and caregivers' mental health in the context of COVID-19. METHODS The study was conducted among caregivers of PWD living at home in France. Caregivers were interviewed via an anonymous cross-sectional online survey during the first lockdown between April 15 and June 15, 2020. RESULTS Three hundred and eighty-nine caregivers accompanying a relative living at home participated in the study; 43.3%of the PWD presented a worsening of BPSD during the lockdown. With multivariate logistic regressions, a significant association was observed between ""more BPSD"" and burden, anxiety and depression, between ""BPSD equivalent"" and anxiety and depression, and between ""emerging BPSD"" and only depression. CONCLUSION The lockdown seems to have an impact on behavioral disorders in PWD and these disorders are associated with poorer mental health of caregivers. Our findings suggest attention should be given to caregivers of PWD who have BPSD before lockdown and the need for continued consultations and professional help in case of new lockdowns.","Pongan, Elodie; Dorey, Jean-Michel; Borg, Céline; Getenet, Jean Claude; Bachelet, Romain; Lourioux, Charles; Laurent, Bernard; Rey, Romain; Rouch, Isabelle",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-201396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33646163/,339
145046,Delirium screening tools validated in the context of palliative care: A systematic review.,2021-02-16,"The temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) consistently emerges in other-regarding behavior, including in tasks probing affective phenomena such as morality and empathy. Yet the TPJ is also recruited in processes with no affective or social component, such as visuo-spatial processing and mathematical cognition. We present serendipitous findings from a perceptual decision-making task on a bistable stimulus, the Necker Cube, performed in an MRI scanner. The Necker cube is a transparent, wire-frame cube that evokes spontaneous switches in perception. Individuals can view the cube from below or from above, though a consistent bias is shown towards seeing the cube from above. We replicate this behavioral bias, finding participants spend more time in the from-above percept. However, in testing for BOLD differences between percept orientations, we find robust responses in bilateral TPJ for the from-above > from-below perceptual state. We speculate that this neural response comes from the sensory incongruence of viewing an object from above while lying supine in the scanner. We further speculate that the TPJ resolves this incongruence by facilitating an egocentric projection. Such a function would explain the TPJ's ubiquitous response to other-regarding, visuo-spatial and mathematical cognition, as all these phenomena demand an ability to ambulate through the coordinate space. Our findings suggest the TPJ may not play a specific role in social or moral components of other-regarding behavior such as altruism and further indirectly suggest that ""pure"", allocentric altruism may not correlate with the TPJ. Results further have implications on how the TPJ may be modulated by activities such as flight or drone operation. Finally, this study highlights the need to ensure stimuli are congruent with a supine position in neuroimaging studies.","Loued-Khenissi, Leyla; Preuschoff, Kerstin",Neuropsychologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2020.107654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069790/,339

Problematic eating behaviors are likely to be impacted by the pandemic through multiple pathways. This study examined the relationships between stress related to lockdown measures and binge eating and dietary restriction in a population of French students during the first week of confinement. Methods A sample of undergraduate students (N = 5,738) completed an online questionnaire 7 days after lockdown measures were introduced. The survey comprised variables related to lockdown measures and the COVID-19-pandemic, mood, stress, body image, binge eating and dietary restriction during the past 7 days, as well as intent to binge eat and restrict in the following 15 days. Results Stress related to the lockdown was associated with greater likelihood of binge eating and dietary restriction over the past week and intentions to binge eat and restrict over the next 15 days. Greater exposure to COVID-19-related media was associated with increased eating restriction over the past week. Binge eating and restriction (past and intentions) were associated with established risk factors, including female gender, low impulse regulation, high body dissatisfaction, and having a concurrent probable eating disorder. Discussion and conclusion The higher the stress related to the first week of confinement, the higher the risk of problematic eating behaviors among students, particularly those characterized by eating-related concerns. Screening for risk factors and providing targeted interventions might help decrease problematic eating behaviors among those who are most vulnerable.","Flaudias, Valentin; Iceta, Sylvain; Zerhouni, Oulmann; Rodgers, Rachel F; Billieux, JoËl; Llorca, Pierre-Michel; Boudesseul, Jordane; de Chazeron, Ingrid; Romo, Lucia; Maurage, Pierre; Samalin, Ludovic; BÈgue, Laurent; Naassila, Mickael; Brousse, Georges; Guillaume, Sébastien",Journal of behavioral addictions,https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2020.00053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32976112/,339

Despite this, service providers indicate that Indigenous peoples are less likely to seek support than non-Indigenous peoples. Little is known about the reasons for this, particularly from the perspective of Indigenous people themselves. In this scoping review, we explore the views Indigenous peoples have on help seeking for FV. Online databases, Google Scholar, and reference lists were searched for relevant studies. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied so that only original studies where the Indigenous voice was specifically sought were chosen. Fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria including qualitative and mixed-methods research. Studies were conducted in the Americas, New Zealand, Australia, and India. Overall, findings suggest that Indigenous peoples are reluctant to engage in help-seeking behaviors for FV. Data were inductively organized into three main themes reflecting this reluctance: tendency to avoid help seeking (acknowledging the barriers of shame, tight-knit communities, and inappropriate service responses causing mistrust and fear), turning to informal support networks, and help is sought when crisis point is reached. We conclude that to overcome barriers for Indigenous peoples seeking help for FV, improving service providers response to FV through training and more research about what works is required; these activities need to be informed by both male and female Indigenous voices.","Fiolet, Renee; Tarzia, Laura; Hameed, Mohajer; Hegarty, Kelsey","Trauma, violence & abuse",https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838019852638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31146652/,339
147330,Cancer care disparities in the LGBT community.,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND Adolescents in the Western Cape Province of South Africa had high force of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection (14% per annum) and high TB incidence (710 per 100,000 person-years) in 2005. We describe subsequent temporal changes in adolescent TB disease notification rates for the decade 2005-2015. METHOD We conducted an analysis of patient-level adolescent (age 10-19 years) TB disease data, obtained from an electronic TB register in the Breede Valley sub-district, Western Cape Province, South Africa, for 2005-2015. Numerators were annual TB notifications (HIV-related and HIV-unrelated); denominators were mid-year population estimates. Period averages of TB rates were obtained using time series modeling. Temporal trends in TB rates were explored using the Mann-Kendall test. FINDINGS The average adolescent TB disease notification rate was 477 per 100,000 for all TB patients (all-TB) and 361 per 100,000 for microbiologically-confirmed patients. The adolescent all-TB rate declined by 45% from 662 to 361 per 100,000 and the microbiologically-confirmed TB rate by 38% from 492 to 305 per 100,000 between 2005-2015, driven mainly by rapid decreases for the period 2005-2009. There was a statistically significant negative temporal trend in both all-TB (per 100,000) (declined by 48%; from 662 to 343; p = 0·028) and microbiologically confirmed TB (per 100,000) (declined by 49%; from 492 to 252; p = 0·027) for 2005-2009, which was not observed for the period 2009-2015 (rose 5%; from 343 to 361; p = 0·764 and rose 21%; from 252 to 305; p = 1·000, respectively). INTERPRETATION We observed an encouraging fall in adolescent TB disease rates between 2005-2009 with a subsequent plateau during 2010-2015, suggesting that additional interventions are needed to sustain initial advances in TB control.","Bunyasi, Erick Wekesa; Mulenga, Humphrey; Luabeya, Angelique K K; Shenje, Justin; Mendelsohn, Simon C; Nemes, Elisa; Tameris, Michele; Wood, Robin; Scriba, Thomas J; Hatherill, Mark",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609738/,339
147874,Using Virtual Learning to Build Pediatric Palliative Care Capacity in South Asia: Experiences of Implementing a Teleteaching and Mentorship Program (Project ECHO).,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND Performing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) anatomy is technically challenging. Device-assisted enteroscopy and laparoscopic-assisted methods suffer from high failure rates and/or post-procedural complications. A novel endoscopic technique termed EUS-Directed Transgastric ERCP (EDGE) or Gastric Access Temporary for Endoscopy (GATE) has recently emerged, demonstrating excellent technical and therapeutic success. The technique involves endoscopic ultrasound-guided deployment of a lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) to gain access into the remnant stomach to facilitate standard ERCP. In this case series, we describe our center's experience and unique approach with the GATE procedure and discuss several key strategies and differences. METHODS Patients underwent the GATE procedure via a novel algorithmic approach. Key information on procedural details, technical and clinical success, follow-up, and adverse events was prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS 10 patients underwent the GATE procedure from May 2017 to March 2018. Technical and clinical success were both 100%. Gastric and jejunal access points for LAMS deployment were 30% and 70%, respectively. Total procedure time per patient, including LAMS deployment, ERCP, and all follow-up procedures, averaged 2.37 ± 0.63 h. 2 out of 10 patients (20%) had adverse events that were resolved either intra-procedurally or after repeat endoscopy with no long-term complications and none requiring surgery. For patients with complete follow-up (n = 7), access tract closure rate was 100% with the aid of a temporary plastic double pigtail stent to facilitate closure. CONCLUSIONS GATE appears to be a safe and effective procedure and may be considered the preferred approach to ERCP in patients with RYGB anatomy at centers with LAMS experience. The procedure offers more definitive and higher range of ERCP interventions compared to traditional methods and is associated with fewer adverse events. Improvements in strategies and methods with the GATE technique may reduce risks and improve outcomes.","Wang, Thomas J; Thompson, Christopher C; Ryou, Marvin",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-06715-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805786/,339

Although there has been an increasing use of service dogs among children and youth their impact has not yet been synthesized. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this article was to conduct a systematic review assessing the impact of service dogs on children, youth and their families. METHODS Systematic searches of seven international databases from 1985 to 2020 led to 29 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Using a narrative synthesis review approach we analyzed these studies regarding their sample characteristics, methods, results and quality of evidence. RESULTS There were 29 studies in our review that included 1121 children and youth (or parents representing them) that spanned across six countries over a 32-year period. Although the outcomes of the impact of service dogs varied across the studies, 23/29 of them reported an improvement in at least one of the following: physical health (i.e., diabetes management, seizure management, mobility), psychological health (i.e., quality of life, safety, behavior, stress, anxiety, self-confidence and independence), social well-being (i.e., social interactions, school and work) and dog-owner-bond. Children, youth and their parents also described several challenges in owning a service dog. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight that service dogs have potential to provide many benefits for children, youth and their families.

151184,Access Block in Australian Emergency Departments 2017-2020.,2021-01-27,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-encapsulated particles released by eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells into the extracellular environment. Depending on their origin, size, and composition, EVs are grouped in several classes, with one of them being exosomes, which are small EVs (SEVs) generated within the endosomal compartment of eukaryotic cells via the unique multivesicular body pathway. Being able to deliver their content (proteins, lipids, small molecules, and nucleic acids) to other cells, exosomes/SEVs are considered as bioactive vesicles with multiple biological functions. Importantly, the composition of exosomes/SEVs depends on the cell and tissue of origin including a set of specific proteins. However, the pathological conditions may lead to the appearance of diseases-specific exosomes/SEVs containing pathology-specific cargoes utilized in the malicious cell-cell communication and spread of malady. Viruses demonstrate complex 'dancing' around the exosome biogenesis system, being able to hijack the host systems responsible for the exosome biogenesis. They use the exosome biogenesis system to promote packaging of their capsids, regulate virion production, and virus secretion. They also utilize a Trojan horse stratagem to place virions inside the SEVs and thereby to spread beyond their normal range of cell hosts using the normal EV uptake process. Another illustration of the virus-based utilization of Trojan horse strategy is given by the ability of human viruses to use exosomes/SEVs as carriers of their exogenous miRNA or viral proteins to the non-infected cells. Taken together, these strategies of dancing with Trojan horses can help viruses to fight with the host defense and to spread the infection.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 20 client-owned dogs with VWD (n = 16) or FVII deficiency (4). PROCEDURES Dogs with VWD or FVII deficiency that underwent laparoscopic ovariohysterectomy or ovariectomy between 2012 and 2014 were retrospectively identified via a multi-institutional review of medical records. RESULTS Median expression of von Willebrand factor was 19% (interquartile range, 18% to 30%). All 16 dogs with VWD were Doberman Pinschers, and all were pretreated with desmopressin; 4 also received cryoprecipitate. One of 4 dogs with FVII deficiency received plasma preoperatively, and 1 was treated with desmopressin; 2 dogs received no preoperative treatment. Laparoscopic ovariectomy was performed in 9 dogs with VWD and 2 dogs with FVII deficiency, laparoscopic ovariectomy with gastropexy was performed in 6 dogs with VWD and 1 dog with FVII deficiency, and laparoscopic-assisted ovariohysterectomy was performed in 1 dog with VWD and 1 dog with FVII deficiency. Iatrogenic splenic laceration requiring conversion to laparotomy occurred during trocar insertion in 1 dog with VWD. No postoperative complications, including signs of hemorrhage, were reported for any dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Laparoscopic ovariohysterectomy or ovariectomy in dogs with VWD or FVII deficiency pretreated with desmopressin, cryoprecipitate, or plasma transfusions were not associated with clinical signs of hemorrhage, suggesting that minimally invasive ovariohysterectomy or ovariectomy may be considered in female dogs affected with these coagulopathies.","Keeshen, Thomas P; Case, J Brad; Runge, Jeffrey J; Singh, Ameet; Mayhew, Philipp D; Steffey, Michele A; Culp, William T N",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.251.9.1053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29035661/,339
151958,Reflections from an emergency department junior doctor: the Covid legacy.,2020-06-15,"OBJECTIVES Surgical resection of nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) invading the cavernous sinus (CS) remains a challenging and significant factor associated with incomplete resection. The residual tumor in CS is usually treated with adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), but there is little information concerning SRS as an initial treatment for CS-invading NFPA. In this study, we investigated the tumor control rate and clinical outcomes of the patients who received primary gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for CS-invading NFPA. METHODS This was a single-institute retrospective analysis of 11 patients. CS invasion of tumor was categorized using the modified Knosp grading system. The median tumor volume and maximal diameter were 1.6 cm3 (range 0.4-6.5) and 17.2 mm (range 11.6-23.3), respectively. The median clinical follow-up period was 48.5 months (range 16.4-177.8). The median prescription dose at tumor margin was 15 Gy (range 11-25) and median prescription isodose was 50% (range 45-50). The maximum radiation dose to optic chiasm and optic nerve were 7.2 Gy (range 3.4-9.2) and 7.5 Gy (range 4.5-11.5), respectively. RESULTS Tumor control was achieved in all patients. The median tumor volume and maximal diameter at last follow-up were 0.4 cm3 (range 0.1-2.3) and 11.4 mm (range 4.7-19.5), respectively. The median volume reduction rate was 52% (range 33-88). Six patients showed downgrading of modified Knosp grade after GKRS. No patients developed GKRS-related complications such as hypopituitarism or visual disturbance. CONCLUSIONS SRS may be an alternative primary treatment option for CS-invading NFPA if there is no urgent and absolute indication for surgery such as optic apparatus compression.","Lee, Won Jae; Cho, Kyung-Rae; Choi, Jung-Won; Kong, Doo-Sik; Seol, Ho Jun; Nam, Do-Hyun; Lee, Jung-Il",Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1159/000508737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937617/,339

Lidocaine is a non-selective inhibitor of voltage gated sodium channels (VGSC) with potential anti-tussive effects, but randomized placebo-controlled studies evaluating its efficacy in RCC are lacking. OBJECTIVE To investigate the efficacy of nebulized lidocaine and lidocaine throat spray versus matched placebos in RCC. METHODS A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study, comparing the effect of single doses of nebulized lidocaine with lidocaine delivered by a throat spray and matched placebo. The primary endpoint was cough frequency over the 10 hours following treatment. Secondary endpoints were visual analogue scores (VAS) for urge-to-cough and cough severity; an exploratory analysis evaluated hourly cough rates up to 5 hours after treatment. RESULTS Twenty-six subjects with RCC were recruited [22 females, mean (S.D) age 53.5±12.1 years, FEV1 %predicted 105.2±16.8 L, FVC %predicted 112.4±18L]. Lidocaine throat spray, but not nebulized lidocaine, significantly reduced 10-hour cough frequency as compared to placebo (throat spray 22.6 coughs/hour, nebulization 26.9 coughs/hour, and placebos 27.6 coughs/hour, p=0.04,). Lidocaine throat spray showed the greatest effect on cough compared to placebo in the first hour after administration (31.7 coughs/hour vs 74.2 coughs/hour, p=0.004). Both nebulizer and spray treatments significantly alleviated urge-to-cough and cough severity VAS compared with placebo (p <0.05). There were no serious adverse events associated with lidocaine therapy. CONCLUSION Lidocaine throat spray was effective in reducing cough frequency in RCC patients. VGSC inhibitors applied to pharynx have potential as therapies for RCC.","Abdulqawi, Rayid; Satia, Imran; Kanemitsu, Yoshihiro; Khalid, Saifudin; Holt, Kimberley; Dockry, Rachel; Woodcock, Ashley A; Smith, Jaclyn A",The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

Structured light plethysmography (SLP) is a contactless technique of respiratory function testing that measures tidal breathing parameters by assessing thoracoabdominal displacement. METHODS In a postdischarge clinic, SLP was performed routinely on 110 hospitalised patients recovering from COVID-19 who had been screened for respiratory symptoms to confirm any respiratory changes occurring after the disease. Patients were categorised based on their hospital treatment in (1) the intensive therapy unit (ITU) (requiring intubation) (n=65) or (2) respiratory wards only (n=45). Data from these two patient cohorts were compared with preacquired data from healthy controls (n=30). RESULTS We have found a significantly increased respiratory rate (p=0.006) in ITU patients compared with the healthy cohort and also a significant decrease in the inspiratory time (p=0.01), expiratory time (p=0.005) and the total breathing cycle (p=0.008). There were no significant differences between ITU and ward patients and no significant differences in healthy compared with ward patients. We examined the variability of breathing ('entropy') both in terms of the breath-to-breath interval and the volume-to-volume change. The breath-to-breath interval alone was significantly lower in ITU patients compared with healthy cohorts (p=0.02). CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that abnormalities in tidal breathing can be detected in COVID-19 recovery patients, and SLP may be a promising tool in assessing the aftermath of diseases such as COVID-19, particularly if more intensive management strategies such as mechanical ventilation are required.","Alhuthail, Eyas; Stockley, James; Coney, Andrew; Cooper, Brendan",BMJ open respiratory research,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2021-001070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642224/,339

We have assessed the feasibility, timing, and short-term oncological outcome of laparoscopic TME after LCRT. METHODS Between 2004 and 2006, 30 patients were selected for LCRT based on clinical examination and MRI. Patients received 3/4 field radiotherapy, 45-50.4 Gy in 25-28 fractions during 5 weeks with either 5-fluorouracil or Uftoral. Clinical assessments were made 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy and then 2 weekly with sequential 4 weekly MRI, to individualize the timing of surgery at maximal response. Laparoscopic TME was performed using a standard technique. RESULTS Thirty patients received LCRT and 26 patients (21 men; median age, 63 years) underwent laparoscopic TME at 11 weeks (median) after LCRT. Median operating time was 270 min. Sixteen patients had LAR and ten had APR. There were three conversions. Three patients developed anastomotic leak (18.7%): one was managed conservatively and one patient died of septicemia. Morbidity was seen in 19% of patients. There were 25 (96%) R0 resections with a complete response in 5 (19%) cases and microscopic tumor in lakes of mucin (Tmic) in another 6 (23%). Two patients (7.6%) developed local recurrence (median follow up, 34 months). The median time interval between radiotherapy and surgery was 11 (range, 7-13) weeks, which was based on serial MRI scans after LCRT. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic TME after LCRT is feasible and safe both oncologically and surgically. Serial MRI helps to determine the optimum timing of surgery.","Motson, Roger W; Khan, J S; Arulampalam, T H A; Austin, R C T; Lacey, N; Sizer, B",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1353-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21533976/,339
157661,"Diabetes, race, and amputations.",2021-04-03,"Bats are the only mammals that use highly developed laryngeal echolocation, a sensory mechanism based on the ability to emit laryngeal sounds and interpret the returning echoes to identify objects. Although this capability allows bats to orientate and hunt in complete darkness, endowing them with great survival advantages, the genetic bases underlying the evolution of bat echolocation are still largely unknown. Echolocation requires high-frequency hearing that in mammals is largely dependent on somatic electromotility of outer hair cells. Then, understanding the molecular evolution of outer hair cell genes might help to unravel the evolutionary history of echolocation. In this work, we analyzed the molecular evolution of two key outer hair cell genes: the voltage-gated potassium channel gene KCNQ4 and CHRNA10, the gene encoding the α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit. We reconstructed the phylogeny of bats based on KCNQ4 and CHRNA10 protein and nucleotide sequences. A phylogenetic tree built using KCNQ4 amino acid sequences showed that two paraphyletic clades of laryngeal echolocating bats grouped together, with eight shared substitutions among particular lineages. In addition, our analyses indicated that two of these parallel substitutions, M388I and P406S, were probably fixed under positive selection and could have had a strong functional impact on KCNQ4. Moreover, our results indicated that KCNQ4 evolved under positive selection in the ancestral lineage leading to mammals, suggesting that this gene might have been important for the evolution of mammalian hearing. On the other hand, we found that CHRNA10, a gene that evolved adaptively in the mammalian lineage, was under strong purifying selection in bats. Thus, the CHRNA10 amino acid tree did not show echolocating bat monophyly and reproduced the bat species tree. These results suggest that only a subset of hearing genes could underlie the evolution of echolocation. The present work continues to delineate the genetic bases of echolocation and ultrasonic hearing in bats.","Liu, Yang; Han, Naijian; Franchini, Lucía F; Xu, Huihui; Pisciottano, Francisco; Elgoyhen, Ana Belén; Rajan, Koilmani Emmanuvel; Zhang, Shuyi",Molecular biology and evolution,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msr310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22319145/,339

Interleukin (IL)-35 is a novel anti-inflammatory cytokine with therapeutic properties in diseases whose pathogenesis is associated with the Th17/Treg imbalance; however, its role during periodontitis has not been established yet. This study aimed to elucidate whether IL-35 inhibits the alveolar bone resorption during periodontitis by modulating the Th17/Treg imbalance. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice with ligature-induced periodontitis were treated with locally or systemically administrated IL-35. As controls, periodontitis-affected mice without IL-35 treatment and non-ligated mice were used. Alveolar bone resorption was measured by micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy. The Th17/Treg-pattern of the immune response was analyzed by qPCR, ELISA, and flow cytometry. RESULTS IL-35 inhibited alveolar bone resorption in periodontitis mice. Besides, IL-35 induced less detection of Th17 lymphocytes and production of Th17-related cytokines, together with higher detection of Treg lymphocytes and production of Treg-related cytokines in periodontitis-affected tissues. CONCLUSION IL-35 is beneficial in the regulation of periodontitis; particularly, IL-35 inhibited alveolar bone resorption and this inhibition was closely associated with modulation of the periodontal Th17/Treg imbalance.","Cafferata, Emilio A; Terraza-Aguirre, Claudia; Barrera, Romina; Faúndez, Nicolás; González, Nicolás; Rojas, Carolina; Melgar-Rodríguez, Samanta; Hernández, Marcela; Carvajal, Paola; Cortez, C; González, Fermín E; Covarrubias, Cristian; Vernal, R",Journal of clinical periodontology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpe.13282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32160331/,339

In short, it is putting a gigantic spanner in the works of neoliberal governance, in the process exposing the widening cracks and fissures of what I have called the 'fractured society'. I begin by recalling Garfinkel's notion of the breaching experiment and by listing the principal attributes of the fractured society. I then explore the response to the coronavirus in the UK, from the government's initial commitment to 'herd immunity' to its present policy of 'muddling through'. The bulk of the remainder of this contribution addresses precisely how this global health crisis shines a harsh and unforgiving searchlight on the strategies and policies pursued by governments in the UK since 2010, and most especially after the passing of the Health and Social Care Act of 2012. In the closing paragraphs, I examine possible scenarios for a post-fractured society, making particular use of Fraser's concepts on 'reactionary' versus 'progressive populism', and conclude with a comment on sociology and engagement.","Scambler, Graham",Health sociology review : the journal of the Health Section of the Australian Sociological Association,https://doi.org/10.1080/14461242.2020.1784019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411650/,339

As of late August 2021, recommendations on the use of these vaccines in children vary across different countries. Recommendations are more uniform for vaccines in young adults, but vaccination uptake in this age group shows a large range across countries. Mandates for vaccination of university students are a particularly debated topic with many campuses endorsing mandates in the USA in contrast to European countries, at least as of August 2021. The commentary discusses the potential indirect impact of vaccination of youth on the COVID-19 burden of disease for other age groups and societal functioning at large, estimates of direct impact on reducing fatalities and non-lethal COVID-19-related events in youth, estimates of potential lethal and non-lethal adverse events from vaccines, and differential considerations that may exist in the USA, European countries, and non-high-income countries. Decision-making for deploying COVID-19 vaccines in young people is subject to residual uncertainty on the future course of the pandemic and potential evolution towards endemicity. Rational recommendations would also benefit from better understanding of the clinical and sociodemographic features of COVID-19 risk in young populations, and from dissecting the role of re-infections and durability of natural versus vaccine-induced immunity.","Ioannidis, John P A",European journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529274/,339

Designing software is one of the least understood software engineering activities. In a collaborative design setting, various types of distances can lead to challenges and effects that potentially affect how software is designed. Objective: To contribute to a better understanding of collaborative software design, we investigate how geographic distance affects its design thinking and the creativity of its discussions. Method: To this end, we conducted a multiple-case study exploring the design thinking and creativity of co-located and distributed software developers in a collaborative design setting. Results: Compared to co-located developers, distributed developers spend less time on exploring the problem space, which could be related to different socio-technical challenges, such as lack of awareness and common understanding. Distributed development does not seem to affect the creativity of their activities. Conclusion: Developers engaging in collaborative design need to be aware that problem space exploration is reduced in a distributed setting. Unless distributed teams take compensatory measures, this could adversely affect the development. Regarding the effect distance has on creativity, our results are inconclusive and further studies are needed.","Jolak, Rodi; Wortmann, Andreas; Liebel, Grischa; Umuhoza, Eric; Chaudron, Michel R.V.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11903v1.pdf,339

Pulse rate and blood oxygen are two parameters that doctors use to diagnose and measure Pneumonia and Bronchitis. Sensors for their measurement are widely available in developed countries, but their costs are prohibitively high for wide penetration in developing countries. Hardware prototypes incorporated with embedded software and IoT have been developed previously, but their costs have not been brought down sufficiently for wide penetration. We developed and tested the performance of an Atmel ATmega 328P MCU and MAX30100 sensor kit-based pulse rate and blood oxygen monitor. We applied the device on 12 subjects and compared the data with a commercially available, Rossmax SB150 pulse oximeter.

172459,"Evaluating implementation of LEAPS, a youth-led early childhood care and education intervention in rural Pakistan: protocol for a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial",2021-04-17,"Traditionally, manipulation has been considered as an act that necessarily takes place somewhere in the background, in secret, ""backstage"", in the dark, so to speak, in the ""unconscious"" part of our social actions. Such an understanding of manipulation thus suggests, psychoanalytically, that manipulation is fundamentally constituted by a logic of the unconscious, which must be suppressed, concealed, and camouflaged, something that resists being easily uncovered. However, in the post-communication era manipulation has taken a step further. Encouraged by big data technologies, pseudo-communication strategies, digital factories of fake news and lies, pseudo-journalism, industries of viral mystification, fabricating and disinforming media, and by related complex systems of deceiving, disguising, blurring, simulating, falsifying, distorting, diverting, mispackaging, deforming, misrepresenting and misusing the reality that have colonised all spheres of social life, from politics, business, media, mass communications industry, public sphere to interpersonal communication, manipulation has recently taken on a new form: that of deep manipulation. This term aims at the increasing, intense and omnipresent naturalisation of manipulation, which has brutally invaded the territories of communication between people at both individual and collective levels, moulding it into its tool. In such a world of perverted communication, the goal of using communication is not ""plain communication"" but the constant production of manipulation by performing it as our ""new communication"". But this is not the end of the story of deep manipulation operating both in depth and at the capillary level, both individually and globally. Against this complex background, another, transparent version of manipulation has evolved, whose key ideological effect is undermining the ability to see manipulation as manipulation, that is, as an excess of communication. Transparent manipulation is dangerously imposed as our new ""natural communicational condition"", or even, invigorated by its unscrupulous visibility, as our ""new communicational conscious"". In other words, it is an accelerated mystifying system that has not only enabled Trump to become Trump, but is able to produce, multiply, and legitimate countless other Trumps in our lives. This insight serves as a starting point to outline a brief history of manipulation, develop a critique of the economism of manipulation, and reveal the psychoanalytical mechanism behind such visible manipulation. The paper not only shows why it is easy to become trapped in the post-communication quagmire, but also why deep manipulation, even in its most transparent version, is a threat to the democratic potentials of communities and societies.","Kotnik, Vlado",Italian Sociological Review,https://doi.org/10.13136/isr.v11i2.447,339

177203,Current Provision and HCP Experiences of Remote Care Delivery and Diabetes Technology Training for People with Type 1 Diabetes in the UK during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Background: Mobile electrocardiogram (mECG) devices are being used increasingly, supplying recordings to providers and providing automatic rhythm interpretation. Given the intermittent nature of certain cardiac arrhythmias, mECGs allow instant access to a recording device. In the COVID-19 pandemic, ways to limit in-person patient interactions and avoid overwhelming emergency and inpatient services would add value. Our goal was to evaluate whether a mECG device would reduce healthcare utilization overall, particularly those of urgent nature. Objective: To evaluate whether the use of a mobile ECG device would lead to decreased urgent healthcare utilization in individuals with symptomatic arrhythmias. Methods: We identified a cohort of KardiaMobile (AliveCor, USA) mECG users and compared their healthcare utilization 1 year prior to obtaining the device and 1 year after device activation. Results: 128 patients were studied (mean age 64, 47% female). Mean duration of follow-up pre-intervention was 9.78 months. 123 of 128 individuals completed post-intervention follow-up. Patients were less likely to have cardiac monitors ordered (30 vs 6;p&lt;0.01), outpatient office visits (525 vs 382;p&lt;0.01), cardiac-specific ED visits (51 vs 30;p&lt;0.01), arrhythmia related ED visits (45 vs 20;p&lt;0.01), and unplanned arrhythmia admissions (34 vs 11;p&lt;0.01) in the year after obtaining a KardiaMobile device compared to the year prior. Conclusion: Mobile technology is available for heart rhythm monitoring and can give feedback to the user. This study showed a reduction of in-person healthcare utilization with mECG device use. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, strategies to limit unnecessary patient contact have value. The use of mECG devices can decrease the risk of exposure to patient and provider from COVID-19, avoid overwhelming emergency and inpatient services during the pandemic, and may decrease healthcare costs. Given the increases in healthcare costs in recent years, methods to safely and effectively limit cost are needed. One possible strategy could be the use of mECG devices.","Johnson, D.

COVID-19 is transmitted through airborne droplets formed during coughing and sneezing and from the saliva of infected patients. Medical healthcare workers are often at risk of infection. This study measured the aerosol derived from the droplets of patients during the conversation. Methods: Overall, 25 patients aged 21 to 87 years were enrolled. The amount of droplets from the patient was measured under the following four conditions: 1) no conversation with the mask on;2) conversation with the mask on;3) conversation without the mask;and 4) no conversation without the mask. Particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) and PM with a diameter of 10 μm or less (PM10) were measured as representative aerosols at a position of 1 meter from the patients. Results: The concentrations of PM2.5 (μg/m3) were as follows: 22.7 ± 10.2 before the conversation with the mask, 24.2 ± 10.2 during the conversation with the mask, 32.3 ± 14.7 during the conversation without the mask, and 23.1 ± 9.9 after the conversation without the mask. The concentrations of PM10 (μg/m3) were as follows: 39.8 ± 18.2 before conversation with the mask, 41.9 ± 18.5 during conversation with the mask, 55.5 ± 27.2 during conversation without the mask, and 40.4 ± 17.8 after conversation without the mask. The variations in the PM2.5 and PM10 correlated negatively with the age of patients (PM2.5: R = -0.51, p = 0.0009 and PM10: R = -0.53, p = 0.0063).

Hierarchical maps, coding matrices, and concept maps were used to aid direct content analysis for theme detection. Results Five primary themes emerged, including shopping barriers (existing compounded with new), coping strategies, impact on mental and emotional health, social comparison, and unintended consequences of COVID-19 on WIC families. Conclusions COVID-19 created additional barriers to food security among WIC families and negatively affected their health and well-being. To meet the needs of this vulnerable population during and beyond the pandemic, the carryover of WIC flexibilities (ie, physical presence and food package substitution waivers) after COVID-19 may improve the ease of overall program participation.","McElrone, M.; Zimmer, M.

181226,Emergency medicine clerkship goes online: Evaluation of a telesimulation programme,2021,"Biomass fast pyrolysis was performed in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor that incorporated two crucial innovations. A fractional condensation train provided dry bio-oils with only 1% of moisture and much reduced acidity. Autothermal pyrolysis with partial oxidation enhanced dry bio-oil quality while reducing the capital and operating costs by eliminating the need for external heating. Both endothermic pyrolysis with pure N2 and autothermal pyrolysis with oxidant fluidization gases were carried out at 500 degrees C. Dry bio-oils of birch wood, birch bark or hydrolysis lignin, from both endothermic and autothermal pyrolysis, could substitute up to 65 % of phenol in reacting with formaldehyde to produce wood adhesives that met the international standard specifications on mechanical strength and formaldehyde emissions. Therefore, autothermal pyrolysis did not harm the bio-oil quality for phenol substitution. Dry bio-oil from autothermal pyrolysis of kraft lignin was able to replace 80 % of the phenol.","Li, D.

This period was chosen to assess the behavior of data in the past so that it can be an indicator for decision-making for the future. To achieve this goal, the Quantitative Threshold Autoregressive method is used to predict data behavior so that the relationship between data can be seen in order to forecast economic growth when investing in health and education. This study focuses on secondary data sourced from the World Bank, including data on Malaysian gross domestic product, health investment in Malaysia and investment in education. We find that education and health are very important means of investing in human capital to drive economic growth. Education and health have the potential to be the two means of awakening and developing and restoring the economy during a pandemic and post-pandemic period. Education is a human resource development mechanism. However, education will be difficult to improve human performance without support from health. Education and health support each other in improving economic performance in Malaysia.","Widarni, E. L.; Wilantari, R.

Our aim is to create an international registry about NENs patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 positivity to give a worldwide representation of the situation. Methods: This is an observational retrospective/prospective multicenter survey based on a direct email invitation. All types of NEN are eligible except SCLC and MiNEN. Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria from March 1st, 2020 up to the end pf pandemic will be recruited. Electronic CRFs are filled out using the REDCap database. Local Institutional Review Board approval is required before data entry. Results: Eighty-one centers, 24 in and 57 outside Italy, representing 39 countries and 5 continents, were contacted. Fourteen centers did not respond and 15 declined the invitation. Among the remaining 52, 6 centers are currently recruiting and 8 are active but not recruiting yet. As of the current abstract submission deadline, 67 patients have been included, mostly GEP-NET (75%), nonfunctioning (86%), metastatic (85%) and on active treatment [47% somatostatin analogs (SSAs), 10% everolimus, 12% tirosin-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), 10% peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), 15% chemotherapy]. Median age at NEN diagnosis was 57 years whilst the median age at SARSCoV-2 diagnosis was 62 years. Almost all patients reported COVID-19-related symptoms, more commonly fever (67% of patients), cough (55%) and dyspnea (51%), in 28% of cases exertional and in 22% at rest. More than one third of patients (n, 24) had a pneumonia. The most common therapies for COVID-19 were antibiotics, steroids and hydroxychloroquine. Eleven patients (16%) needed oxygen therapy, three (4%) sub-intensive care and none intensive care. Fifty-six patients (84%) clinically recovered, six (9%) with sequelae, whereas five (7%) died. Among these latter 4 had a NET and 1 a NEC, and no patients have been receiving chemotherapy. With regard to the anti-tumor therapy no change occurred in 66% of patients, temporary interruption in 30%, and definitive discontinuation in 3%, 2% missing. Conclusions: Most of the NEN patients completely recovered from COVID-19, in many cases without any antitumor therapy adjustment. No clear correlations were observed with type, primary site and treatment of NEN. The recruitment is ongoing.","Spada, F.; Gervaso, L.; La Salvia, A.; Garcia-Carbonero, R.; Hernando, J.; Capdevila, J.; Hofland, J.; De Herder, W.; Koumarianou, A.; Rossi, M.; Boselli, S.; Tamayo, D.; Bagnardi, V.; Laffi, A.; Rubino, M.; Sonbol, M.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS The study evaluated patients' clinical state with the Diagnostic Interview for Psychoses (DIP), and assessed language and communication disturbances (LCD) with the RL-CC-SR in all participants (213 healthy controls (HC), 83 SZ patients, 31 SZ first-degree relatives). Data from the current sample of SZ (n=50), and HC (n=213) was analysed to calculate the relationships between LCD, social and clinical variables using descriptive statistics methods, T-test and Pearson's correlations (SPSS-26, 2019). RESULTS The quotient scores (<6) and raw scores on all three CC-SR subscales demonstrated prominent LCD in SZ: (i) language structure (LS) (SZ:11.92±8.01, HC:7.54±5.91; p<0.001), (ii) pragmatic skills (PS) (SZ:11.30±10.07, HC:8.71±7.39; p=0.040), (iii) social engagement (SE) (SZ:31.94±11.76, HC:19.42±10.35; p<0.001). In SZ, Pearson correlations of LS scores were significant for the DIP-items Odd Speech (p=0.033), and Social Engagement - Blunted Affect (p=0.042). PS was related to early disease onset (p=0.027), poor premorbid work adjustment (p=0.003), along with LS (p=0.005), and was also linked to poor premorbid social adjustment (p=0.005). CONCLUSIONS SZ patients are aware of their LCD at all levels of language structure, pragmatics, and nonverbal communication, but are unable to compensate. Disturbances of LS and PS in SZ patients relate to their poor social adjustment and functioning, and may prove to be associated with the primary negative symptoms domain of the disorder and its generally poor outcome.","Smirnova, Daria; Zhukova, Svetlana; Izmailova, Olga; Fedotov, Ilya; Osadshiy, Yurii; Shustov, Alexander; Spikina, Anna; Ubeikon, Dmitriy; Yashikhina, Anna; Petrova, Natalia; Badcock, Johanna; Morgan, Vera; Jablensky, Assen",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890370/,339

Typical presenting symptoms are akin to those of ordinary pneumonia. Young patients start with fever, chills, malaise, headache, or myalgia; cough and dyspnoea follow. Older persons and those taking corticosteroids may have neither fever nor respiratory symptoms. Exceptional suspicion is needed to identify SARS early in the illness. During an outbreak, even patients with low suspicion of SARS should be promptly isolated, and all contacts quarantined. Health workers need training in the use of appropriate barriers against droplets and other body fluids. Any fever cluster in patients or carers requires immediate action: discharges, visits, and transfers between wards and hospitals should be stopped. Halting hospital admissions and ten-day quarantine of suspected cases create wide buffer zones. To counter a possible resurgence of SARS, a system of prepared isolation and quarantine facilities is important.","Oh, Vernon M S; Lim, T K",Clinical medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14601945/,339

Turkey astroviruses were found in 83.67% of the cases and turkey astrovirus 2 (TAst-2) in 26.53%. The investigations directly demonstrated the high prevalence of turkey parvovirus (TuPV) in 23 flocks (46.9%) experiencing signs of ED, making this pathogen the second most identified after astroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis on a 527 base pair-long region from the NS1 gene revealed two main clusters, a chicken parvovirus (ChPV) and a TuPV group, but also the presence of a divergent branch of tentatively named ""TuPV-like ChPV"" strains. The 23 Hungarian TuPV strains were separately positioned in two groups from the American origin sequences in the TuPV cluster. An Avail-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay has also been developed for the quick differentiation of TuPV, ChPV, and divergent TuPV-like ChPV strains. As most detected enteric viruses have been directly demonstrated in healthy turkey flocks as well, the epidemiology of this disease complex remains unclear, suggesting that a certain combination of pathogens, environmental factors, or both are necessary for the development of clinical signs.","Palade, Elena Alina; Demeter, Zoltán; Hornyák, Akos; Nemes, Csaba; Kisary, János; Rusvai, Miklós",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22017049/,339

Apoptosis was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxytransferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) techniques. By electron microscopy and double-labelling techniques, apoptosis was detected primarily in uninfected bystander cells in the continuous cell line rather than the PRRSV-infected cells. In the lungs, the apoptotic cells were predominantly alveolar and pulmonary intravascular macrophages, and mononuclear cells in the alveolar septa. In the lymph nodes, the apoptotic cells were predominantly tingible body macrophages and mononuclear cells. The induction of apoptosis in a large number of mononuclear cells in the lungs and lymph nodes appears to be a mechanism of PRRSV pathogenesis and might be an explanation for a dramatic reduction in the number of alveolar macrophages and circulating lymphocytes and monocytes in PRRSV-infected pigs.","Sirinarumitr, T; Zhang, Y; Kluge, J P; Halbur, P G; Paul, P S",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9880013/,339

YMV showed the most variable CP relative to eight other potyviruses. This high variability was structured into nine distant molecular groups, as revealed by phylogenetic analyses and validated by assessment of the molecular evolutionary noise. No correlation was observed between the CP and 3'-UTR diversities and phylogenies. The most diversified and divergent groups included isolates from Africa. The remaining groups clustered in a single clade and a geographical distinction between isolates from the Caribbean, South America and Africa was observed. The role of the host in the selection of particular isolates was illustrated by the case of a divergent cultivar from Burkina Faso. Phylogenetic topological incongruence and complementary statistical tests highlighted the fact that recombination events, with single and multiple crossover sites, largely contributed to the evolution of YMV. We hypothesise an African origin of YMV from the yam complex D. cayenensis-D. rotundata, followed by independent transfers to D. alata and D. trifida during virus evolution.","Bousalem, M; Douzery, E J; Fargette, D",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10640564/,339
200706,Emergency department visits and readmissions after COVID-19 hospitalization: a cross-sectional analysis,2021,"OBJECTIVES To compare the diagnostic accuracy of emergency department (ED) physicians with the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition in a large community-based SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) cohort. METHODS This was a cohort study of all patients from Hong Kong's Amoy Garden complex who presented to an ED SARS screening clinic during a 2-month outbreak. Clinical findings and WHO case definition criteria were recorded, along with ED diagnoses. Final diagnoses were established independently based on relevant diagnostic tests performed after the ED visit. Emergency physician diagnostic accuracy was compared with that of the WHO SARS case definition. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios were calculated using standard formulae. RESULTS During the study period, 818 patients presented with SARS-like symptoms, including 205 confirmed SARS, 35 undetermined SARS and 578 non-SARS. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 91%, 96% and 94% for ED clinical diagnosis, versus 42%, 86% and 75% for the WHO case definition. Positive likelihood ratios (LR+) were 21.1 for physician judgement and 3.1 for the WHO criteria. Negative likelihood ratios (LR-) were 0.10 for physician judgement and 0.67 for the WHO criteria, indicating that clinician judgement was a much more powerful predictor than the WHO criteria. CONCLUSIONS Physician clinical judgement was more accurate than the WHO case definition. Reliance on the WHO case definition as a SARS screening tool may lead to an unacceptable rate of misdiagnosis. The SARS case definition must be revised if it is to be used as a screening tool in emergency departments and primary care settings.","Wong, W N; Sek, Antonio C H; Lau, Rick F L; Li, K M; Leung, Joe K S; Tse, M L; Ng, Andy H W; Stenstrom, Robert",CJEM,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17466127/,339
200707,Emergency department visits and readmissions after COVID-19 hospitalization: a cross-sectional analysis,2021,"Efforts to strengthen health information systems in low- and middle-income countries should include forging links with systems in other social and economic sectors. Governments are seeking comprehensive socioeconomic data on the basis of which to implement strategies for poverty reduction and to monitor achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The health sector is looking to take action on the social factors that determine health outcomes. But there are duplications and inconsistencies between sectors in the collection, reporting, storage and analysis of socioeconomic data. National offices of statistics give higher priority to collection and analysis of economic than to social statistics. The Report of the Commission for Africa has estimated that an additional US$ 60 million a year is needed to improve systems to collect and analyse statistics in Africa. Some donors recognize that such systems have been weakened by numerous international demands for indicators, and have pledged support for national initiatives to strengthen statistical systems, as well as sectoral information systems such as those in health and education. Many governments are working to coordinate information systems to monitor and evaluate poverty reduction strategies. There is therefore an opportunity for the health sector to collaborate with other sectors to lever international resources to rationalize definition and measurement of indicators common to several sectors; streamline the content, frequency and timing of household surveys; and harmonize national and subnational databases that store socioeconomic data. Without long-term commitment to improve training and build career structures for statisticians and information technicians working in the health and other sectors, improvements in information and statistical systems cannot be sustained.","Macfarlane, Sarah B",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16184278/,339
202136,Effect of COVID-19 on the Working of a Tertiary Care Hospital,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To assess new information from peer-reviewed publications in 2005 regarding emerging respiratory viral threats. RECENT FINDINGS The expanding epizootic of avian A/H5N1 influenza and increasing number of human cases heighten concern regarding the threat of pandemic influenza. Studies of the 1918 pandemic virus have shown the potential for direct interspecies transmission from an avian host. In the absence of an effective vaccine, antiviral agents could provide an important response measure. Inadequate supplies and potential antiviral resistance are limiting factors. Seasonal influenza heavily affects infants and young children, who also serve to foster transmission at the community level, findings that indicate the need for broader immunization strategies in pediatric populations. Like avian influenza, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was a zoonotic infection, perhaps derived from related coronaviruses in bats. Molecular diagnostic techniques have led to the recent identification of several new coronaviruses and a respiratory parvovirus. It has also helped to define the impact of previously described ones such as human metapneumovirus and rhinoviruses, which account for the majority of asthma exacerbations and frequent lower respiratory tract illnesses. SUMMARY Progress has been made in development of possible specific interventions for influenza and possibly severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, but effective antivirals and vaccines for most other respiratory viruses are currently lacking.","Hayden, Frederick G",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16514342/,339

202946,Special Coverage on COVID-19: An Open Letter to All New Yorkers from the Emergency Department Front Line,2020,"Expression of cytokines/chemokines is tightly regulated at the transcription level. This is crucial in the central nervous system to maintain neuroimmune homeostasis. IL-8 a chemoattractant, which recruits neutrophils, T cells, and basophils into the brain in response to inflammation and/or injury is secreted predominantly by neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which astrocytes regulate IL-8 expression. We demonstrate that while ß-catenin negatively regulated IL-8 transcription, its canonical transcriptional partners, members of the TCF/LEF transcription factors (TCF1, TCF3, TCF4 and LEF1) and Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) positively regulated IL-8 transcription. We further identified a putative TCF/LEF binding site at -175nt close to the minimal transcription region on the IL-8 promoter, mutation of which caused a significant reduction in IL-8 promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated binding of TCF1, TCF4, LEF1 and ATF2 on the IL-8 promoter suggesting that TCFs/LEF partner with ATF2 to induce IL-8 transcription. These findings demonstrate a novel role for ß-catenin in suppression of IL-8 expression and for TCFs/LEF/ATF2 in inducing IL-8. These findings reveal a unique mechanism by which astrocytes tightly regulate IL-8 expression.","Robinson, KaReisha F; Narasipura, Srinivas D; Wallace, Jennillee; Ritz, Ethan M; Al-Harthi, Lena",Cytokine,,339

We examined the influence of different instruments, and QC and reagent lots on the CV calculated from QC data.MethodsResults for BioRad Multiqual frozen liquid QC samples over a 2-year interval were partitioned by QC and reagent lots. The mean and CV were calculated for each partition for each of three Abbott Architect c8000 instruments for measuring serum alanine amino transferase (ALT), creatinine (enzymatic), glucose and sodium.ResultsCVs differed among partitions and instruments for two QC levels by 5.8- and 3.3-fold for ALT, by 4.7- and 2.1-fold for creatinine, by 2.0- and 2.6-fold for glucose, and by 2.1- and 2.0-fold for sodium. Pooled CVs for two QC levels varied among instruments by 1.78- and 1.11-fold for ALT, by 1.63- and 1.11-fold for creatinine, by 1.08- and 1.06-fold for glucose, and by 1.24- and 1.31-fold for sodium.ConclusionsThe CVs from QC data varied substantially among QC and reagent lots and for different identical specification instruments. The CV used to estimate uncertainty for a measurement result or as the basis for interpreting individual QC results must be derived over a sufficient time interval to obtain a pooled CV that represents ""typical"" performance of a measuring system. An estimate of uncertainty provided to users of laboratory results will itself have uncertainty that can influence medical decisions.","Ellis, Ashley D; Gross, Alexander R; Budd, Jeffrey R; Miller, W Greg",Clin. chem. lab. med,,339

Few cases have been observed in children and adolescents who seem to have a more favorable clinical course than other age groups, and even fewer in newborn babies. This review provides an overview of the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, transmission, the associated clinical presentation and outcomes in newborns and infants up to 6 months of life.","De Rose, Domenico Umberto; Piersigilli, Fiammetta; Ronchetti, Maria Paola; Santisi, Alessandra; Bersani, Iliana; Dotta, Andrea; Danhaive, Olivier; Auriti, Cinzia",Ital J Pediatr,,339

The deleterious effects of coronavirus have prompted the development of diagnostic tools to manage the spread of disease. While conventional technologies such as quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) have been broadly used to detect COVID-19, they are time-consuming, labor-intensive and are unavailable in remote settings. Point-of-care (POC) biosensors, including chip-based and paper-based biosensors are typically low-cost and user-friendly, which offer tremendous potential for rapid medical diagnosis. This mini review article discusses the recent advances in POC biosensors for COVID-19. First, the development of POC biosensors which are made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), papers, and other flexible materials such as textile, film, and carbon nanosheets are reviewed. The advantages of each biosensors along with the commercially available COVID-19 biosensors are highlighted. Lastly, the existing challenges and future perspectives of developing robust POC biosensors to rapidly identify and manage the spread of COVID-19 are briefly discussed.","Choi, Jane Ru",Front.

217744,Assessment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Association with Severity of COVID-19: A Prospective Observational Study,2021,"The management of a foodborne outbreak depends on the rapid and accurate identification of the responsible food source. Conventional methods based on isolation of the pathogen from the food matrix and target-specific real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCRs) are used in routine. In recent years, the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial isolates has proven its value to collect relevant information for strain characterization as well as tracing the origin of the contamination by linking the food isolate with the patient's isolate with high resolution. However, the isolation of a bacterial pathogen from food matrices is often time-consuming and not always successful. Therefore, we aimed to improve outbreak investigation by developing a method that can be implemented in reference laboratories to characterize the pathogen in the food vehicle without its prior isolation and link it back to human cases. We tested and validated a shotgun metagenomics approach by spiking food pathogens in specific food matrices using the Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) as a case study. Different DNA extraction kits and enrichment procedures were investigated to obtain the most practical workflow. We demonstrated the feasibility of shotgun metagenomics to obtain the same information as in ISO/TS 13136:2012 and WGS of the isolate in parallel by inferring the genome of the contaminant and characterizing it in a shorter timeframe. This was achieved in food samples containing different E. coli strains, including a combination of different STEC strains. For the first time, we also managed to link individual strains from a food product to isolates from human cases, demonstrating the power of shotgun metagenomics for rapid outbreak investigation and source tracking.","Buytaers, Florence E; Saltykova, Assia; Denayer, Sarah; Verhaegen, Bavo; Vanneste, Kevin; Roosens, Nancy H C; Piérard, Denis; Marchal, Kathleen; De Keersmaecker, Sigrid C J",,,339

219890,“Break The Chain” to Embrace New Possibilities in Dental Education,2020,"Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently raging in China. It has been proven that COVID-19 can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital infection, which seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients. Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide the highest quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the procedures of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management. More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments. The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department. (2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of COVID-19 to patients and doctors. Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.). If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended. (3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under -5 Pa) must be separated. All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard. (4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with COVID-19 must be protected by three-level. After operation, the medical workers must receive medical observation and be isolated for 14 days.

Our partnerships and collaborations among multiple different specialties and disciplines enabled contributions from personnel with specific expertise in medicine, nursing, pharmacy, infection prevention and control, electronic health record (EHR) informatics, compliance, legal, medical ethics, engineering, administration, and other critical areas. Clear communication and a culture in which all roles are welcomed at the planning and operational tables are critical to the rapid development and refinement needed to adapt and thrive in providing this time-sensitive beneficial therapy. Our partnerships with leaders and providers outside our institutions, including those who care for underserved populations, have promoted equity in the access of monoclonal antibodies in our regions. Strong support from institutional leadership facilitated expedited action when needed, from a physical, personnel, and system infrastructure standpoint.

Here we report very large Kerr-like nonlinearities by employing strong optical transitions of charged excitons (trions) observed in semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). By hybridising trions in monolayer MoSe$_2$ at low electron densities with a microcavity mode, we realise trion-polaritons exhibiting significant energy shifts at very small photon fluxes due to phase space filling. Most notably, the strong trion-polariton nonlinearity is found to be 10 to 1000 larger than in other polariton systems, including neutral exciton-polaritons in TMDCs. Furthermore it exceeds by factors of $\sim 10^3-10^5$ the magnitude of Kerr nonlinearity in bare TMDCs, graphene and other widely used optical materials (e.g. Si, AlGaAs etc) in weak light-matter coupling regimes. The results are in good agreement with a theory which accounts for the composite nature of excitons and trions and deviation of their statistics from that of ideal bosons and fermions.

With worsening diffuse ST-segment elevation on electrocardiograms and reduced ejection fraction on echocardiography in the setting of systemic inflammation, fulminant myocarditis was highly suspected. Despite optimal medical treatment, the patient's condition deteriorated and was complicated by cardiac arrest that failed resuscitation. Although myocarditis was initially suspected, the autopsy revealed no evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis but did demonstrate multiple microscopic sites of myocardial ischemia together with thrombi in the left atrium and pulmonary vasculature. Additionally, scattered microscopic cardiomyocyte necrosis with pathological diagnosis of small vessel micro-thrombotic occlusions. These findings are potentially exacerbated by inflammation-induced coagulopathy, hypoxia, hypotension, and stress, that is, a multifactorial etiology. Further research and an improved understanding are needed to define the precise pathophysiology of the coagulopathic state causing widespread micro-thrombosis with subsequent myocardial and pulmonary injury.","Fath, Ayman R; Aglan, Amro; Varkoly, Kyle S; Eldaly, Abdullah S; Beladi, Roxana N; Forlemu, Arnold; Mihyawi, Nawfal; Solsi, Anup; Israr, Sharjeel; Lucas, Alexandra R",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,,339

226530,Early lessons from COVID-19 that may reduce future emergency department crowding,2020,"Medication overuse headache is estimated to affect 2% of the population, and is ranked in the top 20 most disabling disorders due to its high level of disability. Several therapies used in the treatment of acute migraine are thought to be associated with medication overuse headache, including opioids and triptans. With limited treatment options, it is critical to determine the risk profile of novel therapies prior to their widespread use. The current study explores the potential medication overuse risk of two novel therapeutic drug classes, namely the ditans: 5-HT1F receptor agonists, and the gepants: calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists, in a preclinical model of medication overuse. Persistent exposure of mice to the 5-HT1F agonist LY344864, but not olcegepant produced a significant reduction in hind paw and orofacial mechanical withdrawal thresholds as a surrogate readout of allodynia. In agreement, only LY344864 induced neuroplastic changes in trigeminal sensory afferents, increasing calcitonin gene-related peptide expression and basal trigeminal nociception. Our data highlight a differential medication overuse headache risk profile for the ditan and gepant classes of drugs that has important implications for their clinical use and patient education to help reduce the burden of medication overuse headache.","Saengjaroentham, Chonlawan; Strother, Lauren C; Dripps, Isaac; Sultan Jabir, Mohammad Rayhan; Pradhan, Amynah; Goadsby, Peter J; Holland, Philip R",Brain,,339

231609,Management of children and adolescents having type 1 diabetes during COVID-19 pandemic in India: challenges and solutions,2020,"PURPOSE: The outbreak of COVID-19 erupted in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. In a few weeks, it progressed rapidly into a global pandemic which resulted in an overwhelming burden on health care systems, medical resources and staff. Spine surgeons as health care providers are no exception. In this study, we try to highlight the impact of the crisis on spine surgeons in terms of knowledge, attitude, practice and socioeconomic burden. METHODS: This was global, multicentric cross-sectional study on 781 spine surgeons that utilized an Internet-based validated questionnaire to evaluate knowledge about COVID-19, availability of personal protective equipment, future perceptions, effect of this crisis on practice and psychological distress. Univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictors for the degree of COVID-19 effect on practice. RESULTS: Overall, 20.2%, 52% and 27.8% of the participants were affected minimally, intermediately and hugely by COVID-19, respectively. Older ages (ß = 0.33, 95% CI 0.11-0.56), orthopedic spine surgeons (ß = 0.30, 95% CI 0.01-0.61) and those who work in the private sector (ß = 0.05, 95% CI 0.19-0.61) were the most affected by COVID-19. Those who work in university hospitals (ß = - 0.36, 95% CI 0.00 to - 0.71) were affected the least. The availability of N95 masks (47%) and disposable eye protectors or face shields (39.4%) was significantly associated with lower psychological stress (p = 0.01). Only 6.9%, 3.7% and 5% had mild, moderate and severe mental distress, respectively. CONCLUSION: While it is important to recognize the short-term impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the practice of spine surgery, predicting where we will be standing in 6-12 months remains difficult and unknown. The COVID-19 crisis will probably have an unexpected long-term impact on lives and economies.","Khattab, Mohamed Fawzy; Kannan, Tareq M A; Morsi, Ahmed; Al-Sabbagh, Qussay; Hadidi, Fadi; Al-Sabbagh, Mohammed Qussay; M Taha, Muzahem; Bourghli, Anouar; Obeid, Ibrahim",Eur Spine J,,339

In vitro human models are promising platforms for identifying and testing novel compounds to potentially decrease this burden. Directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells is an important strategy to generate lung cells to create such models. Current lung directed differentiation protocols are limited as they do not 1) recapitulate the diversity of respiratory epithelium, 2) generate consistent or sufficient cell numbers for drug discovery platforms, and 3) establish the histologic tissue-level organization critical for modeling lung function. In this review, we describe how lung development has formed the basis for directed differentiation protocols, and discuss the utility of available protocols for lung epithelial cell generation and drug development. We further highlight tissue engineering strategies for manipulating biophysical signals during directed differentiation such that future protocols can recapitulate both chemical and physical cues present during lung development.","Varma, Ratna; Soleas, John P; Waddell, Thomas K; Karoubi, Golnaz; McGuigan, Alison P",Adv. drug deliv. rev,,339

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all cornea donors dying from causes other than SARS-CoV-2 between August 2020 and December 2020 was performed. Informed consent was obtained from the next of kin of the deceased for RT-PCR testing from NP swabs. Rapid antigen testing from all the deceased was performed before in situ cornea excision. In addition, NP samples in viral transport media for RT-PCR were also collected for SARS-CoV-2 analysis. Corneas were released from the eye bank only after a negative RT-PCR report. RESULT: One hundred eighteen corneas from 59 donors were obtained by the eye bank. Eleven donors (18.64%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR testing. Six of these 11 donors had a Ct value of E gene less than 25. CONCLUSIONS: NP samples of cornea donors dying due to causes other than coronavirus disease-19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR. This implicates that donors could be having asymptomatic/undetected coronavirus disease infection. We recommend adding the routine testing of NP samples of all cornea donors in the eye banking protocol in this ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Arora, Ritu; Sharda, Shipra; Sahu, Jigyasa; Manchanda, Vikas; Jain, Parul; Gupta, Isha; Gotmare, Nikhil; Bharti, Nisha",Cornea,,339

The differences in prothrombotic potential between SARS-CoV-2 and non-CoV-2-RV have not been well characterised. We compared the thrombotic rates between these two groups of patients directly and further delved into their coagulation profiles. In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, all consecutive COVID-19 and non-CoV-2-RV patients admitted between January 15th and April 10th 2020 were included. Coagulation parameters studied were prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time and its associated clot waveform analysis (CWA) parameter, min1, min2 and max2. In the COVID-19 (n = 181) group there were two (1.0 event/1000-hospital-days) myocardial infarction events while one (1.8 event/1000-hospital-day) was reported in the non-CoV-2-RV (n = 165) group. These events occurred in patients who were severely ill. There were no venous thrombotic events. Coagulation parameters did not differ throughout the course of mild COVID-19. However, CWA parameters were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 compared with mild disease, suggesting hypercoagulability (min1: 6.48%/s vs 5.05%/s, P < 0.001; min2: 0.92%/s2 vs 0.74%/s2, P = 0.033). In conclusion, the thrombotic rates were low and did not differ between COVID-19 and non-CoV-2-RV patients. The hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is a highly dynamic process with the highest risk occurring when patients were most severely ill. Such changes in haemostasis could be detected by CWA. In our population, a more individualized thromboprophylaxis approach, considering clinical and laboratory factors, is preferred over universal pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients and such personalized approach warrants further research.","Tan, Chuen Wen; Tan, Jing Yuan; Wong, Wan Hui; Cheong, May Anne; Ng, Ian Matthias; Conceicao, Edwin Philip; Low, Jenny Guek Hong; Ng, Heng Joo; Lee, Lai Heng",Sci Rep,,339

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are increasingly reported, along with its potential relationship with overweight and/or obesity. Therefore, we aim here to review the current scientific literature on the impact of overweight and/or obesity among hospitalized patients who have developed severe or critical forms of COVID-19. Following PRISMA guidelines, our literature search identified over 300 scientific articles using the keywords ""obesity"" and ""COVID-19"", 22 of which were finally selected for reporting useful information on the association between overweight/obesity and disease severity. In particular, in 11 out of the 14 studies (79%) which evaluated the association between obesity and disease severity providing also a risk estimate (i.e., the odd ratio; OR), the OR value was constantly >2. Although the studies were found to be heterogeneous in terms of design, population, sample size and endpoints, in most cases a significant association was found between obesity and the risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 illness, intensive care unit admission and/or death. We can hence conclude that an increased body mass index shall be considered a negative prognostic factor in patients with COVID-19, and more aggressive prevention or treatment shall hence be reserved to overweight and/or obese patients.","Onorato, Diletta; Carpenè, Giovanni; Lippi, Giuseppe; Pucci, Mairi",Diagnosis (Berl),,339
236675,Emergency Medicine Journal COVID-19 monthly top five,2021,"AIM: Previous studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the association between metformin use and clinical outcomes in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to evaluate the association between metformin use and clinical outcomes in DM patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective study was based on claims data. All diseases, including COVID-19, were defined using International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Patients were divided into three groups depending on metformin use: CON (those not taking DM medication); N-MFOM (those taking DM medications other than metformin); and MFOM (those taking metformin for DM). Ultimately, 1865 patients were included; CON, N-MFOM and MFOM groups comprised 1301, 95 and 469 patients, respectively. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that MFOM patients had poorer survival rates than those in the CON group, but there were no significant differences in survival rates between MFOM and N-MFOM groups. Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed more favourable survival in CON than in N-MFOM patients, but there was no statistically significant difference in MFOM vs the other groups. Also, there were no significant differences in rates of use of inotropes, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, conventional oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal cannulas or mechanical ventilators, nor in the rates of acute kidney injury or cardiac events across all study groups. CONCLUSION: No definite association could be found between metformin use and clinical outcomes, including survival. However, given the disproportionate participant numbers in our groups and small number of events, further studies are needed to determine whether the use of metformin has favourable or unfavourable effects in DM patients with COVID-19.","Do, Jun Young; Kim, Sang Won; Park, Jong Won; Cho, Kyu Hyang; Kang, Seok Hui",Diabetes metab,,339

The purpose of this study was to compare dual diagnosis before and after lockdown in people aged between 55 and 74 with alcohol use. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected for people referred to mental health services using an anonymised database of de-identified records to identify people with both substance use disorder alone, or accompanied by co-existing mental disorders. Findings: In total, 366 older people were assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), 185 before and 181 after lockdown. People with dual diagnosis were more likely to be referred than those without, after compared to before lockdown (13 and 6%, respectively, p &lt; 0.05). People with any substance use disorder with and without dual diagnosis showed an even greater likelihood of referral after, compared with before, lockdown (61 and 34%, respectively, p &lt; 0.0001). Opioid use more than once a month was more likely to be reported after, compared with before, lockdown (66 and 36%, respectively, p &lt; 0.005). Research limitations/implications: The finding of a higher likelihood of opioid use after compared with before lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic warrants further exploration. There is also further scope for further studies that involve older non-drinkers. Originality/value: A greater likelihood of both dual diagnosis and substance use disorder alone after, compared with before lockdown has implications for both mental health and addiction service provision during a pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Rao, R.; Mueller, C.; Broadbent, M.",Advances in Dual Diagnosis,,339

Testicular involvement is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the pathological changes and whether SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the testes of deceased COVID-19 patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Postmortem examination of the testes from 12 COVID-19 patients was performed using light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry for lymphocytic and histiocytic markers. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the virus in testicular tissue. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Seminiferous tubular injury was assessed as none, mild, moderate, or severe according to the extent of tubular damage. Leydig cells in the interstitium were counted in ten 400× microscopy fields. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Microscopically, Sertoli cells showed swelling, vacuolation and cytoplasmic rarefaction, detachment from tubular basement membranes, and loss and sloughing into lumens of the intratubular cell mass. Two, five, and four of 11 cases showed mild, moderate, and severe injury, respectively. The mean number of Leydig cells in COVID-19 testes was significantly lower than in the control group (2.2 vs 7.8, p < 0.001). In the interstitium there was edema and mild inflammatory infiltrates composed of T lymphocytes and histiocytes. Transmission EM did not identify viral particles in three cases. RT-PCR detected the virus in one of 12 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Testes from COVID-19 patients exhibited significant seminiferous tubular injury, reduced Leydig cells, and mild lymphocytic inflammation. We found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the testes in the majority (90%) of the cases by RT-PCR, and in none by electron microscopy. These findings can provide evidence-based guidance for sperm donation and inform management strategies to mitigate the risk of testicular injury during the COVID-19 disease course. PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the testes of deceased COVID-19 patients. We found significant damage to the testicular parenchyma. However, virus was not detected in testes in the majority of cases.","Yang, Ming; Chen, Shuo; Huang, Bo; Zhong, Jing-Min; Su, Hua; Chen, Ya-Jun; Cao, Qin; Ma, Lin; He, Jun; Li, Xue-Fei; Li, Xiang; Zhou, Jun-Jie; Fan, Jun; Luo, Dan-Ju; Chang, Xiao-Na; Arkun, Knarik; Zhou, Ming; Nie, Xiu",Eur Urol Focus,,339

The aim of this study was the characterization of COVID-19 cases detected during this period. METHODS: We analyzed certain variables of interest coming from the epidemiological surveys carried out in an area of Madrid during May 2020, and stratified the results depending on its temporal relation with the deescalation. Prevalence for each category of response and average duration in minutes of the telephonic call were calculated. Confidence intervals were estimated at 95%. RESULTS: We included 167 cases, being 30.5% of them incident and 49.1% prevalent. The main source of infection was home (38.0%;CI 95% 31.4-46.2). Regarding healthcare and social care workers, the main source of infection was workplace (93.0%;85.4-100). Average number of close contacts per case was 2.0 (1.8-2.2), being 1.5 (1.0-2.0) among pre-deescalation incident cases and 2.4 (1.8-3.0) among those post-deescalation. Average duration of each survey was 35.9 minutes (32.2-38.9), being 32.1 (24.4-39.8) among pre-deescalation incident cases and 37.0 (29.6-44.4) among those post-deescalation. Most of the contacts were household, both before and after beginning of deescalation. CONCLUSIONS: Home is the most prevalent place for the acquisition of the infection among general population, while workplace is the most prevalent among healthcare and social care workers. The initial phase of deescalation do not represents a change regarding sources of infection, but it may increase the number of close contacts. OBJETIVO: La desescalada iniciada en mayo de 2020 aumenta las interacciones sociales, lo que influye en la vigilancia epidemiológica de la COVID-19. Este estudio tuvo como objetivo caracterizar los casos identificados durante este periodo. METODOS: Se analizaron parámetros de interés de las encuestas epidemiológicas realizadas en un área de Madrid durante mayo de 2020, estratificando los resultados según su relación temporal con la desescalada. Para las distintas opciones de respuesta, se calculó la prevalencia, y para la duración de la encuesta, la media en minutos. Los intervalos de confianza se estimaron al 95%. RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron 167 casos, siendo un 30,5% incidentes y un 49,1% prevalentes. El principal lugar de contagio fue el domicilio (38,8%;IC 95% 31,4-46,2). En el caso de los trabajadores sanitarios y sociosanitarios fue el centro de trabajo (93,0%;85,4-100). El número medio de contactos por caso fue 2,0 (1,8-2,2), siendo 1,5 (1,0-2,0) en los casos incidentes predesescalada y 2,4 (1,8-3,0) en los postdesescalada. El tiempo medio por encuesta fue de 35,9 minutos (32,2-38,9), siendo 32,1 (24,4-39,8) en los incidentes predesescalada y 37,0 (29,6-44,4) en los postdesescalada. El principal ámbito de contacto fue el domicilio, tanto antes como después del inicio de la desescalada. CONCLUSIONES: Los contagios se producen principalmente en el domicilio en el caso de la población general y en el centro de trabajo en cuanto a los profesionales sanitarios y sociosanitarios. La fase inicial de la desescalada no supone un cambio en las fuentes de exposición, pero sí podría haber aumentado el número de contactos a investigar.","Pérez Romero, C.; Serrano Pareja, M.; Rumayor Zarzuelo, M.; Mata Pariente, N.; Hernando García, M.",Revista espanola de salud publica,,339

This created an educational challenge because students are unable to access reagents and instruments typical in a university lab setting. It is also difficult for students to connect theory to practice since real-lab experimentation is not possible in a virtual online for-mat. In our online Introductory Quantitative Analysis Laboratory course (GW Chem 2123W) in spring 2021, students were required to design and perform an experiment that could be safely conducted at home which can also demonstrate key princi-ples of quantitative analysis. Herein, we conducted a reliable at-home experiment that utilizes university-level acid/base titra-tion techniques to determine the acetic acid concentration in white vinegar. The experiment used sodium bicarbonate in the form of baking soda to titrate the Whole Foods white vinegar which is advertised to contain 6% of acetic acid. We reliably obtained an equivalence point for the titration from which the actual concentration of acetic acid in the vinegar was calculated with error analysis to be 19% higher than the advertised value. The analytical techniques demonstrated in this experiment supplement practical knowledge of acid/base techniques learned in the online classroom and prompt adoption of this meth-odology in online laboratory curriculum.

METHODS: Prospective follow-up study to evaluate the medium-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on a cohort of epilepsy patients from a tertiary hospital previously surveyed during the first peak of the pandemic. Between July 1, 2020, and August 30, 2020, the patients answered an online 19-item questionnaire, HADS, and PSIQ scales. Short- and medium-term effects of the pandemic confinement and the perception of telemedicine were compared. RESULTS: 153 patients completed the questionnaire, mean ± SD age, 47.6 ± 19.3 years; 49.7% women. Depression was reported by 43 patients, significantly more prevalent than in the short-term analysis (29.2% vs. 19.7%; p = .038). Anxiety (38.1% vs. 36.1%; p = 0.749) and insomnia (28.9% vs. 30.9%, p = .761) remained highly prevalent. Seventeen patients reported an increase in seizure frequency (11.1% vs. 9.1%, p = .515). The three factors independently associated with an increase in seizure frequency in the medium term were drug-resistant epilepsy (odds ratio [OR] = 8.2, 95% CI 2.06-32.52), depression (OR = 6.46, 95% CI 1.80-23.11), and a reduction in income (OR = 5.47, 95% CI 1.51-19.88). A higher proportion of patients found telemedicine unsatisfactory (11.2% vs. 2.4%), and a lower percentage (44.8% vs. 56.8%) found it very satisfactory (p = .005). CONCLUSIONS: Depression rates increased significantly after the first wave. Depression, drug-resistant epilepsy, and a reduction in family income were independent risk factors for an increased seizure frequency.

This pandemic represents a serious public health risk. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is essential to control disease progression. Radiological examination plays a crucial role in the early identification and management of infected patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify the diagnostic value of different imaging modalities used for diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. The keywords diagnostic imaging, radiology, respiratory infection, pneumonia, coronavirus infection and COVID-19 were used to identify radiology articles focusing on the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to determine the diagnostic value of various imaging modalities, including x-ray, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and nuclear medicine for identification and management of infected patients. RESULTS: We identified 50 articles in the literature search. Studies that investigated the diagnostic roles and imaging features of patients with COVID-19, using either chest CT, lung ultrasound, chest x-ray, or positron emission topography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan, were discussed. Of these imaging modalities, chest x-ray and CT scan are the most commonly used for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients, with chest CT scan being more accurate and sensitive in identifying COVID-19 at early stages. Only a few studies have investigated the roles of ultrasound and PET/CT scan in diagnosing COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT scan remains the most sensitive imaging modality in initial diagnosis and management of suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19. Other diagnostic imaging modalities could add value in evaluating disease progression and monitoring critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Aljondi, Rowa; Alghamdi, Salem",J Med Internet Res,,339

Although its full impact on agricultural and food markets is not yet evident, we have some early evidence on the different impacts. The aim of this article is to summarize the early evidence by screening global newspaper articles and sites written on the topic until 10 April 2020. The most read English-based newspaper articles were downloaded and accessed together with a Google search on specific keywords in order to have a complete picture of the topic. Results suggest that agriculture-related pandemic effects can be grouped into supply, demand, labour, food security, food safety, trade and other effects. It is also evident that the first impacts are not one-sided: what helped some hurt others.

This article reviews inactivation data regarding coronaviruses on surfaces and in liquids from published studies and develops secondary models to predict coronaviruses inactivation as a function of temperature and relative humidity. A total of 102 D values (i.e., the time to obtain a log10 reduction of virus infectivity), including values for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), were collected from 26 published studies. The values obtained from the different coronaviruses and studies were found to be generally consistent. Five different models were fitted to the global data set of D values. The most appropriate model considered temperature and relative humidity. A spreadsheet predicting the inactivation of coronaviruses and the associated uncertainty is presented and can be used to predict virus inactivation for untested temperatures, time points, or any coronavirus strains belonging to Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera.IMPORTANCE The prediction of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on fomites is essential in investigating the importance of contact transmission. This study collects available information on inactivation kinetics of coronaviruses in both solid and liquid fomites and creates a mathematical model for the impact of temperature and relative humidity on virus persistence. The predictions of the model can support more robust decision-making and could be useful in various public health contexts. A calculator for the natural clearance of SARS-CoV-2 depending on temperature and relative humidity could be a valuable operational tool for public authorities.","Guillier, Laurent; Martin-Latil, Sandra; Chaix, Estelle; Thébault, Anne; Pavio, Nicole; Le Poder, Sophie; Batéjat, Christophe; Biot, Fabrice; Koch, Lionel; Schaffner, Donald W; Sanaa, Moez",,,339

251634,71 COVID-19 Referral Patterns for Tent and Drive-Through Screening,2020,"Background: Several months into the COVID-19 pandemic, reassessing intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, specifically with regional impact on diverse populations, should be a priority for hospitals planning for critical care resource allocation. In our study, we reviewed the impact of COVID-19 on a community hospital serving an urban region, comparing the sociodemographic distribution of ICU admissions before and during the pandemic. Methods: We executed a time sensitive analysis to see if COVID-19 ICU admissions reflect regional sociodemographic populations as well as ICU admission trends prior to the current pandemic. Collected sociodemographic variables included sex, race, ethnicity, and age of adult patients (age 18 and older) admitted to the hospital's medical and cardiac ICUs, which were converted to COVID-19 ICUs. The time period selected was 18-months, which was then dichotomized into pre-COVID-19 admissions (December 1, 2018 to March 13, 2020) and COVID-19 ICU admissions (March 14, 2020 to May 31, 2020). Variables were compared using Fisher's exact tests and Wilcoxon tests when appropriate. Results: During the 18-month period, 1861 patients were admitted to the aforementioned ICUs. The mean age of the 1861 patients was 62.75 + 15.57 years old, with the majority of these patients being male (52.23%), White (64.43%), and non-Hispanic/Latinx (95.75%). There were differences in racial and ethnic distribution comparing pre-COVID-19 admissions to the COVID-19 admissions. Compared to pre-COVID-19 ICU admissions, there was an increase in African American versus White admissions (p=0.01) and an increase in Hispanic/Latinx versus non-Hispanic/Latinx admissions (p&lt;0.01), during the COVID- 19 pandemic. Discussion: During the first three months of admissions to COVID-19 ICUs, there was a rise in admissions among Hispanic/Latinx and African-American patients, while non-Hispanic/Latinx and White patient admissions declined compared to the previous pre-COVID year. These findings support development of strategies to enhance allocation of resources to bolster novel, equitable strategies to mitigate the incidence of COVID19 in minority populations.","Sarkar, S.; Page, K.; Chatterjee, S.; Maygers, J.; Jones, V.; Tolson, T.; Hill-Briggs, F.; Chen, E.

Therefore, keeping this in mind, several researchers have already started investigating artificial intelligence algorithms to find solutions to predict coronavirus using X-ray images of chest. But due to lack of dataset during the initial days of their research, many came up with framework using pre trained image classification models such as VGG-16, Inceptionv3, ResNet-50 and others. In this paper, the performance of two machine learning algorithms which are support vector machine and decision tree has been evaluated. Further developed deep learning model applying convolutional neural network to classify the chest x-ray images as covid-19 or normal.

People have had a serious fearful mood due to situations such as catching COVID-19, having health problems after catching the disease, and worrying about infecting someone else. This negative mood is discussed in the literature through the concept of the fear of COVID-19. Accordingly, the mediator role of the fear of COVID-19 in the relationship between psychological resilience and life satisfaction was examined in this study. This study was conducted with 430 Turkish university students, 279 women and 151 men, who are between the ages of 18 and 30. The data of the study were collected with the psychological resilience, the fear of COVID-19 and life satisfaction scales. As a result of the analysis, it was concluded that psychological resilience is a negative predictor of the fear of COVID-19 and a positive predictor of life satisfaction, and that the fear of COVID-19 is a negative predictor of life satisfaction. It was also concluded that the fear of COVID-19 mediates the relationship between psychological resilience and life satisfaction.

257208,COVID-19 in Children-Not Just Little Adults,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreaks have led to massive admissions to intensive care units (ICUs). An ultrasound examination of the thorax is widely performed on admission in these patients. The primary objective of our study was to assess the performance of the lung ultrasound score (LUS) on ICU admission to predict the 28-day mortality rate in patients with SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objective was to asses the performance of thoracic ultrasound and biological markers of cardiac injury to predict mortality. METHODS: This multicentre, retrospective, observational study was conducted in six ICUs of four university hospitals in France from 15 March to 3 May 2020. Patients admitted to ICUs because of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory failure and those who received an LUS examination at admission were included. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve was determined for the LUS score to predict the 28-day mortality rate. The same analysis was performed for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score, left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac output, brain natriuretic peptide and ultra-sensitive troponin levels at admission. RESULTS: In 57 patients, the 28-day mortality rate was 21%. The area under the ROC curve of the LUS score value on ICU admission was 0.68 [95% CI 0.54-0.82; p = 0.05]. In non-intubated patients on ICU admission (n = 40), the area under the ROC curves was 0.84 [95% CI 0.70-0.97; p = 0.005]. The best cut-off of 22 corresponded to 85% specificity and 83% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: LUS scores on ICU admission for SARS-CoV-2 did not efficiently predict the 28-day mortality rate. Performance was better for non-intubated patients at admission. Performance of biological cardiac markers may be equivalent to the LUS score.","Duclos, Gary; Bazalguette, Florian; Allaouchiche, Bernard; Mohammedi, Neyla; Lopez, Alexandre; Gazon, Mathieu; Besch, Guillaume; Bouvet, Lionel; Muller, Laurent; Mathon, Gauthier; Arbelot, Charlotte; Boucekine, Mohamed; Leone, Marc; Zieleskiewicz, Laurent",Adv Ther,,339

Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear, and the aim of our study is to address this point. METHODS: Between February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC). RESULTS: In the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI, 62% of cases were ventilated and there were three deaths (17.8 ± 10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17/26 developed bacterial superinfection. One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and one serious bacterial superinfection. Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p < 0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p = 0.04 and p = 0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients. CONCLUSION: Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI. Despite the confounding factors, this suggests that therapy time in anti-cytokine randomized trials will be key.","Quartuccio, Luca; Sonaglia, Arianna; McGonagle, Dennis; Fabris, Martina; Peghin, Maddalena; Pecori, Davide; De Monte, Amato; Bove, Tiziana; Curcio, Francesco; Bassi, Flavio; De Vita, Salvatore; Tascini, Carlo",J Clin Virol,,339
262012,Anosmia and the need for COVID-19 screening during the pandemic. (Special issue on COVID-19.),2020,"BACKGROUND: Several inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in severe COVID-19. We compared cytokines in COVID-19 versus influenza in order to define differentiating features of the inflammatory response to these pathogens and their association with severe disease. Because elevated body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for severe COVID-19, we examined the relationship of BMI to cytokines associated with severe disease. METHODS: Thirty-seven cytokines and chemokines were measured in plasma from 135 patients with COVID-19, 57 patients with influenza, and 30 healthy controls. Controlling for BMI, age, and sex, differences in cytokines between groups were determined by linear regression and random forest prediction was utilized to determine the cytokines most important in distinguishing severe COVID-19 and influenza. Mediation analysis was utilized to identify cytokines that mediate the effect of BMI and age on disease severity. RESULTS: IL-18, IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; were significantly increased in COVID-19 versus influenza patients while GM-CSF, IFN-Î³, IFN-&#955;1, IL-10, IL-15, and MCP-2 were significantly elevated in the influenza group. In subgroup analysis based on disease severity, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; were elevated in severe COVID-19, but not severe influenza. Random forest analysis identified high IL-6 and low IFN-&#955;1 levels as the most distinct between severe COVID-19 and severe influenza. Finally, IL-1RA was identified as a potential mediator of the effects of BMI on COVID-19 severity.

264076,COVID-19 among Foreign Workers in Dormitories - How One Emergency Department Responded,2020,"Countries around the world have undertaken a wide range of strategies to halt the spread of COVID-19 and control the economic fallout left in its wake. Rural areas of developing countries pose particular difficulties for developing and implementing effective responses owing to underdeveloped health infrastructure, uneven state capacity for infection control, and endemic poverty. This paper makes the case for the critical role of local governance in coordinating pandemic response by examining how state authorities are attempting to bridge the gap between the need for rapid, vigorous response to the pandemic and local realities in three Indian states -- Rajasthan, Odisha, and Kerala. Through a combination of interviews with mid and low-level bureaucrats and a review of policy documents, we show how the urgency of COVID-19 response has galvanized new kinds of cross-sectoral and multi-scalar interaction between administrative units involved in coordinating responses, as local governments have assumed central responsibility in the implementation of disease control and social security mechanisms. Evidence from Kerala in particular suggests that the state's long term investment in democratic local government and arrangements for incorporating women within grassroots state functions (through its Kudumbashree program) has built a high degree of public trust and cooperation with state actors, while local authorities embrace an ethic of care in the implementation of state responses. These observations, from the early months of the pandemic in South Asia, can serve as a foundation for future studies of how existing institutional arrangements and their histories pattern the long-term success of disease control and livelihood support as the pandemic proceeds. Governance, we argue, will be as important to understanding the trajectory of COVID-19 impacts and recovery as biology, demography, and economy.","Dutta, Anwesha; Fischer, Harry W",World Dev,,339
264939,Recommendations for the COVID-19 Response at the National Level Based on Lessons Learned from the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a substantial reduction in gastrointestinal endoscopies, creating a backlog of procedures. We aimed to quantify this backlog nationally for England and assess how various interventions might mitigate the backlog. METHODS: We did a national analysis of data for colonoscopies, flexible sigmoidoscopies, and gastroscopies from National Health Service (NHS) trusts in NHS England's Monthly Diagnostic Waiting Times and Activity dataset. Trusts were excluded if monthly data were incomplete. To estimate the potential backlog, we used linear logistic regression to project the cumulative deficit between actual procedures performed and expected procedures, based on historical pre-pandemic trends. We then made further estimations of the change to the backlog under three scenarios: recovery to a set level of capacity, ranging from 90% to 130%; further disruption to activity (eg, second pandemic wave); or introduction of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) triaging. FINDINGS: We included data from Jan 1, 2018, to Oct 31, 2020, from 125 NHS trusts. 10 476 endoscopy procedures were done in April, 2020, representing 9·5% of those done in April, 2019 (n=110 584), before recovering to 105 716 by October, 2020 (84·5% of those done in October, 2019 [n=125 072]). Recovering to 100% capacity on the current trajectory would lead to a projected backlog of 162 735 (95% CI 143 775-181 695) colonoscopies, 119 025 (107 398-130 651) flexible sigmoidoscopies, and 194 087 (172 564-215 611) gastroscopies in January, 2021, attributable to the pandemic. Increasing capacity to 130% would still take up to June, 2022, to eliminate the backlog. A further 2-month interruption would add an extra 15·4%, a 4-month interruption would add an extra 43·8%, and a 6-month interruption would add an extra 82·5% to the potential backlog. FIT triaging of cases that are found to have greater than 10 µg haemoglobin per g would reduce colonoscopy referrals to around 75% of usual levels, with the backlog cleared in early 2022. INTERPRETATION: Our work highlights the impact of the pandemic on endoscopy services nationally. Even with mitigation measures, it could take much longer than a year to eliminate the pandemic-related backlog. Urgent action is required by key stakeholders (ie, individual NHS trusts, Clinical Commissioning Groups, British Society of Gastroenterology, and NHS England) to tackle the backlog and prevent delays to patient management.

265420,The “double eights mask brace” improves the fit and protection of a basic surgical mask amidst COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Objective: Current COVID-19 guidelines recommend symptom-based screening and regular nasopharyngeal (NP) testing for healthcare personnel in high-risk settings. We sought to estimate case detection percentages with various routine NP and saliva testing frequencies. Design: Simulation modelling study. Methods: We constructed a sensitivity function based on the average infectiousness profile of symptomatic COVID-19 cases to determine the probability of being identified at the time of testing. This function was fitted to reported data on the percent positivity of symptomatic COVID-19 patients using NP testing. We then simulated a routine testing program with different NP and saliva testing frequencies to determine case detection percentages during the infectious period, as well as the pre-symptomatic stage. Results: Routine bi-weekly NP testing, once every two weeks, identified an average of 90.7% (SD: 0.18) of cases during the infectious period and 19.7% (SD: 0.98) during the pre-symptomatic stage. With a weekly NP testing frequency, the corresponding case detection percentages were 95.9% (SD: 0.18) and 32.9% (SD: 1.23), respectively. A 5-day saliva testing schedule had a similar case detection percentage as weekly NP testing during the infectious period, but identified about 10% more cases (mean: 42.5%; SD: 1.10) during the pre-symptomatic stage. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the utility of routine non-invasive saliva testing for frontline healthcare workers to protect vulnerable patient populations. A 5-day saliva testing schedule should be considered to help identify silent infections and prevent outbreaks in nursing homes and healthcare facilities.","Zhang, Kevin; Shoukat, Affan; Crystal, William; Langley, Joanne M; Galvani, Alison P; Moghadas, Seyed M",,,339
266177,Adrenal pathology findings in severe COVID-19: an autopsy study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in December 2019, considerable attention has been focused on its elucidation. However, it is also important for clinicians and epidemiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza viruses. RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in patients with ARDS. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This analysis was a retrospective case-control study. Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 (n = 73) or H1N1 (n = 75) were compared. Their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: The median age of patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of patients with H1N1, and there was a higher proportion of male subjects among the H1N1 cohort (P < .05). Patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher proportions of nonproductive coughs, fatigue, and GI symptoms than those of patients with H1N1 (P < .05). Patients with H1N1 had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores than patients with COVID-19 (P < .05). The Pao2/Fio2 of 198.5 mm Hg in the COVID-19 cohort was significantly higher than the Pao2/Fio2 of 107.0 mm Hg in the H1N1 cohort (P < .001). Ground-glass opacities was more common in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with H1N1 (P < .001). There was a greater variety of antiviral therapies administered to COVID-19 patients than to H1N1 patients. The in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 was 28.8%, whereas that of patients with H1N1 was 34.7% (P = .483). SOFA score-adjusted mortality of H1N1 patients was significantly higher than that of COVID-19 patients, with a rate ratio of 2.009 (95% CI, 1.563-2.583; P < .001). INTERPRETATION: There were many differences in clinical presentations between patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 or H1N1. Compared with H1N1 patients, patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS had lower severity of illness scores at presentation and lower SOFA score-adjusted mortality.","Tang, Xiao; Du, Rong-Hui; Wang, Rui; Cao, Tan-Ze; Guan, Lu-Lu; Yang, Cheng-Qing; Zhu, Qi; Hu, Ming; Li, Xu-Yan; Li, Ying; Liang, Li-Rong; Tong, Zhao-Hui; Sun, Bing; Peng, Peng; Shi, Huan-Zhong",Chest,,339

The urinary concentrations of parabens were found to be significantly different between low, medium, and high users of PCPs (P < 0.05). The frequency of PCP use was associated with higher urinary MP, PPand BP concentrations. Significant positive association was found between the frequency of food products use and urinary MP and EP concentrations. The urinary concentration of parabens was higher in individuals who used body wash, makeup base, shaving cream and, lotion in the past 24 h compared to non-users. Consumers of cookies and dairy products had significantly higher urinary MP and jelly consumers had higher urinary MP and PP concentrations than non-consumers. Our findings indicated that certain types of foods and PCPs could be important sources of exposure to parabens.","Hajizadeh, Yaghoub; Kiani Feizabadi, Ghasem; Feizi, Awat; Ebrahimpour, Karim",Int J Environ Health Res,,339
268115,Chronotherapy in COVID-19 Disease,2021,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are cell surface receptors that are involved in the cellular uptake of pathologic amyloid proteins and viruses, including the novel coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Heparin and heparan sulfate antagonize the binding of these pathogens to HSPGs and stop their cellular internalization, but the anticoagulant effect of these agents has been limiting their use in the treatment of viral infections. Heparin-binding peptides (HBPs) are suitable nonanticoagulant agents that are capable of antagonizing binding of heparin-binding pathogens to HSPGs. Here, we review and discuss the use of HBPs as viral uptake inhibitors and will address their benefits and limitations to treat viral infections. Furthermore, we will discuss a variant of these peptides that is in the clinic and can be considered as a novel therapy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The need to discover treatment modalities for COVID-19 is a necessity, and therapeutic interventions such as heparin-binding peptides (HBPs), which are used for other cases, can be beneficial based on their mechanisms of actions. In this paper, we have discussed the application of HBPs as viral uptake inhibitors in COVID-19 and explained possible mechanisms of actions and the therapeutic effects.","Tavassoly, Omid; Safavi, Farinaz; Tavassoly, Iman",Mol Pharmacol,,339

Iran as one of the most affected countries needs unprecedented effort for monitoring and evaluation of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To determine the seroprevalance of COVID-19 in Semnan province North-East of Iran. METHODS: Six hundred people were randomly selected using the ""SIB data-base"". From 1 to 30 June, 2020, 153 participants of Semnan population were enrolled. Blood, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were obtained. Prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies were ascertained using ELISA and Real-Time PCR was conducted to evaluate viral load. Estimates of prevalence were standardized by age and sex, based on the 2015 national census of Semnan province. RESULTS: Seroprevalence showed no difference between females and males and no significant association between age and seropositivity. Among total participants, the age and sex adjusted prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection was 19.3% (95% CI, 14.0-26.7 per 100 persons). Approximately 10% of participants had detectable antibodies but showed a negative-PCR result. However, approximately 80% of participants did not show an evidence of infection. CONCLUSION: The majority of the population in Semnan province has no detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, Semnan is considered a SARS-CoV-2 susceptible area. These results emphasize the need for maintaining public health measures to tackle the new epidemic wave.","Jandaghi, Elahe; Hemati, Maral; Mohammadlou, Maryam; Jandaghi, Jafar; Mirmohammadkhani, Majid; Danaei, Navid; Kokhaei, Parviz",Iran J Immunol,,339

Here, we develop an optimal ordering quantity inventory model of deteriorating items, which are still in demand depending upon the selling price of the product. The items are assumed to be noninstantaneous deteriorating. The shortage is allowed in lead time and is partially backlogged. A solution procedure is presented to determine an optimal cycle, order quantity, and total average cost. A realistic numerical example is given to validate the proposed model by changing different systems of parameters, where sensitivity analysis has been carried out. The effectiveness of the system has been observed through graphical representation.

Men have been becoming severely ill at a higher rate than women. These data along with an age-dependent disease susceptibility and mortality in the elderly suggest that sex hormones are the main factors in determining the clinical course of the infection. The differences in aging males versus females and the role of sex hormones in key phenotypes of COVID-19 infection are described in this review.

The promising efficacy results in dermatology and rheumatology prompted the evaluation of these drugs in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, but the onset of paradoxical events (disease exacerbation after treatment with a theoretically curative drug) prevented their approval in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). To date, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these paradoxical effects are not well defined, and there are no clear guidelines for the management of patients with disease flare or new IBD onset after anti-IL-17 drug therapy. In this review, we summarise the literature on putative mechanisms, the clinical digestive effects after therapy with IL-17 inhibitors and provide guidance for the management of these paradoxical effects in clinical practice.","Fauny, Marine; Moulin, David; D039,; Amico, Ferdinando; Netter, Patrick; Petitpain, Nadine; Arnone, Djesia; Jouzeau, Jean-Yves; Loeuille, Damien; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",Ann. rheum. dis,,339
275421,A systematic review of COVID-19 and obstructive sleep apnoea,2020,"Given the dearth need for healthcare workers in the control of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, e-learning has been adopted in many settings to hasten the continuation of medical training. However, there is a paucity of data in low resource settings on the plausibility of online learning platforms to support medical education. We aimed to assess the awareness, attitudes, preferences, and challenges to e-learning among Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) and Bachelor of Nursing (B.NUR) students at Makerere University, Uganda. An online cross-sectional study was conducted between July and August 2020. Current MBChB and B.NUR students aged 18 years or older constituted the study population. Using Google forms, a web-based questionnaire was administered through the Makerere University mailing list and WhatsApp messenger. The questionnaire was developed using validated questions from previously published studies. Overall, 221 participants responded (response rate = 61%). Of the 214 valid responses, 195 (92.1%) were Ugandans, 123 (57.5% were male, and 165 (77.1%) were pursuing the MB ChB program. The median age was 23 (18 to 40) years. Ownership of computers, smartphones, and email addresses were at 131 (61.2%), 203 (94.9%), and 208 (97.2%), respectively. However, only 57 (26.6%) respondents had access to high or very high quality internet access. Awareness and self-reported usage of e-learning (MUELE) platforms were high among 206 (96.3%) and 177 (82.7%) respondents, respectively. However, over 50% lacked skills in using the Makerere University e-learning (MUELE) platform. About half (n = 104, 49%) of the students believed that e-learning reduces the quality of knowledge attained and is not an efficient method of teaching. Monthly income (P = .006), internet connectivity quality (P < .001), computer ownership (P = .015) and frequency of usage of academic websites or applications (P = .006) significantly affected attitudes towards e-learning. Moreover, internet costs and poor internet connectivity were the most important barriers to e-learning reported by 199 (93%) and 179 (84%) students, respectively. Sensitization and training of students and faculty on e-learning and use of existing learning platforms are important to improve the attitude and use of e-learning. Blended online and use of offline downloadable learning materials would overcome the challenges related to the variable quality of internet access in the country.","Olum, Ronald; Atulinda, Linda; Kigozi, Edwin; Nassozi, Dianah Rhoda; Mulekwa, Alzan; Bongomin, Felix; Kiguli, Sarah",J Med Educ Curric Dev,,339

This study aimed to explore registered nurses' competence in nursing care and their intention to stay in their current workplace. In this study, participants who had graduated from different nursing education systems were recruited. The results indicated that nurses' level of commitment to the workplace and clinical stress were positively correlated with the experience of working with patients. Stepwise regression analysis revealed the following significant predictors for intention to stay: clinical stress, frequency of caring for people with infections, and taking a course on infectious nursing. The novice nurses' competencies in the areas of pandemic disease care and care for infectious adults depended on the experience of nursing care and nursing competence in their professional careers, which may have impact on the nurses' intention to stay. Therefore, clinical stress, frequency of caring for patients, and taking nursing courses were correlated with novice nurses' intention to stay in their professional careers.","Chen, Hsiao-Mei; Liu, Chien-Chi; Yang, Shang-Yu; Wang, Yu-Rung; Hsieh, Pei-Lun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,339

The most common approach is to fit a linear regression of student current achievement on student prior achievement, where the school effects are the school means of the predicted residuals. In the literature further adjustments are made for student sociodemographics and sometimes school composition and 'non-malleable' characteristics. However, accountability systems typically make fewer adjustments: for transparency to end users, because data is unavailable or of insufficient quality, or for ideological reasons. There is therefore considerable interest in understanding the extent to which simpler models give similar school effects to more theoretically justified but complex models.

The Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) conducts studies on the etiology and characteristics of U.S. hospitalized adults with influenza. It began enrolling patients with COVID-19 hospitalizations in March 2020. Patients with influenza were compared with those with COVID-19 in the first months of the U.S. epidemic. METHODS: Adults aged &#8805; 18 years admitted to hospitals in 4 sites with acute respiratory illness were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19. Demographic and illness characteristics were collected for influenza illnesses during 3 seasons 2016-2019. Similar data were collected on COVID-19 cases admitted before June 19, 2020. RESULTS: Age groups hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 914) were similar to those admitted with influenza (n = 1937); 80% of patients with influenza and 75% of patients with COVID-19 were aged &#8805;50 years. Deaths from COVID-19 that occurred in younger patients were less often related to underlying conditions. White non-Hispanic persons were overrepresented in influenza (64%) compared with COVID-19 hospitalizations (37%).

Network meta-analysis was conducted to examine possible relationships between EtOH consumption and COVID-19 pathologies. METHODS: Molecules affected by EtOH exposure were identified by analysis with QIAGEN Knowledge Base. Molecules affected by COVID-19 were identified from studies in MEDLINE, bioRxiv, and medRxiv reporting gene expression profiles in COVID-19 patients, QIAGEN Coronavirus Network Explorer, and analysis of the RNA-sequencing data of autopsied lungs of COVID-19 patients retrieved from the GEO database. Network meta-analysis was then conducted on these molecules using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies reporting significant gene expression changes in COVID-19 patients were identified. One RNA-sequencing dataset on autopsied lungs of COVID-19 patients was retrieved from GEO. Our network meta-analysis suggests that EtOH exposure may augment the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on hepatic fibrosis signaling pathway, cellular metabolism and homeostasis, inflammation, and neuroinflammation. EtOH may also enhance the activity of key mediators including cytokines, such as IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF, and transcription factors, such as JUN and STAT, while inhibiting the activity of anti-inflammatory mediators including glucocorticoid receptor. Furthermore, IL-1ß, IL-6, TNF, JUN, and STAT were mapped to 10 pathways predicted to associate with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including HMGB1, IL-1, and IL-6 signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analyses demonstrate that EtOH exposure may augment SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation by altering the activity of key inflammatory mediators. Our findings suggest that it is important for clinicians to caution patients about the risk of alcohol consumption, which has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also call for further investigation into how alcohol exposure affects viral infections.","Huang, Wenfei; Zhou, Heping; Hodgkinson, Colin; Montero, Angelo; Goldman, David; Chang, Sulie L",Alcohol Clin Exp Res,,339

Methods: Epidemiological investigation was conducted to collect the information of confirmed COVID-19 cases, including demographic, epidemiological and clinical information. Results: As of 25 February 2020, a total of 91 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in Gansu. The epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu can be divided as three different stages, i.e. imported case stage, imported-case plus indigenous case stage, and indigenous case stage. A total of 63 cases were clustered cases (69.23%), 3 cases were medical staff infected with non-occupational exposure. The initial symptoms included fever (54.95%, 50/91), cough (52.75%, 48/91), or fatigue (28.57%, 26/91), the proportion of each symptom showed a decreasing trend along with the three epidemic stages, but only the differences in proportions of fever (trend &#967;2=2.20, P<0.05) and fatigue (trend &#967;2=3.18, P<0.05) among the three epidemic stages were statistically significant. The cases with critical severe symptoms accounted for 42.85% (6/14), 23.73% (14/59) and 16.67% (3/18), respectively, in three epidemic stages, showed a decreasing trend (H=6.45, P<0.05). Also, the incubation period prolonged along with the epidemic stage (F=51.65, P<0.01), but the intervals between disease onset and hospital visit (F=5.32, P<0.01), disease onset and diagnosis (F=5.25, P<0.01) became shorter along with the epidemic stage. Additionally, the basic reproduction number (R0) had decreased from 2.61 in imported case stage to 0.66 in indigenous case stage. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic in Gansu was caused by the imported cases, and about 2/3 cases were clustered ones. No medical worker was observed to be infected by occupational exposure. With the progression of COVID-19 epidemic in Gansu, the change in initial symptom and incubation period suggests, the early screening cannot only depend on body temperature monitoring.","Gou, F X; Zhang, X S; Yao, J X; Yu, D S; Wei, K F; Zhang, H; Yang, X T; Yang, J J; Liu, H X; Cheng, Y; Jiang, X J; Zheng, Y H; Wu, B; Liu, X F; Li, H",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,339

The fact that the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 as the cell entry receptor and that hypertension as well as cardiovascular disorders frequently coexist with COVID-19 have generated considerable discussion on the management of patients with hypertension. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates the development of and adaptation to a ""New Normal"" lifestyle, which will have a profound impact not only on communicable diseases but also on noncommunicable diseases, including hypertension. Summarizing what is known and what requires further investigation in this field may help to address the challenges we face. In the present review, we critically evaluate the existing evidence for the epidemiological association between COVID-19 and hypertension. We also summarize the current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection with an emphasis on ACE2, the cardiovascular system, and the kidney. Finally, we review evidence on the use of antihypertensive medication, namely, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, in patients with COVID-19.","Shibata, Shigeru; Arima, Hisatomi; Asayama, Kei; Hoshide, Satoshi; Ichihara, Atsuhiro; Ishimitsu, Toshihiko; Kario, Kazuomi; Kishi, Takuya; Mogi, Masaki; Nishiyama, Akira; Ohishi, Mitsuru; Ohkubo, Takayoshi; Tamura, Kouichi; Tanaka, Masami; Yamamoto, Eiichiro; Yamamoto, Koichi; Itoh, Hiroshi",Hypertens Res,,339

As long as effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, self-isolation and quarantine as well as far-reaching shutdowns of economic activity and public life are the only available strategies to prevent the virus from spreading. These interventions must meet conflicting requirements where some objectives, like the minimization of disease-related deaths or the impact on health systems, demand for stronger counter-measures, while others, such as social and economic costs, call for weaker counter-measures. Therefore, finding the optimal compromise of counter-measures requires the solution of a multi-objective optimization problem that is based on accurate prediction of future infection spreading for all combinations of counter-measures under consideration. We present a strategy for construction and solution of such a multi-objective optimization problem with real-world applicability. The strategy is based on a micro-model allowing for accurate prediction via a realistic combination of person-centric data-driven human mobility and behavior, stochastic infection models and disease progression models including micro-level inclusion of governmental intervention strategies. For this micro-model, a surrogate macro-model is constructed and validated that is much less computationally expensive and can therefore be used in the core of a numerical solver for the multi-objective optimization problem. The resulting set of optimal compromises between counter-measures (Pareto front) is discussed and its meaning for policy decisions is outlined.","Wulkow, Hanna; Conrad, Tim O F; Djurdjevac Conrad, Natasa; Müller, Sebastian A; Nagel, Kai; Schütte, Christof",PLoS One,,339

295092,Paediatric severe asthma biologics service: from hospital to home,2021,"OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is spreading worldwide. As a consequence of the new circumstances, almost all endoscopic units underwent in-depth reorganization involving patients' selection. We analyzed the efficacy of the newly adopted endoscopic triage. METHODS: In March 2020, we monitored endoscopies to evaluate the effects of the novel selective triage aimed to reduce the number of investigations and viral spread/contagions. Clinical-demographic data of the patients, indications, type of endoscopy, endoscopic findings (subtyped in major and minor), finding rates (major and minor) and diagnostic yields (major findings) have been analyzed and compared to the endoscopic procedures performed in March 2019. Furthermore, patients were called at least 21 days after the endoscopy to evaluate the possibility of a Covid-19 onset. RESULTS: Accordingly to the novel triage, the number of procedures dropped from 530 to 91 (-84%). The finding rates and diagnostic yields were 83% (74-89) vs 71% (66-73) (P 0.015) and 56% (46-65) vs 43% (38-47) (P 0.03) on March 2020 and March 2019, respectively. A significant increase of operative procedures has been reported in 2020, 34% vs 22% in March 2019. All the patients were recalled and neither cases of onset of Covid-19 like symptoms nor positive nasopharyngeal swabs PCR have been evidenced. CONCLUSION: The novel endoscopic triage significantly reduced the number of procedures and increased finding rates and diagnostic yields. However, a careful schedule of canceled procedures should be applied to avoid to miss relevant pathologies. No Covid-19 onset or infection has been noted after endoscopies.","Elli, Luca; Tontini, Gian Eugenio; Filippi, Elisabetta; Scaramella, Lucia; Cantù, Paolo; Vecchi, Maurizio; Bertè, Roberto; Baldassarri, Annarita; Penagini, Roberto",Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,,339

Here, we examine global significant changes in HCHO columns at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic (January-April 2020) compared with the same period in 2019 with observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). HCHO columns decline (11.0%) in the Northern China Plain (NCP) because of a combination of meteorological impacts, lower HCHO yields as NO x emission plunges (by 36.0%), and reduced NMVOC emissions (by 15.0%) resulting from the lockdown. HCHO columns change near Beijing (+8.4%) due mainly to elevated hydroxyl radical as NO x emission decreases in a NO x -saturated regime. HCHO columns change in Australia (+17.5%), Northeastern Myanmar of Southeast Asia (+14.9%), Central Africa (+7.8%), and Central America (+18.9%), consistent with fire activities. Our work also points to other changes related to temperature and meteorological variations.","Sun, Wenfu; Zhu, Lei; De Smedt, Isabelle; Bai, Bin; Pu, Dongchuan; Chen, Yuyang; Shu, Lei; Wang, Dakang; Fu, Tzung-May; Wang, Xiaofei; Yang, Xin",Geophys Res Lett,,339
297244,Early Insights From a Digitally Enhanced Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support Program: Single-Arm Nonrandomized Trial,2021,"AIMS: Public Health England has identified that in COVID-19, death rates among ethnic minorities far exceeds that of the white population. While the increase in ethnic minorities is likely to be multifactorial, to date, no studies have looked to see whether values for routine clinical biochemistry parameters differ between ethnic minority and white individuals. METHODS: Baseline biochemical data for 22 common tests from 311 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients presenting to hospital in April 2020 in whom ethnicity data were available was retrospectively collected and evaluated. Data comparisons between ethnic minority and white groups were made for all patient data and for the subset of patients subsequently admitted to intensive care. RESULTS: When all patient data were considered, the ethnic minority population had statistically significant higher concentrations of C reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, while troponin T was higher in the white group. A greater proportion of ethnic minority patients were subsequently admitted to intensive care, but when the presenting biochemistry of this subset of patients was compared, no significant differences were observed between ethnic minority and white groups. CONCLUSION: Our data show for the first time that routine biochemistry at hospital presentation in COVID-19 differs between ethnic minority and white groups. Among the markers identified, CRP was significantly higher in the ethnic minority group pointing towards an increased tendency for severe inflammation in this group.","Taylor, David R; Buchanan, Devon; Al-Hasani, Wiaam; Kearney, Jessica; Mazaheri, Tina; Ranasinghe, Ruvini N K; Dimitriadis, Georgios K; Vincent, Royce P",J. clin. pathol,,339
297282,COVID-19 Exposure Risk by Speakers of Spanish and English Using a Web-Based Self-assessment Tool,2021,"The outbreak of corona virus disease (COVID-19) caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 began in Wuhan, China, resulting in respiratory disorders. In January of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic owing to its global spread. Because no studies have investigated COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, this study investigated similarities and differences between demographic data during the COVID-19 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective trend analysis was performed to assess demographic data of all laboratory-confirmed MERS and COVID-19 cases. Patients' charts were reviewed for data on demographics, mortality, citizenship, sex ratio, and age groups with descriptive and comparative statistics; the data were analyzed using a non-parametric binomial test and chi-square test. Of all COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia,78%were male patients and 22% were female patients. This proportion of male COVID-19 patients was similar to that of male MERS patients, which also affected male patients more frequently than female patients. The number of COVID-19-positive Saudi cases was lower than that of non-Saudi cases, which were in contrast to that of MERS; COVID-19 appeared to be remarkably similar to MERS with respect to recovered cases. However, the numbers of critical and dead COVID-19 patients have been much lower than those of MERS patients. The largest proportion of COVID-19 and MERS cases (44.05% and 40.8%, respectively) were recorded in the Western region. MERS and COVID-19 exhibited similar threats to the lives of adults and the elderly, despite lower mortality rates during the COVID-19 epidemic. Targeted prevention of and interventions against MERS should be allocated populations according to the areas where they inhabit.

300840,Masks Do More Than Protect Others During COVID-19: Reducing the Inoculum of SARS-CoV-2 to Protect the Wearer,2020,"Local delivery platforms are collaborative undertakings where local stores offer instant-delivery to local customers ordering their products online. Offering such delivery services both cost-efficiently and reliably is one of the main challenges for local delivery platforms, as they face a complex, dynamic, stochastic dynamic pickup-and-delivery problem. Orders need to be consolidated to increase the efficiency of the delivery operations and thereby enable a high service guarantee towards the customer and stores. But, waiting for consolidation opportunities may jeopardize delivery service reliability in the future, and thus requires anticipating future demand. This paper introduces a generic approach to balance the consolidation potential and delivery urgency of orders. Specifically, it presents a newly developed parameterized Cost-Function Approximation (CFA) approach that modifies a set-packing formulation with two parameters. This CFA approach not only anticipates future demand but also utilizes column generation to search the large decision space related to pickup-and-delivery problems fast. Inspired by a motivating application in the city of Groningen, the Netherlands, numerical experiments show that our CFA approach strongly increases perceived customer satisfaction while lowering the total travel time of the vehicles compared to various benchmark policies. Furthermore, our CFA also reduces the percentage of late deliveries, and their lateness, to a minimum. Finally, our approach may assist managers in practice to manage the non-trivial balance between consolidation opportunity and delivery urgency.","Schrotenboer, Albert H.; Broek, Michiel A. J.

Despite the respiratory complication which is the most common symptomatology, multi-organ dysfunction and multiple cardiovascular complications were described such as acute myocarditis, heart failure and even arrhythmias. Cases presentation: Two patients aged 26 and 56 year-old, developed acute myocarditis related to Covid-19 infection but with different symptomatology. Case 1: Presented to the emergency room with digestive symptomatology, Covid-19 infection was confirmed by a positive chest CT scan and positive COVID-19 serology testing. Clinical, biological, radiological findings allowed making the diagnosis of a Covid-19 infection with a bacterial superinfection complicated by a fulminant myocarditis. Case 2: Presented to the emergency department with a chest pain, dyspnoea, paroxistic cough, myalgia and fever. A Covid-19 infection was confirmed. The electrocardiogram showed a diffuse ST elevation, echocardiography showed normal systolic function and the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I level was high. Invasive coronary angiography was performed, revealing angiographically normal coronary arteries. Clinical discussion: Our 2 cases was treated differently, case 1 received antibiotherapy because of the bacterial superinfection and inotropic support for the septic and cardiogenic choc. Contrarily to case 2 who received inotropic support, immunoglobulin and corticosteroid. With a total recovery for both patients. Conclusion: This article can help in considering cardiac affection due to SARS-CoV2, even with poor respiratory symptomatology, and to insist on the importance of the cardiac evaluation for young patients with a sever Covid-19 infection.","Kallel, O; Bourouis, I; Bougrine, R; Housni, B; El Ouafi, N; Ismaili, N",Ann Med Surg (Lond),,339

This includes the impact on physical activity, dietary patterns, alcohol consumption and the resulting consequences, for example increases in body weight. Other risk factors for increases in BP and cardiovascular risk such as smoking, emotional/psychologic stress, changes in sleep patterns and diurnal rhythms may also exhibit significant changes in addition to novel factors such as air pollution and environmental noise. We also highlight potential preventive measures to improve BP control because hypertension is the leading preventable risk factor for worldwide health during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kreutz, Reinhold; Dobrowolski, Piotr; Prejbisz, Aleksander; Algharably, Engi A E-H; Bilo, Grzegorz; Creutzig, Felix; Grassi, Guido; Kotsis, Vasilios; Lovic, Dragan; Lurbe, Empar; Modesti, Pietro A; Pappaccogli, Marco; Parati, Gianfranco; Persu, Alexandre; Polonia, Jorge; Rajzer, Marek; de Timary, Philippe; Weber, Thomas; Weisser, Burkhard; Tsioufis, Konstantinos; Mancia, Giuseppe; Januszewicz, Andrzej",J Hypertens,,339

Relief measures instituted by World Bank Group (WBG) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help in the prevention, detection and treatment of coronavirus amidst SSA non-monetary measures and business support interventions are highlighted. The underlying economic challenges likely to impede WBG and IMF relief measures in SSA such as health infrastructure and resource deficiency, unsustainable high debt levels and drought effects due to climate change are analysed. Ranking the inadequate doctor-to-population ratio from 2015 to 2017, SSA ratio stood at less than 1 per 1000 population recommended World Health Organisation standard. On the credit front, other creditors such as China have contributed to prevailing economic challenges as China Official Development Assistance (ODA) to SSA debt ratio is depicted at 55% in 2016 from a low ratio of 17% in 2009. The economic challenges are further buttressed by estimated monthly tourism sector loss of US$8.8 billion per month for SSA countries during the pandemic. SSA self-employed informal sector that accounts for 76% (International Labour Organisation 2018) is equally affected amid lockdowns, business losses, closures and job losses. Economic growth is forecasted to drop to 1.8%, from a previous estimate of 3.2% according to United Nations Economic Commission (2020) due to a trade fall with developed and emerging markets. Recovery is aligned to good resilience in inherent cyber risk, oil intensity and urbanisation rate and policies to enhance production and the agriculture sector.","Ndiili, Nchimunya",Environ Syst Decis,,339

Accurately identifying patients at an increased risk of deterioration may help hospitals manage their resources while improving the quality of patient care. Here we present the results of an analytical model, PICTURE (Predicting Intensive Care Transfers and Other UnfoReseen Events), to identify patients at a high risk for imminent intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, respiratory failure, or death with the intention to improve prediction of deterioration due to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To validate the PICTURE model's ability to predict unexpected deterioration in general ward and COVID-19 patients, and to compare its performance with the Epic Deterioration Index (EDI), an existing model which has recently been assessed for use in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The PICTURE model was trained and validated on a cohort of hospitalized non-COVID-19 patients using electronic health record data from 2014-2018. It was then applied to two hold-out test sets: non-COVID-19 patients from 2019 and patients testing positive for COVID-19 in 2020. PICTURE results were aligned to EDI and NEWS scores for head-to-head comparison via Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC) and Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC). We compared the models' ability to predict an adverse event (defined as ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation use, or death). Shapley values were used to provide explanations for PICTURE predictions. RESULTS: In non-COVID-19 general ward patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.819 (0.805 - 0.834) per observation, compared to the EDI's 0.763 (0.746 - 0.781) (n = 21,740, P < 0.001). In patients testing positive for COVID-19, PICTURE again outperformed the EDI with an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.849 (0.820 - 0.878) compared to the EDI's 0.803 (0.772 - 0.838) (n = 607, P < 0.001). The most important variables influencing PICTURE predictions in the COVID-19 cohort were a rapid respiratory rate, a high level of oxygen support, low oxygen saturation, and impaired mental status (Glasgow coma score). CONCLUSIONS: The PICTURE model is more accurate in predicting adverse patient outcomes for both general ward patients and COVID-19 positive patients in our cohorts compared to the EDI. The ability to consistently anticipate these events may be especially valuable when considering potential incipient waves of COVID-19 infections. The generalizability of the model will require testing in other health care systems for validation.","Cummings, Brandon C; Ansari, Sardar; Motyka, Jonathan R; Wang, Guan; Medlin, Richard P; Kronick, Steven L; Singh, Karandeep; Park, Pauline K; Napolitano, Lena M; Dickson, Robert P; Mathis, Michael R; Sjoding, Michael W; Admon, Andrew J; Blank, Ross; McSparron, Jakob I; Ward, Kevin R; Gillies, Christopher E",,,339

We compared the models' ability to predict an adverse event (defined as ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation use, or death). Shapley values were used to provide explanations for PICTURE predictions. RESULTS: In non-COVID-19 general ward patients, PICTURE achieved an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.819 (0.805 - 0.834) per observation, compared to the EDI's 0.763 (0.746 - 0.781) (n = 21,740, P < 0.001). In patients testing positive for COVID-19, PICTURE again outperformed the EDI with an AUROC (95% CI) of 0.849 (0.820 - 0.878) compared to the EDI's 0.803 (0.772 - 0.838) (n = 607, P < 0.001). The most important variables influencing PICTURE predictions in the COVID-19 cohort were a rapid respiratory rate, a high level of oxygen support, low oxygen saturation, and impaired mental status (Glasgow coma score). CONCLUSIONS: The PICTURE model is more accurate in predicting adverse patient outcomes for both general ward patients and COVID-19 positive patients in our cohorts compared to the EDI. The ability to consistently anticipate these events may be especially valuable when considering potential incipient waves of COVID-19 infections. The generalizability of the model will require testing in other health care systems for validation.","Cummings, Brandon C; Ansari, Sardar; Motyka, Jonathan R; Wang, Guan; Medlin, Richard P; Kronick, Steven L; Singh, Karandeep; Park, Pauline K; Napolitano, Lena M; Dickson, Robert P; Mathis, Michael R; Sjoding, Michael W; Admon, Andrew J; Blank, Ross; McSparron, Jakob I; Ward, Kevin R; Gillies, Christopher E",,,339

308438,My COVID-19,2021,"Inferring the input parameters of simulators from observations is a crucial challenge with applications from epidemiology to molecular dynamics. Here we show a simple approach in the regime of sparse data and approximately correct models, which is common when trying to use an existing model to infer latent variables with observed data. This approach is based on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and provably makes the smallest change in the latent joint distribution to fit new data. This method requires no likelihood or model derivatives and its fit is insensitive to prior strength, removing the need to balance observed data fit with prior belief. The method requires the ansatz that data is fit in expectation, which is true in some settings and may be reasonable in all with few data points. The method is based on sample reweighting, so its asymptotic run time is independent of prior distribution dimension. We demonstrate this MaxEnt approach and compare with other likelihood-free inference methods across three systems: a point particle moving in a gravitational field, a compartmental model of epidemic spread and finally molecular dynamics simulation of a protein.","Barrett, Rainier; Ansari, Mehrad; Ghoshal, Gourab; White, Andrew D",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09668v2.pdf,339

Patients and Methods: Medical record review of all patients assigned a diagnosis code of COVID-19 (DB342A or DB972A) at six Danish departments of infectious diseases from February 27 through May 4, 2020. Confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis was defined as either: 1) definite, a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a respiratory sample combined with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19: 2) probable, clinical presentation of COVID-19 without detection of SARS-CoV-2 and no alternative diagnoses considered more likely;or 3) possible, clinical presentation of COVID-19 without detection of SARS-CoV-2, and the patient was discharged or deceased before further investigations were carried out. We computed the PPV with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the number of patients with confirmed (i.e., definite, probable, and possible) COVID-19 divided by the number of patients assigned a diagnosis code for COVID-19. Results: The study included 710 patients with a median age of 61 years (interquartile range [IQR] 47-74) and 285/710 (40%) were female. COVID-19 was confirmed in 706/710 (99%) with 705/710 (99%) categorized as definite, 1/710 (0.1%) as probable, and 0 patients as possible COVID-19. The diagnosis was disproven in 4/710 (0.6%) patients who were hospitalized due to bacterial pneumonia (n = 2), influenza (n = 1), and urinary tract infection (n = 1). The overall PPV for COVID-19 was 99% (95% CI 99-100) and remained consistently high among all subgroups including sex, age groups, calendar period, and stratified by diagnosis code and department of infectious diseases (range 97-100%). Conclusion: The overall PPV of diagnosis codes for COVID-19 in Denmark was high and may be suitable for future registry-based prognosis studies of COVID-19.","Bodilsen, J.; Leth, S.; Nielsen, S.

METHODS: In 2019, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) Telehealth Working Group surveyed PIDS members to collect data on the use of TH modalities, adoption barriers, interest, extent of curbside consultations (CC), and reimbursement. RESULTS: Of 1,213 PIDS members, 161 (13.3%) completed the survey, and the responses of 154 (12.7%) from the US were included in our report. Medical school (63.6%) and hospital (44.8%) were the commonest work settings with 16.9% practicing in both of them. The most common TH modalities used were synchronous provider-patient virtual visits (20.8%) and synchronous provider-provider consultations (13.6%). TH services included outpatient consultations (48.1%), vaccine recommendations (43.5%), inpatient consultations (39.6%) and travel advice (39.6%). Barriers perceived by respondents included reimbursement (55.8%), lack of experience with TH (55.2%), lack of institutional support (52.6%), lack of administrative support (50%), and cost of implementation (48.7%). Most respondents (144, 93.5%) were interested in implementing a wide range of TH modalities. CCs accounted for 1-20 hours/week among 148 respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the PIDS survey respondents reported low utilization of TH and several perceived barriers to TH adoption before the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, they expressed a strong interest in adopting different TH modalities. They also reported spending considerable time on non-reimbursed CCs from within and outside their institutions. Results of this survey provide baseline information that will allow comparisons with post-COVID-19 changes in the adoption of TH in PID.","Hakim, Amin; Gaviria-Agudelo, Claudia; Edwards, Kathryn; Olson, Daniel",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,,339

Smart homes have the potential to help older adults to live independently and healthy, improving their quality of life, and relieving the pressure on the healthcare and social care systems. For that, we need to understand how older adults live and their needs. Thus, this study aims to analyze the residentially-based lifestyles (RBL) of older adults and segment them to compare and analyze the real needs of smart home functions for each group. To identify a person's RBL, a questionnaire was designed to include questions about activities at home, social events, quality of life, etc. This study surveyed 271 older Koreans. As a result of the survey on RBL, five groups with different characteristics were clustered. Finally, each groups' features and the differences in their needs for smart home functions were compared and analyzed. The priority of needed functions for each group was found to be significantly different. In a total of 26 smart home functions, there were meaningful differences in the needs for 16 functions among the groups. This study presents the results in South Korea, according to older adults' RBL and their smart home needs.","Yu, Jiyeon; de Antonio, Angelica; Villalba-Mora, Elena",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,339

The Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports initiated and developed CoronaMelder, a COVID-19 contact tracing app. This app is based on a Google/Apple Exposure Notification approach and aims to combat the spread of the coronavirus among individuals by notifying those who are at increased risk of infection due to proximity to someone who later tests positive for COVID-19. The app should support traditional contact tracing by faster tracing and greater reach compared to regular contact tracing procedures. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this study is to investigate whether the CoronaMelder is able to support traditional contact tracing employed by public health authorities. To achieve this, usability tests were conducted to answer the following question: is the CoronaMelder user-friendly, understandable, reliable and credible, and inclusive? METHODS: Participants (N=44) of different backgrounds were recruited: youth with varying educational levels, youth with an intellectual disability, migrants, adults (aged 40-64 years), and older adults (aged >65 years) via convenience sampling in the region of Twente in the Netherlands. The app was evaluated with scenario-based, think-aloud usability tests and additional interviews. Findings were recorded via voice recordings, observation notes, and the Dutch User Experience Questionnaire, and some participants wore eye trackers to measure gaze behavior. RESULTS: Our results showed that the app is easy to use, although problems occurred with understandability and accessibility. Older adults and youth with a lower education level did not understand why or under what circumstances they would receive notifications, why they must share their key (ie, their assigned identifier), and what happens after sharing. In particular, youth in the lower-education category did not trust or understand Bluetooth signals, or comprehend timing and follow-up activities after a risk exposure notification. Older adults had difficulties multitasking (speaking with a public health worker and simultaneously sharing the key in the app). Public health authorities appeared to be unprepared to receive support from the app during traditional contact tracing because their telephone conversation protocol lacks guidance, explanation, and empathy. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that the CoronaMelder app is easy to use, but participants experienced misunderstandings about its functioning. The perceived lack of clarity led to misconceptions about the app, mostly regarding its usefulness and privacy-preserving mechanisms. Tailored and targeted communication through, for example, public campaigns or social media, is necessary to provide correct information about the app to residents in the Netherlands. Additionally, the app should be presented as part of the national coronavirus measures instead of as a stand-alone app offered to the public. Public health workers should be trained to effectively and empathetically instruct users on how to use the CoronaMelder app.","Bente, Britt Elise; 039, van; t Klooster, Jan Willem Jaap Roderick; Schreijer, Maud Annemarie; Berkemeier, Lea; van Gend, Joris Elmar; Slijkhuis, Peter Jan Hendrik; Kelders, Saskia Marion; van Gemert-Pijnen, Julia Elisabeth Wilhelmina Cornelia",JMIR Form Res,,339

We evaluated the impact of a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccination campaign on reducing incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States (US). Methods: We developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and parameterized it with US demographics and age-specific COVID-19 outcomes. Healthcare workers and high-risk individuals were prioritized for vaccination, while children under 18 years of age were not vaccinated. We considered a vaccine efficacy of 90% against infection following 2 doses administered 28 days apart achieving 40% vaccine coverage of the overall population. We specified 10% pre-existing population immunity for the base-case scenario and calibrated to an effective reproduction number of 1.5, accounting for current COVID-19 interventions in the US. Results: Vaccination reduced the overall attack rate to 1.6% (95% CI: 1.3% - 1.8%) from 7.1% (95% CI: 6.3% - 7.9%) across the same period without vaccination. The highest relative reduction (83-90%) was observed among individuals aged 65 and older. Vaccination markedly reduced adverse outcomes, with non-ICU, ICU hospitalizations, and deaths decreasing by 85.2% (95% CI: 82.3% - 87.6%), 85.3% (95% CI: 82.3% - 87.8%), and 87.8% (95% CI: 85.1% - 90.1%), respectively. Conclusions: Our results indicate that vaccination can have a substantial impact on reducing disease transmission and adverse clinical outcomes. However, with uptake of 40% or less in the population, vaccination is unlikely to completely eliminate the need for non-pharmaceutical interventions.","Moghadas, Seyed M; Vilches, Thomas N; Zhang, Kevin; Wells, Chad R; Shoukat, Affan; Singer, Burton H; Meyers, Lauren Ancel; Neuzil, Kathleen M; Langley, Joanne M; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C; Galvani, Alison P",,,339

This paper explores possible impacts of that closure on student achievement. Longstanding research suggests that lengthy periods of time out of school generally create losses of literacy and numeracy skills and widen student achievement gaps. New American studies have attributed sizeable learning losses to the COVID-19 closures. In lieu of comparable Canadian data, this paper extrapolates from summer learning research to estimate likely shortfalls in literacy and numeracy skills. We draw on data from 14 cohorts of Ontario primary-grade students collected between 2010 and 2015 in which 3,723 attended summer programs and 12,290 served as controls. Across three plausible scenarios, we use meta analyses and OLS and quintile regression models to predict learning losses of 3.5 and 6.5 months among typically-performing and lower-performing students respectively, and achievement gaps that grow up to 1.5 years among same grade peers. After qualifying these predictions, we recommend that provincial ministries offer targeted supplementary programs during the summer and synchronous instruction in the event of future school closures.","Aurini, Janice; Davies, Scott",Can Rev Sociol,,339

Rapid transmission of COVID-19 has caused wide-spread panic. Many established medications have been used to treat the disease symptoms; however, no specific drugs or vaccines have been developed. Organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may serve as suitable infection models for ex vivo mimicking of the viral life cycle and drug screening. Human iPSC-3D organoids, self-organised tissues with multiple cell environments, have a similar structure and function as real human organs; hence, these organoids allow greater viral infection efficiency, mimic the natural host-virus interactions, and are suitable for long-term experimentation. Here, we suggest the use of a functional human iPSC-organoid that could act as a reliable and feasible ex vivo infection model for investigation of the virus. This approach will provide much needed insight into the underlying molecular dynamics of COVID-19 for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies.","Zhou, Hang; Liu, Li-Ping; Fang, Mei; Li, Yu-Mei; Zheng, Yun-Wen",Histol Histopathol,,339
316984,Access to Covid-19 Testing by Homeless/Housing-Insecure Individuals in Northeast Ohio,2020,"Recently, leadership literature has faced the challenge of dealing with a growing pervasive diffusion of information and communication technologies that are deeply changing relationships among workers. Consequently, leadership is continuing to develop through the support of these technologies. This emerging phenomenon has been labeled e-leadership, and it has been studied with the objective of understanding the differences it exhibits from traditional leadership. Our research seeks to examine whether enterprises, which use leadership as an important ""tool"" to manage workers as effectively as possible, are conscious of this evolution, whether their behavior is supportive of the related needs, and how they are organizing themselves to face the problems and opportunities arising in this new context. The present study involved 15 Italian companies. Through in-depth interviews based on face-to-face meetings using a semi-structured questionnaire with enterprises' representatives, we explored the extent of these changes. We developed the analysis across two points in time in order to verify if a change was observable with regard to the way these enterprises considered and managed e-leadership. It was also possible to enhance the role of the technologies themselves in leadership, which in the same period has seen a rapid evolution toward mobile and social developments. Our results help to illuminate that, on the one hand, awareness with regard to e-leadership has increased and, on the other hand, the pervasiveness of technologies is playing a relevant role in the change of leadership together with renewed attention toward soft competencies. We identify four different typologies of e-leadership, which summarize different ways of conceptualizing it, and indicate their main features. We should add that this topic is becoming extremely relevant because of the critical crises organizations are now facing (such as the COVID-19 emergency we are experiencing at the present time) and the urgency of adopting e-instruments, which seem now to be the main path to managing the present situation and the aftermath it inevitably will have. Despite this research being carried out before such an event has happened, we believe that its results may further enrich the current lively debate.","Torre, Teresina; Sarti, Daria",Front Psychol,,339

At present there is limited clinical information of the SARS-CoV-2 and there is no specific treatment recommended, although technical guidances and suggestions have been developed and will continue to be updated as additional information becomes available. Preventive treatment has an important role to control and avoid the spread of severe respiratory disease, but often is difficult to obtain and sometimes cannot be effective to reduce the risk of deterioration of the underlining lung pathology. In order to define an effective and safe treatment for SARS-CoV-2-associated disease, we provide considerations on the actual treatments, on how to avoid complications and the undesirable side effects related to them and to select and apply earlier the most appropriate treatment. Approaching to treat severe respiratory disease in infants and children, the risks related to the development of atelectasis starting invasive or non-invasive ventilation support and the risk of oxygen toxicity must be taken into serious consideration. For an appropriate and effective approach to treat severe pediatric respiratory diseases, two main different strategies can be proposed according to the stage and severity of the patient conditions: patient in the initial phase and with non-severe lung pathology and patient with severe initial respiratory impairment and/or with delay in arrival to observation. The final outcome is strictly connected with the ability to apply an appropriate treatment early and to reduce all the complications that can arise during the intensive care admission.","Marraro, Giuseppe A; Spada, Claudio",Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,,339

The majority of documents encouraged the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grain foods. Thirty-one percent of the guidelines highlighted the importance of minerals and vitamins such as zinc and vitamins C, A, and D to maintain a well-functioning immune system. Dietary supplementation has not been linked to COVID-19 prevention. However, supplementation with vitamins C and D, as well as with zinc and selenium, was highlighted as potentially beneficial for individuals with, or at risk of, respiratory viral infections or for those in whom nutrient deficiency is detected. There was no convincing evidence that food or food packaging is associated with the transmission of COVID-19, but good hygiene practices for handling and preparing foods were recommended. No changes to breastfeeding recommendations have been made, even in women diagnosed with COVID-19.","de Faria Coelho-Ravagnani, Christianne; Corgosinho, Flavia Campos; Sanches, Fabiane La Flor Ziegler; Prado, Carla Marques Maia; Laviano, Alessandro; Mota, João Felipe",Nutr. rev,,339

Although we have made tremendous progress in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease, a lot more remains to be learned. Mitochondria appear to be important in COVID-19 pathogenesis because of its role in innate antiviral immunity, as well as inflammation. This article examines pathogenesis of COVID-19 from a mitochondrial perspective and tries to answer some perplexing questions such as why the prognosis is so poor in those with obesity, metabolic syndrome, or type 2 diabetes. Although effective vaccines and antiviral drugs will be the ultimate solution to this crisis, a better understanding of disease mechanisms will open novel avenues for treatment and prevention.","Prasun, Pankaj",DNA cell biol,,339

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated barriers to access, thereby preventing many women from terminating unwanted pregnancies for an extended period. In this paper, we outline existing and COVID-specific barriers to abortion care and consider potential solutions, including the use of telemedicine, to overcome barriers to access during the pandemic and beyond. We explore the responses of governments throughout the world to the challenge of abortion access during the pandemic, which are an eclectic mix of progressive, neutral, and regressive policies. Finally, we call on all governments to recognize abortion as essential healthcare and act to ensure that the law does not continue to interfere with providers' ability to adapt to circumstances and to guarantee safe and appropriate care not only during the pandemic, but permanently.","Romanis, Elizabeth Chloe; Parsons, Jordan A",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,,339

With the onset of the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, several issues related to conducting social behavioural sciences research and related community engagement activities arise, especially in rural areas of low-income countries, where the coverage of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is limited and their application on field-based research would imply a biased selection of relatively more privileged minorities with access to on-line and other communication platforms not requiring physical contact. This article enumerates and discusses the different technical challenges that social behavioural sciences research and community engagement activities face in times of public health emergencies caused by pandemics such as COVID-19. It also highlights the possibility of using alternative approaches to maintain the engagement with members of rural communities in research and social action activities, as well as the ethical challenges arising from such approaches.","Magaço, Amílcar; Munguambe, Khátia; Nhacolo, Ariel; Ambrósio, Contardo; Nhacolo, Felizarda; Cossa, Saquina; Macete, Eusébio; Mandomando, Inácio",Glob Public Health,,339

328512,Optimising Ventilator Use during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Lactic acid bacteria are widespread in various ecological niches with the excess of nutrients and have reduced capabilities to adapt to starvation. Among more than 280 Lactobacillus species known to the date, only five, including Lactobacillus hilgardii, carry in their genome the gene encoding for PII-like protein, one of the central regulators of cellular metabolism generally responding to energy- and carbon-nitrogen status in many free-living Bacteria, Archaea and in plant chloroplasts. In contrast to the classical PII encoding genes, in L. hilgardii genome the gene for PII homologue is located within the potABCD operon, encoding the ABC transporter for polyamines. Based on the unique genetic context and low sequence identity with genes of any other so-far characterized PII subfamilies, we termed this gene potN (Pot-protein, Nucleotide-binding). The second specific feature of L. hilgardii genome is that many genes encoding the proteins with similar function are present in two copies, while with low mutual identity. Thus, L. hilgardii LMG 7934 genome carries two genes of glutamine synthetase with 55% identity. One gene is located within classical glnRA operon with the gene of GlnR-like transcriptional regulator, while the second is monocistronic. Together with the relative large genome of L. hilgardii as compared to other Lactobacilli (2.771.862 bp vs ~ 2.2 Mbp in median), these data suggest significant re-arrangements of the genome and a wider range of adaptive capabilities of L. hilgardii in comparison to other bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus.","Zhuravleva, Darya E; Iskhakova, Zalina I; Ozhegov, Georgii D; Gogoleva, Natalia E; Khusnutdinova, Dilyara R; Shagimardanova, Elena I; Forchhammer, Karl; Kayumov, Airat R",Curr. microbiol,,339

Yet, the applications are limited due to the lack of the tumor-selectivity for most of the reactants. Here we explored an alternative approach to leverage the rate constant by locally inducing an in vivo catalyst. We found that the desilylation-induced cleavage chemistry could be catalyzed in vivo by cationic micelles, and accelerated over 1400-fold under physiological condition. This micelle-catalyzed controlled release platform is demonstrated by the release of a 6-hydroxyl-quinoline-2-benzothiazole derivative (HQB) in two cancer cell lines and a NIR dye in mouse tumor xenografts. Through intravenous injection of a pH-sensitive polymer micelles, we successfully applied this strategy to a prodrug activation of hydroxyl camptothecin (OH-CPT) in tumors. Its ""decaging"" efficiency is 42-fold to that without cationic micelles-mediated catalysis. This micelle-catalyzed desilylation strategy unveils the potential that micelle may act beyond a carrier but a catalyst for local perturbing or activation.","Wang, Chunhong; Hong, Hanyu; Chen, Mengqi; Ding, Zexuan; Rui, Yuchen; Qi, Jianyuan; Li, Zi-Chen; Liu, Zhibo",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,339

Pregnant women and their fetuses are susceptible to viral infection, and outcomes in this population need to be investigated. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHAL, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, clinicaltrials.gov, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Cochrane Central Controlled Trials Registry will be searched for observational studies (cohort and control cases) published from December 2019 to present. This systematic review and meta-analysis will include studies of pregnant women at any gestational stage diagnosed with COVID-19. The primary outcomes will be maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality. Three independent reviewers will select the studies and extract data from the original publications. The risk of bias will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. To evaluate the strength of evidence from the included data, we will use Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method. Data synthesis will be performed using Review Manager software V.5.2.3. To assess heterogeneity, we will compute the I2 statistics. Additionally, a quantitative synthesis will be performed if the included studies are sufficiently homogenous. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study will be a review of the published data, and thus it is not necessary to obtain ethical approval. The findings of this systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

333314,Health and Social Precarity Among Americans Receiving Unemployment Benefits During the COVID-19 Outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND: We compared the clinical characteristics, findings, and outcomes of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or influenza to detect relevant differences. METHODS: From December 2019 to April 2020, we recruited all eligible hospitalized adults with respiratory infection to a prospective observational study at a tertiary care hospital in Finland. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR. Follow-up lasted for 3 months from admission. RESULTS: We included 61 patients, of whom 28 were COVID-19 and 33 influenza patients with median ages of 53 and 56 years. Majority of both COVID-19 and influenza patients were men (61% vs. 67%) and had at least one comorbidity (68% vs. 85%). Pulmonary diseases and current smoking were less common among COVID-19 than influenza patients (5 [18%] vs. 15 [45%], p=.03 and 1 [4%] vs. 10 [30%], p=.008). In chest X-ray at admission, ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations were more frequent among COVID-19 than influenza patients (19 [68%] and 7 [21%], p<.001). Severe disease and intensive care unit (ICU) admission occurred more often among COVID-19 than influenza patients (26 [93%] vs. 19 [58%], p=.003 and 8 [29%] vs. 2 [6%], p=.034). COVID-19 patients were hospitalized longer than influenza patients (six days [IQR 4-21] vs. 3 [2-4], p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral GGOs and consolidations in chest X-ray may help to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients had more severe disease, required longer hospitalization and were admitted to ICU more often than influenza patients, which has important implications for public health policies.","Auvinen, Raija; Nohynek, Hanna; Syrjänen, Ritva; Ollgren, Jukka; Kerttula, Tuija; Mäntylä, Jarkko; Ikonen, Niina; Loginov, Raisa; Haveri, Anu; Kurkela, Satu; Skogberg, Kirsi",Infect Dis (Lond),,339

Long-Term use of spectacles may prevent repeated touching and rubbing of the eyes. Aim: To know the association between infection with SARS-CoV-2 and wearing of spectacles. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in which 304 patients of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) were selected. Their spectacles wearing behaviour were assessed through a questionnaire. Spectacles wearing behaviour of general population were obtained from older studies (for comparison). Risk of COVID-19 was calculated in long-Term spectacles wearers as well as in persons not using spectacles. Chi-Square test was used for statistical analysis. Results: In this study, total 58 patients showed the behaviour of using spectacles continuously during day time and always on outdoor activities. The risk of COVID-19 was found 0.48 in spectacles wearing population as compared to 1.35 in population not using spectacles. The calculated Risk Ratio (RR) was 0.36. It indicates that the risk of COVID-19 was 2-3 times less in spectacles wearing population than the population not using spectacles. The protective effectiveness of the spectacles was found statistically significant (p-value=0.00113). Conclusion: The present study showed that the risk of COVID-19 was about 2-3 times less in spectacles wearing population than the population not wearing those.

335741,Temperature in Nursing Home Residents Systematically Tested for SARS-CoV-2,2020,"AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) often coexist. Catheter ablation has been reported to restore left ventricular (LV) function but patients benefit differently. This study investigated the correlation between left atrial (LA) fibrosis extent and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) recovery after AF ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 103 patients [64 years, 69% men, 79% persistent AF, LVEF 33% interquartile range (IQR) (25-38)] undergoing first time AF ablation were investigated. Identification of LA fibrosis and selection of ablation strategy were based on sinus rhythm voltage mapping. Continuous rhythm monitoring was used to assess ablation success. Improvement in post-ablation LVEF was measured as primary study endpoint. An absolute increase in post-ablation LVEF &#8805;10% was defined as 'Super Response'. Left atrial fibrosis was present in 38% of patients. After ablation LVEF increased by absolute 15% (IQR 6-25) (P < 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction improvement was higher in patients without LA fibrosis [15% (IQR 10-25) vs. 10% (IQR 0-20), P < 0.001]. An inverse correlation between LVEF improvement and the extent of LA fibrosis was found (R2 = 0.931). In multivariate analysis, the presence of LA fibrosis was the only independent predictor for failing LVEF improvement [odds ratio 7.2 (95% confidence interval 2.2-23.4), P < 0.001]. Echocardiographic 'Super Response' was observed in 55/64 (86%) patients without and 21/39 (54%) patients with LA fibrosis, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Presence and extent of LA fibrosis predict LVEF response in HF patients undergoing AF ablation. The assessment of LA fibrosis may impact prognostic stratification and clinical management in HF patients with AF.","Kirstein, Bettina; Neudeck, Sebastian; Gaspar, Thomas; Piorkowski, Judith; Wechselberger, Simon; Kronborg, Mads Brix; Zedda, Angela; Hankel, Anastasia; El-Armouche, Ali; Tomala, Jakub; Schmidt, Thomas; Mayer, Julia; Wagner, Michael; Ulbrich, Stefan; Pu, Liying; Richter, Utz; Huo, Yan; Piorkowski, Christopher",Europace,,339
336222,Water fluoridation: current challenges,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can cause neurological disease in humans, but little is known about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central nervous system (CNS). Herein, using K18-hACE2 mice, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion and encephalitis is associated with mortality in these mice. Intranasal infection of K18-hACE2 mice with 105 plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 100% mortality by day 6 after infection. The highest virus titers in the lungs were observed on day 3 and declined on days 5 and 6 after infection. By contrast, very high levels of infectious virus were uniformly detected in the brains of all the animals on days 5 and 6. Onset of severe disease in infected mice correlated with peak viral levels in the brain. SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited encephalitis hallmarks characterized by production of cytokines and chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, hemorrhage and neuronal cell death. SARS-CoV-2 was also found to productively infect cells within the nasal turbinate, eye and olfactory bulb, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain by this route after intranasal infection. Our data indicate that direct infection of CNS cells together with the induced inflammatory response in the brain resulted in the severe disease observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice.","Kumari, Pratima; Rothan, Hussin A; Natekar, Janhavi P; Stone, Shannon; Pathak, Heather; Strate, Philip G; Arora, Komal; Brinton, Margo A; Kumar, Mukesh",Viruses,,339

The propagation of new lineages and the discovery of key mechanisms adopted by the virus to overlap the immune system are central topics for the entire public health policies, research and disease management. Since the second semester of 2020, the mutation E484K has been progressively found in the Brazilian territory, composing different lineages over time. It brought multiple concerns related to the risk of reinfection and the effectiveness of new preventive and treatment strategies due to the possibility of escaping from neutralizing antibodies. To better characterize the current scenario we performed genomic and phylogenetic analyses of the E484K mutated genomes sequenced from Brazilian samples in 2020. From October 2020, more than 40% of the sequenced genomes present the E484K mutation, which was identified in three different lineages (P.1, P.2 and B.1.1.33 - posteriorly renamed as N.9) in four Brazilian regions. We also evaluated the presence of E484K associated mutations and identified selective pressures acting on the spike protein, leading us to some insights about adaptive and purifying selection driving the virus evolution.","Ferrareze, Patrícia Aline Gröhs; Franceschi, Vinícius Bonetti; de Menezes Mayer, Amanda; Caldana, Gabriel Dickin; Zimerman, Ricardo Ariel; Thompson, Claudia Elizabeth",Infect Genet Evol,,339

340475,First Person: No One is Ready for This,2020,"Background: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has now spread to a number of countries worldwide. While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number R 0, variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others. Methods: We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution. Results: Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R 0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for R 0 and k (95% CrIs: R 0 1.4-12; k 0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of R 0 was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution. Conclusions: Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.","Endo, Akira; Abbott, Sam; Kucharski, Adam J.; Funk, Sebastian; Eggo, Rosalind M.; Quilty, Billy J.; Bosse, Nikos I.; van Zandvoort, Kevin; Munday, James D.; Flasche, Stefan; Rosello, Alicia; Jit, Mark; John Edmunds, W.; Gimma, Amy; Liu, Yang; Prem, Kiesha; Gibbs, Hamish; Diamond, Charlie; Jarvis, Christopher I.; Davies, Nicholas; Sun, Fiona; Hellewell, Joel; Russell, Timothy W.; Jombart, Thibaut; Clifford, Samuel; Klepac, Petra; Medley, Graham; Pearson, Carl A.B.",Wellcome Open Res.,,339
340645,IDSA made 4 strong recommendations for preventing COVID-19 infection in health care personnel,2021,"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to maintain self-isolation, the vast majority of outpatient services are closed, and the inpatient clinics have limited the workload admitting almost only urgent cases. Outpatients, including ones with various sleep disorders, are left without access to the specialized examinations. This will lead to the late diagnosis and untimely therapy prescriptions. In such conditions, it is relevant to take into account new instrumental diagnostic methods that could be used by the patient themselves to register their vital parameters at home. The obtained data can be transmitted via the Internet to the attending physician for further analysis followed by prescriptions when required. One of these methods is bioradiolocation, which allows noncontact recording of breathing patterns, heart rate and movement of a person during sleep, as well as detection of various sleep disorders and determination of sleep stages. This method is easy to use, and can be recommended for home-screening by patients. Sleep has a significant immunomodulating function, and sleep assessment is important in both patients at risk and afflicted with novel coronavirus infection.

341352,The Rise and Fall of Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment and Prevention of COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Extensive studies indicate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) involves human sensory systems. A lack of discussion, however, exists given the auditory-vestibular system involvement in CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine the event rate (ER) of hearing loss, tinnitus, and dizziness caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Wiley) and World Health Organization updates were searched using combined keywords: 'COVID-19,' 'SARS-CoV-2,' 'pandemic,' 'auditory dysfunction,' 'hearing loss,' 'tinnitus,' 'vestibular dysfunction,' 'dizziness,' 'vertigo,' and 'otologic symptoms.' RESULTS: Twelve papers met the eligibility criteria and were included in the study. These papers were single group prospective, cross-sectional, or retrospective studies on otolaryngologic, neurologic, or general clinical symptoms of COVID-19 and had used subjective assessments for data collection (case histories/medical records). The results of the meta-analysis demonstrate that the ER of hearing loss (3.1%, CIs: 0.01-0.09), tinnitus (4.5%, CIs: 0.012-0.153), and dizziness (12.2%, CIs: 0.070-0.204) is statistically significant in patients with COVID-19 (Z &#8804; -4.469, p &#8804; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and dizziness. These findings, however, should be interpreted with caution given insufficient evidence and heterogeneity among studies. Well-designed studies and follow-up assessments on otologic symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 using standard objective tests are recommended.","Jafari, Zahra; Kolb, Bryan E; Mohajerani, Majid H",Can J Neurol Sci,,339

In the current scenario, COVID-19 patients experience severe respiratory syndromes, hence it is envisaged from our study that these traditional medicines are very likely to provide a favourable effect on COVID-19 infections. The active ingredients identified from these natural products are previously reported for antiviral activities against large group of viruses. Totally 47 bioactives identified from the medicinal plants were investigated against the structural targets of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro and spike protein) and human ACE2 receptor. The top leads were identified based on interaction energies, number of hydrogen bond and other parameters that explain their potency to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The bioactive ligands such as Cucurbitacin E, Orientin, Bis-andrographolide, Cucurbitacin B, Isocucurbitacin B, Vitexin, Berberine, Bryonolic acid, Piperine and Magnoflorine targeted the hotspot residues of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. In fact, this protease enzyme has an essential role in mediating the viral replication and therefore compounds targeting this key enzyme are expected to block the viral replication and transcription. The top scoring conformations identified through docking analysis were further demonstrated with molecular dynamics simulation. Besides, the stability of the conformation was studied in detail by investigating the binding free energy using MM-PBSA method. Overall, the study emphasized that the proposed hit Cucurbitacin E and orientin could serve as a promising scaffold for developing anti-COVID-19 drug.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which exhibits high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, is a risk factor of CVD. The relationship of Lp(a) with CVD has been characterized in populations specific to FH. Material and methods: Studies reporting on the relationship of Lp(a) with CVD among FH subjects via PubMed up to 2020 were reviewed. Results: Eight studies were identified as eligible. In the meta-analyses, a high Lp(a) level was significantly and predictively associated with CVD compared to a low Lp(a) level in 2 cross-sectional studies (odds ratio = 2.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16-5.73) and 6 cohort studies (risk/hazard ratio = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.50-2.43). The totally integrated relative risk of these studies was 1.97 (95% CI: 1.57-2.46). Conclusions: FH subjects with high Lp(a) levels can have a high CVD risk, and besides LDL-C, attention should be paid to Lp(a) levels in FH subjects.","Watanabe, Jun; Hamasaki, Masato; Kotani, Kazuhiko",Arch Med Sci Atheroscler Dis,,339

We propose a data-driven approach for automatic prediction of deterioration risk using a deep neural network that learns from chest X-ray images, and a gradient boosting model that learns from routine clinical variables. Our AI prognosis system, trained using data from 3,661 patients, achieves an AUC of 0.786 (95% CI: 0.742-0.827) when predicting deterioration within 96 hours. The deep neural network extracts informative areas of chest X-ray images to assist clinicians in interpreting the predictions, and performs comparably to two radiologists in a reader study. In order to verify performance in a real clinical setting, we silently deployed a preliminary version of the deep neural network at NYU Langone Health during the first wave of the pandemic, which produced accurate predictions in real-time. In summary, our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed system for assisting front-line physicians in the triage of COVID-19 patients.","Shamout, F.

362574,Annals Graphic Medicine - The Social Impact of COVID-19,2021,"During crises (major events characterised by uncertainty, urgency and threat), society must make sense of rapidly unfolding events. This happens mainly through narrativising-depicting a setting, characters and a meaningful sequence of events and actions unfolding over time. In the early months of the pandemic, UK general practice shifted from face-to-face consultations to a remote-by-default model (telephone, video or e-consultation). This shift was initially widely accepted by press and public, but support waned after a politician declared that the change would be permanent. We invoke Burke's dramatistic pentad of act, scene, agent, agency and purpose to theorise findings from a detailed analysis of media coverage of the remote-by-default policy and reactions to it. We consider the 12 weeks from March to June 2020 (first lockdown, when remote-by-default services had just been introduced) and 1 week from late July 2020 (following the ministerial announcement). The initial introduction of remote consulting had strong narrative coherence in which all parts of the pentad were balanced: scene (a deadly virus threatening the country) aligned with act (lockdown, including avoiding face-to-face appointments unless essential), agents (the National Health Service and digital technology as heroic macro-actors), agency (general practitioners 'deployed') and purpose (to control the pandemic). The later period, however, was characterised by a mismatch between scene (a country emerging from lockdown and resuming normal life), act (imposition of the remote model), agent (a politician known for his enthusiasm for technology), agency (top-down directive) and purpose (modernisation). Whereas media narratives in the first period aligned with the genre of heroic adventure (suggesting a worthy battle, bravely fought), those of the second had characteristics of farce (something both comic and grotesque). We conclude that close reading of media narratives may surface potential misalignments between policy decisions and the context in which they must be implemented.","Mroz, Gilly; Papoutsi, Chrysanthi; Greenhalgh, Trisha",Med. humanit,,339

Using summary statistics from the Host Genetics Initiative and the Million Veteran Program, we studied 7,554 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and >1 million controls. We found significant Mendelian randomization results for three proteins (ACE2, P = 1.6 × 10-6; IFNAR2, P = 9.8 × 10-11 and IL-10RB, P = 2.3 × 10-14) using cis-expression quantitative trait loci genetic instruments that also had strong evidence for colocalization with COVID-19 hospitalization. To disentangle the shared expression quantitative trait loci signal for IL10RB and IFNAR2, we conducted phenome-wide association scans and pathway enrichment analysis, which suggested that IFNAR2 is more likely to play a role in COVID-19 hospitalization.

METHODS: All patients diagnosed as confirmed or probable COVID-19 pneumonia whom hospitalised in our Chest Diseases Education and Research Hospital between March 11, 2020 and May 15, 2020 were enrolled. The optimal cut-off values, sensitivity and specificity values and odds ratios to be used in mortality prediction of the novel scoring system created from these parameters were calculated by ROC analysis according to the area under the curve and Youden index. RESULTS: Over 383 patients (n: 33 deceased, n: 350 survivors) univariate and multivariate regression analysis showed that CCI and lymphocyte ratio were prognostic factors for COVID-19-related mortality. Using this analysis, a novel scoring model CoLACD (CoVID-19 Lymphocyte ratio, Age, CCI score, Dyspnoea) was established. The cut-off value of this scoring system, which determines the mortality risk in patients, was 2.5 points with 82% sensitivity and 73% specificity (AUC = 0.802, 95% CI 0.777-0.886, P < .001). The risk of mortality was 11.8 times higher in patients with a CoLACD mortality score higher than 2.5 points than patients with a score lower than 2.5 (OR = 11.8 95% CI 4.7-29.3 P < .001). CONCLUSION: This study showed that by using the CoLACD mortality score, clinicians may achieve a prediction of mortality in COVID-19 patients hospitalised for pneumonia.","Varol, Yelda; Hakoglu, Burcin; Kadri Cirak, Ali; Polat, Gulru; Komurcuoglu, Berna; Akkol, Berrin; Atasoy, Cagri; Bayramic, Eda; Balci, Gunseli; Ataman, Sena; Ermin, Sinem; Yalniz, Enver",Int J Clin Pract,,339

369708,Understanding Global Health: An Experience from International Professional Exchange Program,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To study the profile of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 in the Unified Health System (SUS) in Brazil and to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality related to the disease. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, based on secondary data on COVID-19 hospitalizations that occurred in the SUS between late February through June. Patients aged 18 years or older with primary or secondary diagnoses indicative of COVID-19 were included. Bivariate analyses were performed and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were estimated with random effects intercept. The modeling followed three steps, including: attributes of the patients; elements of the care process; and characteristics of the hospital and place of hospitalization. RESULTS: 89,405 hospitalizations were observed, of which 24.4% resulted in death. COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the SUS were predominantly male (56.5%) with a mean age of 58.9 years. The length of stay ranged from less than 24 hours to 114 days, with a mean of 6.9 (±6.5) days. Of the total number of hospitalizations, 22.6% reported ICU use. The odds on in-hospital death were 16.8% higher among men than among women and increased with age. Black individuals had a higher likelihood of death. The behavior of the Charlson and Elixhauser indices was consistent with the hypothesis of a higher risk of death among patients with comorbidities, and obesity had an independent effect on increasing this risk. Some states, such as Amazonas and Rio de Janeiro, had a higher risk of in-hospital death from COVID-19. The odds on in-hospital death were 72.1% higher in municipalities with at least 100,000 inhabitants, though being hospitalized in the municipality of residence was a protective factor. CONCLUSION: There was broad variation in COVID-19 in-hospital mortality in the SUS, associated with demographic and clinical factors, social inequality, and differences in the structure of services and quality of health care.","de Andrade, Carla Lourenço Tavares; Pereira, Claudia Cristina de Aguiar; Martins, Mônica; Lima, Sheyla Maria Lemos; Portela, Margareth Crisóstomo",PLoS One,,339

Using a Tokyo Metropolitan dataset, this study investigated how these limited intervention policies have affected public health and economic conditions in the COVID-19 context. A causal loop analysis suggested that there were risks to prematurely terminating such interventions. On the basis of this result and subsequent quantitative modelling, we found that the short-term effectiveness of a short-term pre-emptive stay-at-home request caused a resurgence in the number of positive cases, whereas an additional request provided a limited negative add-on effect for economic measures (e.g. the number of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communications and restaurant visits). These findings suggest the superiority of a mild and continuous intervention as a long-term countermeasure under epidemic pressures when compared to strong intermittent interventions.","Niwa, Makoto; Hara, Yasushi; Matsuo, Yusuke; Narita, Hodaka; Yeongjoo, Lim; Sengoku, Shintaro; Kodama, Kota",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14298v1.pdf,339

376794,Asymptomatic Spread of COVID-19 in 97 Patients at a Skilled Nursing Facility,2020,"OBJECTIVES: In the face of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, people with dementia and their carers are contending with serious challenges to their health and wellbeing, due to risk of severe illness, limiting of social contact and disruption to usual activities. Many forms of support for people with dementia and their carers, including singing groups, have moved online using videoconferencing. Previous research has demonstrated the benefits of group singing, which include cognitive stimulation, meaningful activity and peer support. However, although we know which aspects of the singing group experience participants find helpful, we do not know how this experience translates into an online videoconferencing format, and this is a very new field with little existing research. This article reviews the literature pertinent to online singing interventions and uses the findings to develop some suggestions for running an online singing group. STUDY DESIGN: SCOPING REVIEW. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were conducted in EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Owing to the paucity of existing research, searches were also conducted in Google Scholar. The scope of the review covered five related areas: online music making and music therapy, telemedicine and telecare, everyday technology for people with dementia, digital arts and dementia, and use of technology for social interaction and leisure. Our analysis aimed to integrate the results to inform the implementation of online singing groups for people with dementia. RESULTS: Scoping of evidence from discrete fields of enquiry and different disciplinary traditions can inform the delivery of online singing in dementia. This literature also yields useful insights into the role of the carer and how best to support participants to use technology. Barriers and facilitators to online singing were found to relate both to the technology and to the individual participant. CONCLUSION: Lockdown restrictions have led to much innovation, and this is likely to lead to changes in practice even after normal life resumes. The suggestions in this article will be helpful primarily for practitioners moving into online work and researchers investigating this novel area. They may also be useful to commissioners and policymakers because they reflect current knowledge about best practice.","Dowson, B; Schneider, J",Public Health,,339

379033,Protection Procedures and Preventions against the Spread of Covid-19 in Health Care Settings for Nursing Personnel – Lessons from Taiwan,2020,"In a permanent quest for profit, employees can be reduced to a mere function or instrument, dissociated from their quality as individuals for the organization's ends. Experiencing such a feeling as an employee has been called organizational dehumanization. Scholars have recently suggested that organizational dehumanization may play a key role in the development of emotional labor. However, how organizational dehumanization and two main emotional labor strategies (i.e., surface and deep acting) are causally related remains unclear in this literature. In the present research, we argue that employees who experience organizational dehumanization and whose self is thus threatened then engage in surface acting to ""conserve"" their self or in deep acting to ""give up"" their self in service of the role. Overall, the combined results of three studies offer strong evidence that organizational dehumanization leads employees to perform more surface acting, but not more deep acting. Unexpectedly, our findings also indicate that deep acting reduces the perception of being dehumanized by the organization. In showing this, the present research sheds light on the potential dark side of deep acting, by suggesting that this strategy can change employees' perspectives in a way that may encourage them to stay in an organization that treats them as a means to an end.

Design/methodology/approach: Data obtained from 248 students who took online design studios during the lockdown in 15 universities in Jordan highlight many factors that make the experience of the online design studio more challenging. Despite these challenges, strongly positive aspects of the online studio were evident and widely discussed. Findings: A model of a hyper-flexible design studio in which students can have a direct contact with their instructor when needed – in addition to online activities, reviews and written feedback – is highly recommended for the beginner years. This HyFlex model will enrich students' learning and understanding of the fundamentals of design and ensure that technology solutions deliver significant and sustainable benefits. Originality/value: For students, studying architecture necessitates a fundamental shift in the learning mode and attitude in the transition from school. Beginner students are often surprised by the new mode of learning-by-doing and the new learner identity that they must adopt and adapt to in the design studio. Moreover, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, architecture teaching has moved online.

380604,Comment on the article by Dr. T. Huda: Barrier device prototype for open tracheotomy during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was recognised by the WHO as a pandemic in 2020. Host preparation to combat the virus is an important strategy to avoid COVID-19 severity. Thus, the relationship between eating habits, nutritional status and their effects on the immune response and further implications in viral respiratory infections is an important topic discussed in this review. Malnutrition causes the most diverse alterations in the immune system, suppressing of the immune response and increasing the susceptibility to infections such as SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, obesity induces low-grade chronic inflammation caused by excess adiposity, which increases angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. It decreases the immune response favouring SARS-CoV-2 virulence and promoting respiratory distress syndrome. The present review highlights the importance of food choices considering their inflammatory effects, consequently increasing the viral susceptibility observed in malnutrition and obesity. Healthy eating habits, micronutrients, bioactive compounds and probiotics are strategies for COVID-19 prevention. Therefore, a diversified and balanced diet can contribute to the improvement of the immune response to viral infections such as COVID-19.","Morais, Ana Heloneida de Araújo; Aquino, Jailane de Souza; da Silva-Maia, Juliana Kelly; Vale, Sancha Helena de Lima; Maciel, Bruna Leal Lima; Passos, Thaís Sousa",Br J Nutr,,339

Although many patients report some subjective symptoms months after the infection, the exact incidence of neurological and cognitive sequelae of COVID-19 remains to be determined. The aim of this study is to investigate if objective neurological or cognitive impairment is detectable four months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a group of patients who had mild-moderate COVID-19. A cohort of 120 health care workers previously affected by COVID-19 was examined 4 months after the diagnosis by means of neurological and extensive cognitive evaluation and compared to a group of 30 health care workers who did not have COVID-19 and were similar for age and co morbidities. At 4 month follow-up, 118/120 COVID-19 cases had normal neurological examination, two patients had neurological deficits. COVID-19 patients did not show general cognitive impairment at MMSE. In COVID-19 cases the number of impaired neuropsychological tests was not significantly different from non COVID-19 cases (mean 1.69 and 1 respectively, Mann-Whitney p = n.s.), as well as all the mean tests' scores. Anxiety, stress and depression scores resulted to be significantly higher in COVID-19 than in non COVID-19 cases. The results do not support the presence of neurological deficits or cognitive impairment in this selected population of mild-moderate COVID-19 patients four months after the diagnosis. Severe emotional disorders in patients who had COVID-19 in the past are confirmed.","Mattioli, Flavia; Stampatori, Chiara; Righetti, Francesca; Sala, Emma; Tomasi, Cesare; De Palma, Giuseppe",J. neurol,,339

391106,Integrating Medical Students in Tele-Palliative Care,2020,"People often rely on partner support and shared reality during stressful and uncertain times. As such, the current research explored how these may relate to relationship satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. To do so, 155 frontline health-care workers and their significant others completed measures of shared reality and relationship satisfaction, while also indicating their levels of perceived or provided support, respectively. We proposed that shared reality would foster partners providing and health-care workers perceiving support which would, in turn, promote greater relationship satisfaction. Overall, both shared reality and partner support were positively associated with relationship satisfaction for health-care workers and their significant others. Using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model with Mediation (APIMeM), we found shared reality to be associated with greater relationship satisfaction through health-care workers perceiving greater support from their partner. Our research demonstrates that shared reality may be a way for people under stress to perceive greater partner support, providing relational benefits for the couple as a whole.

At present airborne transmission has been deemed as one of the main spread routes of the respiratory infectious diseases. This paper adopts computational fluid dynamics to explore the impacts of dividers installation in two different dining environments on the distribution of aerosols exhaled by infectors and uses a modified Wells-Riley model to analyze the infection risk of surrounding diners. The results show that the effects of dividers on blocking the path of aerosol transmission and protecting the surrounding susceptible personals are limited to some extent. Meanwhile, the aerosols will gather in the breathing zone inside the partitioned space, and the next diner sitting in the previous infector’s seat has a certain infection risk.","Liu, Zhanpeng Li Ruibin Wu Yan Ju Ran Gao Naiping",Energy and Buildings,,339
394404,Impact of COVID-19 on Diabetes Health Care and Service Provision in Australian Diabetes Centers,2021,"BACKGROUND: Medical tapes are ubiquitous in healthcare and there are currently no guidelines for their storage and use. Tapes cannot be cleaned or disinfected; yet, several clinicians may use a given roll for any number of patients. Reports of tape contamination associated with clinical infection have been published. PURPOSE: We reviewed the literature reporting microbiological studies, case reports of infections, and nosocomial outbreaks associated with the use of medical tapes and other adhesive devices to assess the prevalence of this problem. METHODS: We conducted a literature search for cross-contamination due to medical tape use in 6 databases in June 2020 using indexing terms for surgical tape, adhesive agent, adhesives or the keyword for tape. We compiled available evidence on tape contamination as a cause for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). MAIN FINDINGS: Forty-two publications reported relevant microbiological studies, case reports of infections, and/or nosocomial outbreaks. Results demonstrated that tape rolls handled with questionable practices can harbor pathogens. Some studies showed the association between contaminated tape and HAIs, which in some cases even led to death. CONCLUSIONS: The time has come to establish national guidelines to help reduce the risk of cross-contamination from medical tapes. We offer suggested elements for these guidelines. The COVID-19 pandemic brings greater scrutiny to eliminate any avoidable cause of infection transmission.","Bernatchez, Stéphanie F; Schommer, Kimberly",Am. j. infect. control,,339
394568,'Do not resuscitate me in Barbados',2020,"Genome editing technology is important for plant science and crop breeding. Genome-edited plants prepared using general CRISPR-Cas9 methods usually contain foreign DNA, which is problematic for production of genome-edited transgene-free plants for vegetative propagation or highly heterozygous hybrid cultivars. Here, we describe a method for highly efficient targeted mutagenesis in Nicotiana benthamiana through expression of Cas9 and single guide (sg)RNA using a potato virus X (PVX) vector. Following Agrobacterium-mediated introduction of virus vector cDNA, >60% of shoots regenerated without antibiotic selection carried targeted mutations, while &#8804;18% of shoots contained T-DNA. The PVX vector was also used to express a base-editor consisting of modified Cas9 fused with cytidine deaminase to introduce targeted nucleotide substitution in regenerated shoots. We also report exogenous DNA-free genome editing by mechanical inoculation of virions comprising the PVX vector expressing Cas9. This simple and efficient virus-vector-mediated delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 could facilitate transgene-free gene editing in plants.","Ariga, Hirotaka; Toki, Seiichi; Ishibashi, Kazuhiro",Plant cell physiol,,339

395618,The Ethics of COVID-19 Risk Communication,2021,"Older adults have diminished immune responses that lead to increased susceptibility and severity of infectious diseases. Influenza is a leading killer of older adults despite the availability of seasonal influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccines are strain specific, and their efficacy varies greatly year to year based on how well the vaccine virus matches the circulating strains. Additionally, older adults have reduced vaccination responses. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the increased mortality rate in older adults for infectious disease, and brought vaccine development to the forefront. The speed of vaccine development was met with an equally impressive vaccine efficacy. Interestingly, both mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines currently available have shown similar efficacy in both young and older adults. mRNA vaccine production has significantly reduced the production timeline compared to current influenza vaccines, making them particularly attractive for influenza vaccine development. Faster production coupled with improved efficacy would be a tremendous advancement in protecting older adults from influenza morbidity and mortality.","Bartley, Jenna M; Cadar, Andreia N; Martin, Dominique E",Immunol Invest,,339

The effect of M. alba oil vapour (300-900 µL/L) on the growth of moulds was studied in brown rice. Then, optimisation of the M. alba oil vapour (300-900 µL/L) was studied through sensory evaluation. Next, EEG was used to investigate the effect of fragrant cooked brown rice on human brain activity. In addition, the key components of M. alba oil on the sensory effects were determined. The results indicated that M. alba oil vapour &#8805; 450 µL/L provided effective antifungal activity against natural moulds on brown rice for at least 90 days of storage at 25 °C at 100% RH. Furthermore, the optimal concentration of M. alba oil vapour for enhancing consumer preference and acceptance of cooked brown rice was 300-600 µL/L with a rejection threshold of 2,052 µL/L. Moreover, it was found that linalool was the main key component and caryophyllene and ß-elemene were the minor components affecting the sensory quality enhancement. Interestingly, the EEG results showed that fragrant cooked brown rice could increase the power of alpha and beta waves in the human brain, indicating anti-stress effects and a relaxed mood. Therefore, M. alba oil vapour demonstrated good potential to enhance consumer acceptance and preference for cooked brown rice while controlling the significant growth of moulds in brown rice.","Songsamoe, Sumethee; Koomhin, Phanit; Matan, Narumol",J Food Sci Technol,,339

However, despite urgent need, there remains uncertainty surrounding best practices for pharmaceutical interventions to treat COVID-19. In particular, conflicting evidence has emerged surrounding the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, alone or in combination, for COVID-19. The COVID-19 Evidence Accelerator convened by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, in collaboration with Friends of Cancer Research, assembled experts from the health systems research, regulatory science, data science, and epidemiology to participate in a large parallel analysis of different data sets to further explore the effectiveness of these treatments. METHODS: Electronic health record (EHR) and claims data were extracted from seven separate databases. Parallel analyses were undertaken on data extracted from each source. Each analysis examined time to mortality in hospitalized patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and the two in combination as compared to patients not treated with either drug. Cox proportional hazards models were used, and propensity score methods were undertaken to adjust for confounding. Frequencies of adverse events in each treatment group were also examined. RESULTS: Neither hydroxychloroquine nor azithromycin, alone or in combination, were significantly associated with time to mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. No treatment groups appeared to have an elevated risk of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Administration of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and their combination appeared to have no effect on time to mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Continued research is needed to clarify best practices surrounding treatment of COVID-19.","Stewart, Mark; Rodriguez-Watson, Carla; Albayrak, Adem; Asubonteng, Julius; Belli, Andrew; Brown, Thomas; Cho, Kelly; Das, Ritankar; Eldridge, Elizabeth; Gatto, Nicolle; Gelman, Alice; Gerlovin, Hanna; Goldberg, Stuart L; Hansen, Eric; Hirsch, Jonathan; Ho, Yuk-Lam; Ip, Andrew; Izano, Monika; Jones, Jason; Justice, Amy C; Klesh, Reyna; Kuranz, Seth; Lam, Carson; Mao, Qingqing; Mataraso, Samson; Mera, Robertino; Posner, Daniel C; Rassen, Jeremy A; Siefkas, Anna; Schrag, Andrew; Tourassi, Georgia; Weckstein, Andrew; Wolf, Frank; Bhat, Amar; Winckler, Susan; Sigal, Ellen V; Allen, Jeff",PLoS One,,339

The interactions of the ACE2 glycan at N322 with SARS-CoV RBD are blocked by the presence of the RBD glycan at N357 of the SARS-CoV RBD.

Emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can act as a trigger for subacute thyroiditis (SAT). We conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed/Medline and Google Scholar to identify cases of subacute thyroiditis associated with COVID-19 and evaluated patient-level demographics, major clinical features, laboratory findings and outcomes. In the 21 cases that we reviewed, the mean age of patients was 40.0 ± 11.3 years with a greater female preponderance (71.4%). Mean number days between the start of COVID-19 illness and the appearance of SAT symptoms were 25.2 ± 10.1. Five patients were confirmed to have ongoing COVID-19, whereas the infection had resolved in 16 patients before onset of SAT symptoms. Fever and neck pain were the most common presenting complaints (81%). Ninety-four percent of patients reported some type of hyperthyroid symptoms, while the labs in all 21 patients (100%) confirmed this with low TSH and high T3 or T4. Inflammatory markers were elevated in all cases that reported ESR and CRP. All 21 cases (100%) had ultrasound findings suggestive of SAT. Steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs were the mainstay of treatment, and all patients reported resolution of symptoms; however, 5 patients (23.8%) were reported to have a hypothyroid illness on follow-up. Large-scale studies are needed for a better understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, but current evidence suggests that clinicians need to recognize the possibility of SAT both in ongoing and resolved COVID-19 infection to optimize patient care.","Aemaz Ur Rehman, Muhammad; Farooq, Hareem; Ali, Muhammad Mohsin; Ebaad Ur Rehman, Muhammad; Dar, Qudsia Anwar; Hussain, Awab",SN Compr Clin Med,,339

409200,Effects of open rhinoplasty on upper lip position in profile and frontal views,2020,"Analysis of gaze points has been a vital tool for understanding varied human behavioral pattern and underlying psychological processing. Gaze points are analyzed generally in terms of two events of fixations and saccades that are collectively termed as scanpath. Scanpath could potentially establish correlation between visual scenery and human cognitive tendencies. Scanpath has been analyzed for different domains that include visual perception, usability, memory, visual search or low level attributes like color, illumination and edges in an image. Visual search is one prominent area that examines scanpath of subjects while a target object is searched in a given set of images. Visual search explores behavioral tendencies of subjects with respect to image complexity. Complexity of an image is governed by spatial, frequency and color information present in the image. Scanpath based image complexity analysis determines human visual behavior that could lead to development of interactive and intelligent systems. There are several sophisticated eye tracking devices and associated algorithms for recording and classification of scanpath. However, in the present scenario when the chances of viral infections (COVID-19) from known and unknown sources are high, it is very important that the contact less methods and models be designed. In addition, even though the devices acquire and process eye movement data with fair accuracy but are intrusive and costly. The objective of current research work is to establish the complexity of the given set of images while target objects are searched and to present analysis of gaze search pattern. To achieve these objectives a remote gaze estimation and analysis model has been proposed for scanpath identification and analysis. The model is an alternate option for gaze point tracking and scanpath analysis that is non intrusive and low cost. The gaze points are tracked remotely as against sophisticated wearable eye tracking devices available in the market. The model employs easily available softwares and hardware devices. In the current work, complexity is derived on the basis of analysis of fixation and saccade gaze points. Based on the results generated by the proposed model, influence on subjects due to external stimuli is studied. The set of images chosen, act as external stimuli for the subjects during visual search. In order to statistically analyze scanpath for different subjects, certain scanpath parameters have been identified. The model maps and classifies eye movement gaze points into fixations and saccades and generates data for identified parameters. For eye detection and subsequent iris detection voila jones and circular hough transform (CHT) algorithms have been used. Identification by dispersion threshold (I-DT) is implemented for scanpath identification. The algorithms are customized for better iris and scanpath detection. Algorithms are developed for gaze screen mapping and classification of fixations and saccades. The experimentation has been carried on different subjects. Variations during visual search have been observed and analyzed. The present model requires no contact of human subject with any equipment including eye tracking devices, screen or computing devices.","Ishrat, Mohsina; Abrol, Pawanesh",Multimed Tools Appl,,339

We aimed to assess the collective evidence on the effects on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of the pandemic. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the effects of the pandemic on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. We searched MEDLINE and Embase in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, from Jan 1, 2020, to Jan 8, 2021, for case-control studies, cohort studies, and brief reports comparing maternal and perinatal mortality, maternal morbidity, pregnancy complications, and intrapartum and neonatal outcomes before and during the pandemic. We also planned to record any additional maternal and offspring outcomes identified. Studies of solely SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant individuals, as well as case reports, studies without comparison groups, narrative or systematic literature reviews, preprints, and studies reporting on overlapping populations were excluded. Quantitative meta-analysis was done for an outcome when more than one study presented relevant data. Random-effects estimate of the pooled odds ratio (OR) of each outcome were generated with use of the Mantel-Haenszel method. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020211753). FINDINGS: The search identified 3592 citations, of which 40 studies were included. We identified significant increases in stillbirth (pooled OR 1·28 [95% CI 1·07-1·54]; I2=63%; 12 studies, 168 295 pregnancies during and 198 993 before the pandemic) and maternal death (1·37 [1·22-1·53; I2=0%, two studies [both from low-income and middle-income countries], 1 237 018 and 2 224 859 pregnancies) during versus before the pandemic. Preterm births before 37 weeks' gestation were not significantly changed overall (0·94 [0·87-1·02]; I2=75%; 15 studies, 170 640 and 656 423 pregnancies) but were decreased in high-income countries (0·91 [0·84-0·99]; I2=63%; 12 studies, 159 987 and 635 118 pregnancies), where spontaneous preterm birth was also decreased (0·81 [0·67-0·97]; two studies, 4204 and 6818 pregnancies). Mean Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores were higher, indicating poorer mental health, during versus before the pandemic (pooled mean difference 0·42 [95% CI 0·02-0·81; three studies, 2330 and 6517 pregnancies). Surgically managed ectopic pregnancies were increased during the pandemic (OR 5·81 [2·16-15·6]; I2=26%; three studies, 37 and 272 pregnancies). No overall significant effects were identified for other outcomes included in the quantitative analysis: maternal gestational diabetes; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; preterm birth before 34 weeks', 32 weeks', or 28 weeks' gestation; iatrogenic preterm birth; labour induction; modes of delivery (spontaneous vaginal delivery, caesarean section, or instrumental delivery); post-partum haemorrhage; neonatal death; low birthweight (<2500 g); neonatal intensive care unit admission; or Apgar score less than 7 at 5 min. INTERPRETATION: Global maternal and fetal outcomes have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an increase in maternal deaths, stillbirth, ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and maternal depression. Some outcomes show considerable disparity between high-resource and low-resource settings. There is an urgent need to prioritise safe, accessible, and equitable maternity care within the strategic response to this pandemic and in future health crises.

412209,Letter to the Editor in Response to Khazanchi et al,2021,"Virus host shifts are generally associated with novel adaptations to exploit the cells of the new host species optimally. Surprisingly, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has apparently required little to no significant adaptation to humans since the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to October 2020. Here we assess the types of natural selection taking place in Sarbecoviruses in horseshoe bats versus the early SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans. While there is moderate evidence of diversifying positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it is limited to the early phase of the pandemic, and purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in related bat Sarbecoviruses. In contrast, our analysis detects evidence for significant positive episodic diversifying selection acting at the base of the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from, accompanied by an adaptive depletion in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action of antiviral mechanisms in these ancestral bat hosts. The closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor about 1976), is a recombinant with a structure that includes differential CpG content in Spike; clear evidence of coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other species. While an undiscovered ""facilitating"" intermediate species cannot be discounted, collectively, our results support the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 being capable of efficient human-human transmission as a consequence of its adaptive evolutionary history in bats, not humans, which created a relatively generalist virus.","MacLean, Oscar A; Lytras, Spyros; Weaver, Steven; Singer, Joshua B; Boni, Maciej F; Lemey, Philippe; Kosakovsky Pond, Sergei L; Robertson, David L",PLoS Biol,,339

417420,Discharge in Pandemic: Suspected Covid-19 patients returning to the Emergency Department within 72 hours for admission,2020,"The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic in 2020 has caused oncology teams around the world to adapt their practice in the aim of protecting patients. Early evidence from China indicated that patients with cancer, and particularly those who had recently received chemotherapy or surgery, were at increased risk of adverse outcomes following SARS-Cov-2 infection. Many registries of cancer patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 emerged during the first wave. We collate the evidence from these national and international studies and focus on the risk factors for patients with solid cancers and the contribution of systemic anti-cancer treatments (SACT-chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted and hormone therapy) to outcomes following SARS-Cov-2 infection. Patients with cancer infected with SARS-Cov-2 have a higher probability of death compared with patients without cancer. Common risk factors for mortality following COVID-19 include age, male sex, smoking history, number of comorbidities and poor performance status. Oncological features that may predict for worse outcomes include tumour stage, disease trajectory and lung cancer. Most studies did not identify an association between SACT and adverse outcomes. Recent data suggest that the timing of receipt of SACT may be associated with risk of mortality. Ongoing recruitment to these registries will enable us to provide evidence-based care.","Lee, Alvin J X; Purshouse, Karin",Br J Cancer,,339

419352,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physicians Working in the Head and Neck Field,2021,"BACKGROUND: Advanced prediction of the daily incidence of COVID-19 can aid policy making on the prevention of disease spread, which can profoundly affect people's livelihood. In previous studies, predictions were investigated for single or several countries and territories. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop models that can be applied for real-time prediction of COVID-19 activity in all individual countries and territories worldwide. METHODS: Data of the previous daily incidence and infoveillance data (search volume data via Google Trends) from 215 individual countries and territories were collected. A random forest regression algorithm was used to train models to predict the daily new confirmed cases 7 days ahead. Several methods were used to optimize the models, including clustering the countries and territories, selecting features according to the importance scores, performing multiple-step forecasting, and upgrading the models at regular intervals. The performance of the models was assessed using the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Our models can accurately predict the daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in most countries and territories. Of the 215 countries and territories under study, 198 (92.1%) had MAEs <10 and 187 (87.0%) had Pearson correlation coefficients >0.8. For the 215 countries and territories, the mean MAE was 5.42 (range 0.26-15.32), the mean RMSE was 9.27 (range 1.81-24.40), the mean Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.89 (range 0.08-0.99), and the mean Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.84 (range 0.2-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: By integrating previous incidence and Google Trends data, our machine learning algorithm was able to predict the incidence of COVID-19 in most individual countries and territories accurately 7 days ahead.","Peng, Yuanyuan; Li, Cuilian; Rong, Yibiao; Pang, Chi Pui; Chen, Xinjian; Chen, Haoyu",J Med Internet Res,,339
419551,Screening for Covid-19 in Skilled Nursing Facilities,2020,"Mucous epithelia are protected by complex mucus barrier layers, which are part of the innate immune defense. Trefoil factor family peptides TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3 have lectin activities and are predominantly co-secreted together with mucins from these epithelia. TFF1 and TFF2 are mainly expressed in the gastric mucosa; whereas TFF3 is rather widely secreted from most mucous epithelia and their glands. TFF1 and TFF3 consist of a single TFF domain and an additional free 7th cysteine residue; whereas TFF2 contains two TFF domains. Systematic analyses of the molecular forms of TFFs gave new insights into their diverse molecular functions. TFF1 mainly exists as a monomer with an unusual free thiol group and only minor amounts form a disulfide linked homodimer as well as heterodimers with gastrokine-2 and IgG-Fc-binding protein (FCGBP). TFF3 mainly forms a heterodimer with FCGBP in vivo, but binds also Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumors/gp340 (DMBT1gp340) in vitro. In contrast, TFF2 binds as a lectin to a conserved O-linked carbohydrate moiety of the mucin MUC6. Both FCGBP and DMBT1gp340 are secreted from most mucous epithelia and their glands and are involved in mucosal innate immunity. Thus, a new picture emerged pointing to functions of TFF3-FCGBP (and TFF1-FCGBP) for mucosal innate immune defense, e.g. supporting the clearing of microorganisms. Such a function could be well be supported by DMBT1gp340. In contrast, the TFF2/MUC6 complex probably stabilizes physically the inner adherent gastric mucus layer. Furthermore, there are indications that TFF3-FCGBP might play also a role in blood vessels.","Hoffmann, Werner",Curr. med. chem,,339

434559,Preprosthetic Dentoalveolar Surgery,2020,"Résumé Contexte Dans les services de psychiatrie de l’enfant et de l’adolescent, le nombre d’hospitalisations pour anorexie mentale (AM) est en augmentation ces dernières années En état de dénutrition sévère, ces patients peuvent présenter des perturbations de leurs fonctions immunitaires Forts de ce constat, beaucoup de praticiens avaient fait le choix d’éviter les hospitalisations longues lors de la première vague de COVID-19, par peur de contages et de probable risque augmenté de forme grave chez ces patients Est-ce que cette stratégie est toujours d’actualité pour la seconde vague ? Un risque majoré de forme grave a-t-il été identifié chez le patient adolescent AM ? Méthode Nous avons rappelé les recommandations françaises sur le sujet que nous avons complétées par une revue de la littérature internationale via Medline, Google Scholar ainsi que les données de l’organisme américain Center for Disease Control and Prevention Résultats L’évolution des connaissances sur la pandémie a clairement établi un plus faible risque de contamination chez l’enfant et l’adolescent Il n’a pas été montré que l’AM ou faible poids corporel constituaient un risque de forme sévère de COVID-19 À l’inverse, le confinement aggrave la symptomatologie chez au moins un tiers de ces patients Conclusion Au final, il apparaît judicieux de ne pas reproduire la stratégie de retour à domicile précoce chez les adolescents atteints d’AM Les données actuelles appuient la nécessité d’une continuité des soins, ainsi que la poursuite des prises en charges hospitalières quand elles sont nécessaires Background In child and adolescent psychiatry departments, the number of hospitalizations for anorexia nervosa (AN) has been increasing in recent years In the phase of severe undernutrition, these patients may exhibit disturbances in their immune functions Based on this observation, many French practitioners had chosen to avoid long hospitalizations during the first wave of COVID-19 They had in mind a risk of contagion between adolescents, in which infections can be frequently asymptomatic Fear of an increased risk of a severe form of COVID-19 in AN patients has led to early returns home, where they would probably be safer than in our departments Is this strategy still relevant for the second wave? Has an increased risk of a severe form been identified in the adolescent AN patients? Method We have recalled the French recommendations on the subject Then we carried out a review of the international literature via Medline, Google Scholar as well as data from the American organization Center for Disease Control and Prevention Results The evolution of knowledge about the pandemic has clearly established a lower risk of infection in adolescents than in adults It seems that the virus spares this population, most of them remaining asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic Reassuringly, AN or low body weight has not been shown to pose a risk for the severe form of COVID-19 Conversely, the literature reports that lockdown worsens the symptoms of AN (food restriction, hyperactivity) in at least a third of these patients Most of the patients expressed a high level of anxiety during the first lockdown It may even have been difficult for these patients to continue to access care when they were confined Conclusion In the end, it seems wise not to reproduce the strategy of early return home in adolescents with AN Current data support the need for continuity of care, as well as the continuation of hospital care when necessary, while a too rapid discharge runs the risk of destabilizing the patient in an already long and difficult course of care in the usual time","Verley, J.

435354,The impact of COVID-19 on the GOSH newborn screening service,2020,"Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years. Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold. The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV. HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well. Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic. The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known. Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases. Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans. In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission. Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination. The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context. In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.","Ye, Zi-Wei; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yuen, Kit-San; Fung, Sin-Yee; Chan, Chi-Ping; Jin, Dong-Yan",Int J Biol Sci,,339

This paper provides a brief history of the socio-cultural perceptions attached to wearing a mask by surveying how masks were perceived in ancient Greece and Rome, the origins of medical masks, and the ascribed socio-cultural meaning of masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of a mask has historically diverse perceived meanings; currently, wearing a mask communicates a bipolar socio-cultural meaning and a nuanced, divisive symbology. To some, masks communicate a belief in medical science and a desire to protect one's neighbor from contagion. To others, a mask communicates oppression, government overreach, and a skepticism toward established scientific principles. It is the mask's ability to signal a deception, or extrapolated more broadly, a value system, that is highly relevant to current public health guidelines encouraging mask use to decrease the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health officials and providers should utilize evidence-based health communication strategies when findings warrant a reversed recommendation of a symbol (such as masks) with a legacy of socio-cultural underpinnings that are deep-seated, complex, and emotional.","Ike, John David; Bayerle, Henry; Logan, Robert A; Parker, Ruth M",J Health Commun,,339

We describe an immunocompetent woman with a cutaneous manifestation of Candida parasilopsis fungemia, a prominent eschar, which proved to be the nidus for the candidemia. We stress the value of selectively removing eschars. C. parasilopsis and C. auris are increasingly important causes of sepsis and wound infections. We emphasize that commercially available biochemical-based tests may misidentify C. auris as C. parapsilosis, and stress the added danger of C. auris to critically ill-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Any health care facility with evidence of infection or colonization with C. auris requires very close monitoring, since this fungus is a nosocomial threat comparable to SARS-CoV-2 in its mortality and fomite adhesiveness! Both organisms have the potential to be transmitted as nosocomial pathogens; health care workers need to follow strict CDC guidelines. During this COVID-19 pandemic, every health care facility should closely monitor for the possible deadly combination of the SARS-CoV-2 and C. auris. The identification of C. auris necessitates use of sophisticated technology not readily available to make this essential diagnosis since C. auris is multi-drug resistant and isolation precautions would become paramount.","Schwartz, Robert A; Kapila, Rajendra",Dermatol Ther,,339

442931,Urgent Issues Facing Immigrant Physicians in the United States in the COVID-19 Era,2020,"The newly discovered Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been globally spreading and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world as of its first emergence in late 2019. The rapid outbreak of this disease has overwhelmed health care infrastructures and arises the need to allocate medical equipment and resources more efficiently. The early diagnosis of this disease will lead to the rapid separation of COVID-19 and non-COVID cases, which will be helpful for health care authorities to optimize resource allocation plans and early prevention of the disease. In this regard, a growing number of studies are investigating the capability of deep learning for early diagnosis of COVID-19. Computed tomography (CT) scans have shown distinctive features and higher sensitivity compared to other diagnostic tests, in particular the current gold standard, i.e., the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Current deep learning-based algorithms are mainly developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify COVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however, require extensive data augmentation and large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations between image instances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend slice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding mechanism or rely on a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the disease. In this paper, we propose a two-stage fully automated CT-based framework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases referred to as the ""COVID-FACT"". COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks and is, therefore, capable of capturing spatial information. In particular, to make the proposed COVID-FACT independent from sophisticated segmentations of the area of infection, slices demonstrating infection are detected at the first stage and the second stage is responsible for classifying patients into COVID and non-COVID cases. COVID-FACT detects slices with infection, and identifies positive COVID-19 cases using an in-house CT scan dataset, containing COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia, and normal cases. Based on our experiments, COVID-FACT achieves an accuracy of 90.82 % , a sensitivity of 94.55 % , a specificity of 86.04 % , and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, while depending on far less supervision and annotation, in comparison to its counterparts.","Heidarian, S.; Afshar, P.; Enshaei, N.; Naderkhani, F.; Rafiee, M.

SUMMARY: Drug utilization trends for 7 medications used to treat patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at 47 New York hospitals were identified. The data demonstrated sharp increases in aggregate utilization of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and the number of patients receiving either drug beginning on March 15, with a notable 20% median increase per day through March 31. The net quantity of drug charge units per day for midazolam, propofol, ketamine, cisatracurium, and fentanyl also increased during the study period. Following peak utilization, use of all study drugs decreased at different times throughout April 2020. The data were used to provide information to various stakeholders in the drug supply chain during the initial surge of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: This analysis describes the increased use, beginning in mid-March 2020, of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, midazolam, propofol, ketamine, cisatracurium, and fentanyl in 47 hospitals in New York State. The increased utilization of supportive therapy drugs was consistent with the surge in patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 during the study period. These data and observations can help clinicians, health-system leaders, manufacturers, wholesalers, and policymakers understand the impact of current and future pandemics on the drug supply chain.","Dabestani, Arash; DeAngelo, Dawn; Chhay, Sophia R; Larson, Bayli J; Ganio, Michael C",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,339
446876,52 Acceptance of Telemedicine Screening for COVID-19 Outside Usual Health System Catchment Area,2020,"Increasing number in global COVID-19 cases demands for mathematical model to analyze the interaction between the virus dynamics and the response of innate and adaptive immunity. Here, based on the assumption of a weak and delayed response of the innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we constructed a mathematical model to describe the dynamic processes of immune system. Integrating theoretical results with clinical COVID-19 patients' data, we classified the COVID-19 development processes into three typical modes of immune responses, correlated with the clinical classification of mild&moderate, severe and critical patients. We found that the immune efficacy (the ability of host to clear virus and kill infected cells) and the lymphocyte supply (the abundance and pool of na\""ive T and B cell) play important roles in the dynamic process and determine the clinical outcome, especially for the severe and critical patients. Furthermore, we put forward possible treatment strategies for the three typical modes of immune response. We hope our results can help to understand the dynamical mechanism of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to be useful for the treatment strategies and vaccine design.","Zhou, Zhengqing; Zhao, Zhiheng; Shi, Shuyu; Wu, Jianghua; Li, Dianjie; Li, Jianwei; Zhang, Jingpeng; Gui, Ke; Zhang, Yu; Mei, Heng; Hu, Yu; Ouyang, Qi; Li, Fangting",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04477v1.pdf,339

449917,Providing emergency medical care without consent: How the 'emergency principle' in Australian law protects against claims of trespass,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is extensive concern about older people's care in institutions, especially recently in the past years. One of the reasons is linked to the cases of elder abuse, not only shown by academic and scientific sources, but also by social and mass media and their impact on public perception of the institutional setting. What is more, current COVID-19 pandemic consequences on older people have provoked alarm and worry especially about what is happening in institutions. METHODS: The sample for this study consists of 286 staff working in nursing homes in Spain. This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Professional Good Care Scale in Nursing Homes (GCS-NH). RESULTS: Results of parallel analyses and exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) showed a four-factor model for the 32-item scale: humanization (9 items), non-infantilization (10 items), respect (7 items) and empowerment (6 items). Then, psychometric properties were tested analysing internal consistency (reliability) and convergent, divergent and criterion validity. High internal consistency (reliability) and different validity evidence were obtained for the total scores of the GCS-NH and its subscales. GCS-NH scores were also capable of detecting risk of probable institutional elder abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that this scale is an appropriate, valid, and reliable multidimensional instrument to evaluate good care in older institutionalized people by staff. Good care is an outcome of a complex construct in which a wide range of factors converge (staff, older people, and environmental characteristics). The GCS-NH has potential to be used as a multidimensional tool to assess good care.","Pérez-Rojo, Gema; López, Javier; Noriega, Cristina; Martínez-Huertas, José Angel; Velasco, Cristina",BMC Geriatr,,339

STUDY AIMS: (1) identify sociodemographic groups of the adult population at risk of anxiety and depression and (2) determine if the following social and psychological risk factors for poor mental health moderated these direct sociodemographic effects: loneliness, social support, threat perception, illness representations. METHODS: Cross-sectional nationally representative telephone survey in Scotland in June 2020. If available, validated instruments were used, for example, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) to measure anxiety and depression. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect. RESULTS: A total of 1006 participants; median age 53 years, 61.4% female, from all levels of area deprivation (i.e., 3.8% in the most deprived decile and 15.6% in the most affluent decile). Analyses show associations of anxiety and depression with sociodemographic (age, gender, deprivation), social (social support, loneliness) and psychological factors (perceived threat and illness representations). Mental health was poorer in younger adults, women and people living in the most deprived areas. Age effects were exacerbated by loneliness and illness representations, gender effects by loneliness and illness representations and deprivation effects by loneliness, social support, illness representations and perceived threat. In each case, the moderating variables amplified the detrimental effects of the sociodemographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the results of pre-Covid-19 pandemic studies about associations between sociodemographics and mental health. Loneliness, lack of social support and thoughts about Covid-19 exacerbated these effects and offer pointers for pre-emptive action.","Hubbard, Gill; den Daas, Chantal; Johnston, Marie; Dixon, Diane",Int. j. behav. med,,339

454480,50 Years of Behavioral Science in Diabetes: A 2020 Vision of the Future,2021,"BACKGROUND: There are limited treatment options for unresectable recurrent or metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Vascular endothelial growth factor is of significant interest for targeted therapy in R/M HNSCC because of its central role in tumorigenesis and immunosuppression. Axitinib is a potent inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1 , VEGFR2, VEGFR3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, as well as c-kit and offers such an approach. METHODS: This article reports the results of a phase 2 trial evaluating axitinib in R/M HNSCC according to the Choi criteria for radiographic response assessment. The primary endpoint of this trial was 6-month overall survival. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were enrolled, and 28 were evaluable for a response. Patients were heavily pretreated with 61% having had at least 1 previous systemic treatment in the metastatic setting (range, 0-5). The median overall survival of 9.8 months and the 6-month overall survival rate of 70% met the protocol-defined criteria for clinical efficacy. The best overall response rate was 42%. Correlative analyses demonstrated that PI3K signaling pathway alterations were associated with an increased response to therapy (75% vs 17%). A marked response to therapy was seen in a subgroup of patients who were treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor after progression on axitinib. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with axitinib is associated with improved survival in patients with heavily pretreated head and neck cancer, and PI3K pathway alterations may serve as a biomarker for response. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate axitinib in biomarker-selected populations, especially in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. LAY SUMMARY: Metastatic head and neck squamous cancer is an incurable disease with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. This study is the first to demonstrate that the targeted oral drug axitinib improves survival in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic head and neck cancer.

455867,Creating a COVID-19 surge clinic to offload the emergency department,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic imposes new challenges on the capability of governments in intervening with the information dissemination and reducing the risk of infection outbreak. To reveal the complexity behind government intervention decision, we build a bi-layer network diffusion model for the information-disease dynamics that were intervened in and conduct a full space simulation to illustrate the trade-off faced by governments between information disclosing and blocking. The simulation results show that governments prioritize the accuracy of disclosed information over the disclosing speed when there is a high-level medical recognition of the virus and a high public health awareness, while, for the opposite situation, more strict information blocking is preferred. Furthermore, an unaccountable government tends to delay disclosing, a risk-averse government prefers a total blocking, and a low government credibility will discount the effect of information disclosing and aggravate the situation. These findings suggest that information intervention is indispensable for containing the outbreak of infectious disease, but its effectiveness depends on a complicated way on both external social/epidemic factors and the governments' internal preferences and governance capability, for which more thorough investigations are needed in the future.","Lu, Yao; Ji, Zheng; Zhang, Xiaoqi; Zheng, Yanqiao; Liang, Han",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,339

AIMS: To examine the impact of COVID-19 on acute urolithiasis presentations to the ED. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre, observational study, we reviewed all CT KUBs (and their corresponding cases) ordered in ED for possible acute urolithiasis in a 100-day period immediately prior to COVID-19 and in a 100-day period immediately afterwards. We sought to establish the number of CT KUBs performed and the number confirming urolithiasis. We recorded patients' age, gender, stone size and location. We also analysed CRP, WCC and creatinine as well as the duration of patients' pain and the management strategy adopted for each case. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-eight CT KUBs were performed, 94 pre-COVID and 104 intra-COVID. A total of 70.2% (n = 66) and 66.3% (n = 69) were positive for urolithiasis pre-COVID and intra-COVID respectively (p = 0.56). There was a significantly higher percentage of females pre-COVID compared with intra-COVID (54% vs 36%, p = 0.012). There was no difference in median ureteric stone size seen between the groups (4.7 mm pre-COVID vs 4.0 mm intra-COVID, p = 0.179). There were no significant differences in WCC, CRP or creatinine levels. One patient in the pre-COVID group and two in the intra-COVID groups required percutaneous nephrostomies. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic did not result in fewer or sicker patients presenting with acute ureteric colic cases to the ED.","Anderson, Steven; McNicholas, Daniel; Murphy, Claudine; Cheema, Ijaz; McLornan, Liza; Davis, Niall; Quinlan, Mark",Ir. j. med. sci,,339

METHODS: The CDS app allowed anonymized individual surveys of demographic features and COVID-19 risk of transmission and exacerbation factors from users of the San Luis Potosí Metropolitan Area (SLPMA). The platform's data processing pipeline computed and geolocalized the risk index of each user and enabled the analysis of the variables and their association. Point process analysis identified geographic clustering patterns of users at risk and these were compared with the patterns of COVID-19 cases confirmed by the State Health Services. RESULTS: A total of 1554 COVID-19 surveys were administered through the CDS app. Among the respondents, 50.4 % were men and 49.6 % women, with an average age of 33.5 years. Overall risk index frequencies were, in descending order: no-risk 77.8 %, low risk 10.6 %, respiratory symptoms 6.7 %, medium risk 1.4 %, high risk 2.0 %, very high risk 1.5 %. Comorbidity was the most frequent vulnerability category (32.4 %), followed by the inability to keep home lockdown (19.2 %). Statistically significant risk clusters identified at a spatial scale between 5 and 730 m coincided with those in neighborhoods containing substantial numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The CDS platform enables the analysis of the sociodemographic features and spatial distribution of individual risk indexes of COVID-19 transmission and exacerbation. It is a useful epidemiological surveillance and early detection tool because it identifies statistically significant and consistent risk clusters in neighborhoods with a substantial number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.","Ruiz-Correa, Salvador; López-Revilla, Rubén; Díaz-Barriga, Fernando; Marmolejo-Cossío, Francisco; Del Carmen Robledo-Valero, Viridiana; Hernández-Huérfano, Emilio Ernesto; Álvarez-Rivera, Leonardo; Rangel-Martínez, Mónica Liliana; Lutzow-Steiner, Miguel Ángel; Ortiz-Vázquez, Luis Alfredo; Mendoza-Lara, Andrea Rebeca; Olivo-Rodríguez, Montserrat; Galván-Ramírez, Marco Sebastián; Morales-Neri, Ángel Emanuel; Martínez-Donjuan, Víctor Uriel; Cervantes-Irurzo, Massiel Isabella; Comas-García, Andreu; Hernández-Maldonado, Fernando; Aguilar-Acosta, Carlos",Int J Med Inform,,339
464999,"Virtual Emergency Medicine Clerkship Curriculum during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Development, Application, and Outcomes",2021,"Negative pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE) is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that typically occurs in response to an upper airway obstruction, where patients generate high negative intrathoracic pressures, leading to a pulmonary edema especially in the postoperative period. Here, we report a case of NPPE following general anesthesia that can easily be misdiagnosed as COVID-19 both radiologically and clinically during this pandemic. Twenty-year-old male was presented with sudden onset respiratory distress, tachypnea, and cyanosis just after the rhinoplasty surgery under general anesthesia. Chest radiography and thoracic computed tomography scans revealed the bilateral patchy alveolar opacities with decreased vascular clarity that looks similar to COVID-19 radiology. Negative pressure pulmonary edema is a sudden onset and life-threatening complication following general anesthesia particularly after head and neck surgery in young healthy individuals. It is a clinical condition that cannot be diagnosed unless it comes to mind. While both NPPE and COVID-19 cause hypoxemia and respiratory distress, as well as ground-glass opacities in the chest computed tomography, those opacities in NPPE appear mostly in central areas, whereas those opacities are mostly seen in peripheral areas in COVID-19. Furthermore, while NPPE cause decreased vascular clarity, COVID-19 causes vascular dilatations in the areas of opacities. Those differences together with medical history of the patient is crucial to differentiate these 2 similar identities. Negative pressure pulmonary edema requires an immediate recognition and intervention, therefore, we would like to raise the awareness of clinicians for such condition to avoid possible mistakes during the pandemic situation.","Karaman, Irem; Ozkaya, Sevket",J. craniofac. surg,,339

Little is known about how these changes affected academic stress in students. This study examined the role of changes of teaching methods on academic stress among university students during the first lockdown in Denmark. METHODS: The cross-sectional survey was part of the international ""COVID-19 International Student Well-being Study"" and included responses on socio-economic characteristics, infection worries, academic stress, work capacity and satisfaction with teaching from 1,541 Danish health and medical science university students in May-June 2020. Changes in academic stress were analysed using descriptive statistics and multi-variable analyses using stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: A considerable part (39%) of students reported academic stress due to COVID-19. One third reported that their study workload had increased significantly due to the COVID-19 outbreak and that they were concerned about their ability to complete the academic year. Factors associated with academic stress were female sex, young age, bachelor level, knowing a COVID-19 patient and being worried about becoming infected, whereas immigration background, sufficient financial resources and living arrangements were not. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak has influenced university students' academic stress. It is important to set up structures to support students' mental health and educational trajectory during the pandemic.","Guldager, J.

Specifically, we examine differences in moral framing in two datasets: (i) tweets from US-based politicians annotated with political affiliation and (ii) COVID-19 related tweets in German from followers of the leaders of the five major Austrian political parties. Our research is based on recent work that introduces an unsupervised approach to extract framing bias and intensity in news using a dictionary of moral virtues and vices. In this paper, we use a more extensive dictionary and adapt it to German-language tweets. Overall, in both datasets, we observe a moral framing that is congruent with the public perception of the political parties. In the US dataset, democrats have a tendency to frame tweets in terms of care, while loyalty is a characteristic frame for republicans. In the Austrian dataset, we find that the followers of the governing conservative party emphasize care, which is a key message and moral frame in the party's COVID-19 campaign slogan. Our work complements existing studies on moral framing in social media. Also, our empirical findings provide novel insights into moral-based framing on COVID-19 in Austria.","Reiter-Haas, Markus; Kopeinik, Simone; Lex, Elisabeth",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11853v1.pdf,339

We identified three pre-existing structures that facilitated the effective implementation of the massive lockdown: ready-made containment units offered by urban “gated” housing, a comprehensive grassroots governance network coordinated by shequ (community residence committees), and the ubiquitous WeChat app in Chinese daily life. We also showed that the pre-existing structures provided space for uncontentious self-organizing, grassroots mobilization, and civic engagement that often dove-tailed with state-mandated measures.

A long-standing open problem in this area is to prove an unconditional polynomial lower bound of a trade-off between the update time and the query time of an adaptive dynamic data structure computing some explicit function. Ko and Weinstein provided such lower bound for a restricted class of {\em semi-adaptive\/} data structures, which compute the Disjointness function. There, the data are subsets $x_1,\dots,x_k$ and $y$ of $\{1,\dots,n\}$, the updates can modify $y$ (by inserting and removing elements), and the queries are an index $i \in \{1,\dots,k\}$ (query $i$ should answer whether $x_i$ and $y$ are disjoint, i.e., it should compute the Disjointness function applied to $(x_i, y)$). The semi-adaptiveness places a restriction in how the data structure can be accessed in order to answer a query. We generalize the lower bound of Ko and Weinstein to work not just for the Disjointness, but for any function having high complexity under the smooth corruption bound.","Dvovr'ak, Pavel; Loff, Bruno",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02238v1.pdf,339

Objective: To investigate the effect of a single high dose of vitamin D3 on hospital length of stay in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 2 sites in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The study included 240 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who were moderately to severely ill at the time of enrollment from June 2, 2020, to August 27, 2020. The final follow-up was on October 7, 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of 200â¯000 IU of vitamin D3 (n = 120) or placebo (n = 120). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was length of stay, defined as the time from the date of randomization to hospital discharge.

To address these questions, we conducted a longitudinal survey among European and American respondents. Wave 1 (N = 501) was conducted on March 27, 2020 and Wave 2 (N = 326) on July 1, 2020. We assessed COVID-19 knowledge, endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories, media use, Need for Cognition (NC), Need for Cognitive Closure (NCC), and self-reported adherence to governmental measures taken. Results showed that nearly three-quarters of our respondents actively searched for information about COVID-19. Most at least once a day. Information seeking behaviour was not influenced by cognitive motivation (i.e., NC and NCC). However, cognitive motivation was related to (1) knowledge about COVID-19, (2) conspiracy rejection, and (3) change in knowledge over time. Respondents with more knowledge on COVID-19 also indicated to adhere more often to measures taken by their government. Self-reported adherence to measures was not influenced by cognitive motivation. Implications of these findings will be discussed.","Boot, Arnout B; Eerland, Anita; Jongerling, Joran; Verkoeijen, Peter P J L; Zwaan, Rolf A",Sci Rep,,339

483115,Experiences of Latinx Individuals Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Qualitative Study,2021,"There has been an increased interest in optimizing pricing and sourcing decisions under supplier competition with supply disruptions. In this paper, we conduct an analytical game-theoretical study to examine the effects of supply capacity disruption timing on pricing decisions for substitute products in a two-supplier one-retailer supply chain setting. We investigate whether the timing of a disruption may significantly impact the optimal pricing strategy of the retailer. We derive the optimal pricing strategy and ordering levels with both disruption timing and product substitution. By exploring both the Nash and Stackelberg games, we find that the order quantity with the disrupted supplier depends on price leadership and it tends to increase when the non-disrupted supplier is the leader. Moreover, the equilibrium market retail prices are higher under higher levels of disruption for the Nash game, compared to the Stackelberg game. We also uncover that the non-disrupted supplier can always charge the highest wholesale price if a disruption occurs before orders are received. This highlights the critical role of order timing. The insights can help operations managers to proper design risk mitigation ordering strategies and re-design the supply contracts in the presence of product substitution under supply disruptions.","Gupta, Varun; Ivanov, Dmitry; Choi, T-M",Omega,,339

Shakrawal: Barrier device prototype for open tracheotomy during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the predictive factors of pulmonary thromboembolic (PTE) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) assessed in the emergency department at a tertiary hospital during the first pandemic wave. METHODS: Observational single-center study conducted in a retrospective cohort of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (or high clinical-radiological suspicion) who underwent PTE screening by computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Predictive factors of PTE were explored using logistic regression, creating two predictive models (without or with D-dimer values). RESULTS: Out of a total of 274 CTPA performed, 70 procedures presented diagnostic findings of PTE, representing a cumulative incidence of 25.54% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.49-31.14). In the non-D-dimer based model, respiratory rate>22bpm (odds ratio [OR]: 3.162; 95% CI: 1.627-6.148; p=0.001) and the absence of findings suggestive of COVID-19 in plain chest X-ray (OR: 3.869; 95% CI: 0.869-17.225; p=0.076) were predictors of PTE. In the D-dimer-based model, tachypnea remained as a predictive factor (OR: 4.967; 95% CI: 2.053-12.018; p<0.001), as well as D-dimers>3,000ng/ml (OR: 7.494; 95% CI: 3.038-18.485; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of tachypnea (>22bpm) and the absence of radiological findings suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the chest X-ray, in addition to D-dimer values>3,000 ng/mL, were identified as predictive factors of PTE in patients with COVID-19.","Gil Mosquera, Manuel; Fernández-Ruiz, Mario; Sanz Rodríguez, Elena; Mata Martínez, Aránzazu; Ibáñez Sanz, Laín; Muñoz Martín, David; Bisbal Pardo, Otilia; Martínez Chamorro, Elena",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,339
485370,Covid-19: UK budget gives £94 a week statutory sick pay to self-isolators and their carers,2020,"BACKGROUND: The mental health of the UK population declined at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Convenience sample surveys indicate that recovery began soon after. Using a probability sample, we tracked mental health during the pandemic to characterise mental health trajectories and identify predictors of deterioration. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of five waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (a large, national, probability-based survey that has been collecting data continuously since January, 2009) from late April to early October, 2020 and pre-pandemic data taken from 2018-19. Mental health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). We used latent class mixed models to identify discrete mental health trajectories and fixed-effects regression to identify predictors of change in mental health. FINDINGS: Mental health was assessed in 19 763 adults (&#8805;16 years; 11 477 [58·1%] women and 8287 [41·9%] men; 3453 [17·5%] participants from minority ethnic groups). Mean population mental health deteriorated with the onset of the pandemic and did not begin improving until July, 2020. Latent class analysis identified five distinct mental health trajectories up to October 2020. Most individuals in the population had either consistently good (7437 [39·3%] participants) or consistently very good (7623 [37·5%] participants) mental health across the first 6 months of the pandemic. A recovering group (1727 [12·0%] participants) showed worsened mental health during the initial shock of the pandemic and then returned to around pre-pandemic levels of mental health by October, 2020. The two remaining groups were characterised by poor mental health throughout the observation period; for one group, (523 [4·1%] participants) there was an initial worsening in mental health that was sustained with highly elevated scores. The other group (1011 [7·0%] participants) had little initial acute deterioration in their mental health, but reported a steady and sustained decline in mental health over time. These last two groups were more likely to have pre-existing mental or physical ill-health, to live in deprived neighbourhoods, and be of Asian, Black or mixed ethnicity. Infection with SARS-CoV-2, local lockdown, and financial difficulties all predicted a subsequent deterioration in mental health. INTERPRETATION: Between April and October 2020, the mental health of most UK adults remained resilient or returned to pre-pandemic levels. Around one in nine individuals had deteriorating or consistently poor mental health. People living in areas affected by lockdown, struggling financially, with pre-existing conditions, or infection with SARS-CoV-2 might benefit most from early intervention.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mechanism of microthrombosis in COVID-19 progression. PATIENTS/METHODS: We assessed VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF ristocetin-cofactor (VWF:RCo), VWF multimers, VWF propeptide (VWFpp) and ADAMTS13 activity in a cross-sectional study of 50 patients stratified according to their admission to three different intensity of care units: low (requiring high-flow nasal cannula oxygenation, n=14), intermediate (requiring continuous positive airway pressure devices, n=17), high (requiring mechanical ventilation, n=19). RESULTS: Median VWF:Ag, VWF:RCo and VWFpp levels were markedly elevated in COVID-19 patients and increased with intensity of care, with VWF:Ag being 268, 386 and 476 IU/dL, VWF:RCo 216, 334 and 388 IU/dL, and VWFpp 156, 172 and 192 IU/dL in patients at low, intermediate and high intensity of care, respectively. Conversely, the high-to-low molecular weight VWF multimers ratios progressively decreased with increasing intensity of care, as well as median ADAMTS13 activity levels, which ranged from 82 IU/dL for patients at low intensity of care to 62 and 55 IU/dL for those at intermediate and high intensity of care. CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant alteration of the VWF-ADAMTS13 axis in COVID-19 patients, with an elevated VWF:Ag to ADAMTS13 activity ratio that was strongly associated with disease severity. Such an imbalance enhances the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 patients and their risk of microthrombosis.","Mancini, Ilaria; Baronciani, Luciano; Artoni, Andrea; Colpani, Paola; Biganzoli, Marina; Cozzi, Giovanna; Novembrino, Cristina; Boscolo Anzoletti, Massimo; De Zan, Valentina; Pagliari, Maria Teresa; Gualtierotti, Roberta; Aliberti, Stefano; Panigada, Mauro; Grasselli, Giacomo; Blasi, Francesco; Peyvandi, Flora",J. thromb. haemost,,339

RAS dysregulation is one of the major characteristics of several cardiovascular diseases, thus adjustment of this system is the main therapeutic target. RAS inhibitors - particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) - are commonly used for treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Patients with cardiovascular diseases are the group most commonly seen amongst those with COVID-19 comorbidity. At the beginning of this pandemic, a dilemma occurred regarding the use of ACEIs and ARBs potentially aggravating cardiovascular and pulmonary dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Urgent clinical trials from different countries and hospitals reported that there is no association between RAS inhibitor treatment and COVID-19 infection or comorbidity complication. Nevertheless, the disturbance of the RAS system that is associated with COVID-19 infection and the potential treatment targeting this area has yet to be resolved. In this review, the link between the dysregulation of classical RAS and counter-regulatory RAS activities in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular metabolic diseases is investigated. In addition, the latest findings based on ACEIs and ARBs administration and ACE-2 availability in relation to COVID-19 which may provide a better understanding of RAS contribution to COVID-19 pathology is discussed as it is of the utmost importance amid the current pandemic.","Almutlaq, Moudhi; Alamro, Abir Abdullah; Alroqi, Fayhan; Barhoumi, Tlili",,,339

It is an uncommon syndrome with elusive pathophysiologic mechanisms. We observed POS in patients of moderate COVID-19 who required hospital admission to our indoor facility and oxygen supplementation when saturation was documented in sitting and supine positions for evaluation of platypnea. Materials and methods: We conducted an observational, cross sectional, retrospective analysis of pulse oximetry readings of patients with stage 2 COVID-19 admitted in ward during the period from 15th May 2020 to 30th May 2020. The difference in the peripheral oxygen saturation in sitting and supine positions, documented as a routine standard of care, especially in patients with platypnea, was calculated and demographic details and co-morbidities were noted from indoor record forms. Results: Of the 53 patients of stage 2 COVID-19 who were included in the study, 15 (28%) had platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome at the time of presentation and 18(33.9%) patients with platypnoea had ≥ 3% desaturation in sitting position as compared to supine position. Rest of the 20 (37.7%) patients had neither platypnoea nor orthodeoxia. All the patients presenting with platypnoea-orthodeoxia required oxygen therapy during the course of treatment. Amongst the 33 patients who were hypoxic and required oxygen supplementation, 15 patients (45.4%) had oxygen saturation of ≥94% in the supine position at presentation. Conclusion: Platypnoea-orthodeoxia syndrome is common in patients with stage 2 COVID 19 infection who require oxygen therapy. POS can be easily documented by using pulse oximeter without the need of any specialised equipment. Hence, we propose that documentation of POS at the time of admission in primary health care or resource depleted settings would help in successful triage of the patients needing oxygen therapy. We also propose that oxygen saturation in sitting position be documented as far as possible. Further clinical studies are necessary to validate this observation. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

496432,COVID-19: A Driver for Disruptive Innovation of the Emergency Medicine Residency Application Process,2020,"Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the harm caused by coronaviruses to the world cannot be underestimated. Recently, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) initially found to trigger human severe respiratory illness in Wuhan City of China in 2019, has infected more than six million people worldwide by 21 June 2020, and which has been recognized as a public health emergency of international concern as well. And the virus has spread to more than 200 countries around the world. However, the effective drug has not yet been officially licensed or approved to treat SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov infection. NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, essential for viral replication and transcription, is generally regarded as a potential target to fight against the virus. According to the NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex (PDB ID: 7BW4) structure of SARS-CoV-2 and the NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex (PDB ID: 6NUR) structure of SARS-CoV, NSP12-NSP7 interface model, and NSP12-NSP8 interface model were established for virtual screening in the present study. Eight compounds (Nilotinib, Saquinavir, Tipranavir, Lonafarnib, Tegobuvir, Olysio, Filibuvir, and Cepharanthine) were selected for binding free energy calculations based on virtual screening and docking scores. All eight compounds can combine well with NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 in the crystal structure, providing drug candidates for the treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 and SARS.","Ruan, Zijing; Liu, Chao; Guo, Yuting; He, Zhenqing; Huang, Xinhe; Jia, Xu; Yang, Tai",J Med Virol,,339

497116,Revisiting the Safety of Health Care Workers,2020,"Abstract Viral respiratory diseases (VRDs), such as influenza and COVID-19, are thought to spread faster over winter than during summer It has been previously argued that cold and dry conditions were more conducive to the transmission of VRD than warm and humid climates, although this relationship appears restricted to temperate regions, and the causal relationship is not well understood The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 has emerged as a serious global public health problem after the first COVID-19 reports in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 It is still unclear whether this novel respiratory disease will ultimately prove to be a seasonal endemic disease Here, we suggest that Air Drying Capacity (ADC;an atmospheric state-variable known to control the fate/evolution of the virus-laden droplets) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) are probable environmental determinants in shaping the transmission of COVID-19 at the seasonal time scale These variables, unlike temperature and humidity, provide a physically-based framework consistent with the apparent seasonal variability in COVID-19 prevalence across a broad range of climates (e g , Germany and India) Since this disease is known to be influenced by the compounding effect of social, biological, and environmental determinants, this study does not claim that these environmental determinants exclusively shape the seasonality of COVID-19 However, we argue that ADC and UV play a significant role in COVID-19 dynamics at the seasonal scale These findings could help guide the development of a sound adaptation strategy against the pandemic over the coming seasons","Choi, Yeon-Woo Tuel Alexandre Eltahir Elfatih A.

However, due to existence of numerous polytypes and occurrence of additional phases, the synthesis of 2D films remains a difficult task. This paper reports on MBE growth of GaSe, InSe, and GaTe layers and related heterostructures on GaAs(001) substrates by using a Se valve cracking cell and group III metal effusion cells. The sophisticated self-consistent analysis of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy data was used to establish the correlation between growth conditions, formed polytypes and additional phases, surface morphology and crystalline structure of the III-VI 2D layers. The photoluminescence and Raman spectra of the grown films are discussed in detail to confirm or correct the structural findings. The requirement of a high growth temperature for the fabrication of optically active 2D layers was confirmed for all materials. However, this also facilitated the strong diffusion of group III metals in III-VI and III-VI/II-VI heterostructures. In particular, the strong In diffusion into the underlying ZnSe layers was observed in ZnSe/InSe/ZnSe quantum well structures, and the Ga diffusion into the top InSe layer grown at ~450 °C was confirmed by the Raman data in the InSe/GaSe heterostructures. The results on fabrication of the GaSe/GaTe quantum well structures are presented as well, although the choice of optimum growth temperatures to make them optically active is still a challenge.","Sorokin, Sergey V; Avdienko, Pavel S; Sedova, Irina V; Kirilenko, Demid A; Davydov, Valery Yu; Komkov, Oleg S; Firsov, Dmitrii D; Ivanov, Sergey V",,,339
501418,Emerging Evidence on Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines Among Residents of Long-Term Care Facilities,2021,"Air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging for travellers, airlines, airports, health authorities, and governments. We reviewed multiple aspects of COVID peri-pandemic air travel, including data on traveller numbers, peri-flight prevention, and testing recommendations and in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission, photo-epidemiology of mask use, the pausing of air travel to mass gathering events, and quarantine measures and their effectiveness. Flights are reduced by 43% compared to 2019. Hygiene measures, mask use, and distancing are effective, while temperature screening has been shown to be unreliable. Although the risk of in-flight transmission is considered to be very low, estimated at one case per 27 million travellers, confirmed in-flight cases have been published. Some models exist and predict minimal risk but fail to consider human behavior and airline procedures variations. Despite aircraft high-efficiency filtering, there is some evidence that passengers within two rows of an index case are at higher risk. Air travel to mass gatherings should be avoided. Antigen testing is useful but impaired by time lag to results. Widespread application of solutions such as saliva-based, rapid testing or even detection with the help of ""sniffer dogs"" might be the way forward. The ""traffic light system"" for traveling, recently introduced by the Council of the European Union is a first step towards normalization of air travel. Quarantine of travellers may delay introduction or re-introduction of the virus, or may delay the peak of transmission, but the effect is small and there is limited evidence. New protocols detailing on-arrival, rapid testing and tracing are indicated to ensure that restricted movement is pragmatically implemented. Guidelines from airlines are non-transparent. Most airlines disinfect their flights and enforce wearing masks and social distancing to a certain degree. A layered approach of non-pharmaceutical interventions, screening and testing procedures, implementation and adherence to distancing, hygiene measures and mask use at airports, in-flight and throughout the entire journey together with pragmatic post-flight testing and tracing are all effective measures that can be implemented. Ongoing research and systematic review are indicated to provide evidence on the utility of preventive measures and to help answer the question ""is it safe to fly?"".","Bielecki, Michel; Patel, Dipti; Hinkelbein, Jochen; Komorowski, Matthieu; Kester, John; Ebrahim, Shahul; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Memish, Ziad A; Schlagenhauf, Patricia",Travel Med Infect Dis,,339

METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated clinical and X-ray features in all patients referred to the emergency department for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1st and March 13th. A single radiologist with more than 15 years of experience in chest-imaging evaluated the presence and extent of alveolar opacities, reticulations, and/or pleural effusion. The percentage of lung involvement (range <25 % to 75-100 %) was also calculated. We stratified patients in groups according to the time interval between symptoms onset and X-ray imaging (&#8804; 5 and > 5 days) and according to age (&#8804; 50 and > 50 years old). RESULTS: A total of 518 patients were enrolled. Overall 314 patients had negative and 204 had positive RT-PCR results. Lung lesions in patients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia primarily manifested as alveolar and interstitial opacities and were mainly bilateral (60.8 %). Lung abnormalities were more frequent and more severe by symptom duration and by increasing age. The sensitivity and specificity of chest X-ray at admission in the overall cohort were 57 % (95 % CIâ¯=â¯47-67) and 89 % (83-94), respectively.

One such challenge is the control of indoor air quality in the COVID-19 era and beyond. Since COVID-19 became a global pandemic, the ""super spread"" of the virus has continued to amaze policymakers despite measures put in place by public health officials to sensitize the general public on the need for social distancing, personal hygiene, etc. In this work, we have reviewed the literature to demonstrate, by investigating the historical and present circumstances, that indoor spread of infectious diseases may be assisted by the conditions of the HVAC systems. While little consideration has been given to the possibility of indoor airborne transmission of the virus, the available reports have demonstrated that the virus, with average aerodynamic diameter up to 80-120 nm, is viable as aerosol in indoor atmosphere for more than 3 h, and its spread may be assisted by the HVAC systems. Having reviewed the vulnerability of the conventional ventilation systems, we recommend innovative air circulation concept supported by the use of UVGI in combination with nanoporous air filter to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other harmful microbes in enclosed spaces.","Sodiq, Ahmed; Khan, Moazzam Ali; Naas, Mahmoud; Amhamed, Abdulkarem",Environ Res,,339

514543,Adaption of the emergency department decontamination room for airway management during COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Social isolation and quarantine are unusual precautions taken all over the world against the COVID-19 pandemic. Some legal sanctions were made in order to protect vulnerable age groups such as the geriatric population, to make them stay at home. These measures, which are vital for pandemic management, have negative psychological effects on elderly individuals. The aim of this study was to reveal how pandemic process affected individuals over 65 years old psychosocially. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Socio-demographic characteristics questionnaire, the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S) and the Loneliness Scale for the Elderly individuals were used. Descriptive analysis, Mann-Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Pearson correlation analysis were performed for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 130 elderly people (80 women, 50 men) were included in the study. Of the participants, 61.5% were women, 67.7% were married and mean age was 71.53 ± 5.57 (min. 65-max. 87) years old. The C19P-S scores were significantly higher in women, singles, people living alone, those living in an apartment, and those with higher economic and educational level (P = .001). There was a strong positive correlation between age and total loneliness score. Loneliness scores were significantly higher in singles, those with higher levels of education and income, those who live alone, who was a relative of a healthcare worker, and whose relatives were infected with COVID-19 (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that elderly individuals, who have to comply with social isolation rules, have increased fear and loneliness due to coronavirus. Considering this situation, timely psychological treatment and social support measures should be taken.","Cihan, Fatma G; Gökgöz Durmaz, Funda",Int J Clin Pract,,339

515394,Initial Experience with a COVID-19 Web-Based Patient Self-assessment Tool,2020,"During the recent years, viral epidemic due to coronaviruses, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 (coronavirus disese-19), has become a global problem. In addition to causing cardiovascular and respiratory lethal dysfunction, these viruses can cause neurodegeneration leading to neurological disorders. Review of the current scientific literature reveals the multiple neuropathies and neuronal dysfunction associated with these viruses. Here, we review the major findings of these studies and discuss the main neurological sequels and outcomes of coronavirus infections with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. This article analyzes and discusses the main mechanisms of coronavirus-induced neurodegeneration according to the current experimental and clinical studies. Coronaviruses can damage the nerves directly through endovascular dysfunctions thereby affecting nerve structures and synaptic connections. Coronaviruses can also induce neural cell degeneration indirectly via mitochondrial dysfunction inducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Thus, coronaviruses can cause neurological disorders by inducing neurovascular dysfunction affecting nerve structures and synaptic connections, and by inducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. While some of these mechanisms are similar to other RNA viruses, the neurotoxic mechanisms of COVID-19, MERS, and SARS-CoV viruses are unknown and need detailed clinical and experimental studies.","Gholami, Mina; Safari, Sepideh; Ulloa, Luis; Motaghinejad, Majid",J Neurovirol,,339

518579,Breaking News: EDs Should Hoard Every Gown and Surgical Mask and Lock Up N95s,2020,"AIM: The COVID-19 pandemic led to limit patients' visits to the neuro-urology department. Telemedicine was seen as a pragmatic solution to provide follow-up care. This study aimed to assess the efficiency and satisfaction of a telephone consultation in neuro-urology. METHODS: During the pandemic, the scheduled medical visits were converted into telephone consultation. For each teleconsultation, the physician assessed the efficiency and the patient-rated global satisfaction of the teleconsultation. The physician and the patient assessed whether this teleconsultation replaced a physical visit. RESULTS: About 358 neurologic patients were included in the study. The mean efficiency of the telephone consultation was 9.3/10 (±1.5). The mean global satisfaction was 9.0/10 (±1.3). The majority of the patients (52.4%) would prefer a physical consultation. 90.2% might convert some clinic visits to teleconsultations in the future. No agreement was found between the patient and the physician when they were asked if the teleconsultation replaced the physical consultation initially scheduled (weight kappa = 0.02; 95% confidence interval = [-0.06 to 0.11]). Cognitive impairment, difficulty to obtain relevant information, and lack of physical examination were unfavorable to the efficiency of the teleconsultation. Cognitive impairment, embarrassing nature of the teleconsultation, and preference for a physical consultation were unfavorable to satisfaction of the patient. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine in neuro-urology was associated with a high satisfaction of the patients and was described as efficient by the physicians. Despite this, the majority of the patients reported a preference for physical consultation. The COVID-19 pandemic might be an opportunity to refine our practices in neuro-urology and to develop telemedicine.","Chesnel, Camille; Hentzen, Claire; Le Breton, Frédérique; Turmel, Nicolas; Tan, Eliane; Haddad, Rebecca; Amarenco, Gérard",Neurourol Urodyn,,339
519480,Black Lives Matter: tackling racial and ethnic inequalities in diabetes health care,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a radical shift in social work practice. Overnight, social work intervention models provided in-person gave way to the utilization of Information and Communication Technologies to facilitate direct practice in virtual environments (e-therapy). Social work's slow acceptance of e-therapy prior to the pandemic resulted in a lack of training for many social work practitioners and MSW student interns, who were required to make rapid transitions to using and operating in online environments. It appears likely that e-therapy will continue after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, so integrating education about effective e-therapy techniques into social work curricula seems like a logical next step. A social worker's ability to establish the therapeutic alliance, which is at the heart of all helping relationships, will be central to this curricula. Understanding social work students' perceptions of e-therapy and the therapeutic alliance can help shape the development of this new curriculum. Using internal student email, students at two Research I universities were invited to participate in a fully online anonymous survey dealing with attitudes towards e-therapy and the therapeutic alliance. Surveys were conducted in 2018 and April-May 2020. Survey questions were based on the only prior comprehensive study of student attitudes towards e-therapy (Finn in J Soc Work Educ 38(3), 403-419. 10.1080/10437797.2002.10779107, 2002). Study results indicate that students have e-therapy experience, believe that a practitioner can build a good therapeutic alliance, and think that some form of e-therapy will continue after the pandemic. These results confirm that further exploration about the inclusion of e-therapy education and its efficacy in social work curricula requires urgent attention.","Earle, Melissa J; Freddolino, Paul P",Clin Soc Work J,,339

521079,"Novel ENT triad of anosmia, ageusia and hearing impairment in COVID-19",2020,"BackgroundPrisons and jails are high-risk settings for COVID-19 transmission, morbidity, and mortality. COVID-19 vaccines may substantially reduce these risks, but evidence is needed of their effectiveness for incarcerated people, who are confined in large, risky congregate settings. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate effectiveness of mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people in California prisons from December 22, 2020 through March 1, 2021. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation provided daily data for all prison residents including demographic, clinical, and carceral characteristics, as well as COVID-19 testing, vaccination status, and outcomes. We estimated vaccine effectiveness using multivariable Cox models with time-varying covariates that adjusted for resident characteristics and infection rates across prisons. FindingsAmong 60,707 residents in the cohort, 49% received at least one BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 dose during the study period. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was 74% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64-82%) from day 14 after first dose until receipt of second dose and 97% (95% CI, 88-99%) from day 14 after second dose. Effectiveness was similar among the subset of residents who were medically vulnerable (74% [95% CI, 62-82%] and 92% [95% CI, 74-98%] from 14 days after first and second doses, respectively), as well as among the subset of residents who received the mRNA-1273 vaccine (71% [95% CI, 58-80%] and 96% [95% CI, 67-99%]). ConclusionsConsistent with results from randomized trials and observational studies in other populations, mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people. Prioritizing incarcerated people for vaccination, redoubling efforts to boost vaccination and continuing other ongoing mitigation practices are essential in preventing COVID-19 in this disproportionately affected population.

Moreover, thromboembolic events throughout the body, including in the CNS, have been described. Given the neurological symptoms observed in a large majority of individuals with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 penetrance of the CNS is likely. By various means, we demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein in anatomically distinct regions of the nasopharynx and brain. Furthermore, we describe the morphological changes associated with infection such as thromboembolic ischemic infarction of the CNS and present evidence of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. SARS-CoV-2 can enter the nervous system by crossing the neural-mucosal interface in olfactory mucosa, exploiting the close vicinity of olfactory mucosal, endothelial and nervous tissue, including delicate olfactory and sensory nerve endings. Subsequently, SARS-CoV-2 appears to follow neuroanatomical structures, penetrating defined neuroanatomical areas including the primary respiratory and cardiovascular control center in the medulla oblongata.","Meinhardt, Jenny; Radke, Josefine; Dittmayer, Carsten; Franz, Jonas; Thomas, Carolina; Mothes, Ronja; Laue, Michael; Schneider, Julia; Brünink, Sebastian; Greuel, Selina; Lehmann, Malte; Hassan, Olga; Aschman, Tom; Schumann, Elisa; Chua, Robert Lorenz; Conrad, Christian; Eils, Roland; Stenzel, Werner; Windgassen, Marc; Rößler, Larissa; Goebel, Hans-Hilmar; Gelderblom, Hans R; Martin, Hubert; Nitsche, Andreas; Schulz-Schaeffer, Walter J; Hakroush, Samy; Winkler, Martin S; Tampe, Björn; Scheibe, Franziska; Körtvélyessy, Péter; Reinhold, Dirk; Siegmund, Britta; Kühl, Anja A; Elezkurtaj, Sefer; Horst, David; Oesterhelweg, Lars; Tsokos, Michael; Ingold-Heppner, Barbara; Stadelmann, Christine; Drosten, Christian; Corman, Victor Max; Radbruch, Helena; Heppner, Frank L",Nat. neurosci,,339

METHODS: We searched https://clinicaltrials.gov/ and retrieved all clinical trials on COVID-19 from 1 January 2020 to 26 June 2020. As a comparator group, we have chosen two fields that are not related to emerging infections and infectious diseases: and considered not directly affected by the pandemic: breast cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and included studies within the aforementioned study period as well as those registered in the preceding year (pre-study period: 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019). Gender of the investigator was predicted using the genderize.io application programming interface. The repository of the data sets used to collect and analyse the data are available at https://osf.io/k2r57/. RESULTS: Only 27.8% (430/1548) of principal investigators among COVID-19-related studies were women, which is significantly different compared with 54.9% (156/284) and 42.1% (56/133) for breast cancer (p < 0.005) and T2DM (p < 0.005) trials over the same period, respectively. During the pre-study period, the proportion of principal investigators who were predicted to be women were 49.7% (245/493) and 44.4% (148/333) for breast cancer and T2DM trials, respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant when compared with results from the study period (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that less than one-third of COVID-19-related clinical trials are led by women, half the proportion observed in non-COVID-19 trials over the same period, which remained similar to the pre-study period. These gender disparities during the pandemic may not only indicate a lack of female leadership in international clinical trials and involvement in new projects but also reveal imbalances in women's access to research activities and funding during health emergencies.","Cevik, Muge; Haque, Syed Arefinul; Manne-Goehler, Jennifer; Kuppalli, Krutika; Sax, Paul E; Majumder, Maimuna S; Orkin, Chloe",Clin. microbiol. infect,,339

524061,COVID-19 in People With Diabetes: Urgently Needed Lessons From Early Reports,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound mental health consequences for many people. Concerns have been expressed that, at their most extreme, these consequences could manifest as increased suicide rates. We aimed to assess the early effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates around the world. METHODS: We sourced real-time suicide data from countries or areas within countries through a systematic internet search and recourse to our networks and the published literature. Between Sept 1 and Nov 1, 2020, we searched the official websites of these countries' ministries of health, police agencies, and government-run statistics agencies or equivalents, using the translated search terms ""suicide"" and ""cause of death"", before broadening the search in an attempt to identify data through other public sources. Data were included from a given country or area if they came from an official government source and were available at a monthly level from at least Jan 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. Our internet searches were restricted to countries with more than 3 million residents for pragmatic reasons, but we relaxed this rule for countries identified through the literature and our networks. Areas within countries could also be included with populations of less than 3 million. We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from at least Jan 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020) in each country or area within a country, comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number of suicides in the early months of the pandemic (from April 1 to July 31, 2020, in the primary analysis). FINDINGS: We sourced data from 21 countries (16 high-income and five upper-middle-income countries), including whole-country data in ten countries and data for various areas in 11 countries). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs based on the observed versus expected numbers of suicides showed no evidence of a significant increase in risk of suicide since the pandemic began in any country or area. There was statistical evidence of a decrease in suicide compared with the expected number in 12 countries or areas: New South Wales, Australia (RR 0·81 [95% CI 0·72-0·91]); Alberta, Canada (0·80 [0·68-0·93]); British Columbia, Canada (0·76 [0·66-0·87]); Chile (0·85 [0·78-0·94]); Leipzig, Germany (0·49 [0·32-0·74]); Japan (0·94 [0·91-0·96]); New Zealand (0·79 [0·68-0·91]); South Korea (0·94 [0·92-0·97]); California, USA (0·90 [0·85-0·95]); Illinois (Cook County), USA (0·79 [0·67-0·93]); Texas (four counties), USA (0·82 [0·68-0·98]); and Ecuador (0·74 [0·67-0·82]). INTERPRETATION: This is the first study to examine suicides occurring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries. In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, suicide numbers have remained largely unchanged or declined in the early months of the pandemic compared with the expected levels based on the pre-pandemic period.

FINDINGS: We sourced data from 21 countries (16 high-income and five upper-middle-income countries), including whole-country data in ten countries and data for various areas in 11 countries). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs based on the observed versus expected numbers of suicides showed no evidence of a significant increase in risk of suicide since the pandemic began in any country or area. There was statistical evidence of a decrease in suicide compared with the expected number in 12 countries or areas: New South Wales, Australia (RR 0·81 [95% CI 0·72-0·91]); Alberta, Canada (0·80 [0·68-0·93]); British Columbia, Canada (0·76 [0·66-0·87]); Chile (0·85 [0·78-0·94]); Leipzig, Germany (0·49 [0·32-0·74]); Japan (0·94 [0·91-0·96]); New Zealand (0·79 [0·68-0·91]); South Korea (0·94 [0·92-0·97]); California, USA (0·90 [0·85-0·95]); Illinois (Cook County), USA (0·79 [0·67-0·93]); Texas (four counties), USA (0·82 [0·68-0·98]); and Ecuador (0·74 [0·67-0·82]). INTERPRETATION: This is the first study to examine suicides occurring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries. In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, suicide numbers have remained largely unchanged or declined in the early months of the pandemic compared with the expected levels based on the pre-pandemic period. We need to remain vigilant and be poised to respond if the situation changes as the longer-term mental health and economic effects of the pandemic unfold.

Residual blood samples were collected for serology testing over 5-day periods monthly from June 2020 to January 2021 from six clinical laboratories across the province of Alberta, Canada. A total of 93,993 individual patient samples were tested with a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody assay with positives confirmed using a spike antibody assay. Population-adjusted SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity was 0.92% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91 to 0.93%) shortly after the first COVID-19 wave in June 2020, increasing to 4.63% (95% CI: 4.61 to 4.65%) amid the second wave in January 2021. There was no significant difference in seropositivity between males and females (1.39% versus 1.27%; P = 0.11). Ages with highest seropositivity were 0 to 9 years (2.71%, 95% CI: 1.64 to 3.78%) followed by 20 to 29 years (1.58%, 95% CI: 1.12 to 2.04%), with the lowest rates seen in those aged 70 to 79 (0.79%, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.93%) and >80 (0.78%, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.97%). Compared to the seronegative group, seropositive patients inhabited geographic areas with lower household income ($87,500 versus $97,500; P < 0.001), larger household sizes, and higher proportions of people with education levels of secondary school or lower, as well as immigrants and visible minority groups (all P < 0.05). A total of 53.7% of seropositive individuals were potentially undetected cases with no prior positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test (NAAT). Antibodies were detectable in some patients up to 9 months post positive NAAT result. This seroprevalence study will continue to inform public health decisions by identifying at-risk demographics and geographical areas. IMPORTANCE Using SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, we assessed the proportion of people in Alberta, Canada (population 4.4 million) positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating previous infection, during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic (prior to vaccination programs). Linking these results with sociodemographic population data provides valuable information as to which groups of the population are more likely to have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus to help facilitate public health decision-making and interventions. We also compared seropositivity data with previous COVID-19 molecular testing results. Absence of antibody and molecular testing were highly correlated (95% negative concordance). Positive antibody correlation with a previous positive molecular test was low, suggesting the possibility of mild/asymptomatic infection or other reasons leading individuals from seeking medical attention. Our data highlight that the true estimate of population prevalence of COVID-19 is likely best informed by combining data from both serology and molecular testing.","Charlton, Carmen L; Nguyen, Leonard T; Bailey, Ashley; Fenton, Jayne; Plitt, Sabrina S; Marohn, Carol; Lau, Cheryl; Hinshaw, Deena; Lutsiak, Christie; Simmonds, Kimberley; Kanji, Jamil N; Zelyas, Nathan; Lee, Nelson; Mengel, Michael; Tipples, Graham",Microbiol Spectr,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00291-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34406813/,339

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 4269 players (87% male, age: 21.7±4.2 years) and 2231 staff (87% male, age: 42.6±11.9 years) from 122 teams (women: n=16) involved in eight leagues (women: n=2), which took place in São Paulo, Brazil. Between 4 July 2020 and 21 December 2020, swab samples were collected weekly (n=29 507) and tested for SARS-Cov-2 via reverse transcription-PCR by an accredited laboratory commissioned by the São Paulo Football Federation. We contacted the medical staff of each team with positive cases to collect information on disease severity. RESULTS: Among 662 PCR-confirmed cases, 501 were athletes and 161 were staff. The new infection rate was 11.7% and 7.2% for athletes and staff, respectively. Athletes were more susceptible to infection than staff (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.42, 2.06, p<0.001), although with lower chance for moderate to severe disease (OR: 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.54, p=0.012). Six teams had ≥20 individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, whereas 19 teams had ≥10 confirmed cases. Twenty-five mass outbreaks were identified (≥5 infections within a team in a 2-week period). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was similar in athletes and staff as the general population in São Paulo. CONCLUSION: Despite weekly testing and other preventive measures, we found a high SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in athletes and staff after resuming football, which coincides with the high prevalence of infection in the community during the same period. These data may assist policy-makers and sports federations for determining if and when it is safe to resume competitions.","Gualano, Bruno; Brito, Gisele Mendes; Pinto, Ana Jéssica; Lemes, Italo Ribeiro; Matos, Luciana Diniz Nagem Janot; de Sá Pinto, Ana Lúcia; Loturco, Irineu",Br J Sports Med,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2021-104431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226184/,339

We find strong evidence that as a firm's CSR status improves (declines), increasing (decreasing) its risk-taking capacity, the firm responds by adjusting compensation contracts to increase (decrease) CEO risk-taking incentives (Vega). One channel of the adjustment is through stock option grants. Further analyses indicate that the positive CSR-Vega association is stronger in firms with better corporate governance and in industries where riskiness is more important.

WNV has spread rapidly across the United States since its introduction in 1999 and its geographical distribution within the western hemisphere is expected to further expand, whereas, JEV is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in Southeast Asia, China and India. Currently, there is no registered human vaccine or specific therapy to prevent or treat WNV infection. Here we describe the efficacy of recombinant domain III (DIII) of WNV glycoprotein E in a mouse model.

The results show the importance of early intervention: shutdowns and mask mandates reduced the COVID-19 infection growth rate immediately after being imposed statewide. Over the longer term, mask mandates had a larger effect on flattening the curve than shutdowns. The increase in the daily infection growth rate pushed state governments to shut down, but reopening led to significant increases in new cases 21 days afterward. The results suggest a dynamic social distancing approach: a shutdown for a short period followed by reopening, combined with universal mask wearing. We also found that the COVID-19 growth rate increased in states with higher percentages of essential workers (during reopening) and higher percentages of minorities (during the mask mandate period). Health insurance access for low-income workers (via Medicaid expansion) helped to reduce COVID-19 cases in the reopening model. The implications for public health show the importance of access to health insurance and mask mandates to protect low-income essential workers, but minority groups still face a higher risk of infection during the pandemic.","Zhang, Xue; Warner, Mildred E.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33353158/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249520,339

By investigating 17 acute and 24 convalescent patients, we found that acute SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in broad immune cell reduction including T, NK, monocyte and dendritic cell (DC). DCs were significantly reduced with functional impairment, and cDC:pDC ratios were increased among acute severe patients. Besides lymphocytopenia, although neutralizing antibodies were rapidly and abundantly generated in patients, there were delayed receptor binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NP)-specific T cell responses during the first 3 weeks post symptoms onset. Moreover, acute RBD- and NP-specific T cell responses included relatively more CD4 T cells than CD8 T cells. Our findings provided evidence that impaired DCs, together with timely inverted strong antibody but weak CD8 T cell responses, may contribute to acute COVID-19 pathogenesis and have implications for vaccine development.","Zhou, Runhong; Kai-Wang To, Kelvin; Wong, Yik-Chun; Liu, Li; Zhou, Biao; Li, Xin; Huang, Haode; Mo, Yufei; Luk, Tsz-Yat; Tsz-Kan Lau, Thomas; Yeung, Pauline; Chan, Wai-Ming; Ka-Lun Wu, Alan; Lung, Kwok-Cheung; Tak-Yin Tsang, Owen; Leung, Wai-Shing; Fan-Ngai Hung, Ivan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Chen, Zhiwei",Immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32791036/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761320303332; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761320303332?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.07.026,339

Methods SARS-CoV-2 lineages reported from South American countries were analyzed from a public dataset of 5597 genome assemblies. Polymorphisms in the main open reading frames were identified and compared to those present in the main lineages of epidemiology concern: B.1.1.7 (from UK) and B.1.351 (from South Africa). Results A total of 169 circulating lineages across 16 South American countries were identified, revealing a predominant circulation of the major lineage B, the one with the greatest diversity and broadest geographic distribution. Sixteen lineages were selected to be comprehensively analyzed because are predominant in the region. Two lineages of concern report were remarkably identified: P.1 recognized as the Brazilian variant (with 94 genomes) and B.1.1.7 the UK variant (with 28 genomes), both displayed 33 polymorphisms compared to the reference genome, the highest number among analyzed genomes. While the most of other lineages circulating in SA displayed 24 or less polymorphisms compared to the reference strain. A high number of polymorphisms were detected in the evaluated lineages with a limited number of common variable positions amongst them, in agreement with the profiles identified in the main lineages of epidemiology concern. Conclusions The ever-increasing genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 continues to lead to the emergence of novel lineages. Different variants and lineages are now present across SA with the presence of major lineage B mostly. The circulation of variants as P.1 and B.1.1.7 in different countries as well as the elevated number of polymorphisms highlighted the importance of continuing with the genomic surveillance to determine introduction events, identify transmission chains, trace emergence and help to implement successful prevention, vaccination and control strategies.","Muñoz, Marina; Patiño, Luz H.; Ballesteros, Nathalia; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Ramírez, Juan David",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33618008/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.02.073; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221001594; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221001594?v=s5,339

Understanding the environmental factors that affect the spread of the disease COVID-19 infection is critical to stop the spread of the disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether population density is associated with the infection rate of the COVID-19. We collected data from official webpages of cities in China and in the USA. The data were organized on Excel spreadsheets for statistical analyses. We calculated the morbidity and population density of cities and regions in these two countries. We then examined the relationship between morbidity and other factors. Our analysis indicated that the population density in cities in Hubei province where the COVID-19 was severe was associated with a higher percentage of morbidity, with an r value of 0.62. Similarly, in the USA, the density of 51 states and territories is also associated with morbidity from COVID-19 with an r value of 0.55. In contrast, as a control group, there is no association between the morbidity and population density in 33 other regions of China, where the COVID-19 epidemic is well under control. Interestingly, our study also indicated that these associations were not influenced by the first case of COVID-19. The rate of morbidity and the number of days from the first case in the USA have no association, with an r value of − 0.1288. Population density is positively associated with the percentage of patients with COVID-19 infection in the population.

596257,The COVID-19 Pandemic Revealed the Importance and Shortcomings of Technologies for Diabetes Support,2020-05-27,"Although expanding the availability of buprenorphine—a first-line pharmacotherapy for opioid-use disorder (OUD)—has increased the capacity of healthcare systems to offer treatment, starting this medication is fraught with significant barriers. Standard induction regimens require persons with OUD to taper and discontinue full opioid agonists and experience opioid withdrawal prior to the first dose of buprenorphine. Further, emerging evidence indicates that precipitated withdrawal during induction may impact long-term treatment outcomes. Microinduction is a novel approach that, by harnessing buprenorphine’s unique pharmacological profile, may allow circumventing the needed for prolonged opioid tapers, and reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal—holding promise to enhance treatment access. In this review, we examine the pharmacological basis for microinduction and appraise the evidence of this approach to improve clinical outcomes among persons with OUD. First, we highlight the potential dose-dependent effects of buprenorphine on two key neuroadaptations at the mu-opioid receptor (MOR)—resensitization and upregulation. We then focus on how microinduction may reverse these chronic MOR neuroadaptations, allowing the maintenance of an adequate opioid tone, and thereby potentially circumventing opioid withdrawal. Second, we describe the clinical evidence available, derived from observational reports and open-label studies, examining the potential efficacy of microinduction. Despite significant heterogeneity—exemplified by variable buprenorphine formulations, daily doses, and schedules of administration—these data provide preliminary support for the feasibility of microinduction. Finally, we provide new mechanistic, methodological, and clinical insights to guide future translational research, as well as randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in this compelling agenda of pharmacotherapy development.","De Aquino, Joao P.; Parida, Suprit; Sofuoglu, Mehmet",Clin Drug Investig,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40261-021-01032-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818748/,339

The most contagious form of COVID-19 associated with ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 majorly produces the cytokine storm and severe lung inflammation and ultimately leads to respiratory failure. ARDS is a complex disease and there is no proper therapeutics for effective therapy. Still, there is a huge scope to identify novel targets to combat respiratory illness. In the current study, we have identified the epigenetic regulating protein BRD4 and developed siRNA based nanomedicine to treat the ARDS. The liposomes were prepared by thin-film hydration method, where BRD4 siRNA complexed with cationic lipid and exhibited 96.24 ± 18.01 nm size and stable even in the presence of RNase. BRD4 siRNA lipoplexes (BRD4-siRNA-LP) inhibited inflammatory cells in lungs and suppressed the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the neutrophil infiltration and mast cell accumulation. Also, BRD4 siRNA based nanomedicine significantly reduced the LPS induced cytokine storm followed by inflammatory signaling pathways. Interestingly, BRD4-siRNA-LP suppressed the LPS-induced p65 and STAT3 nuclear translocation and ameliorated the lung inflammation. Thus, BRD4-siRNA-LP could be a plausible therapeutic option for treating ARDS and might be useful for combating the COVID-19 associated respiratory illness.","Pooladanda, Venkatesh; Thatikonda, Sowjanya; Priya Muvvala, Sai; Devabattula, Geetanjali; Godugu, Chandraiah",Int J Pharm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781885/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517321003410?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378517321003410; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2021.120536,339

All anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in use are conceived to induce anti-Spike neutralizing antibodies. However, this strategy still has unresolved issues, the most relevant of which are: (i) the resistance to neutralizing antibodies of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and (ii) the waning of neutralizing antibodies. On the other hand, both pre-clinical evidence and clinical evidence support the idea that the immunity sustained by antigen-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes can complement and also surrogate the antiviral humoral immunity. As a distinctive feature, anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8(+) T-driven immunity maintains its efficacy even in the presence of viral protein mutations. In addition, on the basis of data obtained in survivors of the SARS-CoV epidemic, this immunity is expected to last for several years. In this review, both the mechanisms and role of CD8(+) T-cell immunity in viral infections, particularly those induced by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, are analyzed. Moreover, a CD8(+) T-cell-based vaccine platform relying on in vivo engineered extracellular vesicles is described.

A major limitation of conventional deep learning is uncertainty quantification in predictions which affect investor confidence. Bayesian neural networks feature Bayesian inference for providing inference (training) of model parameters that provides a rigorous methodology for uncertainty quantification in predictions. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods have been prominent in implementing inference of Bayesian neural networks; however certain limitations existed due to a large number of parameters and the need for better computational resources. Recently, there has been much progress in the area of Bayesian neural networks given the use of Langevin gradients with parallel tempering MCMC that can be implemented in a parallel computing environment. The COVID-19 pandemic had a drastic impact in the world economy and stock markets given different levels of lockdowns due to rise and fall of daily infections. It is important to investigate the performance of related forecasting models during the COVID-19 pandemic given the volatility in stock markets. In this paper, we use novel Bayesian neural networks for multi-step-ahead stock price forecasting before and during COVID-19. We also investigate if the pre-COVID-19 datasets are useful of modelling stock price forecasting during COVID-19. Our results indicate due to high volatility in the stock-price during COVID-19, it is more challenging to provide forecasting.

Depletion of G3BP1 inhibits SGs formation and overexpression of G3BP1 nucleates SGs assembly. We observed that knockdown of G3BP1 by silencing RNA significantly increased PEDV replication. Overexpression of exogenous G3BP1, on the other hand, lowered virus replication by 100-fold compared to vector control. An increase in the levels of mRNAs of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was also observed in PEDV-infected G3BP1 depleted cells compared to PEDV-infected control cells. Taken together, our results suggest that G3BP1 plays an antiviral role and impairs PEDV replication.","Pandey, Kabita; Zhong, Shuhong; Diel, Diego G.; Hou, Yixuan; Wang, Qiuhong; Nelson, Eric; Wang, Xiuqing",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500725/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519306960; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108392; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519306960,339

In this article we analyze how a collection of welfare state agents with different tasks, resources and interests in interaction formed an assemblage in their responses to the pandemic and how education thereby became part of a strategy to keep the society going. The inquiries concern what this tells us about education as framed and constrained as a part of society. Our observations are based on statements presented by the government and public agencies, mass media and websites. We identified an assemblage of interwoven agents such as institutions, laws, regulations and recommendations, pandemic manuals, statistics and media. All these were brought together by actions and ideas to handle a pandemic when there were no preventive vaccines. The overarching principle was to educate the population to competent actions in dealing with the pandemic. To keep schools open was part of that principle combined with caretaking ambitions. This assemblage looked like a centralistic machine but it was not; risks were pushed back to local authorities and schools. In conclusion, we note that education is vital in the overarching strategy to deal with the pandemic in Sweden in terms of trust in people and governmentality.","Lindblad, Sverker; Lindqvist, Anders; Runesdotter, Caroline; Wärvik, Gun-Britt",Z Erziehwiss,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11618-021-01001-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33686342/,339

However, as of today, no dedicated software exists that implements these methods and allow comparisons. RESULTS: A review of generic methods used to estimate transmissibility parameters during outbreaks was carried out. Most methods used the epidemic curve and the generation time distribution. Two categories of methods were available: those estimating the initial reproduction number, and those estimating a time dependent reproduction number. We implemented five methods as an R library, developed sensitivity analysis tools for each method and provided numerical illustrations of their use. A comparison of the performance of the different methods on simulated datasets is reported.

METHODS: All adults diagnosed with new onset diabetes from during the time of COVID-19 were compared with new onset diabetes prior to COVID-19, from two tertiary care hospitals in Chennai and Delhi. RTPCR test for SARS-CoV-2 virus was done as appropriate, and COVID-19 antibody test was done in all other NOD COVID patients. RESULT: A total of 555 patients with new onset diabetes were included in the study (282 NOD and 273 NOD COVID patients). Patients with NOD COVID had higher fasting and post prandial blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin vs. NOD patients. Both the groups had high average body mass index; ∼28 kg/m2. Interestingly, fasting C-peptide levels were significantly higher in the NOD COVID group vs. NOD group. There was no difference in C-peptide or glycemic parameters between the COVID-19 antibody positive and negative NOD COVID cases.

Vitamin D has emerged as a potential treatment able to reduce the disease severity. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the effect of calcifediol [25OHD3] treatment on COVID-19-related outcomes. DESIGN: Observational cohort study from March to May, 2020. SETTING: Patients admitted to COVID-19 wards of Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain. PATIENTS: A total of 930 patients with COVID-19 were included. Ninety-two were excluded due to previous calcifediol intake. INTERVENTION: Of the remaining 838, a total of 447 received calcifediol (532ug on day one plus 266ug on day 3, 7, 15, and 30) whereas 391 were not treated at the time of hospital admission (Intention-to-Treat). Of the latter, 53 patients were treated later during ICU admission and were allocated in the treated group in a second analysis. In healthy subjects, calcifediol is about 3.2-fold more potent on a weight basis than cholecalciferol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ICU admission and mortality. RESULTS: ICU assistance was required by 102 (12.2%) participants. Out of 447 patients treated with calcifediol at admission, 20 (4.5%) required ICU, compared to 82 (21%) out of 391 non-treated (p-value<0.0001). Logistic regression of calcifediol treatment on ICU admission, adjusted by age, gender, linearized 25OHD levels at baseline, and comorbidities showed that treated patients had a reduced risk to require ICU (OR 0.13 [95% CI 0.07;0.23]). Overall mortality was 10%. In the Intention-to-Treat analysis, 21 (4.7%) out of 447 patients treated with calcifediol at admission died compared to 62 patients (15.9%) out of 391 non-treated (p=0.0001). Adjusted results showed a reduced mortality risk with an OR 0.21 [95% CI 0.10; 0.43]). In the second analysis, the obtained OR was 0.52 [95% CI 0.27;0.99]. CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, calcifediol treatment significantly reduced ICU admission and mortality.","Nogues, Xavier; Ovejero, Diana; Pineda-Moncusí, Marta; Bouillon, Roger; Arenas, Dolors; Pascual, Julio; Ribes, Anna; Guerri-Fernandez, Robert; Villar-Garcia, Judit; Rial, Abora; Gimenez-Argente, Carme; Cos, Maria Lourdes; Rodriguez-Morera, Jaime; Campodarve, Isabel; Quesada-Gomez, José Manuel; Garcia-Giralt, Natalia",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34097036/; https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgab405,339
607128,Disparities and Temporal Trends in COVID-19 Exposures and Mitigating Behaviors Among Black and Hispanic Adults in an Urban Setting,2021-09-28,"Objectives: Several risk factors have been identified for severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. Some can be found in structured data of patients' Electronic Health Records. Others are included as unstructured free-text, and thus cannot be easily detected automatically. We propose an automated real-time detection of risk factors using a combination of data mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Material and methods: Patients were categorized as negative or positive for SARS-CoV-2, and according to disease severity (severe or non-severe COVID-19). Comorbidities were identified in the unstructured free-text using NLP. Further risk factors were taken from the structured data. Results: 6250 patients were analysed (5664 negative and 586 positive; 461 non-severe and 125 severe). Using NLP, comorbidities, i.e. cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions, diabetes, dementia and cancer, were automatically detected (error rate [≤]2%). Old age, male sex, higher BMI, arterial hypertension, chronic heart failure, coronary heart disease, COPD, diabetes, insulin only treatment of diabetic patients, reduced kidney and liver function were risk factors for severe COVID-19. Interestingly, the proportion of diabetic patients using metformin but not insulin was significantly higher in the non-severe COVID-19 cohort (p<0.05). Discussion and conclusion: Our findings were in line with previously reported risk factors for severe COVID-19. NLP in combination with other data mining approaches appears to be a suitable tool for the automated real-time detection of risk factors, which can be a time saving support for risk assessment and triage, especially in patients with long medical histories and multiple comorbidities.","Schoening, V.; Liakoni, E.; Drewe, J.; Hammann, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.25.21254314v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.25.21254314,339

OBJECTIVE: Analyze SARS-CoV-2 infection in pediatric patients with hemoglobinopathy. METHODS: Using the online platforms LILACS, PUBMED and EMBASE, on 17- JUL-2020 a search was made for the terms COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 associated with “sickle cell”, “thalassemia” and “hemoglobinopathy”. RESULTS: There were 623 pediatric and adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) or beta thalassemia (BT) and COVID-19. Total mortality rate was 6.42%. No pediatric patient with BT has been described. So, our analysis focused on children and adolescents with SCD: there were 121 pediatric patients, one adolescent died, prophylactic anticoagulation was prescribed to six patients, 11.76% needed intensive care unit, blood transfusion was prescribed in 29.70%. Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and acute chest syndrome (ACS) were the main clinical manifestations in SCD. DISCUSSION: Pediatric patients with SCD and COVID-19 have a low mortality rate when compared to adults, although is higher than the global pediatric population with COVID-19 (0−0.67%). The comorbidities associated with age and the long-term complications inherent to hemoglobinopathies may contribute to the increased mortality outside the pediatric age group. In SCD the clinical manifestations, both in children and adults, are VOC and ACS, and there was increase in blood requirement. Pediatric SCD patients with COVID-19 need more intensive care unit than the global pediatric population (3.30%). CONCLUSION: Despite pediatric population with SCD needs more intensive care, the outcome after infection by COVID-19 is favorable.","Vilela, Thiago de Souza; Braga, Josefina Aparecida Pellegrini; Loggetto, Sandra Regina",Hematol Transfus Cell Ther,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2531137920313006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2531137920313006?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33289008/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.htct.2020.11.002,339
608830,A Computational Modeling Study of COVID-19 in Bangladesh,2020-11-02,Abstract This chapter addresses the application of data and information fusion to the design of integrated systems in the Homeland Protection (HP) domain. HP is a wide and complex domain: systems in this domain are large (in terms of size and scope) integrated (each subsystem cannot be considered as an isolated system) and different in purpose. Such systems require a multidisciplinary approach for their design and analysis and they are necessarily required to provide data and information fusion in the most general sense. The first data fusion algorithms employed in real systems in the radar field go back to the early seventies; now a days new concepts have been developed and spread to be applied to very complex systems with the aim to achieve the highest level of intelligence as possible and hopefully to support decision. Data fusion is aimed to enhance situation awareness and decision making through the combination of information/data obtained by networks of homogeneous and/or heterogeneous sensors. The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of the several approaches that can be followed to design and analyze systems for homeland protection. Different fusion architectures can be drawn on the basis of the employed algorithms: they are analyzed under several aspects in this chapter.

610008,Risk for Severe COVID-19 Illness Among Health Care Workers Who Work Directly with Patients,2020-06-24,"Cough is an important physiological mechanism to protect the lower airways, but it is also one of the most common symptoms that lead patients to seek medical consultations. Chronic cough, usually defined by cough duration longer than 8 weeks in adults, is prevalent in the community and impairs quality of life in individual patients. There are several characteristics that may differentiate pathologic coughs from protective cough responses, including cough duration, frequency, hypersensitivity, impaired cough suppressibility, or treatment refractoriness. However, the impact of cough, or its perceived severity, is a sum of the patient's experience of coughing and is a factor that may finally define cough as a disease. Social isolation is a major impact of chronic cough, which is now worse due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and a widespread fear of cough as a source of contagion. Emotional impact and economic impact (medical cost, reduced work productivity, and job loss) are also important complications of chronic cough, and they interact in a vicious cycle, aggravated by social isolation and treatment failures. This paper is a narrative review that aims to address the impact and disease burden of chronic cough in adult patients. We review the literature, but also introduce the findings from recent qualitative interviews and the patients' experiences of the impact and burden of chronic cough and discuss unmet needs in these patients.","Won, Ha-Kyeong; Song, Woo-Jung",Asia Pac Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007832/; https://doi.org/10.5415/apallergy.2021.11.e22,339

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two-hundred thirty-seven patients admitted to the hospital with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia diagnosed by clinical, radiology and molecular tests in the nasopharyngeal swab who underwent a chest computed tomography because of a respiratory worsening from Apr 1 to Apr 30, 2020 were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups depending on the presence and amount of atelectasis at the computed tomography: no atelectasis, small atelectasis (< 5% of the estimated lung volume) or large atelectasis (> 5% of the estimated lung volume). In all patients, clinical severity, oxygen-therapy need, Intensive Care Unit admission rate, the length of in-hospital stay and in-hospital mortality data were collected. RESULTS: Thirty patients (19%) showed small atelectasis while eight patients (5%) showed large atelectasis. One hundred and seventeen patients (76%) did not show atelectasis. Patients with large atelectasis compared to patients with small atelectasis had lower SatO(2)/FiO(2) (182 vs 411 respectively, p = 0.01), needed more days of oxygen therapy (20 vs 5 days respectively, p = 0,02), more frequently Intensive Care Unit admission (75% vs 7% respectively, p < 0.01) and a longer period of hospitalization (40 vs 14 days respectively p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, atelectasis might appear in up to 24% of patients and the presence of larger amount of atelectasis is associated with worse oxygenation and clinical outcome.

610799,Regular versus extended shift outbreak roster in the emergency department and its impact on staff well-being,2020-06-24,"INTRODUCTION: Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemics, it is known that the severe course of the disease occurs mostly among elderly, whereas it is rare among children and young adults. Comorbidities, in particular diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke are strongly associated with the need of intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukemia. AIM AND METHODS: We made a flash survey on COVID19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short web based survey. RESULTS: We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed. At the time of the survey, over 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken as well as treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Thus, even children receiving anti-cancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.","Hrusak, Ondrej; Kalina, Tomas; Wolf, Joshua; Balduzzi, Adriana; Provenzi, Massimo; Rizzari, Carmelo; Rives, Susana; del Pozo Carlavilla, María; Valerio Alonso, Maria Eli; Domínguez Pinilla, Nerea; Bourquin, Jean-Pierre; Schmiegelow, Kjeld; Attarbaschi, Andishe; Grillner, Pernilla; Mellgren, Karin; Ten Bosch van der Werff, J.; Pieters, Rob; Brozou, Triantafyllia; Borkhardt, Arndt; Escherich, Gabriele; Lauten, Melchior; Stanulla, Martin; Smith, Owen; Juh Yeoh, Allen Eng; Elitzur, Sarah; Vora, Ajay; Li, Chi-Kong; Ariffin, Hany; Kolenova, Alexandra; Dallapozza, Luciano; Farah, Roula; Lazic, Jelena; Manabe, Atsushi; Styczynski, Jan; Kovacs, Gabor; Ottoffy, Gabor; Felice, Marisa; Buldini, Barbara; Conter, Valentino; Stary, Jan; Schrappe, Martin",Eur J Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32305831/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.03.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804920301623?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804920301623,339

This motif is palmitoylated in the Betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV. Here, we demonstrate by metabolic labeling with [(3)H]-palmitic acid that the S protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), an Alphacoronavirus, is palmitoylated as well. This is relevant for TGEV replication as virus growth was compromised by the general palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate. Mutation of individual cysteine clusters in the cysteine-rich motif of S revealed that all cysteines must be replaced to abolish acylation and incorporation of S into virus-like particles (VLP). Conversely, the interaction of S with the M protein, essential for VLP incorporation of S, was not impaired by lack of palmitoylation. Thus, palmitoylation of the S protein of Alphacoronaviruses is dispensable for S–M interaction, but required for the generation of progeny virions.","Gelhaus, Sandra; Thaa, Bastian; Eschke, Kathrin; Veit, Michael; Schwegmann-Weßels, Christel",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.07.035; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268221400350X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268221400350X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25113909/,339

Of the 388 new cases, oxygen was administered to 57 patients (14.7%) at the time of admission and 103 patients (26.5%) during hospitalization. Of the 103 patients, 90 (87.3%) received steroid treatment. Thirty–seven patients (9.5%) had a high oxygen demand of 6L/min or more; of these, 12 (3.1%) were transferred to intensive care facilities, and 15 (3.9%) died. Conclusion: The temporary COVID–19 field hospital dedicated to moderate illness possibly contributed to preventing progression to critical COVID–19.","(Hiroshi Koyama), 小山 洋史; (Yoshihisa Aida), 會田 悦久; (Hiroshi Yamagami), 山上 浩; (Tomohiro Kumagae), 熊谷 知博; (Sho Nishiguchi), 西口 翔; (Tadashi Kamio), 神尾 直; (Jun Kawachi), 河内 順",Nihon Kyukyu Igakukai Zasshi: Journal of Japanese Association for Acute Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/jja2.12623,339

Here we assessed potential antiviral activities of K22 against a range of viruses representing two (sub)families of the order Nidovirales, the Arteriviridae (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [PRRSV], equine arteritis virus [EAV] and simian hemorrhagic fever virus [SHFV]), and the Torovirinae (equine torovirus [EToV] and White Bream virus [WBV]). Possible effects of K22 on nidovirus replication were studied in suitable cell lines. K22 concentrations significantly decreasing infectious titres of the viruses included in this study ranged from 25 to 50 μM. Reduction of double-stranded RNA intermediates of viral replication in nidovirus-infected cells treated with K22 confirmed the anti-viral potential of K22. Collectively, the data show that K22 has antiviral activity against diverse lineages of nidoviruses, suggesting that the inhibitor targets a critical and conserved step during nidovirus replication.","Rappe, Julie Christiane Françoise; de Wilde, Adriaan; Di, Han; Müller, Christin; Stalder, Hanspeter; V’kovski, Philip; Snijder, Eric; Brinton, Margo A.; Ziebuhr, John; Ruggli, Nicolas; Thiel, Volker",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217308560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29337162/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.01.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217308560,339

Data on healthcare indices are collected from data published on Web of Sciences and other Google survey from various governing bodies. In this review, we focused on various aspects of blockchain and artificial intelligence and also discussed about integrating both technologies for making a significant difference in healthcare by promoting the implementation of a generalizable analytical technology that can be integrated into a more comprehensive risk management approach. This article has shown the various possibilities of creating reliable artificial intelligence models in e-Health using blockchain, which is an open network for the sharing and authorization of information. Healthcare professionals will have access to the blockchain to display the medical records of the patient, and AI uses a variety of proposed algorithms and decision-making capability, as well as large quantities of data. Thus, by integrating the latest advances of these technologies, the medical system will have improved service efficiency, reduced costs, and democratized healthcare.

Although real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current diagnostic method, challenges for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) necessitate cheaper, higher-throughput, reliable rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the documented performance characteristics of available COVID-19 RDTs to understand their public health utility in the ongoing pandemic, especially in resource-scarce LMIC settings. METHODS: Using a scoping review methodology framework, common literature databases and documentary reports were searched up to 22 April 2020, irrespective of geographical location. The search terms included ‘SARS-CoV-2 AND serological testing’ and ‘COVID-19 AND serological testing’. RESULTS: A total of 18 RDTs produced in eight countries, namely China (6; 33.33%), the United States (4; 22.22%), Germany (2; 11.11%), Singapore (2; 11.11%), Canada, Kenya, Korea and Belgium (1 each; 5.56%), were evaluated. Reported sensitivity ranged from 18.4% to 100% (average = 84.7%), whereas specificity ranged from 90.6% to 100% (average = 95.6%). The testing time ranged from 2 min to 30 min. Of the 12 validated RDTs, the IgM/IgG duo kit with non-colloidal gold labelling system was reported to elicit the highest sensitivity (98% – 100%) and specificity (98% – 99% for IgG and 96% – 99% for IgM). CONCLUSION: We found reports of high sensitivity and specificity among the developed RDTs that could complement RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, especially for screening in LMICs. However, it is necessary to validate these kits locally.","Olalekan, Adesola; Iwalokun, Bamidele; Akinloye, Oluwabukola M.; Popoola, Olayiwola; Samuel, Titilola A.; Akinloye, Oluyemi",Afr J Lab Med,https://doi.org/10.4102/ajlm.v9i1.1255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33102170/,339

Children also completed online surveys at ages 11–16 assessing self-efficacy, optimism, and coping. Multi-level modeling analyses showed a within-person increase in mental health symptoms from before to after the outbreak after controlling for changes associated with maturation. Symptom increases were mitigated in youth with greater self-efficacy and (to some extent) problem-focused engaged coping, and exacerbated in youth with greater emotion-focused engaged and disengaged coping. Implications of this work include the importance of reinforcing self-efficacy in youth during times of crisis, such as the pandemic, and the potential downsides of emotion-focused coping as an early response to the crisis for youth.","Hussong, Andrea M.; Midgette, Allegra J.; Thomas, Taylor E.; Coffman, Jennifer L.; Cho, Su",Res Child Adolesc Psychopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856611/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-021-00821-0,339

Despite that, the syndrome remains under-recognised and under-diagnosed. Paradoxically, it affects exclusively patients with mild forms of sickle cell disease, predominantly HbSC and HbSβ(+). A significant number of cases occur in the context of human parvovirus B19 infection. We provide here a brief summary of the existing literature and describe our experience treating 8 patients in our institution. One patient had HbSS, 6 HbSC and 1 HbSβ(+). All patients developed type I respiratory failure and neurological involvement either at presentation or within the first 72 h. The most striking laboratory abnormality was a 100-fold increase of the serum ferritin from baseline. Seven patients received emergency red cell exchange and 1 simple transfusion. Two patients (25%) died, 2 patients (25%) suffered severe neurological impairment and 1 (12%) mild neurological impairment on discharge, while 3 (38%) patients made a complete recovery. With long-term follow-up, 1 patient with severe neurological impairment and one patient with mild neurological impairment made dramatic improvements, making the long-term complete recovery or near complete recovery rate 63%. Immediate red cell exchange transfusion can be lifesaving and should be instituted as soon as the syndrome is suspected. However, as the outcomes remain unsatisfactory despite the increasing use of red cell exchange, we suggest additional therapeutic measures such as therapeutic plasma exchange and pre-emptive transfusion for high risk patients.","Tsitsikas, Dimitris A.; Bristowe, Jessica; Abukar, Jibril",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9113601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33171683/,339

The current infection trends of a disease in some targeted locations are efficiently captured by the ESN when it is fed with the infection data for other locations. The performance of the ESN is first tested with synthetic data generated by numerical simulations of independent uncoupled patches, each governed by the classical susceptible-infected-recovery model for a choice of distributed infection parameters. From a large pool of synthetic data, the ESN predicts the current trend of infection in patches by exploiting the uncorrelated infection trend of patches. The prediction remains consistent for most of the patches for approximately 4 to 5 weeks. The machine's performance is further tested with real data on the current COVID-19 pandemic collected for different countries. We show that our proposed scheme is able to predict the trend of the disease for up to 3 weeks for some targeted locations. An important point is that no detailed information on the epidemiological rate parameters is needed;the success of the machine rather depends on the history of the disease progress represented by the time-evolving data sets of a large number of locations.

625155,Covid-19 pandemic: Economic burden on patients with musculoskeletal injuries in a tertiary care hospital of LMIC; retrospective cross sectional study,2020-10-12,"Smaller, more affordable, and more portable MRI brain scanners offer exciting opportunities to address unmet research needs and long-standing health inequities in remote and resource-limited international settings. Field-based neuroimaging research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) can improve local capacity to conduct both structural and functional neuroscience studies, expand knowledge of brain injury and neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, and ultimately improve the timeliness and quality of clinical diagnosis and treatment around the globe. Facilitating MRI research in remote settings can also diversify reference databases in neuroscience, improve understanding of brain development and degeneration across the lifespan in diverse populations, and help to create reliable measurements of infant and child development. These deeper understandings can lead to new strategies for collaborating with communities to mitigate and hopefully overcome challenges that negatively impact brain development and quality of life. Despite the potential importance of research using highly portable MRI in remote and resource-limited settings, there is little analysis of the attendant ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI). To begin addressing this gap, this paper presents findings from the first phase of an envisioned multi-staged and iterative approach for creating ethical and legal guidance in a complex global landscape. Section 1 provides a brief introduction to the emerging technology for field-based MRI research. Section 2 presents our methodology for generating plausible use cases for MRI research in remote and resource-limited settings and identifying associated ELSI issues. Section 3 analyzes core ELSI issues in designing and conducting field-based MRI research in remote, resource-limited settings and offers recommendations. We argue that a guiding principle for field-based MRI research in these contexts should be including local communities and research participants throughout the research process in order to create sustained local value. Section 4 presents a recommended path for the next phase of work that could further adapt these use cases, address ethical and legal issues, and co-develop guidance in partnership with local communities.","Shen, Francis X.; Wolf, Susan M.; Bhavnani, Supriya; Deoni, Sean; Elison, Jed T.; Fair, Damien; Garwood, Michael; Gee, Michael S.; Geethanath, Sairam; Kay, Kendrick; Lim, Kelvin O.; Estrin, Georgia Lockwood; Luciana, Monica; Peloquin, David; Rommelfanger, Karen; Schiess, Nicoline; Siddiqui, Khan; Torres, Efraín; Vaughan, J.

To resolve the abrupt overloading of COVID-19–suspected patients in a community, each ED needs to respond in various ways. In our hospital, we increased the isolation beds through temporary remodeling and by performing in-hospital COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction testing rather than outsourcing them. The aim of this study was to verify the effects of our response to the newly developed viral outbreak. The medical records of patients who presented to an ED were analyzed retrospectively. We divided the study period into 3: pre-COVID-19, transition period of response (the period before fully implementing the response measures), and post-response (the period after complete response). We compared the parameters of the National Emergency Department Information System and information about isolation and COVID-19. The number of daily ED patients was 86.8 ± 15.4 in the pre-COVID-19, 36.3 ± 13.6 in the transition period, and 67.2 ± 10.0 in the post-response period (P < .001). The lengths of stay in the ED were significantly higher in transition period than in the other periods [pre-COVID-19 period, 219.0 (121.0–378.0) min; transition period, 301 (150.0–766.5) min; post-response period, 281.0 (114.0–575.0) min; P < .001]. The ratios of use of an isolation room and fever (≥37.5°C) were highest in the post-response period [use of isolation room: pre-COVID-19 period, 0.6 (0.7%); transition period, 1.2 (3.3%); post-response period, 16.1 (24.0%); P < .001; fever: pre-COVID-19 period, 14.8(17.3%); transition period, 6.8 (19.1%); post-response period, 14.5 (21.9%), P < .001].

REACT-1 is a survey of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the community in England, based on repeated cross-sectional samples of the population. Between 6th and 22nd January 2021, out of 167,642 results, 2,282 were positive giving a weighted national prevalence of infection of 1.57% (95% CI, 1.49%, 1.66%). The R number nationally over this period was estimated at 0.98 (0.92, 1.04). Prevalence remained high throughout, but with suggestion of a decline at the end of the study period. The average national trend masked regional heterogeneity, with robustly decreasing prevalence in one region (South West) and increasing prevalence in another (East Midlands). Overall prevalence at regional level was highest in London at 2.83% (2.53%, 3.16%). Although prevalence nationally was highest in the low-risk 18 to 24 year old group at 2.44% (1.96%, 3.03%), it was also high in those over 65 years who are most at risk, at 0.93% (0.82%, 1.05%). Large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood, and Black and Asian ethnicity were all associated with higher levels of infections compared to smaller households, less deprived neighbourhoods and other ethnicities. Healthcare and care home workers, and other key workers, were more likely to test positive compared to other workers. If sustained lower prevalence is not achieved rapidly in England, pressure on healthcare services and numbers of COVID-19 deaths will remain unacceptably high.","Riley, S.; Eales, O.; Walters, C.

We conducted a study among the lay public in Wuhan to access their support, understanding of, compliance with, and the psychological impacts of the quarantine. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, online-based survey study between January 28, 2020, and February 2, 2020 among the adult lay public in Wuhan to access their support, understanding of, compliance with, and the psychological impacts of the quarantine. Multivariable logistic analysis was used to identify factors associated with psychological impacts. Results Among the 4100 participants investigated, a total of 15.9% were compliant with all the five household prevention measures, whereas 74.4% were compliant with all the three community prevention measures investigated. By demographics, participants of younger age, higher income, residing in an urban area, knowing neighbors infected with COVID-19 reported significantly higher psychological impact score. Participants with a lower level of support for quarantine were more likely to have a higher psychological impact score (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.07–1.96). Participants with a lower level of compliance with preventive measures (score of 0–19) reported higher psychological impact (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.22–1.60 vs. score 20–24).

Infections by human-pathogenic coronaviruses result in diverse clinical outcomes, ranging from self-limiting flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia with extrapulmonary manifestations. Understanding how cellular lipids may modulate the pathogenicity of human-pathogenic coronaviruses remains poor. To this end, we utilized the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) as a model coronavirus to comprehensively characterize the host cell lipid response upon coronavirus infection with an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS)-based lipidomics approach. Our results revealed that glycerophospholipids and fatty acids (FAs) were significantly elevated in the HCoV-229E-infected cells and the linoleic acid (LA) to arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism axis was markedly perturbed upon HCoV-229E infection. Interestingly, exogenous supplement of LA or AA in HCoV-229E-infected cells significantly suppressed HCoV-229E virus replication. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of LA and AA on virus replication was also conserved for the highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Taken together, our study demonstrated that host lipid metabolic remodeling was significantly associated with human-pathogenic coronavirus propagation. Our data further suggested that lipid metabolism regulation would be a common and druggable target for coronavirus infections.","Yan, Bingpeng; Chu, Hin; Yang, Dong; Sze, Kong-Hung; Lai, Pok-Man; Yuan, Shuofeng; Shuai, Huiping; Wang, Yixin; Kao, Richard Yi-Tsun; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30654597/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11010073,339

Aims to examine whether time from symptoms onset to intensive care unit (ICU) admission affects incidence of extra-pulmonary complications and prognosis in order to provide a new insight for reducing the mortality. A single-centered, retrospective, observational study investigated 45 critically ill patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in ICU of The Third People's Hospital of Yichang from January 17 to March 29, 2020. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to time from symptoms onset to ICU admission (>7 and ≤7 days) and into 2 groups according to prognosis (survivors and non-survivors). Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics and treatment data were studied. Compared with patients who admitted to the ICU since symptoms onset ≤7 days (55.6%), patients who admitted to the ICU since symptoms onset >7 days (44.4%) were more likely to have extra-pulmonary complications (19 [95.0%] vs 16 [64.0%], P = .034), including acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, acute heart failure, liver dysfunction, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hyperamylasemia, and hypernatremia. The incidence rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumothorax, and hospital-acquired pneumonia had no difference between the 2 groups. Except activated partial thromboplastin and Na(+) concentration, the laboratory findings were worse in group of time from symptoms onset to ICU admission >7 days. There was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups. Of the 45 cases in the ICU, 19 (42.2%) were non-survivors, and 16 (35.6%) were with hospital-acquired pneumonia. Among these non-survivors, hospital-acquired pneumonia was up to 12 (63.2%) besides higher incidence of extra-pulmonary complications.

We aimed to evaluate the chest CT radiological characteristics and lesion distribution patterns in patients of COVID-19 pneumonia in London, UK. Methods We performed a retrospective study and reviewed data of patients with clinically suspected COVID-19 who underwent chest CT between February 1 and May 5, 2020. All patients underwent the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Lung lesion characteristics and distribution patterns were evaluated by two radiologists. Fisher’s exact test was used for statistical analysis, and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 18 patients (nine men and nine women) were analyzed. All of them had bilateral patchy lesions in the chest CT images. There was no correlation between the severity score and mortality (p=0.790). The distinctive CT features included ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidative patchy amorphous lesions, bilateral posterior and peripheral multi-lobar lung involvement, pleural effusions, subpleural fibrotic lines, subpleural sparing, vascular engorgement, occasional crazy paving, occasional mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural thickening, lack of cavitation, and absence of reverse halo (atoll) signs. Conclusion CT can facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Our UK cohort showed slight variations compared with previously reported Asian and continental European cases with respect to chest CT images.","Pakdemirli, Emre; Mandalia, Uday; Monib, Sherif",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32923301/,339
631031,688 Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and COVID-19-Related Adverse Clinical Outcomes,2021-05-03,"Abstract Background and aims Despite anticoagulation, usually with heparin, mortality for thromboembolic events in COVID-19 remains high. Clinical efficacy of heparin is due to its interaction with antithrombin (AT) that may be decreased in COVID-19. Therefore, we correlated AT levels with outcomes of COVID-19. Methods and Results We recruited 49 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19. AT levels were significantly lower in 16 non-survivors than in 33 survivors (72.2±23.4 versus 94.6±19.5%; p=0.0010). A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that low AT (levels below 80%) was a predictor of mortality (HR:3.97; 95%CI:1.38 to 11.43; p=0.0103). BMI was the only variable that showed a significant difference between patients with low and those with normal AT levels (32.9±7.9 versus 27.5±5.9%; p=0.0104). AT levels were significantly lower in obese patients than in subjects with normal weight or overweight (77.9±26.9 versus 91.4±26.9 versus 91.4±17.1%; p=0.025). An inverse correlation between AT levels and BMI was documented (r:-0.33; p=0.0179). Conclusions Our data first suggest that AT is strongly associated with mortality in COVID-19. In addition, AT may be the link between obesity and a poorer prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Other studies should confirm whether AT may become a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in COVID-19.","Gazzaruso, Carmine; Paolozzi, Enrico; Valenti, Cinzia; Brocchetta, Mauro; Naldani, Daniela; Grignani, Claudio; Salvucci, Fabrizio; Marino, Francesco; Coppola, Adriana; Gallotti, Pietro",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S093947532030315X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32907762/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S093947532030315X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.07.040,339

This novel coronavirus was first reported end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, however the powerful contamination spread among people forced the World Health Organization to characterize the Covid-19 as a pandemic in March of 2020. Here we analyze the main Brazilian airlines operations response due to lower demand because Covid-19 outbreak in first quarter of 2020 comparing with first quarter of 2019. The analysis here aims to verify the efficiency of airlines in domestic air transport market in Brazil through Multicriteria Data Envelopment Analysis (MCDEA) model. We used MCDEA to avoid limitations of classical DEA models for the case, especially the numbers of decision units and variable. In this paper we used an improvement of the MCDEA model to seek benchmarks considering a dual model all objective functions of MCDEA. The results highlight the challenges for the airlines, due to flight restriction and demand dropping. And also, the evaluation exposes the different company configuration of aircrafts age and network reconfiguration which was reflected by the efficiency difference on the period. The assessment shows the company with a better mix of aircraft models has a leverage on efficiency response due to unpredictable period as the pandemic Covid-19 outbreak.","Pereira, Deivison DA Silveira; Soares de Mello, Joao Carlos Correia Baptista",J Air Transp Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33235408/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jairtraman.2020.101976; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969699720305597; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699720305597?v=s5,339
633036,Association between ambient PM(2.5) and emergency department visits for psychiatric emergency diseases(),2018-11-24,"Background Measurement of post-exertion oxygen saturation has been proposed to assess illness severity in suspected COVID-19 infection. We aimed to determine the accuracy of post-exertional oxygen saturation for predicting adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19. Methods We undertook an observational cohort study across 70 emergency departments during first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. We collected data prospectively, using a standardised assessment form, and retrospectively, using hospital records, from patients with suspected COVID-19, and reviewed hospital records at 30 days for adverse outcome (death or receiving organ support). Patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded were selected for this analysis. Results We analysed data from 817 patients with post-exertion oxygen saturation recorded after excluding 54 in whom measurement appeared unfeasible. The c-statistic for post-exertion change in oxygen saturation was 0.589 (95% confidence interval 0.465 to 0.713), and the positive and negative likelihood ratios of a 3% or more desaturation were respectively 1.78 (1.25 to 2.53) and 0.67 (0.46 to 0.98). Multivariable analysis showed that post-exertion oxygen saturation was not a significant predictor of adverse outcome when baseline clinical assessment was taken into account (p=0.368). Secondary analysis excluding patients in whom post-exertion measurement appeared inappropriate resulted in a c-statistic of 0.699 (0.581 to 0.817), likelihood ratios of 1.98 (1.26 to 3.10) and 0.61 (0.35 to 1.07), and some evidence of additional prognostic value on multivariable analysis (p=0.019). Conclusions Post-exertion oxygen saturation provides modest prognostic information in the assessment of patients attending the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.","Goodacre, Steve; Thomas, Ben; Lee, Ellen; Sutton, Laura; Biggs, Katie; Marincowitz, Carl; Loban, Amanda; Waterhouse, Simon; Simmonds, Richard; Schutter, Jose; Connelly, Sarah; Sheldon, Elena; Hall, Jamie; Young, Emma; Bentley, Andrew; Challen, Kirsty; Fitzsimmons, Chris; Harris, Tim; Lecky, Fiona; Lee, Andrew; Maconochie, Ian; Walter, Darren",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.10.20171033v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.10.20171033,339

How effective this factor is in preventing behavioral and emotional trauma and promoting resilience for Black and Brown families remains to be studied. While the literature has focused on family communication between parent and child, little attention has been paid to familial dynamics inherent within racial socialization processes. This paper seeks to advance the conversation of racial socialization as The Talk toward one that holds more promise toward the goal of resilience in the face of systemic racism. To do so, we offer a reframe of The Dance, drawing upon key aspects from the family- and multisystem-focused literatures (e.g., synergy, homeostasis, feedback, metacommunication) to expand and justify the utility, complexity, and efficacy of racial socialization among Black and Brown families as a resilient response to historical and contemporary systemic racism in American society. We include methodological and applied recommendations to promote resilience, resistance, and ultimately healing in the face of racial adversity and trauma.","Jones, Shawn C.

636938,The benefits and challenges of embedding specialist palliative care teams within homeless hostels to enhance support and learning: Perspectives from palliative care teams and hostel staff,2021-03-29,"INTRODUCTION: Nightmares are often associated with psychiatric disorders, though acute stress can also induce them. This study explores how the COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced the frequency and content of nightmares. METHODS: A sample of N=419 US adults completed online surveys about sleep and COVID-19 experiences. Participants were asked the degree to which they agree with statements including that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they have greater general stress, worse overall sleep, and more middle-of-the-night insomnia. They were also asked if they experienced nightmares during the pandemic on a range of topics, including confinement, claustrophobia, suffocation, oppression, drowning, failure, helplessness, natural disasters, anxiety, evil forces, war, domestic abuse, separation from loved ones, totalitarian regimes, being chased, dangerous animals, sickness, death, COVID-19, and apocalypse. Logistic regression analyses examined each nightmare content as outcome and increased stress, worse sleep, and more middle-of-the-night insomnia as predictors, adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Those who reported greater general COVID-related stress were more likely to have nightmares about confinement (OR=1.66,p<0.03), failure (OR=1.64,p<0.005), helplessness (OR=2.89, 0<0.0005), anxiety (OR=2.37,p<0.0005), war (OR=3.42,p<0.0005), separation (OR=2.23,p<0.0005), totalitarianism (OR=3.78,p<0.003), sickness (OR=1.92,p<0.003), death (OR=1.66,p<0.01), COVID (OR=1.96,p<0.01), and apocalypse (OR=2.92,p<0.0005). Those who reported worsened sleep were more likely to have nightmares about confinement (OR=1.80,p<0.003), oppression (OR=2.99,p<0.0005), failure (OR=2.12,p<0.0005), helplessness (OR=1.67, 0<0.0005), disaster (OR=1.86,p<0.005), anxiety (OR=1.97,p<0.0005), evil forces (OR=1.56,p<0.02), war (OR=2.08,p<0.002), domestic abuse (OR=2.22,p<0.009), separation (OR=2.01,p<0.0005), totalitarianism (OR=3.39,p<0.0005), sickness (OR=1.74,p=0.003), death (OR=2.03,p<0.0005), COVID (OR=2.15,p<0.001), and apocalypse (OR=1.86,p<0.006). Those who reported worsened middle-of-the-night insomnia were more likely to have nightmares about confinement (OR=1.60,p<0.01), oppression (OR=1.97,p<0.002), failure (OR=2.00,p<0.0005), helplessness (OR=1.60,p<0.001), disaster (OR=1.52,p<0.04), anxiety (OR=2.27,p<0.0005), war (OR=2.10,p<0.001), domestic abuse (OR=1.74,p<0.04), separation (OR=1.86,p<0.0005), totalitarianism (OR=1.87,p<0.03), sickness (OR=1.80,p<0.001), death (OR=2.00,p<0.0005), COVID (OR=1.68,p<0.009), and apocalypse (OR=1.65,p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that increased stress may induce negatively-toned dreams related to that stress.

638161,61 Academic Impact on Emergency Medicine Training Programs During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-08-31,"INTRODUCTION: Oral corticosteroids are the cornerstone of acute asthma management in the emergency department. Recent evidence has raised doubts about the efficacy of this treatment in preschool-aged children with viral-induced wheezing and in smoking adults. The aims of the study were to: (1) document the magnitude of response to oral corticosteroids in children presenting to the emergency department with moderate or severe asthma; (2) quantify potential determinants of response to corticosteroids and (3) explore the role of gene polymorphisms associated with the responsiveness to corticosteroids. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The design is a prospective cohort study of 1008 children aged 1–17 years meeting a strict definition of asthma and presenting with a clinical score of ≥4 on the validated Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure. All children will receive standardised severity-specific treatment with prednisone/prednisolone and cointerventions (salbutamol with/without ipratropium bromide). Determinants, namely viral aetiology, environmental tobacco smoke and single nucleotide polymorphism, will be objectively documented. The primary efficacy endpoint is the failure of emergency department (ED) management within 72 h of the ED visit. Secondary endpoints include other measures of asthma severity and time to recovery within 7 days of the index visit. The study has 80% power for detecting a risk difference of 7.5% associated with each determinant from a baseline risk of 21%, at an α of 0.05. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from all participating institutions. An impaired response to systemic steroids in certain subgroups will challenge the current standard of practice and call for the immediate search for better approaches. A potential host–environment interaction will broaden our understanding of corticosteroid responsiveness in children. Documentation of similar effectiveness of corticosteroids across determinants will provide the needed reassurance regarding current treatment recommendations. RESULTS: Results will be disseminated at international conferences and manuscripts targeted at emergency physicians, paediatricians, geneticists and respirologists.

The control group was fed with basal diet, and the treatment group was fed with basal diet containing Bacillus cereus PAS38 1×10(6) CFU/g. Thymus and bursa of fabricius were taken from two groups of broilers at the age of 42 days, total RNA was extracted, differential gene library was constructed by SSH technology, and immune-related differential genes were screened. Then, we used siRNA to interfere with the expression of some differential genes in the original generation lymphocytes of broiler blood to detect the change of cytokines mRNA expression level. A total of 42 immune-related differentially expressed genes were screened, including 22 up-regulated genes and 20 down-regulated genes. When 7 differentially up-regulated genes associated with enhanced immune function were interfered with in lymphocytes, some immune-promoting cytokines were down-regulated. These results showed that Bacillus cereus PAS38 might up-regulate the expression of JCHAIN, PRDX1, CD3E, CDK6 and other genes in immune organs of broilers, thereby affecting the development of immune organs, the expression of various cytokines and the transduction of immune signals, improving the immune capacity of broilers.","Li, Jiajun; Li, Wanqiang; Wang, Zhenhua; Khalique, Abdul; Wang, Junrui; Yang, Miao; Ni, Xueqin; Zeng, Dong; Zhang, Dongmei; Zeng, Yan; Luo, Qihui; Jing, Bo; Pan, Kangcheng",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609751/,339
639776,"An Invited Commentary on “Acute Care Surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: Changes in volume, causes and complications. A multicentre retrospective cohort study”",2020-09-11,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine the evidence that the dietary quality of children changed between the period preceding the COVID-19 pandemic and the first year during the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: A systematic review of the evidence for dietary changes occurring as a result of the pandemic-related restrictions, in Part I of this article, yielded 38 original research articles. These articles had conflicting results, some describing improvements in overall quality and some describing deteriorations. As a whole the studies were characterized by a low study quality, and children were poorly represented. Taken together, these studies do not provide enough evidence to draw conclusions about whether dietary habits changed or not as a result of the pandemic. However, in a wider, narrative review of the psychosocial changes occurring as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the known associations of these factors with a dietary intake in Part II, we conclude that there is a reason to expect that the dietary quality of children might have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. SUMMARY: One the one hand, the literature fails to provide conclusive evidence on changes in the dietary quality of children resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, the broader literature supports the hypothesis that children’s dietary quality will have declined during the pandemic. Taken together, we urgently need more high-quality research on children’s changes in dietary intake occurring over the pandemic. This will provide important information on whether any potential long-term consequences of such changes, if they exist, need to be examined and ameliorated.","Campbell, Heather; Wood, Alexis C.",Curr Nutr Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13668-021-00359-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993426/,339
640506,An Update on Instagram Utilization by Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Residency Programs: The Social Media Big Bang,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is characterised by respiratory symptoms, which deteriorate into respiratory failure in a substantial proportion of cases, requiring intensive care in up to a third of patients admitted to hospital. Analysis of the pathological features in the lung tissues of patients who have died with COVID-19 could help us to understand the disease pathogenesis and clinical outcomes. METHODS: We systematically analysed lung tissue samples from 38 patients who died from COVID-19 in two hospitals in northern Italy between Feb 29 and March 24, 2020. The most representative areas identified at macroscopic examination were selected, and tissue blocks (median seven, range five to nine) were taken from each lung and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for at least 48 h. Tissues were assessed with use of haematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining for inflammatory infiltrate and cellular components (including staining with antibodies against CD68, CD3, CD45, CD61, TTF1, p40, and Ki-67), and electron microscopy to identify virion localisation. FINDINGS: All cases showed features of the exudative and proliferative phases of diffuse alveolar damage, which included capillary congestion (in all cases), necrosis of pneumocytes (in all cases), hyaline membranes (in 33 cases), interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema (in 37 cases), type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia (in all cases), squamous metaplasia with atypia (in 21 cases), and platelet–fibrin thrombi (in 33 cases). The inflammatory infiltrate, observed in all cases, was largely composed of macrophages in the alveolar lumina (in 24 cases) and lymphocytes in the interstitium (in 31 cases). Electron microscopy revealed that viral particles were predominantly located in the pneumocytes. INTERPRETATION: The predominant pattern of lung lesions in patients with COVID-19 patients is diffuse alveolar damage, as described in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses. Hyaline membrane formation and pneumocyte atypical hyperplasia are frequent. Importantly, the presence of platelet–fibrin thrombi in small arterial vessels is consistent with coagulopathy, which appears to be common in patients with COVID-19 and should be one of the main targets of therapy.

The first constraint is that, although QDs (=nodes) are randomly distributed in a metric space, they have to fulfill the condition that there is a minimum inter-dot distance that cannot be violated (to minimize electron localization). The second constraint arises from our process of weighted link formation, which is consistent with the laws of quantum physics and statistics: it not only takes into account the overlap integrals but also Boltzmann factors to include the fact that an electron can hop from one QD to another with a different energy level. Boltzmann factors and coherence naturally arise from the Lindblad master equation. The weighted adjacency matrix leads to a Laplacian matrix and a time evolution operator that allows the computation of the electron probability distribution and quantum transport efficiency. The results suggest that there is an optimal inter-dot distance that helps reduce electron localization in QD clusters and make the wave function better extended. As a potential application, we provide recommendations for improving QD intermediate-band solar cells.","Cuadra, Lucas; Nieto-Borge, José Carlos",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11082056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34443887/,339

642640,Retinal nerve fibre layer and ganglion cell layer changes in children who recovered from COVID-19: a cohort study,2021-07-31,"Asthma is the most frequent chronic condition in childhood and a current concern exists about asthma in the pediatric population and its risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although all ages can be affected, SARS-CoV-2 infection has lower clinical impact on children and adolescents than on adults. Fever, cough and shortness of breath are the most common symptoms and signs in children; wheezing has not been frequently reported. Published studies suggest that children with asthma do not appear to be disproportionately more affected by COVID-19. This hypothesis raises two issues: is asthma (and/or atopy) an independent protective factor for COVID-19? If yes, why? Explanations for this could include the lower IFN-α production, protective role of eosinophils in the airway, and antiviral and immunomodulatory proprieties of inhaled steroids. Additionally, recent evidence supports that allergic sensitization is inversely related to ACE2 expression. Obesity is a known risk factor for COVID-19 in adults. However, in the childhood asthma–obesity phenotype, the classic atopic Th2 pattern seems to predominate, which could hypothetically be a protective factor for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with both conditions.

Although this is still a controversial topic, the identification and management of asymptomatic children is an important approach during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

It is important to explore to what extent and how hematopoietic stem cells contribute to the impairment of peripheral lymphoid and myeloid compartments in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to assess bone marrow mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients with peripheral blood mononuclear cells as control. The results showed that the hematopoietic stem cells in these patients were mainly in the G1 phase and prone to apoptosis, with immune activation and anti-viral responses. Importantly, a significant accumulation of immature myeloid progenitors and a dramatic reduction of lymphoid progenitors in severe cases were identified, along with the up-regulation of transcription factors (such as SPI1, LMO4, ETS2, FLI1, and GATA2) that are important for the hematopoietic stem cell or multipotent progenitor to differentiate into downstream progenitors. Our results indicate a dysregulated hematopoiesis in patients with severe COVID-19.","Wang, Xin; Wen, Yanling; Xie, Xiaowei; Liu, Yang; Tan, Xiaohua; Cai, Qingxian; Zhang, Yawen; Cheng, Lin; Xu, Gang; Zhang, Shengyuan; Wang, Haiyan; Wei, Lanlan; Tang, Xian; Qi, Furong; Zhao, Juanjuan; Yuan, Jing; Liu, Lei; Zhu, Ping; Ginhoux, Florent; Zhang, Shuye; Cheng, Tao; Zhang, Zheng",Cell Discov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349096/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-021-00296-9,339

METHOD: An electronic search was conducted using PubMed and incorporated forward and backward research methods on clinical trials, case reports, case series, guidelines and reports from the centre for disease control and prevention (CDC), and the keywords included COVID‐19, paediatrics, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS‐C), complications, acute kidney injury and heart failure. Secondary resources included one study from preprint servers (www.preprints.org), last search 8 May 2021, with notion of nonpeer review status. Data were collected and analysed to stay current with the most recent alerts and guidelines for the best care for children during the COVID‐19 pandemic. RESULTS: Evaluation and analysis of literature revealed MIS‐C to be the most prevalent followed by neurological complications. Whereas the least prevalent were septic shock and ophthalmic complications. CONCLUSION: Even though COVID‐19 is known to be a less severe in the paediatric population, the complications of the virus have caused a great deal of stress to the paediatric patients’ parents and paediatricians worldwide, and hence, emphasis should be given to the management of coronavirus complications in paediatrics.","Seth, Shrey; Rashid, Femida; Khera, Kanav",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34115913/,339

One of the outcomes of the ongoing pandemic is the generation of huge amount of solid polymeric “COVID-waste” comprising medical waste, personal protective equipment (PPE) waste, packaging waste, and other household waste with potential infectious components residing on it. Thermochemical route is the preferred treatment and effective way of disposal of such infectious polymeric waste. Typically, incineration is employed to ensure complete destruction of the pathogens which is not a resource-efficient method. Pyrolysis is a sustainable alternative which can handle the present COVID-waste stream in short-term and long-term yielding valuable fuel and material products. Recently published literature in this avenue have clearly shown the versatility of this technology in efficiently handling both mono and mixed stream of polymers. Based on facts, we propose a resource resurgence framework that utilizes pyrolysis as the core conversion route for effectively handling COVID-waste streams. Our framework suggests how these plants can be operational and helpful in generation of revenue in post-pandemic times as well. We expect that the conscientious adoption of pyrolysis will certainly lead us towards a circular economy paradigm.","Debnath, Biswajit; Ghosh, Shiladitya; Dutta, Neelanjan",Circ.Econ.Sust.,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43615-021-00104-2,339

A multicentre retrospective cohort study”",2020-08-19,"The accumulation of a specific protein in aggregated form is a common phenomenon in human neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease, this protein is α-synuclein which is a neuronal protein of 143 amino acids. With a monomeric conformation in solution, it also has a natural capacity to aggregate into amyloid structures (dimers, oligomers, fibrils and Lewy bodies or neurites). It therefore fulfils the characteristics of a prion protein (different conformations, seeding and spreading). In vitro and in vivo experimental evidence in transgenic and wild animals indicates a prion-like propagation of Parkinson's disease. The sequential and predictive distribution of α-synuclein demonstrated by Braak et al. and its correlation with non-motor signs are consistent with the prion-like progression. Although the triggering factor causing the misfolding and aggregation of the target protein is unknown, Parkinson's disease is a highly relevant model for the study of these mechanisms and also to test specific treatments targeting the assemblies of α-synuclein and propagation from pre-motor phase of the disease. Despite this prion-like progression, there is currently no argument indicating a risk of human transmission of Parkinson's disease.","Brandel, J.-P.; Corbillé, A.-G.; Derkinderen, P.; Haïk, S.",Rev Neurol (Paris),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0035378715008760; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0035378715008760,339
645891,European Society For Emergency Medicine position paper on emergency medical systems’ response to COVID-19,2020-05-04,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global pandemic. However, as effective treatments for this disease are still unclear, safe and efficient therapies are urgently needed. Qingfei Paidu decoction (QPD) is strongly recommended in the Chinese Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Provisional 6th Edition). However, clinical research data on the effects of QPD on COVID-19 are scarce. Our study aimed to explore the effects of combined treatment with QPD and Western medicine on COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, 63 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed. During the first 14 days of hospitalization, patients with deteriorating symptoms were administered QPD along with Western medicine therapy (the antiviral medicine selected from interferon, lopinavir, or arbidol). The clinical characteristics and blood laboratory indices (blood routine, inflammatory factors, and multi-organ biochemical indices) were examined, and the total lung severity scores were evaluated in each patient by reviewing chest computed tomography before treatment and at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Before QPD treatment, the combined treatment group showed higher blood C-reactive protein levels and more severe pulmonary inflammation and clinical symptoms than the Western medicine treatment group. Both groups met the discharge criteria after a similar length of hospitalization. At the end of treatment, circulating white blood cells, total lymphocyte count, and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase levels improved dramatically in both groups (P < 0.05). In contrast, C-reactive protein, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-myocardial band, lactate dehydrogenase, and blood urea nitrogen levels were improved only in the combined treatment group (P < 0.05), and C-reactive protein and creatine kinase were the most pronounced (P < 0.01). Compared with baseline, at the end of treatment, the proportion of patients with normal values of C-reactive protein, total lymphocyte count, and lactate dehydrogenase were increased in the combined treatment group (P < 0.05), whereas no significant difference was observed in the Western medicine treatment group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of QPD with Western medicine demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects compared with those of only Western medicine in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19; however, neither mortality nor length of hospitalization was affected. Moreover, the combined treatment tended to mitigate the extent of multi-organ impairment. Long-term randomized controlled trials with follow-up evaluations are required to confirm the results presented here.","Xin, Siyi; Cheng, Xueqi; Zhu, Bo; Liao, Xiaolong; Yang, Feng; Song, Lina; Shi, Yan; Guan, Xuefeng; Su, Renyi; Wang, Jian; Xing, Limin; Xu, Xiping; Jin, Lin; Liu, Yanping; Zhou, Wei; Zhang, Dongwei; Liang, Liang; Yu, You; Yu, Rui",Biomed Pharmacother,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110500; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220306934?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332220306934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32768975/,339

Here, tuneable cell–VNS interfacial interactions are probed and assessed, highlighting the use of 1D‐VNS in immunomodulation, and intracellular delivery into immune cells—both crucial in fundamental and translational biomedical research. With programmable topography and adaptable surface functionalization, 1D‐VNS provide unique biophysical and biochemical cues to orchestrate innate and adaptive immunity, both ex vivo and in vivo. The intimate nanoscale cell–VNS interface leads to membrane penetration and cellular deformation, facilitating efficient intracellular delivery of diverse bioactive cargoes into hard‐to‐transfect immune cells. The unsettled interfacial mechanisms reported to be involved in VNS‐mediated intracellular delivery are discussed. By identifying up‐to‐date progress and fundamental challenges of current 1D‐VNS technology in immune‐cell manipulation, it is hoped that this report gives timely insights for further advances in developing 1D‐VNS as a safe, universal, and highly scalable platform for cell engineering and enrichment in advanced cancer immunotherapy such as chimeric antigen receptor‐T therapy.","Chen, Yaping; Wang, Ji; Li, Xiangling; Hu, Ning; Voelcker, Nicolas H.; Xie, Xi; Elnathan, Roey",Adv Mater,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202001668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32844502/,339
646117,Transvenous Phrenic Nerve Stimulation for Treatment of Central Sleep Apnea: Five-Year Safety and Efficacy Outcomes,2021-04-29,"Of Chargaff's four ""rules"" on DNA base frequencies, the functional interpretation of his second parity rule (PR2) is the most contentious. Thermophile base compositions (GC%) were taken by Galtier and Lobry (1997) as favoring Sueoka's neutral PR2 hypothesis over Forsdyke's selective PR2 hypothesis, namely that mutations improving local within-species recombination efficiency had generated a genome-wide potential for the strands of duplex DNA to separate and initiate recombination through the ""kissing"" of the tips of stem-loops. However, following Chargaff's GC rule, base composition mainly reflects a species-specific, genome-wide, evolutionary pressure. GC% could not have consistently followed the dictates of temperature, since it plays fundamental roles in both sustaining species integrity and, through primarily neutral genome-wide mutation, fostering speciation. Evidence for a local within-species recombination-initiating role of base order was obtained with a novel technology that masked the contribution of base composition to nucleic acid folding energy. Forsdyke's results were consistent with his PR2 hypothesis, appeared to resolve some root problems in biology and provided a theoretical underpinning for alignment-free taxonomic analyses using relative oligonucleotide frequencies (k-mer analysis). Moreover, consistent with Chargaff's cluster rule, discovery of the thermoadaptive role of the ""purine-loading"" of open reading frames made less tenable the Galtier-Lobry anti-selectionist arguments.

We argue that the benefits of quarantine and isolation justify some level of coercion or compulsion by the state, but that the state should be able to provide the strongest justification possible for implementing such measures. While a constrained form of consequentialism might provide a justification for such public health interventions, we argue that a stronger justification is provided by a principle of State Enforced Easy Rescue: a state may permissibly compel individuals to engage in activities that entail a small cost to them but a large benefit to others, because individuals have a moral duty of easy rescue to engage in those activities. The principle of State Enforced Easy Rescue gives rise to an Obligation Enforcement Requirement: the state should create the conditions such that submitting to coercive or compulsive measures becomes a fundamental moral duty of individuals, i.e. a duty of easy rescue. When the state can create such conditions, it has the strongest justification possible for implementing coercive or compulsive measures, because individuals have a moral duty to temporarily relinquish the rights that such measures would infringe. Our argument has significant implications for how public health emergencies in the developing world should be tackled. Where isolation and quarantine measures are necessary, states or the international community have a moral obligation to provide certain benefits to those quarantined or isolated.","Giubilini, Alberto; Douglas, Thomas; Maslen, Hannah; Savulescu, Julian",Dev World Bioeth,https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28922559/,339

Thus, understanding mechanisms of antibody-mediated viral inhibition and neutralization escape is critical. Here, a robust yeast display system for fine epitope mapping of viral surface hemagglutinin (HA)-specific antibodies is demonstrated. The full-length H5 subtype HA (HA0) was expressed on the yeast surface in a correctly folded conformation, determined by binding of a panel of extensively characterized neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). These mAbs target conformationally-dependent epitopes of influenza A HA, which are highly conserved across H5 clades and group 1 serotypes. By separately displaying HA1 and HA2 subunits on yeast, domain mapping of two anti-H5 mAbs, NR2728 and H5-2A, localized their epitopes to HA1. These anti-H5 mAb epitopes were further fine mapped by using a library of yeast-displayed HA1 mutants and selecting for loss of binding without prior knowledge of potential contact residues. By overlaying key mutant residues that impacted binding onto a crystal structure of HA, the NR2728 mAb was found to interact with a fully surface-exposed contiguous patch of residues at the receptor binding site (RBS), giving insight into the mechanism underlying its potent inhibition of virus binding. The non-neutralizing H5-2A mAb was similarly mapped to a highly conserved H5 strain-specific but poorly accessible location on a loop at the trimer HA interface. These data further augment our toolchest for studying HA antigenicity, epitope diversity and accessibility in response to natural and experimental influenza infection and vaccines.","Han, Thomas; Sui, Jianhua; Bennett, Andrew S.; Liddington, Robert C.; Donis, Ruben O.; Zhu, Quan; Marasco, Wayne A.",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3119598?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21569761/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.139; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X11007467; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X11007467,339

Complex head and neck reconstructive surgery in this setting may carry substantial risk to patients and staff. This paper outlines the management strategy and outcomes of major head and neck oncological cases at a single regional tertiary referral centre. METHODS: : A database review was undertaken of consecutive patients undergoing major head and neck surgery and reconstruction during the COVID-19 pandemic at St Andrew's Centre for Plastic Surgery & Burns, Chelmsford UK. Patient demographics, tumour and reconstruction characteristics as well as peri-operative information were determined. Patients were prospectively contacted regarding COVID-related symptoms and investigations.

Patients underwent pre-operative throat swabs at 72h and 24h as well as chest CT scanning, as part of a robust protocol. Twelve free flaps, four loco-regional flaps, four parotidectomies and 23 cervical lymphadenectomies were performed. Two patients required a return to theatre. No post-operative deaths occurred and flap survival rate was 100%. A single patient tested positive for COVID-19 pre-operatively and no post-operative COVID-19 infections occurred.

COVID-19 imposes severe and tragic consequences on people’s health due to the high rate of spread and potentially fatal impacts. In this study, the association of socio-economic factors with food security and dietary diversity is assessed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from 299 respondents were collected by an online standard questionnaire. Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) were calculated. A multinomial regression model was applied to determine factors associated with HDDS and HFIAS before and during COVID-19 outbreak. Food security of Iranian households improved during the initial COVID-19 pandemic period (P<0.001). Households reduced consumption of some food groups during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Key socio-economic factors associated with food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic included personal savings, household income, employment status of head of household, and nutrition knowledge of head of household. During the COVID-19 outbreak, household size, head of household’s occupation, personal savings, and number of male children were significantly associated with dietary diversity. Distributing free food baskets to poor households, extending e-marketing, providing nutrition consultations, and organizing donations to support infected households may increase household dietary diversity and improve food security status during a pandemic such as COVID-19.

We consider pre-existing disease burden and baseline susceptibility, limited disease prevention resources, and unequal access to basic and specialized health care, essential drugs, and clinical trials. Recognizing that ongoing and underlying disparity issues will require long-term correction efforts, this pathway approach is nonetheless helpful to inform ethical responses to this global pandemic. It can facilitate international cooperation during the pandemic to reduce the disparate burdens among different regions without imposing significant burden on any particular contributor. The pathway approach allows international stakeholders in various social positions to respond to different components of the pathway based on their respective strengths and resources to help break the cycle of global health inequity.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Health literacy and other data for phase 1 will be collected using the Health Literacy Questionnaire, eHealth Literacy Questionnaire, IBD-related questions and qualitative interviews with people with IBD and their carers to ascertain their lived experience. Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive statistics and cluster analysis. Identified clusters will be combined with qualitative data to develop vignettes (narratives of people’s experiences of living with IBD) for stakeholder workshops to generate ideas for useful, accessible and sustainable solutions for identified health literacy needs. Selection and testing of health literacy actions happens in phase 2 and implementation and evaluation in phase 3 (2021–2023). Outcomes of this project include giving voice to people living with IBD, their carers and frontline healthcare practitioners. Genuine codesign informs the development and implementation of what is needed and wanted to improve access to and availability and quality of information and resources that support people to manage their health. There is potential for other NGOs to use the CCA Ophelia model in other health contexts to improve engagement with and understanding of the needs of the people they serve and to reduce health inequalities and improve health outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval for Ophelia phase 1 has been obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of Swinburne University of Technology (Ref: 20202968–4652) and by the South West Sydney Local Health District Research and Ethics Office for the purposes of questionnaire recruitment at Liverpool Hospital (Ref: 20202968–4652). Dissemination of the study findings will be the national codesign process and ownership development across the CCA community and through the genuine engagement of clinicians and relevant managers across Australia. The model and process will be directly distributed to international IBD associations and to other NGOs. It will also be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal, conference presentations and public reports on the CCA and Swinburne University of Technology website.","Hawkins, Melanie; Massuger, Wayne; Cheng, Christina; Batterham, Roy; Moore, Gregory T; Knowles, Simon; Nadarajah, Ranjit G; Raven, Leanne; Osborne, Richard H",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34446478/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045059,339

659503,74 Trends Of Diabetic Ketoacidosis During COVID-19 Pandemic In Large Urban Public Emergency Department,2021-08-31,"BACKGROUND Physical function worsens with older age, particularly for sedentary and socially isolated individuals, and this often leads to injuries. Through reductions in physical activity, the COVID-19 pandemic may have worsened physical function and led to higher fall-related risks. METHODS A nationally representative online survey of 2,006 US adults ages 50-80 was conducted in January 2021 to assess changes in health behaviors (worsened physical activity and less daily time spent on feet), social isolation (lack of companionship and perceived isolation), physical function (mobility and physical conditioning), and falls (falls and fear of falling) since March 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess relationships between physical activity, social isolation, physical function, falls, and fear of falling. RESULTS Among respondents, 740 (36.9%) reported reduced physical activity levels, 704 (35.1%) reported reduced daily time spent on their feet since March 2020, 712 (37.1%) reported lack of companionship, and 914 (45.9%) social isolation. In multivariable models, decreased physical activity (adjusted risk ratio, ARR: 2.92, 95% CI: 2.38, 3.61), less time spent on one's feet (ARR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.62, 2.34), and social isolation (ARR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.74) were associated with greater risks of worsened physical conditioning. Decreased physical activity, time spent daily on one's feet, and social isolation were similarly associated with worsened mobility. Worsened mobility was associated with both greater risk of falling (ARR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.35, 2.15) and worsened fear of falling (ARR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.30, 3.13). Worsened physical conditioning and social isolation were also associated with greater risk of worsened fear of falling. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with worsened physical functioning and fall outcomes, with the greatest effect on individuals with reduced physical activity and social isolation. Public health actions to address reduced physical activity and social isolation among older adults are needed.","Hoffman, Geoffrey J; Malani, Preeti N; Solway, Erica; Kirch, Matthias; Singer, Dianne C; Kullgren, Jeffrey T",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34536288/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17477,339
660279,93 Emergency Department Visits for Cerebral Venous Thrombosis After the Arrival of COVID-19,2021-08-31,"OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in the Republic of Korea started from the index case who developed fever after returning from the Middle East. He infected 26 cases in Hospital C, and consecutive nosocomial transmission proceeded throughout the nation. We provide an epidemiologic description of the outbreak, as of July 2015. METHODS: Epidemiological research was performed by direct interview of the confirmed patients and reviewing medical records. We also analyzed the incubation period, serial interval, the characteristics of superspreaders, and factors associated with mortality. Full genome sequence was obtained from sputum specimens of the index patient. RESULTS: A total of 186 confirmed patients with MERS-CoV infection across 16 hospitals were identified in the Republic of Korea. Some 44.1% of the cases were patients exposed in hospitals, 32.8% were caregivers, and 13.4% were healthcare personnel. The most common presenting symptom was fever and chills. The estimated incubation period was 6.83 days and the serial interval was 12.5 days. A total of 83.2% of the transmission events were epidemiologically linked to five superspreaders, all of whom had pneumonia at presentation and contacted hundreds of people. Older age [odds ratio (OR) = 4.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.90–12.45] and underlying respiratory disease (OR = 4.90, 95% CI 1.64–14.65) were significantly associated with mortality. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the MERS-CoV of the index case clustered closest with a recent virus from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSION: A single imported MERS-CoV infection case imposed a huge threat to public health and safety. This highlights the importance of robust preparedness and optimal infection prevention control. The lessons learned from the current outbreak will contribute to more up-to-date guidelines and global health security.",,Osong Public Health Res Perspect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221090991530045X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221090991530045X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473095/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrp.2015.08.006,339
660446,Implementing a pandemic roster in a specialty emergency department: Challenges and benefits,2021-02-15,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, increasing emphasis has been placed on the importance of collaboration within multi-disciplinary healthcare teams, so as to facilitate holistic patient care and thus allow improved treatment outcomes. There is hence an urgent need to educate healthcare undergraduates early in their professional careers on the importance of and complexities involved in cooperating with counterparts from other allied healthcare professions. In conjunction with this, a milestone student-led conference for undergraduate students, the 9th Student Medical-Nursing Education Conference (SMEC), was organised in 2013 to provide a unique opportunity for shared learning among the entire cohort of undergraduate medical and nursing students in Singapore matriculating in that year. METHODS: This study evaluated the effectiveness of the 9th SMEC 2013 as a shared conference experience in improving the attitudes of undergraduate medical and nursing students in Singapore towards inter-professional education (IPE). A 19-point Readiness for Inter-Professional Learning Scale (RIPLS) questionnaire comprising three subscales was administered to participants both before and after the conference. 352 responses were collected, giving a response rate of 75.1 %. Results were analysed using paired-samples t-tests with statistical significance set at p = 0.05. RESULTS: Improvements in overall scores for both medical and nursing students were reported for all three RIPLS subscales. Examining the RIPLS items individually, significant improvement in scores for both medical and nursing students was obtained in all 19 items. Prior exposure to IPE activities was not a predictor of improvement in IPE attitudes. CONCLUSION: The authors propose that student-led jointly-organised conference experiences are effective in improving healthcare students’ attitudes towards IPE. This study provides valuable insights to facilitate the development of further IPE programs to allow for the rapid and effective promotion of cooperation and collaboration between students across various healthcare disciplines.","Chua, Amelia ZE; Lo, Daryl YK; Ho, Wilbert HH; Koh, Yun Qing; Lim, Daniel SY; Tam, John KC; Liaw, Sok Ying; Koh, Gerald CH",BMC Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26698562/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-015-0509-9,339
660828,What could we learn from SARS when facing the mental health issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak? A nationwide cohort study in Taiwan,2020-10-06,"INTRODUCTION: The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, may need intensive care unit (ICU) admission in up to 12% of all positive cases for massive interstitial pneumonia, with possible long-term endotracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation and subsequent tracheostomy. The most common airway-related complications of such ICU maneuvers are laryngotracheal granulomas, webs, stenosis, malacia and, less commonly, tracheal necrosis with tracheo-esophageal or tracheo-arterial fistulae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This paper gathers the opinions of experts of the Laryngotracheal Stenosis Committee of the European Laryngological Society, with the aim of alerting the medical community about the possible rise in number of COVID-19-related laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS), and the aspiration of paving the way to a more rationale concentration of these cases within referral specialist airway centers. RESULTS: A range of prevention strategies, diagnostic work-up, and therapeutic approaches are reported and framed within the COVID-19 pandemic context. CONCLUSIONS: One of the most important roles of otolaryngologists when encountering airway-related signs and symptoms in patients with previous ICU hospitalization for COVID-19 is to maintain a high level of suspicion for LTS development, and share it with colleagues and other health care professionals. Such a condition requires specific expertise and should be comprehensively managed in tertiary referral centers.","Piazza, Cesare; Filauro, Marta; Dikkers, Frederik G.; Nouraei, S. A.

661846,PROGNOSTIC VALUE OF LUNG ULTRASOUND IN OLDER NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AFFECTED BY COVID-19,2020-07-29,"The scope of health information and health care services available online is rapidly expanding. At the same time, COVID-19 is causing vulnerable elders to reconsider in-person provider visits. In that context, recently published research by Y. Mizrachi et al. examining obstacles to the use of online health services (OHS) among adults age 50 and up takes on new importance. An iconic Israeli song begins, “Will you hear my voice?” (Hebrew Songs. Zemer Nugeh (Hatishmah Koli), 2020). What makes Mizrachi et al.’s findings particularly intriguing, despite several caveats, is the manner in which they demonstrated a commitment to genuinely listen to individual voices. The researchers spoke “openly and bluntly” with interviewees as peers and were rewarded with “specific, well-defined and applicable answers with the potential to be used.” The most striking findings came in candid answers that went beyond the factors intrinsic to the online offerings and addressed important factors in what regular Internet users often refer to as IRL (“in real life”), such as support from family. The necessity of avoiding preconceptions about the most effective manner to engage patients underscores the importance of patient and family advisory councils (PFACs). PFACs, increasingly being adopted by health care organizations globally, provide an ongoing ability to listen and respond to the “patient voice.” Effectively addressing obstacles to older adults’ use of the full range of online health resources will require the involvement not just of health plans and government, but also of voluntary organizations, providers, families and others integral to users’ offline “real lives.” Sustained, focused listening must be a central part of that effort.","Millenson, Michael L.",Isr J Health Policy Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33023660/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13584-020-00408-y,339

The current case series examines the immediate short‐term outcomes of 7 heart transplant recipients transplanted during the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. We hope to illustrate that with proper preparation, planning, and testing, heart transplantation can be continued during a pandemic. We assessed 7 patients transplanted from March 4, 2020 to April 15, 2020. The following endpoints were noted: in‐hospital survival, in‐hospital freedom from rejection, in‐hospital non‐fatal major cardiac adverse events (NF‐MACE), severe primary graft dysfunction, hospital length of stay, and ICU length of stay. There were no expirations throughout the hospital admission. In addition, there were no patients with NF‐MACE or treated rejection, and 1 patient developed severe primary graft dysfunction. Average length of stay was 17.2 days with a standard deviation of 5.9 days. ICU length of stay was 7.7 days with a standard deviation of 2.3 days. Despite the decreasing trend in completed heart transplants due to SARS‐CoV‐2, heart transplantation appears to be feasible in the immediate short term. Further follow up is needed, however, to assess the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on post‐heart transplant outcomes months after transplantation.","Esmailian, Gabriel; Kobashigawa, Jon A; Nishihara, Keith; Patel, Jignesh K; Czer, Lawrence; Megna, Dominick; Emerson, Dominic; Ramzy, Danny; Trento, Alfredo; Chikwe, Joanna; Esmailian, Fardad",Clin Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633819/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.14029,339

OBJECTIVES: We elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which the cyclophilin inhibitors Cyclosporin A (CsA) and Alisporivir (ALV) restrict MERS-CoV to validate their suitability as readily-available therapy in MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: Calu-3 cells and primary human alveolar epithelial cells (hAEC) were infected with MERS-CoV and treated with CsA or ALV or inhibitors targeting cyclophilin inhibitor-regulated molecules including Calcineurin, NFAT, or MAP kinases. Novel CsA-induced pathways were identified by RNA sequencing and manipulated by gene knockdown or neutralising antibodies. Viral replication was quantified by qRT-PCR and TCID(50). Data were validated in a murine MERS-CoV infection model. RESULTS: CsA and ALV both reduced MERS-CoV titers and viral RNA replication in Calu-3 and hAEC improving epithelial integrity. While neither Calcineurin nor NFAT inhibition reduced MERS-CoV propagation, blockade of c-Jun N-terminal kinase diminished infectious viral particle release but not RNA accumulation. Importantly, CsA induced interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), a pronounced type-III-interferon (IFNλ) response and expression of antiviral genes. Down-regulation of IRF1 or IFNλ increased MERS-CoV propagation in presence of CsA. Importantly, oral application of CsA reduced MERS-CoV replication in vivo, correlating with elevated lung IFNλ levels and improved outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that cyclophilin inhibitors efficiently decrease MERS-CoV replication in vitro and in vivo via upregulation of inflammatory, antiviral cell responses, in particular IFNλ. CsA might therefore represent a promising candidate to treat MERS-CoV infection.","Sauerhering, Lucie; Kupke, Alexandra; Meier, Lars; Dietzel, Erik; Hoppe, Judith; Gruber, Achim D.; Gattenloehner, Stefan; Witte, Biruta; Fink, Ludger; Hofmann, Nina; Zimmermann, Tobias; Goesmann, Alexander; Nist, Andrea; Stiewe, Thorsten; Becker, Stephan; Herold, Susanne; Peteranderl, Christin",Eur Respir J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32616594/; https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01826-2019,339

We describe a meta-transcriptomic study of 411 samples collected from 23 bat species in a small (~1100 hectare) region in Yunnan province, China, from May 2019 to November 2020. We identified coronavirus contigs in 40 of 100 sequencing libraries, including seven representing SARS-CoV-2-like contigs. From these data we obtained 24 full-length coronavirus genomes, including four novel SARS-CoV-2 related and three SARS-CoV related genomes. Of these viruses, RpYN06 exhibited 94.5% sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome and was the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 in the ORF1ab, ORF7a, ORF8, N, and ORF10 genes. The other three SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses were nearly identical in sequence and clustered closely with a virus previously identified in pangolins from Guangxi, China, although with a genetically distinct spike gene sequence. We also identified 17 alphacoronavirus genomes, including those closely related to swine acute diarrhea syndrome virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Ecological modeling predicted the co-existence of up to 23 Rhinolophus bat species in Southeast Asia and southern China, with the largest contiguous hotspots extending from South Lao and Vietnam to southern China. Our study highlights both the remarkable diversity of bat viruses at the local scale and that relatives of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV circulate in wildlife species in a broad geographic region of Southeast Asia and southern China. These data will help guide surveillance efforts to determine the origins of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic coronaviruses.","Zhou, Hong; Ji, Jingkai; Chen, Xing; Bi, Yuhai; Li, Juan; Hu, Tao; Song, Hao; Chen, Yanhua; Cui, Mingxue; Zhang, Yanyan; Hughes, Alice C.; Holmes, Edward C.; Shi, Weifeng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.434390,339

METHODS: The 2020 China COVID-19 Survey is an anonymous 74-item survey administered via social media across China. A national sample of 10,545 adults in all 31 provinces in mainland China provided data on sociodemographic characteristics, awareness, attitudes towards COVID-19, lifestyle factors, and health outcomes during the quarantine. Regression models tested associations among study variables adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Among the 9,016 total participants (42.6% men and 57.4% women), 585 reported having diagnosed diabetes and 8,431 had no diabetes. Participants with diabetes perceived themselves to be at higher risk and were more worried about being infected with COVID-19 when compared to non-diabetic individuals (p<.001). During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants with diabetes were more likely to experience food and drug shortages and to increase their physical activity, compared to their counterparts. Among diabetic respondents, a high proportion of current smokers (74.1%) and drinkers (68.5%) reported increased amounts of smoking and drinking. People with diabetes were 11% less likely to report excellent or very good health. Having 150 minutes/week physical activity was positively associated with excellent or very good health (prevalence ratio, PR=1.14, 95%CI 1.11-1.16).

RESULTS: In 2020, throughout weeks 37 to 50, 3333 patients were assessed for eligibility and among them 331 (9.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Among the included patients, 136 (9.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pre-POC period and 195 (10.5%) in the POC period. Among positive patients for SARS-CoV-2 related infection in-hospital mortality rate was similar between the two groups but the hospitalization rate was higher in the POC group (81.6% vs. 65.4%; p < 0.001). More patients in the POC period were able to leave the ED within 6 h. We examined rates of antibiotic, anticoagulant, and corticosteroid prescriptions among patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 in the ED. Only the rate of prescribed anticoagulants was found to be higher in the POC period (40% vs. 24.2%; p < 0.003). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that COVID-19 point-of-care testing speeds up clinical decision-making, improving use of recommended treatments for COVID-19, such as anticoagulants. Moreover, it improves the boarding time and significantly shortened the length of stay in the ED for patients requiring outpatient care.","Gerlier, Camille; Pilmis, Benoît; Ganansia, Olivier; Le Monnier, Alban; Nguyen Van, Jean-Claude",Am J Emerg Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675721007993?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675721007993; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.09.062,339

Recent free mobility labor rights for certain EU citizens have facilitated economic migrants’ ability to work abroad while simultaneously filling labor shortages within the country’s service industry in peripheral zones that are salient economic hubs. Drawing on ethnography and moment analysis, results indicate that for language-marginal occupations such as dishwashers, linguistic entrepreneurship is resisted since relying on shared semiotic repertoires and material objects for communicative purposes is preferred given the physically demanding occupation and stressful moments in a restaurant kitchen.

Type II pneumocytes exclusively secrete ‘pulmonary surfactants’, a lipo-protein complex made up of 90% lipids (mainly phospholipids) and 10% surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D). Respiratory diseases like influenza, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are reported to preferentially attack type II pneumocytes of the lungs. After viral invasion, consequent viral propagation and destruction of type II pneumocytes causes altered surfactant production, resulting in dyspnea and Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. Exogenous animal-derived or synthetic pulmonary surfactant therapy has already shown immense success in the treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and has the potential to contribute efficiently to repairing damaged alveoli and preventing SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure. Furthermore, the early detection of surfactant collectins (SP-A and SP-D) in the circulatory system can be a significant clinical marker for disease prognosis in the near future.","Ghati, Amit; Dam, Paulami; Tasdemir, Didar; Kati, Ahmet; Sellami, Hanen; Sezgin, Gulten Can; Ildiz, Nilay; Franco, Octavio L.; Mandal, Amit Kumar; Ocsoy, Ismail",Curr Opin Colloid Interface Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cocis.2020.101413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33390762/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359029420301205; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359029420301205?v=s5,339

METHODS: The immunochromatography (ICG) rapid test kit and the chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) quantitative antibody test were performed. The differences in IgM and IgG antibody prevalence in different serological assays were descriptively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 637 participants were included in this research. Two staff were IgM positive in the CLIA quantitative antibody test (cutoff value: 10 AU/ml) of 51 staff who were IgM positive in the rapid test kit. Six staff were IgG positive in the CLIA quantitative antibody test of 56 staff who were IgG positive in the rapid test kit. The proportion of antibody positive staff differed greatly between the rapid test kit and the CLIA quantitative antibody test. CONCLUSIONS: There was a vast difference in the proportions of IgG and IgM antibody positive staff in the rapid test kit and the CLIA quantitative antibody test results. The results from the only rapid test kit might have to be interpreted with caution.

668340,Bereavement Care in the Wake of COVID-19: Offering Condolences and Referrals,2020-06-23,"INTRODUCTION: the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was identified following the report of a cluster of cases of viral (atypical) pneumonia in Wuhan City of China. Healthcare workers are at high risk of contracting the infection from COVID-19 patients and also spreading it unknowingly to their families, especially if they do not take adequate precautionary measures. This study assessed the risk perception of COVID-19 and practice of precautionary measures against its spread amongst healthcare workers practicing in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Clinic of a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. METHODS: this was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted amongst healthcare workers in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Clinic of a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. It employed the use of a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire to obtain data from the participants. Data analysis was done using the IBM SPSS statistics version 22.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) statistical software. RESULTS: there were 49 study participants with all of them aware of COVID-19. Only 11(22.4%) respondents reported receiving training on infection prevention and control against COVID-19. Most of them received training from their workplace/hospital (12.2%), while 10.2% were trained via webinars. More of the respondents had moderate risk perception (n=17, 34.7%) while a majority of them had good practice of precautionary measures against COVID-19 (n=28, 57.1%). Conclusion: most of the study participants had moderate risk perception and good practice of precautionary measures.

668593,An international survey of healthcare workers use of personal protective equipment during the early stages of the COVID‐19 pandemic,2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND: Inadequate supply of filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) for healthcare workers during a pandemic such as the novel coronavirus outbreak (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious public health issue. AIM: To synthesize existing data on the effectiveness of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) for N95 FFR decontamination. METHODS: Systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020176156) on UVGI in N95 FFRs using Embase, Medline, Global Health, Google Scholar, WHO feed, and MedRxiv. Two reviewers independently determined eligibility and extracted predefined variables. Original research reporting on function, decontamination, or mask fit following UVGI were included. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Thirteen studies were identified, comprising 54 UVGI intervention arms and 58 N95 models. FFRs consistently maintained certification standards following UVGI. Aerosol penetration averaged 1.19% (0.70-2.48%) and 1.14% (0.57-2.63%) for control and UVGI arms respectively. Airflow resistance for the control arms averaged 9.79 mm H(2)O (7.97-11.70 mm H(2)O) vs 9.85 mm H(2)O (8.33-11.44 mm H(2)O) for UVGI arms. UVGI protocols employing a cumulative dose >20,000 J/m(2) resulted in a 2 log reduction in viral load. A >3 log reduction was observed in seven UVGI arms using >40,000 J/m(2). Impact of UVGI on fit was evaluated in two studies (16,200; 32,400 J/m(2)) and did not find evidence of compromise. Our findings suggest that further work in this area (or translation to a clinical setting) should use a cumulative UV-C dose of 40,000 J/m(2) or greater, and confirm appropriate mask fit following decontamination.","Katie, O’Hearn; Gertsman, Shira; Sampson, Margaret; Webster, Richard; Tsampalieros, Anne; Ng, Rhiannon; Gibson, Jess; Lobos, Anna-Theresa; Acharya, Nina; Agarwal, Anirudh; Boggs, Samantha; Chamberlain, Graham; Staykov, Emiliyan; Sikora, Lindsey; McNally, James Dayre",J Hosp Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32687870/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120303455; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120303455?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.07.014,339
668620,"Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation: Symptomatology, Well-Being, and Attitudes to Life",2020-09-06,"BACKGROUND: Porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) is an immunosuppressive virus that mainly inhibits T-lymphocyte and macrophage immune functions; it has significantly damaged the farming industry. Although recent studies have shown that miRNAs play important roles in immune responses, the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during immunosuppressive virus infection remain unclear. METHODS: In this study, porcine small-RNA transcriptomes of PCMV-infected and uninfected vital organs were first characterised by high-throughput sequencing. miRDeep2 software was used to predict novel pig-encoded miRNAs. To verify the accuracy of the high-throughput sequencing results, stem-loop qRT-PCR was performed on 12 significantly DE miRNAs. The physical and functional interactions between the immune-related target genes of the DE miRNAs in PCMV-infected organs were analysed using the STRING database. RESULTS: In total, 306 annotated and 295 novel miRNAs were identified from PCMV-infected and uninfected porcine organs, respectively, through alignment with known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs. Overall, 92, 107, 95, 77 and 111 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in lung, liver, spleen, kidney and thymus after PCMV infection, respectively. According to Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs associated with immune system processes, regulation of biological processes and metabolic processes were enriched in every sample. Integrated expression analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs and their target mRNAs in PCMV-infected thymus showed that the significant differential expression of specific miRNAs under the pressure of PCMV infection in central immune organs interfered with the expression of genes involved in important immune-related signalling pathways, thus promoting the viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive analysis of the responses of host small-RNA transcriptomes to PCMV infection in vital porcine organs. It provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during infection by immunosuppressive viruses.

Several studies to characterize the new virus expressing G614 variant show that it exhibits increased infectivity compared to the ancestral virus having D614 spike protein. Here, using in-silico mutagenesis and energy calculations, we analyzed inter-residue interaction energies and thermodynamic stability of the dominant (G614) and the ancestral (D614) variants of spike protein trimer in ‘closed’ and ‘partially open’ conformations. We find that the local interactions mediated by aspartate at the 614th position are energetically frustrated and create unfavourable environment. Whereas, glycine at the same position confers energetically favourable environment and strengthens intra-as well as inter-protomer association. Such changes in the local interaction energies enhance the thermodynamic stability of the spike protein trimer as free energy difference (ΔΔG) upon glycine substitution is −2.6 kcal/mol for closed conformation and −2.0 kcal/mol for open conformation. Our results on the structural and energetic basis of enhanced stability hint that G614 may confer increased availability of functional form of spike protein trimer and consequent in higher infectivity than the D614 variant.","Yazhini, Arangasamy; Sidhanta, Das Swayam Prakash; Srinivasan, Narayanaswamy",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.02.364273,339

This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition. Importantly, DUSP1 promotes SeV-induced apoptosis and suppresses cell migration in RSV-infected cells. Collectively, our data unveil a previously unrecognized selective role of DUSP1 in the regulation of tissue damage and repair during infections by RSV and SeV.","Robitaille, Alexa C.; Caron, Elise; Zucchini, Nicolas; Mukawera, Espérance; Adam, Damien; Mariani, Mélissa K.; Gélinas, Anaïs; Fortin, Audray; Brochiero, Emmanuelle; Grandvaux, Nathalie",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/163360,339

Whether the clinical features and pathobiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia differ from those of pneumonia secondary to other pathogens is unclear. This uncertainty has created variability in the application of historically proven therapies for ARDS to patients with COVID-19. We review the available literature and find many similarities between patients with ARDS from pneumonia attributable to SARS-CoV-2 versus other respiratory pathogens. A notable exception is the long duration of illness among patients with COVID-19, which could result from its unique pathobiology.

The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936. FINDINGS: Between May 28, 2020, and Jan 15, 2021, 11558 (71%) of 16287 patients enrolled in RECOVERY were eligible to receive convalescent plasma and were assigned to either the convalescent plasma group or the usual care group. There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the two groups: 1399 (24%) of 5795 patients in the convalescent plasma group and 1408 (24%) of 5763 patients in the usual care group died within 28 days (rate ratio 1·00, 95% CI 0·93–1·07; p=0·95). The 28-day mortality rate ratio was similar in all prespecified subgroups of patients, including in those patients without detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at randomisation. Allocation to convalescent plasma had no significant effect on the proportion of patients discharged from hospital within 28 days (3832 [66%] patients in the convalescent plasma group vs 3822 [66%] patients in the usual care group; rate ratio 0·99, 95% CI 0·94–1·03; p=0·57). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at randomisation, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients meeting the composite endpoint of progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death (1568 [29%] of 5493 patients in the convalescent plasma group vs 1568 [29%] of 5448 patients in the usual care group; rate ratio 0·99, 95% CI 0·93–1·05; p=0·79). INTERPRETATION: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, high-titre convalescent plasma did not improve survival or other prespecified clinical outcomes.

AF was collected by an obstetrician using sterile syringes during a cesarean section. The culture medium was supplemented with 5 different concentrations of FBS or AF including 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30%. These concentrations were used to maintain both mentioned parasites. L. major was maintained at temperatures 4 and 24 °C and examined once a week for 4 weeks, while T. gondii was maintained at temperatures 4, 24, and 37 °C and examined at hours 24, 48, 72, and 96. For L. major, at both 4 and 24 °C, we observed no significant difference between FBS and AF on day 7. However, on days 14, 21, and 28, the difference between FBS and AF was significant at both temperatures. For T. gondii, no significant difference was observed between FBS and AF at hour 24 and all temperatures. However, this difference was significant at hours 48, 72, and 96 and all temperatures. According to our results, although FBS had a greater efficacy than AF in the growth of L. major and the survival of T. gondii, the number of promastigotes increased over time in AF-containing medium and the number of tachyzoites reduced slowly with a mild slop. Therefore, AF can be a potential alternative to FBS.","Rahmani, Zahra; Faridnia, Roghiyeh; Kalani, Hamed; Ghanei, Naryan; Fakhar, Mahdi; Zamanian, Marzieh; Keighobadi, Masoud; Tabaripour, Rabeeh",Parasitol Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07058-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33491113/,339

679399,Emergency department preparation for COVID-19: accelerated care units,2020-05-27,"Abstract Objectives Heightened anxiety among dental healthcare professionals (DHPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic stems from uncertainties about the effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE) against dental aerosols and risk levels of asymptomatic patients. Our objective was to assess the risks for DHPs providing dental care during the pandemic based on available scientific evidence. Methods We reviewed the best available evidence and estimated the annualized risk (p=d a s(1-1-p 0 p 1(1-e)y n ) for a DHP during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the following basic parameters: p 0, the prevalence of asymptomatic patients in the local population; p 1, the probability that a DHP gets infected by an asymptomatic patient; e, the effectiveness of the PPE; s, the probability of becoming symptomatic after getting infected from asymptomatic patient; d a, the probability of dying from the disease in age group a; n, number of patients seen per day; and y, number of days worked per year. Results With the assumption that DHPs work fulltime and wear a N95 mask, the annualized probability for a DHP to acquire COVID-19 infection in a dental office, become symptomatic, and die from the infection is estimated at 1:13,000 (0.008%). Conclusions Risk of COVID-19 transmission in dental office is very low based on available evidence on effectiveness of PPE and prevalence of asymptomatic patients. Face shields and pre-procedure oral rinses may further reduce the risks. Clinical significance DHPs should follow guidelines on pre-appointment protocols and on PPE use during dental treatments to keep the risk low.","Ren, Yanfang; Feng, Changyong; Rasubala, Linda; Malmstrom, Hans; Eliav, Eli",J Dent,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300571220301809?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2020.103434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32693111/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300571220301809,339
679963,Impact of a Serious Game on the Intention to Change Infection Prevention and Control Practices in Nursing Homes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Web-Based Randomized Controlled Trial,2020-12-15,"Single stranded RNA viruses were known to cause variety of diseases since many years and are gaining much importance due to pandemic after the identification of a novel corona virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)). Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to infect humans and they are OC43 CoV, NL63 CoV, HKU1 CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome, SARS CoV, and SARS CoV-2. Virus replication weakens the immune system of host thereby altering T-cell count and much of interferon response. Although no vaccine or therapeutic treatment has been approved till now for CoV infection, trials of vaccine against SARS CoV-2 are in progress. One of the epitopes used for vaccine production is of the spike protein on the surface of virus. The work focuses on designing of multi-epitope vaccine construct for treatment of seven human CoV infections using the epitopes present on the spike protein of human CoVs. To address this, immuno-informatics techniques have been employed to design multi-epitope vaccine construct. B- and T-cell epitopes of the spike proteins have been predicted and designed into a multi-epitope vaccine construct. The tertiary structure of the vaccine construct along with the adjuvant has been modelled and the physiochemical properties have been predicted. The multi-epitope vaccine construct has antigenic and non-allergenic property. After validation, refinement and disulphide engineering of the vaccine construct, molecular docking with toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been performed. Molecular dynamics simulation in aqueous environment predicted that the vaccine-TLRs complexes were stable. The vaccine construct is predicted to be able to trigger primary immune response in silico.

680243,Diabetes and covid-19: a global health challenge,2020-04-27,"BACKGROUND: Perceptual congruence has been defined as the level of agreement between partners on various aspects of their shared lives, including perceived engagement in individual and jointly performed activities. While the level of adjustment made by partners to such activities is thought to contribute to a couple’s sense of mutuality, perceptions of time use concerning activity engagement has yet to be considered. As such, this study will determine the level of perceptual congruence between partners with respect to perceived time use in their respective and shared activities. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the IP-COUPLES study is to determine the similarities and differences between partners in terms of their perceptual congruence with respect to independent and jointly performed activities. This study will also examine the association between independent and joint activities in terms of perceptual congruence of time use and the strength of this association. METHODS: This descriptive observational study includes 100 couples from Western Switzerland who are recruited using snowball sampling methods. The Life Balance Inventory (LBI), a self-report questionnaire that captures activity configuration congruence, will measure independent and joint perceptions of both time use allocated to daily activities and corresponding satisfaction. Due to COVID-19, the protocol can be administered virtually by the primary investigator. The mean scores of perceptual congruence variables will be used for analysis, namely perceived congruence of time use in terms of independent and jointly performed activities. For the first objective, an independent t test will be used for each variable to compare the mean score between activities on the LBI. For the second objective, the correlations between the mean scores for these activities will be calculated for each variable using the Pearson correlation. RESULTS: The IP-COUPLES study protocol was developed in 2019 and 2020. Enrollment began in June 2020. Data collection will continue until October 2021 to account for time needed for recruitment due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Analysis and presentation of results are expected in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study is exploratory, as it is the first to our knowledge to investigate how perceived time-use patterns with respect to independent or jointly performed activities are similar or different among romantic couples. By investigating the interpersonal perception of time-use patterns among couples, the IP-COUPLES study is an important first step to understanding how romantic partners’ daily activities are contributing to the level of satisfaction as a partner and as a couple and to the sense of mutuality between partners in a romantic relationship.

Bariatric surgery, as a technically demanding surgery, imposes a learning curve that may initially induce higher morbidity. In order to limit the clinical impact of this learning curve, a simulation preclinical training can be offered. The aim of the work was to assess the realism of a new cadaveric model for simulated bariatric surgery (sleeve and Roux in Y gastric bypass). AIM: A face validation study of SimLife, a new dynamic cadaveric model of simulated body for acquiring operative skills by simulation. The objectives of this study are first of all to measure the realism of this model, the satisfaction of learners, and finally the ability of this model to facilitate a learning process. METHODS: SimLife technology is based on a fresh body (frozen/thawed) given to science associated to a patented technical module, which can provide pulsatile vascularization with simulated blood heated to 37 °C and ventilation. RESULTS: Twenty-four residents and chief residents from 3 French University Digestive Surgery Departments were enrolled in this study. Based on their evaluation, the overall satisfaction of the cadaveric model was rated as 8.52, realism as 8.91, anatomic correspondence as 8.64, and the model’s ability to be learning tool as 8.78. CONCLUSION: The use of the SimLife model allows proposing a very realistic surgical simulation model to realistically train and objectively evaluate the performance of young surgeons.","Danion, J.; Donatini, G.; Breque, C.; Oriot, D.; Richer, J.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 48 consecutive patients who had undergone HDC/ASCT with TBC (thiotepa, busulfan, cyclophosphamide) conditioning for PCNSL (27 patients), secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL) (8 patients), or relapsed disease with CNS involvement (13 patients) from July 2006 to December 2017. Of the 27 patients with PCNSL, 21 had undergone ASCT at first complete remission (CR1). RESULTS: The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 80.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.9-92.9) and the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate was 80.1% (95% CI, 69.2%-92.7%) among all patients. The 2-year PFS and OS rate for patients with PCNSL in CR1 was 95.2% (95% CI, 86.6%-100%) and 95.2% (95% CI, 86.6%-100%), respectively. On univariate analysis of the patients with PCNSL, ASCT in CR1 was the only variable statistically significant for outcome (P = .007 for PFS; P = .008 for OS). Among patients with SCNSL or CNS relapse, the 2-year PFS and OS rate were comparable at 75.9% (95% CI, 59.5%-96.8%) and 75.3% (95% CI, 58.6%-98.6%), respectively. The most common side effects were febrile neutropenia (89.6%; of which 66.7% had an infectious etiology identified), nausea/vomiting (85.4%), diarrhea (93.8%), mucositis (89.6%), and electrolyte abnormalities (89.6%). Four patients (8.3%) died of treatment-related overwhelming infection; of these patients, 3 had SCNSL. CONCLUSION: HDC and ASCT using TBC conditioning for both PCNSL and secondary CNS NHL appears to have encouraging long-term efficacy with manageable side effects.","Young, Patricia A.; Gaut, Daria; Kimaiyo, Davis K.; Grotts, Jonathan; Romero, Tahmineh; Chute, John; Schiller, Gary; de Vos, Sven; Eradat, Herbert A.; Timmerman, John",Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32229199/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2152265020300896; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2152265020300896; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clml.2020.02.009,339

However, the vast majority of those works do not share their code or data for replicating their studies. With minimal exceptions, the few that do, place the burden on the researcher to figure out how to fetch the data, how to best format their data, and how to create automatic and manual annotations on the acquired data. In order to address this pressing issue, we introduce the Social Media Mining Toolkit (SMMT), a suite of tools aimed to encapsulate the cumbersome details of acquiring, preprocessing, annotating and standardizing social media data. The purpose of our toolkit is for researchers to focus on answering research questions, and not the technical aspects of using social media data.

We capitalised on extensive high resolution HLA data deposited in the National Marrow Donor Program registry to obtain detailed information on human HLA haplotype frequencies of twenty five human populations and used a bioinformatics approach to investigate the role of HLA polymorphism on SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity at the population and at the individual level. Within populations, we identify wide inter-individual variability in predicted CD4+ T-cell reactivity against structural, non-structural and accessory SARS-CoV-2 proteins, according to expressed HLA genotype. However, we find similar potential for anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity at the population level, across all ethnic groups examined, suggesting that HLA polymorphism is unlikely to account for observed disparities in clinical outcomes after COVID-19 among different race and ethnic groups. We predict robust immune reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, the basis for the majority of current vaccination efforts, both at the population and individual level, despite significant variation in Spike-derived peptide presentation by individual HLA genotypes. Finally, we provide comprehensive maps of SARS-CoV-2 proteome immunogenicity accounting for population coverage in major ethnic groups. Our findings provide important insight on the potential role of HLA polymorphism on development of protective immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and after vaccination and a firm basis for further experimental studies in this field.","Copley, Hannah C; Gragert, Loren; Leach, Andrew R; Kosmoliaptsis, Vasilis",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.24.424326,339

However, application of gig economy in health care is underresearched, especially in areas of eHealth that can facilitate various online activities and be outsourced. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the gig economy and eHealth in terms of prospects for future health care in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Analysis of data collected using online semistructured interviews with 19 experts, including executives from ministries of health and information and communications, physicians, and health-care administrative managers was conducted and new empirical insights are offered. RESULTS: A lack of legal and regulatory frameworks and integrating gig culture into the eHealth system were identified to be the major challenges. Improved operational efficiency of health care, reduced costs, and positive societal impact were identified to be the opportunities and benefits of using the gig economy and eHealth in Saudi Arabia. A strategic framework and an effective regulatory framework are essential for integrating the gig economy into the eHealth system in Saudi Arabia and improving future health care by adopting innovative artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies. CONCLUSION: eHealth has major scope for future health-care operations in Saudi Arabia and use of the gig economy in eHealth may lead to effective management of eHealth operations.

METHODS: We used electronic medical records (EMR) to obtain data about the total number of the insured population and the number of FMF patients in the two largest health management organizations (HMOs) in Jerusalem, Clalit and Meuhedet. The total number of COVID-19 inpatients at the Hadassah Medical Center, including those with FMF, for the period between the 1 February 2020, and the 10 March 2021 was retrieved from the EMR of Hadassah. COVID-19 course was compared between the FMF inpatient group and age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidity-matched non-FMF COVID-19 inpatients. Each FMF inpatient was matched with 2 non-FMF controls. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant difference in the odds of hospitalization for COVID-19 between FMF patients and the non-FMF population (0.46% vs 0.41%; p= 0.73).
