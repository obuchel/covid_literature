In the meantime, there is an obligation to prevent transmission and further spread of pathogens, including adherence to the Infection Protection Act. Pathogens can also survive for a long time on inanimate surfaces, from where they can be transferred via the hands of personnel and thus lead to infections. Studies have shown that even contamination of untouched instruments after an otorhinolaryngological examination is not a rare occurrence. The Kommission für Krankenhaushygiene und Infektionsprävention (KRINKO) of the Robert Koch Institute gives recommendations for general hygiene measures (basic or standard hygiene). These must be adapted and implemented accordingly for the otorhinolaryngological examination. Due to the increasing development of resistance of nosocomial pathogens and the current pandemic, consistent implementation of these infection-prevention measures is important.","Rohrmeier, C.; Schneider-Brachert, W.; Holzmann, T.; Bohr, C.; Haubner, F.",HNO,658,22

It can increase the rate of postoperative complications, interfere with patient recovery, and decrease hospital satisfaction. However, there are few studies on perioperative insomnia. This study was conducted to investigate the differences in the demographic, health status, and clinical characteristics of patients with and without insomnia postoperatively, and to identify the potential risk factors of insomnia. METHODS: There were 299 non-cardiac surgery patients, 165 females, and 134 males, with a mean age of 55 years, enrolled in the study. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were administered to all the patients preoperatively. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used preoperatively, and at the end of the surgery, and then one day, two days, and three days after surgery. The PHQ-9, the GAD-7, and the ISI were repeated three days after surgery. Insomnia was diagnosed by the ISI as being a score of 8–28 (mild: 8–14; moderate-severe: 15–21; severe: 22–28). The patients were divided into group A (with insomnia, N=78) and group B (without insomnia, N=221) according to their ISI score three days after surgery. The general clinical data of the two groups were analyzed first, and then binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the risk factors of insomnia. RESULTS: A total of 299 non-cardiac surgery patients with a mean age of 55 years were enrolled in the study. Of the included patients, the number of females was 165 and the number of the male was 134. The incidence of insomnia at 3 days postoperatively was 26.1% (78/299). The average points that group A patients scored in the ISI, PHQ-9, and the GAD-7 were significantly higher than those in group B. The VAS score three days after surgery was significantly higher in group A. The PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 three days after surgery showed significantly higher depression and anxiety scores in group A. Logistic regression showed that the ISI (p<0.001, 95% CI=1.218–1.500) and the GAD-7 (p=0.003, 95% CI=1.041–1.218) preoperatively, and the PHQ-9 postoperatively (p<0.001, 95% CI=1.226–1.555), were risk factors of insomnia. CONCLUSION: Insomnia is common and can worsen after surgery. The present study suggests that depression and anxiety are risk factors for insomnia after surgery. There is a need for further research and the development of strategies for depression and anxiety management to ensure better sleep quality for patients, which will be of significant benefit to their health.

Colchicine has been used to prevent FMF episodes and reduce the frequency of attacks. We report the case of a 64-year-old man who presented with depressive symptoms and was resistant to colchicine treatment. Adding escitalopram to the ongoing colchicine regimen dramatically improved his fever, abdominal pain, and depressive symptoms. The change in cytokines, ABCB1 effects, and increased serotonin were related to these mechanisms. This case suggested that adding escitalopram to colchicine is a viable treatment option for colchicine-resistant FMF.","Toshida, Masamitsu; Konishi, Yuki; Ikenouchi, Atsuko; Okamoto, Naomichi; Yoshimura, Reiji",,658,22

Although most recognize the critical and expanding role mechanism-based antitumor bioassays play in modern anticancer drug discovery, few natural products chemists have specific training in bioassay technology. Critical bioassay development factors are outlined and introduced at a level intended to provide a basic understanding to a general audience. These include molecular target identification, antitumor target validation, selection of assayable biochemical processes, data acquisition methods, experimental controls, bioassay validation and statistical methods, experimental artifacts, active compound identification, and the dereplication of nuisance compounds. Marine natural products have been identified that inhibit the activation of the anticancer drug target hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1).

In his original work, he described the “fetal allograft analogy” whereby the fetus may be viewed as a semi-allogeneic conceptus that has evaded rejection by the maternal immune system. Although numerous hypotheses have been proposed to prove this observation, none have demonstrated that the maternal immune system is antagonist to the invading trophoblast. In the present manuscript we have reviewed recent studies demonstrating the expression and function of TLRs in trophoblast cells and based on this data we propose an alternative view for maternal-fetal immune interactions.","Mor, Gil; Abrahams, Vikki M.",Immunology of Pregnancy,658,1

Researchers have discussed whether the mean-field approaches could accurately describe the epidemic spreading for the homogeneous cases but not for the heterogeneous cases. In this paper, we explore if and under what conditions the mean-field approach could perform well when the infection rates are heterogeneous. In particular, we employ the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and compare the average fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state, where the fraction of infected nodes remains stable for a long time, obtained by the continuous-time simulation and the mean-field approximation. We concentrate on an individual-based mean-field approximation called the N-intertwined Mean Field Approximation (NIMFA), which is an advanced approach considered the underlying network topology. Moreover, for the heterogeneity of the infection rates, we consider not only the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) infection rate but also the infection rate correlated with the degree of the two end nodes. We conclude that NIMFA is generally more accurate when the prevalence of the epidemic is higher. Given the same effective infection rate, NIMFA is less accurate when the variance of the i.i.d. infection rate or the correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree leads to a lower prevalence. Moreover, given the same actual prevalence, NIMFA performs better in the cases: 1) when the variance of the i.i.d. infection rates is smaller (while the average is unchanged); 2) when the correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree is positive. Our work suggests the conditions when the mean-field approach, in particular NIMFA, is more accurate in the approximation of the SIS epidemic with heterogeneous infection rates.","Qu, Bo; Wang, Huijuan",Complex Networks & Their Applications V,658,1

We describe the development process and key features for the Understanding Stroke web-based decision support tool. METHODS: We used multiple strategies to develop a patient-centered, tailored decision aid. We began by forming a Patient and Family Advisory Council to provide continuous input to our multidisciplinary team on the development of the tool. Additionally, focus groups consisting of nurses, therapists, social workers, physicians, stroke survivors, and family members reviewed key elements of the tool, including prognostic information, graphical displays, and values clarification exercise. To design the values clarification exercise, we asked focus groups to provide feedback on a list of important activities of daily living. An ordinal prognostic model was developed for ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage using data taken from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive Plus, and incorporated into the tool. RESULTS: Focus group participants recommended making numeric prognostic information optional due to possible emotional distress. Pie charts were generally favored by participants for graphical presentation of prognostic information, though a horizontal stacked bar chart was also added due to its prevalence in stroke literature. Plain language descriptions of the modified Rankin Scale were created to accompany the prognostic information. A values clarification exercise was developed consisting of a list of 13 situations that may make an individual consider comfort measures only. The final version of the web based tool (which can be viewed on tablets) included the following sections: general introduction to stroke, outcomes (prognostic information and recovery), in-hospital and life-sustaining treatments, decision making and values clarification, post-hospital care, tips for talking to the health care team, and a summary report. Preliminary usability testing received generally favorable feedback. CONCLUSION: We developed Understanding Stroke, a tailored decision support tool for surrogate decision makers of stroke patients. The tool was well received and will be formally pilot tested in a group of stroke surrogate decision makers.

The present discourse, made from within an Arabian Gulf society, specifically Oman, reviews the socio-cultural differences of the region and explores the potential regional challenges for effectively implementing the CRC mandated child protection legislation. The international best practices evolved for individualistic, “guilt-based” societies, which may need to be modified to suit the “shame-based” collective societies in the Arabian Gulf where the individual autonomy is overridden by that of the family and society. This may mean that the entire spectrum of child abuse may need to be studied in-depth, starting from what constitutes child abuse and neglect, the methods adopted for identifying cases, setting preventive measures in place, applying penal and corrective action on the perpetrators, and helping the victims recover. It is posited that while modifying the laws may be straightforward, implementation of certain clauses may initially come into conflict with deeply engrained socio-cultural conventions on these societies which have different parenting styles and child-rearing practices. The country in focus is Oman. Pointing out the sparsity of research on the topic in the region, the study suggests additional research to understand how to reconcile these sociocultural constraints with the international best practices of protecting child rights.","Al-Saadoon, Muna; Al-Adawi, Manal; Al-Adawi, Samir",Child Indic Res,658,26

COVID-19 has created new educational challenges, as DM self-management education and support is difficult to deliver remotely and can be time intensive. Content and format have not been re-designed for remote delivery; however, learning sciences research can help us create effective remote education strategies. We conducted interviews with users to identify critical needs in assuming immediate DM self-care at discharge from the hospital. We then mapped these user needs to relevant learning science theories to inform potential re-designs for remote delivery of DM education and survival skills at discharge. We conducted 12 semi-structured interviews with “users,” which included 18 participants (8 minority; 6>65 years): patients newly diagnosed with DM at discharge (N=6 [33%]), their caregivers (N=4 [22%]), and laypersons new to DM (N=8 [45%]). Users were asked about their discharge needs, laypersons about perceived needs. Three investigators performed iterative rounds of inductive coding of the transcripts (using MAXQDA software), utilizing a constant comparative method to identify codes describing dominant user needs. Learning science theory was applied to identify potential re-designs for remote delivery. Dominant user needs during hospitalization included being overwhelmed with DM self-care information (6/12 sessions) and difficulty organizing self-care equipment (5/12 sessions). Dominant user needs at home included remembering DM self-care steps (6/12 sessions), understanding correct insulin dosing (9/12 sessions), feeling fearful injecting insulin (9/12 sessions), with some noting difficulty in tracking glucose (4/12 sessions) and confusing insulin types (4/12 sessions). When learning science theory was applied, analysis mapped to three discrete educational strategies, most dominant of which is the spiral design approach—cycles of teaching the same topic but with increasing complexity. This design follows the pre-teaching principle—curriculum-based conceptual overview of self-care. Self-care at home mapped to the need for segmented learning and goal directed practice and feedback, with the potential need for behavioral therapies to reduce fear. Learning sciences has demonstrated that learning complex procedures and concepts, such as DM self-care, requires time, repetition, and continued support. With short hospital stays and the complexity of learning DM self-care, patients cannot gain needed knowledge structures to organize the information received during hospitalization. This study suggests specific learning science strategies for the design of an effective remote delivery of DM education and skills.","Prince, Grace; Lewis, Daniel Rees; Pollack, Teresa; Karam, Susan; Touma, Emilie; Khorzad, Rebeca; Bailey, Stacy; Gatchell, David; Ankenman, Bruce; Holl, Jane; Wallia, Amisha",J Endocr Soc,658,1

To our knowledge, there is no study conducted to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pregnant women in Ethiopia. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and its associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care clinic in Southwest Ethiopia. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was employed from January 1 up to 30, 2021. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 396 study participants. A structured and face-to-face interview was used to collect data. Data were entered into Epi-data version 4.2.0 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. P values &lt;0.05 result were considered as a statistically significant association. Results: The COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was found to be 70.7% (95% CI, 66.7%– 74.7%). Maternal age (34–41) years [AOR=1.464, (95% CI;1.218–5.129)], primary maternal educational status [AOR=3.476, (95% CI;1.520–7.947), good knowledge [AOR=5.946, (95% CI;3.147–7.065)], and good practice [AOR =9.15, (95% CI;8.734–12.189)] of pregnant women towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures were factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was found to be 70.9%. Maternal age (34–41) years, primary maternal educational status, good knowledge, and good practice of pregnant women towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures were factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Health care workers should provide health education to pregnant women to increase their knowledge about the diseases and disseminate leaflets regarding COVID-19 preventive measures. Moreover, before initiation of COVID-19 vaccine administration to pregnant women they must promote the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine.","Mose, A.; Yeshaneh, A.",International Journal of General Medicine,658,4

The main aim of this study was to evaluate the mutual effects of belief that the pandemic was the result of a conspiracy on knowledge and anxiety levels among students at the University of Jordan (UJ). An electronic-based survey was conducted between 29 March, 2020 and 31 March, 2020. The targeted population involved all undergraduate and postgraduate students from the health, scientific and humanities schools at UJ. Survey sections included 26 items on: socio-demographic information, knowledge and sources of information about the disease, attitude towards the false notion that COVID-19 stemmed from a conspiracy and items to assess the anxiety level among students during the quarantine period. The total number of participants was 1540 students. The mean age of study participants was 22 years and females predominated the study population (n = 1145, 74.4%). The majority of participants perceived the disease as moderately dangerous (n = 1079, 70.1%). Males, Jordanians and participants with lower income were more inclined to feel that COVID-19 is very dangerous. A lower level of knowledge and a higher level of anxiety about COVID-19 were associated with the belief that the disease is part of a conspiracy. Females and participants with lower income were more likely to believe that the disease is related to conspiracy. Belief in conspiracy regarding the origin of COVID-19 was associated with misinformation about the availability of a vaccine and the therapeutic use of antibiotics for COVID-19 treatment. The Ministry of Health in Jordan was the most common source of information about COVID-19 reported by the participants (n = 1018). The false belief that COVID-19 was the result of a global conspiracy could be the consequence of a lower level of knowledge about the virus and could lead to a higher level of anxiety, which should be considered in the awareness tools of various media platforms about the current pandemic.","Sallam, Malik; Dababseh, Deema; Yaseen, Alaa039; Al-Haidar, Ayat; Ababneh, Nidaa A; Bakri, Faris G; Mahafzah, Azmi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),658,24

The objective of our study was to describe and classify maculopapular eruptions associated with COVI-19. We carried out a subanalysis of the maculopapular cases found in the previous cross-sectional study. Using a consensus, we defined seven clinical patterns. We described patient demographics, the therapy received by the patient and the characteristics of each pattern. Consensus lead to the description of seven major maculopapular patterns: morbilliform (45.5%), other maculopapular (20.0%), purpuric (14.2%), erythema multiforme-like (9.7%), pytiriasis rosea-like (5.7%), erythema elevatum diutinum-like (2.3%), and perifollicular (2.3%). In most cases, maculopapular eruptions were coincident (61.9%) or subsequent (34.1%) to the onset of other COVID-19 manifestations. The most frequent were cough (76%), dyspnea (72%), fever (88%), and astenia (62%). Hospital admission due to pneumonia was frequent (61%). Drug intake was frequent (78%). Laboratory alterations associated with maculo-papular eruptions were high C-reactive protein, high D-Dimer, lymphopenia, high ferritin, high LDH, and high IL-6. The main limitation of our study was the impossibility to define the cause-effect relationship of each pattern. In conclusion, we provide a description of the cutaneous maculopapular manifestations associated with COVID-19. The cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 are wide-ranging and can mimic other dermatoses.","Català, Alba; Galván-Casas, Cristina; Carretero-Hernández, Gregorio; Rodríguez-Jiménez, Pedro; Fernández-Nieto, Daniel; Rodríguez-Villa, Ana; Navarro-Fernández, Íñigo; Ruiz-Villaverde, Ricardo; Falkenhain-López, Daniel; Llamas-Velasco, Mar; Carnero-Gonzalez, Lucía; García-Gavin, Juan; Baniandrés, Ofelia; González-Cruz, Carlos; Morillas-Lahuerta, Víctor; Cubiró, Xavier; Figueras, Ignasi; Selda-Enriquez, Gerald; Fustà-Novell, Xavier; Roncero-Riesco, Mónica; Burgos-Blasco, Patrícia; Romaní, Jorge; Solà-Ortigosa, Joaquim; García-Doval, Ignacio",Dermatol Ther,658,16

A literature search was executed using MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase databases for articles published till 20 November 2020. All eligible articles including observational studies, case reports, and case series reporting the maculopapular skin lesion in Covid‐19 patients were included. Data were obtained for 354 Covid‐19 patients presenting with maculopapular lesions from 40 studies. The mean age of these patients was 53 years, and with 42% of them being male. These maculopapular lesions differed considerably in terms of distribution and appearance, ranging from diffuse erythematous maculopapular lesions to scattered erythematous macules coalescing into papules to maculopapular lesions in plaques. The mean duration of the lesion was 8 days. These lesions were frequently localized on trunks and extremities. Superficial perivascular dermatitis with lymphocytic infiltrate was a histopathological hallmark of these lesions. As these skin lesions may have a possible association with diagnosis, management, prognosis, and severity of the disease, all health practitioners need to be well acquainted with these Covid‐19 skin lesions. Also, in the middle of this worldwide pandemic, early identification of this eruption may help manage this infection's further spread.","Shams, Saad; Rathore, Sawai Singh; Anvekar, Priyanka; Sondhi, Manush; Kancherla, Neeraj; Tousif, Sohaib; Rojas, Gianpier Alonzo; Ahmed, Noman Khurshid; Munawwar, Mehwish; Noman, Muhammad",Dermatol Ther,658,16
