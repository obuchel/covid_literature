70596,The ghost of hosts past: impacts of host extinction on parasite specificity.,2021-11-08,"Negative staining is a simple and rapid method for studying the morphology and ultrastructure of small particulate specimens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, cell fragments, and isolated macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids). The technique described in this protocol involves allowing particles or fragments of cells to settle onto a support film, then applying a drop of metal salt solution to the adherent particulate specimen. The stain penetrates the interstices of the particles to bring out detail. In this situation, the preparation dries rapidly. The dissolved substance precipitates out of solution in an amorphous condition at the 0.1-nm level, and it is deposited over the support film and exposed surface of the specimen. The theoretical requirements of a good negative staining are a substance (1) of high density to provide high contrast, (2) at high solubility so that the stain does not come out of solution prematurely but does so only at the final stage of drying, (3) of high melting point and boiling point so that the material does not evaporate at high temperatures induced by the electron beam, and (4) in which the precipitate should be essentially amorphous down to the limit of resolution.","Hendricks, Gregory; Sena-Esteves, Miguel; Gao, Guangping",Cold Spring Harbor protocols,https://doi.org/10.1101/pdb.prot095661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747581/,886
86244,Extreme precision in rhythmic interaction is enabled by role-optimized sensorimotor coupling: analysis and modelling of West African drum ensemble music.,2021-10-11,"Soft and stretchable materials play an important role in the emerging fields of soft robotics, human-machine interfaces, and stretchable electronics. Hydrogels are compelling materials because they are soft, chemically tunable, biocompatible, and ionically conductive. Hydrogels have been used as components of skin mountable sensors, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes, and show promise in emerging devices as stretchable, transparent electrodes. Ultimately, these types of devices interface the hydrogel with rigid metallic electrodes to connect with electronic circuitry. Here, we show it is possible to interface hydrogel with liquid metal (eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn) electrodes to create completely soft and deformable electrodes that provide low resistance traces through the gel without altering its mechanical properties. As a case study, we created and tested electrodes for ECG monitoring. ECG electrodes require low impedance at biomedically relevant frequencies (1-50 Hz). Potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements show that capacitive effects at the hydrogel-EGaIn interface dominate the impedance at these low frequencies, yet can be reduced by interfacing the metal with acidic or basic hydrogels that remove the native oxide skin from the metal. Increasing the ionic strength of the hydrogel also helps in lowering the impedance of the metal-hydrogel electrodes. The resulting devices have signal-to-noise ratios that exceed commercial ECG electrodes. The softness of these hydrogels can be modified without compromising the electrical properties to create truly soft electrodes. Interfacing liquid metal conductors with hydrogels represents a potential strategy of creating soft electrodes for various bioelectronic applications, e-skins, and next-generation soft robotics.","Shay, Tim; Velev, Orlin D; Dickey, Michael D",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/c8sm00337h; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29670971/,886

Diet, and specifically vitamin C, through its antioxidant properties can play a role in impeding the development and progression of atherosclerosis. This systematic review conducted comprehensive searches in Medline, Emcare, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane using key search terms for vitamin C, plasma vitamin C, supplementation, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The results demonstrated that vitamin C supplementation resulted in a significant increase in vitamin C levels in populations with or without CVD, except for one study on the CVD population. It was also seen that the healthy population baseline and post-intervention vitamin C levels were high compared to the CVD population. However, further research is indicated for CVD population groups with varying baseline vitamin C levels, such as low baseline vitamin C, within a more representative elderly cohort in order to formulate and update vitamin C repletion guidelines.","Collins, Bianca J; Mukherjee, Mitali S; Miller, Michelle D; Delaney, Christopher L",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34371840/,886

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were utilized for data mining of the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for suspected adverse events involving AP after PI. The times to onset and fatality rates of AP following different PI regimens were also compared. RESULTS Based on 33,832 reports related to PIs, 285 cases were associated with AP, involving with 12 out of the 15 studied PIs. Of all the reported AP events related to PIs, 64.56% occurred in men and the median time to onset of AP was 103 (IQR: 26-408) days after the initiation of PI treatment with a fatality rate of 14.02%. Among all PI therapies, indinavir was notably associated with AP, and ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir-induced AP cases appeared to be associated with a higher risk of death. CONCLUSIONS Most of PIs were associated with AP-related adverse events, among which indinavir has a stronger association with AP but there is no significant difference in fatality rates.","Qin, Wangjun; Zhao, Bin; Shang, Yongguang; Zhang, Lei",Expert opinion on drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1080/14740338.2021.1933942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34018864/,886

In response to a telephone survey, 126 older adults described perceived changes in physical and mental health, and adaptations in their everyday health behaviors. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, and multiple regressions revealed that participants experienced changes in mental and physical health, reduced health service access, lower social engagement, and increased coping behaviors. Greater negative social impact of the pandemic was associated with higher levels of COVID-19 distress. Reduced mental health was significantly related to reductions in health service access, health changes, and fewer adaptive coping behaviors. Adaptive coping behaviors were helpful, just as reduced health access and social contact added risk for mental health problems. Suggestions were provided for alleviating mental health needs by increasing social contact and engaging in adaptive coping behaviors.","Scott, Judith M; Yun, Stacy W; Qualls, Sara H",Geriatric nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gerinurse.2021.06.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34256160/,886

We have found an active phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid, (13aR,14R)-9,11,12,13,13a,14-hexahydro-3,6,7-trimethoxydibenzo[f,h]pyrrolo[1,2-b]isoquinolin-14-ol (HTBPI), is a promising Akt inhibitor effective in the suppression of HCC cells proliferation through stimulating apoptotic and autophagic capability in vivo and in vitro. Treatment of HTBPI combined with a classical autophagy-lysosomal inhibitor (bafilomycin A1), could enhance stimulation effects of apoptosis on HCC cell lines. In addition, we confirmed HTBPI targeting Akt, occupied the kinase binding domain (Thr 308) of Akt to inactivate its function by CETSA and DARTS assay. In contrast, ectopic Akt-induced overexpression significantly abrogated inhibitory effects of HTBPI on cell viability and proliferation. Furthermore, high p-Akt (Thr 308) expression is collated with liver tumor formation and poor survival in HCC patients. In conclusions, HTBPI impeded HCC progress through regulation of apoptosis and autophagy machinery via interaction with p-Akt (Thr 308). This may provide potential molecular candidate by targeting Akt for the therapy of HCC patients.","Liu, Hongwei; Chen, Qian; Lu, Di; Pang, Xu; Yin, Shuangshuang; Wang, Kailong; Wang, Rui; Yang, Shenshen; Zhang, Yi; Qiu, Yuling; Wang, Tao; Yu, Haiyang",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202000254r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411355/,886
106676,Mobile phone-based surveillance for animal disease in rural communities: implications for detection of zoonoses spillover.,2019,"Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) is involved in resistance to several therapies for malignant tumours. Currently, several anti-HER3 monoclonal antibodies are under clinical development. We introduce an alternative approach to HER3-targeted therapy based on engineered scaffold proteins, i.e. affibody molecules. We designed a small construct (22.5 kDa, denoted 3A3), consisting of two high-affinity anti-HER3 affibody molecules flanking an albumin-binding domain ABD, which was introduced for prolonged residence in circulation. In vitro, 3A3 efficiently inhibited growth of HER3-expressing BxPC-3 cells. Biodistribution in mice was measured using 3A3 that was site-specifically labelled with 111In via a DOTA chelator. The residence time of 111In-DOTA-3A3 in blood was extended when compared with the monomeric affibody molecule. 111In-DOTA-3A3 accumulated specifically in HER3-expressing BxPC-3 xenografts in mice. However, 111In-DOTA-3A3 cleared more rapidly from blood than a size-matched control construct 111In-DOTA-TAT, most likely due to sequestering of 3A3 by mErbB3, the murine counterpart of HER3. Repeated dosing and increase of injected protein dose decreased uptake of 111In-DOTA-3A3 in mErbB3-expressing tissues. Encouragingly, growth of BxPC-3 xenografts in mice was delayed in an experimental (pilot-scale) therapy study using 3A3. We conclude that the 3A3 affibody format seems promising for treatment of HER3-overexpressing tumours.","Bass, Tarek Z; Rosestedt, Maria; Mitran, Bogdan; Frejd, Fredrik Y; Löfblom, John; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Ståhl, Stefan; Orlova, Anna",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep43118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28230065/,886

These manifestations do not seem to share pathophysiological mechanisms, but clinical data on the subject is lacking. Aims/Objectives: This study aims to correlate the olfactory function (OF) and the radiological pulmonary involvement among in-hospital patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 were consecutively recruited. They had their objective OF evaluated by the Alcohol Sniff Test and underwent a chest computed tomography (cCT). Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the cCT scans were performed by a blinded radiologist. The quantitative assessment included both the grade of involved parenchyma and the CT severity score (CT-SS). Data obtained were then compared. RESULTS 57 patients were included. There was no correlation between the OF and the grade of lung involvement (p-value: .884) or the CT-SS (Pearson's coefficient: -.111). Yet, patients with radiological findings on the cCT typical for COVID-19 did not present significantly different OF from the remaining (p-value: .193). Conclusions: Olfactory dysfunction does not correlate with the radiological lung involvement in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

BACKGROUND Without randomized clinical trials, the best approach to managing coexisting severe carotid and coronary disease remains uncertain. Staged carotid endarterectomy (CEA) followed by OHS or combined CEA and OHS are commonly used. A recent alternative is carotid artery stenting (CAS). METHODS From 1997 to 2009, 350 patients underwent carotid revascularization within 90 days before OHS at a tertiary center: 45 staged CEA-OHS, 195 combined CEA-OHS, and 110 staged CAS-OHS. The primary composite endpoint was all-cause death, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI). Staged CAS-OHS patients had higher prevalence of previous stroke (p = 0.03) and underwent more complex OHS. Therefore, the propensity score adjusted multiphase hazard function models with modulated renewal to account for staging, and competing risks were used. RESULTS Using propensity analysis, staged CAS-OHS and combined CEA-OHS had similar early hazard phase composite outcomes, whereas staged CEA-OHS incurred the highest risk driven by interstage MI. Subsequently, staged CAS-OHS patients experienced significantly fewer late hazard phase events compared with both staged CEA-OHS (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.33; 95% confidence interval: 0.15 to 0.77; p = 0.01) and combined CEA-OHS (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.35; 95% confidence interval: 0.18 to 0.70; p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS Staged CAS-OHS and combined CEA-OHS are associated with a similar risk of death, stroke, or MI in the short term, with both being better than staged CEA-OHS. However, the outcomes significantly favor staged CAS-OHS after the first year.","Shishehbor, Mehdi H; Venkatachalam, Sridhar; Sun, Zhiyuan; Rajeswaran, Jeevanantham; Kapadia, Samir R; Bajzer, Christopher; Gornik, Heather L; Gray, Bruce H; Bartholomew, John R; Clair, Daniel G; Sabik, Joseph F; Blackstone, Eugene H",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2013.03.094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23876675/,886
131917,New methodologies for the estimation of population vulnerability to diseases: a case study of Lassa fever and Ebola in Nigeria and Sierra Leone.,2019,"OBJECTIVES There is increasing evidence that intestinal microbiota play a role in diverse metabolic processes via intestinal butyrate production. Based on bariatric surgery data in humans it has been suggested that the gut-brain axis is also involved in this process, however the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. DESIGN We therefore compared the effect of fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) donors versus oral butyrate supplementation on (123I-FP-CIT determined) brain dopamine transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) binding as well as stable isotope determined insulin sensitivity at baseline and after 4 weeks in 24 male and female treatment-naïve metabolic syndrome subjects. Also, plasma metabolites and fecal microbiota were determined at these timepoints. RESULTS We observed an increase in brain DAT upon donor FMT compared to oral butyrate that reduced this binding. However, no effect on body weight and insulin sensitivity was seen upon post-RYGB donor feces transfer in either humans with metabolic syndrome. In line, increases in fecal levels of Bacteroides uniformis were significantly associated with an increase in DAT whereas increases in Prevotella spp. showed an inverse association. Furthermore, changes in the plasma metabolites glycine, betaine, methionine and lysine (associated with the S-adenosylmethionine cycle) were also associated with altered striatal DAT expression. CONCLUSION Although more and larger studies are needed, our data suggest a potential gut microbiota-driven modulation of brain dopamine and serotonin transporters in human obese metabolic syndrome subjects. Moreover, these data suggest the presence of a gut-brain axis in humans,that can be modulated.

159485,"Contact structure, mobility, environmental impact and behaviour: the importance of social forces to infectious disease dynamics and disease ecology.",2017,"INTRODUCTION The use of robotics for benign etiology in gynecology has not proven to be more beneficial when compared to traditional laparoscopy. The major concern regarding robotic hysterectomy stems from its high cost. AIM To evaluate the clinical utility and effectiveness of one-arm reduced robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy as a cost-effective surgical option for total robotic hysterectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS A sample population of 54 women who underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery for benign gynecologic indications was evaluated, and two groups were identified: (1) the two-armed robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery group (n = 38 patients), and (2) the three-armed robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery group (n = 16 patients). RESULTS An increased cost was observed when three-armed robotic surgery was employed for benign gynecologic surgery (p < 0.001). The cost reduction observed in the study group was primarily derived from one robotic arm reduction and vaginal closure of the cuff. This cost reduction was achieved without an increase in complication rates or undesirable postoperative outcomes. An estimated profit between $399.5 and $421.5 was made for each patient depending on the suture material chosen for cuff closure. Two-armed surgery resulted in an 18.6% reduction in procedure-specific costs for robotic hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS Two-armed robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy appears to be a cost-effective solution for robotic gynecologic surgery. This surgical solution can be performed as effectively as classical three-armed robotic hysterectomies for benign indications without the risk of increased surgical-related morbidities. This approach has the potential to be a widely preferred surgical approach in medical communities where cost reduction is one of the primary determinants of surgery type.","Bodur, Serkan; Dede, Murat; Fidan, Ulas; Firatligil, Burcin F; Ulubay, Mustafa; Ozturk, Mustafa; Yenen, Mufit C",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2017.68772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29062448/,886

187074,Animal health.,1973,"We investigated the role played by inflammation in acute encephalitis following infection with a neurotropic virus by comparing the disease caused by the CVS strain of rabies virus in C57BL/6 and mice deficient for the p55 Kd TNF-alpha receptor (p55TNFR-/-). Morbidity (weight loss and paralysis) and mortality of infected mice were associated with viral propagation, cytokine (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) production, induction of apoptosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Mortality occurred later in p55TNFR-/- (than in C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, morbidity and the number of cells undergoing apoptosis were similar in C57BL/6 and p55TNFR-/- mice.) This suggests that morbidity and mortality are independently regulated and that the death of the animal was not due to CNS apoptosis. Delayed mortality correlated with: a reduction in viral load on day 9 p.i., an increase in IFN-gamma and IL-10 concentrations and a reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration in the CNS. Thus, these data indicate that CVS infection elicits an inflammatory response within the CNS and suggest that cytokines signaling via the p55 Kd TNF-alpha receptor is deleterious for the survival of the host. These results strongly suggest that, the modulation of TNF-alpha and upregulation of IFN-gamma would be a powerful anti-virus strategy in cases of viral encephalitis.","Camelo, S; Lafage, M; Lafon, M",Journal of neurovirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11175323/,886

Reactivation of HBV refers to an increase in the HBV load caused by chemotherapy in a patient with HBV infection. Reactivation of HBV is classified into 2 categories: reactivation in a carrier and reactivation in a patient with resolved HBV infection. Because hepatitis caused by HBV reactivation is more likely to become severe and makes the treatment of original diseases difficult, it is most important to prevent the onset of hepatitis. The basic strategy for prevention and treatment of HBV reactivation associated with powerful chemotherapy regimens should follow the guidelines for the management of hepatitis B virus infection by the Japan Society of Hepatology. Risk of HBV reactivation is determined by HBV infection status and the degree of immunosuppression. HBV infection status is classified into chronic active hepatitis, inactive carrier, and resolved infection. This corresponds, in descending order, to the risk of reactivation. Patients undergoing chemotherapy should be screened for HBV infection. HBsAg levels should be measured in all patients prior to commencement of treatment. In HBsAg-positive patients, HBeAg, anti-HBe antibody, and HBV DNA levels should also be measured. In HBsAg-negative patients, anti-HBc antibody and anti-HBs antibody should be measured. The next step for patients with resolved HBV infection is measurement of HBV DNA levels. In patients with resolved HBV infection whose HBV DNA level is 20 IU/mL or higher, as in inactive carriers, prophylactic therapy should be commenced before chemotherapy. In patients with resolved HBV infection whose HBV DNA level is less than 20 IU/mL, periodic monitoring of HBV DNA should be performed during and after chemotherapy. Preemptive therapy should be started immediately if the HBV DNA level ex- ceeds 20 IU/mL.","Takikawa, Hajime",Gan to kagaku ryoho.

DATA SOURCES The data used in this review were obtained from PubMed and CNKI up to May 2013. Terms of Chinese herbs and infections of respiratory tract were used in the search. STUDY SELECTION Articles related that Chinese herbs preventing and treating infections in respiratory tract were retrieved and reviewed. The risk of bias of included studies was assessed by the method in the ""Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reveiws of Interventionsand studies"" with high risk of bias were excluded. Four criteria for selections were set as following: randomized controlled trial, particular effective compound or derivative, reproducible result and animal test. RESULTS Infectious respiratory tract diseases cause most mortality among infectious illnesses around the world. As traditional medicines, Chinese herbs have been widely used to deal with diseases for centuries and have been proved effective in practice. The administration of some Chinese herbs stimulates, suppresses or regulates the activity of immune system, thus protecting the respiratory tract or relieving infections of pathogens. Many herbs have remarkable antiviral effects, therefore they are used as substitutes of antimicrobial drugs. Based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, mix-using herbs provide a synergistic benefit on preventing and healing respiratory tract infections. Many commercial herbal medicines containing one or more compounds have been successfully applied to prevent and treat viral infections of respiratory tract clinically. CONCLUSIONS Traditional Chinese herbs could directly inhibit pathogens infecting respiratory tract, or coordinate the activity of immune system to avoid or relieve infections. With the emergence of antidrug pathogens or new variants, Chinese herbs give strong evidence to protect human health.","Wang, Xiaoguang; Liu, Zejing",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709192/,886

293933,Relatively low mortality rate of COVID-19 in Cameroon: What if age was the main factor?,2021,"The essential microelement zinc plays immunoregulatory roles via its ability to influence signaling pathways. Zinc deficiency impairs overall immune function and resultantly increases susceptibility to infection. Thus, zinc is considered as an immune-boosting supplement for populations with hypozincemia at high-risk for infection. Besides its role as a structural cofactor of many proteins, zinc also acts as an intracellular messenger in immune cell signaling. T-cell activation instructs zinc influx from extracellular and subcellular sources through the Zip6 and Zip8 zinc transporters, respectively. Increased cytoplasmic zinc participates in the regulation of T-cell responses by modifying activation signaling. However, the mechanism underlying the activation-dependent movement of zinc ions by Zip transporters in T cells remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Zip6, one of the most abundantly expressed Zip transporters in T cells, is mainly localized to lipid rafts in human T cells and is recruited into the immunological synapse in response to TCR stimulation. This was demonstrated through confocal imaging of the interaction between CD4+ T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Further, immunoprecipitation assays show that TCR triggering induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Zip6, which has at least three putative tyrosine motifs in its long cytoplasmic region, and this phosphorylation is coupled with its physical interaction with Zap70. Silencing Zip6 reduces zinc influx from extracellular sources and suppresses T-cell responses, suggesting an interaction between Zip6-mediated zinc influx and TCR activation. These results provide new insights into the mechanism through which Zip6-mediated zinc influx occurs in a TCR activation-dependent manner in human CD4+ T cells.","Kim, Bonah; Kim, Hee Young; Lee, Won-Woo",Front Immunol,,886
293934,Relatively low mortality rate of COVID-19 in Cameroon: What if age was the main factor?,2021,"Poor mental health associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may prompt the utilization of various coping behaviors, including alcohol use. We aimed to investigate the relationships between mental health symptomatology and self-reported changes in alcohol consumption at the onset of the pandemic. Data were from the nationwide COVID-19 Coping Study of US adults aged &gt;=55 in April and May 2020 (n = 6548). We used population-weighted multivariable-adjusted multi-nomial logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the associations between mental health (of depression, anxiety, and loneliness, each) and self-reported increased alcohol consumption (vs. no change in consumption). One in ten adults (717/6548;11%) reported an increase in their alcohol consumption in the past week compared to their usual pre-COVID-19 drinking. Mental health symptomatology was associated with increased drinking since the pandemic onset (depression: OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.99-3.56;anxiety: OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.34-2.42;loneliness: OR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.83-3.28). Participants who screened positive for all three mental health outcomes were substantially more likely to report increased alcohol consumption since the onset of the pandemic (OR = 3.87, 95% CI: 2.52-5.96, vs. no mental health outcomes). This study demonstrates potentially harmful changes in alcohol intake among middle-to-older aged adults experiencing mental health symptomatology during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Eastman, M.

As always, natural disasters or infectious disease outbreaks have the potential to cause emergency department (ED) volume changes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the influence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on ED visits and the impact on the handling of patients requiring urgent revascularization. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of all patients presenting to the ED of Hospital Sainte Anne (Toulon, France) from March 23 to April 5, 2020 and compared them with those of the same period in 2019. Then we analyzed complementary data on acute coronary syndrome (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]) and neurovascular emergencies (strokes and transient ischemic attacks). RESULTS: The total number of visits decreased by 47%. The number of people assessed as triage level 2 was 8% lower in 2020. There were five fewer cases of NSTEMI in 2020, but the same number of STEMI. The number of neurovascular emergencies increased (27 cases in 2019 compared with 30 in 2020). We observed a reduction in the delay between arrival at the ED and the beginning of coronary angiography for STEMI cases (27 min in 2019 and 22 min in 2020). In 2020, 7 more stroke patients were admitted. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic probably dissuaded ""non-critical"" patients from coming to the hospital, whereas the same number of patients with a critical illness attended the ED as attended prior to the pandemic. There does not seem to have been any effect of the pandemic on patients requiring reperfusion therapy (STEMI and stroke).","Montagnon, Romain; Rouffilange, Louis; Agard, Geoffray; Benner, Patrick; Cazes, Nicolas; Renard, Aurélien",J. emerg. med,,886
600051,Characteristics of the 100 largest modern zoonotic disease outbreaks,2021-11-08,"Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) is about to touch every aspect of radiotherapy from consultation, treatment planning, quality assurance, therapy delivery, to outcomes modeling. There is an urgent need to train radiation oncologists and medical physicists in data science to help shepherd AI solutions into clinical practice. Poorly trained personnel may do more harm than good when attempting to apply rapidly developing and complex technologies. As the amount of AI research expands in our field, the radiation oncology community needs to discuss how to educate future generations in this area. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Workshop on AI in Radiation Oncology (Shady Grove, MD, April 4-5, 2019) was the first (https://dctd.cancer.gov/NewsEvents/20190523_ai_in_radiation_oncology.htm) of two data science workshops in radiation oncology hosted by the NCI in 2019. During this workshop, the Training and Education Working Group was formed by volunteers among the invited attendees. Its members represent radiation oncology, medical physics, radiology, computer science, industry, and the NCI. In this perspective article written by members of the Training and Education Working Group, we provide and discuss Action Points relevant for future trainees interested in radiation oncology AI: (1) creating AI awareness and responsible conduct; (2) implementing a practical didactic curriculum; (3) creating a publicly available database of training resources; and (4) accelerate learning and funding opportunities. Together, these Action Points can facilitate the translation of AI into clinical practice.","Kang, John; Thompson, Reid F.; Aneja, Sanjay; Lehman, Constance; Trister, Andrew; Zou, James; Obcemea, Ceferino; El Naqa, Issam",Pract Radiat Oncol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879850020301557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32544635/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879850020301557?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prro.2020.06.001,886
