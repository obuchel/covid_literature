Further phytochemical investigation afforded two new aryl cresol 12–13, along with eight known compounds 14–21. Both new metabolites, along with 19, showed moderate in vitro antiproliferative activity against HepG2, MCF-7, and Caco-2. Pharmacophore-based virtual screening suggested both 5-LOX and 15-LOX as the most probable target linked to their observed antiproliferative activity. The in vitro enzyme assays revealed 12 and 13 were able to inhibit 5-LOX more preferentially than 15-LOX, while 19 showed a convergent inhibitory activity toward both enzymes. Further in-depth in silico investigation revealed the molecular interactions inside both enzymes’ active sites and explained the varying inhibitory activity for 12 and 13 toward 5-LOX and 15-LOX.","Alzarea, Sami I.; Elmaidomy, Abeer H.; Saber, Hani; Musa, Arafa; Al-Sanea, Mohammad M.; Mostafa, Ehab M.; Hendawy, Omnia Magdy; Youssif, Khayrya A.; Alanazi, Abdullah S.; Alharbi, Metab; Sayed, Ahmed M.; Abdelmohsen, Usama Ramadan",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8069941/,685
17022,Burnout and Its Relationship with Demographic and Job-Related Variables among Dentists in Lithuania: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021-04-09,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Inflammation has been recognized to be linked to tumor development. Several markers of inflammation can be detected via blood such as variety of blood cells, which can be readily and easily obtained. These markers have been studied as ways to predict and prognosticate tumor response to chemotherapy. With the development of immunotherapy, namely immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and programmed death ligand 1 (PDL-1) PDL-1 inhibitors, several markers have also been studied in assessing tumor response. In this review, we will discuss the various inflammatory markers that have been studied in several tumors treated with ICIs. ABSTRACT: Chronic inflammation is considered a major risk factor for cancer formation. Inflammation within the tumor environment plays a role in its response to therapy, growth, and prognosis. Cancer associated inflammation is known to occur in the tumor microenvironment and in the systemic circulation, and is correlated with disease progression and prognosis in many cancers. Blood cells such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, and circulating proteins such as C-reactive protein, and interleukins, such as IL-6, have been associated with inflammatory responses, which contribute to tumorigenesis. Cancer has found ways to evade the immune response; a pathway that can attenuate the innate immune response is via blocking immune checkpoints. Development of monoclonal antibodies against inhibitory immune checkpoints such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) have given rise to immunotherapy, which has shown remarkable responses in anti-tumor activity resulting in several U.S. Federal and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved checkpoint inhibitors. Various inflammatory markers and their prognostic and predictive implications in malignancies treated with immunotherapy will be discussed in this review.","Ravindranathan, Deepak; Master, Viraj A.; Bilen, Mehmet Asim",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8069970/,685
19835,Efficacy of Interventional Programs in Reducing Acculturative Stress and Enhancing Adjustment of International Students to the New Host Educational Environment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2021-07-22,"Management of takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is currently empirical and supportive, via extrapolation of therapeutic principles worked out for other cardiovascular pathologies. Although it has been emphasized that such non-specific therapies for TTS are consequent to its still elusive pathophysiology, one wonders whether it does not necessarily follow that the absence of knowledge of TTS’ pathophysiological underpinnings should prevent us for searching, designing, or even finding, therapies efficacious for its management. Additionally, it is conceivable that therapy for TTS may be in response to pathophysiological/pathoanatomic/pathohistological consequences (e.g., “myocardial stunning/reperfusion injury”), common to both TTS and coronary artery disease, or other cardiovascular disorders). The present review outlines the whole range of management principles of TTS during its acute phase and at follow-up, including considerations pertaining to the recurrence of TTS, and commences with the idea that occasionally management of TTS should consist of mere observation along the “first do no harm” principle, while self-healing is under way. Finally, some new therapeutic hypotheses (i.e., large doses of insulin infusions in association with the employment of intravenous short- and ultrashort-acting β-blockers) are being entertained, based on previous extensive animal work and limited application in patients with neurogenic cardiomyopathy and TTS.","Madias, John E.",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8347171/,685

This raises an additional challenge to the process of exploring and recognizing online opinions. To date, very little work has addressed TUNIZI sentiment analysis due to scarce resources for training an automated system. In this paper, we focus on the Tunisian dialect sentiment analysis used on social media. Most of the previous work used machine learning techniques combined with handcrafted features. More recently, Deep Neural Networks were widely used for this task, especially for the English language. In this paper, we explore the importance of various unsupervised word representations (word2vec, BERT) and we investigate the use of Convolutional Neural Networks and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory. Without using any kind of handcrafted features, our experimental results on two publicly available datasets [18, 19] showed comparable performances to other languages.","Messaoudi, Abir; Haddad, Hatem; Ben HajHmida, Moez; Fourati, Chayma; Ben Hamida, Abderrazak",Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971973/,685

We assessed the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous ustekinumab in patients with anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) refractory CD. METHODS We performed a retrospective observational study, collecting data from the Groupe d'Etude Thérapeutique des Affections Inflammatoires du tube Digestif on 122 consecutive patients with active CD refractory to anti-TNF therapy who received at least 1 subcutaneous injection of ustekinumab from March 2011 to December 2014, in 20 tertiary centers in Europe. Subjects were followed for at least 3 months. The primary outcome was clinical benefit, defined as reductions in symptoms and biochemical markers of CD and complete weaning from steroids, without surgery or immunosuppressant therapies. RESULTS Seventy-nine patients (65%) had a clinical benefit within 3 months of receiving ustekinumab. Concomitant immunosuppressant therapy at study inclusion increased the odds for a clinical benefit from ustekinumab (odds ratio, 5.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-25.77; P = .03). Over a median follow-up period of 9.8 months (interquartile range, 5.3-14.5 months), the cumulative probabilities that patients maintained the clinical benefit for 6 and 12 months after introduction of ustekinumab were 93% and 68%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Almost two-thirds of patients with CD refractory to at least 1 anti-TNF agent receive clinical benefit from ustekinumab therapy, not requiring steroids for up to 12 months afterward. While awaiting results from ongoing trials, ustekinumab can be considered for use in these patients.","Wils, Pauline; Bouhnik, Yoram; Michetti, Pierre; Flourie, Bernard; Brixi, Hedia; Bourrier, Anne; Allez, Matthieu; Duclos, Bernard; Grimaud, Jean-Charles; Buisson, Anthony; Amiot, Aurélien; Fumery, Mathurin; Roblin, Xavier; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Filippi, Jérôme; Bouguen, Guillaume; Abitbol, Vered; Coffin, Benoit; Simon, Marion; Laharie, David; Pariente, Benjamin",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2015.09.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26432476/,685
62115,[COVID-19 and micronutrients to regulate the immune response].,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Enteral immunomodulatory nutrition is recommended as an adjuvant therapy for patients in intensive care units (ICU), but its effectiveness is incompletely understood. AIM The aim of this review was to examine the effect of a commonly used immunomodulatory formula-omega-3 fatty acids, γ-linolenic acid, and antioxidants-on clinical outcomes and mortality risk in critically ill patients. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHOD PubMed, Scopus, and Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge databases were searched until 18 February 2021. RCTs that used the immunomodulatory formula in the ICU were included. RESULTS Ten RCTs (1166 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. The immunomodulatory formula reduced the duration of ICU stay weighted mean difference [(WMD): -2.97 days; 95%CI: -5.59, -0.35)], mechanical ventilation (WMD = -2.20 days, 95%CI: -4.29, -0.10), sequential organ failure assessment and multiple organ dysfunction scores (Hedge's g: -0.42 U/L; 95% CI: -0.74, -0.11), decreased 8-day overall mortality risk (RR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.91), and extended the ICU-free days (WMD: 4.06 days, 95% CI: 0.02, 8.09). The improvement in respiratory function and reduction in mortality risk was more in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Furthermore, the reduction in mechanical ventilation and mortality risk was more evident in older (>60 years) vs young adults. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Taken together, the immunomodulatory formula may enhance clinical practice for critical care nurses, such that the prevalence and/or susceptibility to secondary conditions commonly encountered in the ICU (ie, ALI and ARDS) could be attenuated, ultimately allowing critical care nurses to focus their care on the primary reason for which a patient is in the ICU.

72995,'Health for All by All' during a pandemic: 'Protect Everyone' and 'Keep the Promise' of Universal Health Coverage in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.,2020-12-09,"OBJECTIVE To determine whether the manner of consent, i.e., informed consent by patients themselves or informed consent by proxy, affects clinical characteristics of samples of acute stroke patients enrolled in clinical trials. METHODS We analyzed the manner of obtaining informed consent in the first 1,005 patients from WAKE-UP, an investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of MRI-based thrombolysis in stroke patients with unknown time of symptom onset running in 6 European countries. Patients providing informed consent by themselves were compared with patients enrolled by proxy consent. Baseline clinical measures were compared between groups. RESULTS In 359 (35.7%) patients, informed consent was by proxy. Patients with proxy consent were older (median 71 vs 66 years, p < 0.0001) and had a higher frequency of arterial hypertension (58.2% vs 43.4%, p < 0.0001). They showed higher scores on the NIH Stroke Scale (median 11 vs 5, p < 0.0001) and more frequently aphasia (73.7% vs 20.0%, p < 0.0001). The rate of proxy consent varied among countries (p < 0.0001), ranging from 77.1% in Spain to 1.2% in Denmark. CONCLUSIONS Patients recruited by proxy consent were older, had more severe strokes, and had higher prevalence of aphasia than those with capacity to give personal consent.

76083,[COVID-19-related respiratory distress in emergency departments: reality and perspectives.],2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND There are increasing concerns that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic will disproportionately affect socioeconomically disadvantaged children. However, there lacks empirical evidence on socioeconomic inequalities in child mental health and associated factors. METHODS We conducted a population-based online survey in 21,526 children in China, when children were confined at home for nearly two months during the pandemic. We assessed child mental health problems with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Parental education level and provincial gross domestic product (GDP) per capita were treated as proxies for individual- and population-level socioeconomic status (SES), respectively. Lifestyle and family environment factors included sleep disturbances, physical activity, screen time, primary caregiver, parental mental health, and harsh parenting. RESULTS Of the children, 32.31% demonstrated mental health problems. Parental education from the highest (undergraduate and above) to the lowest (middle school and below) increased the adjusted odds ratio(aOR) for child mental health problems by 42% (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.29-1.57); provincial GDP per capita (RMB) from the highest (>¥100K) to the lowest (≤¥70K) increased aOR by 41% (aOR, 1.41; 95% CI%, 1.28-1.55). Sleep disturbances, physical activity <1 h/day, media exposure ≥2 h/day, non-parental care, poor parental mental health, and harsh parenting were independently associated with increased child mental health problems, regardless of SES. LIMITATIONS The potential sampling bias, subjective measures, and the cross-sectional design are the main limitations. CONCLUSION The first evidence from China suggests socioeconomic inequality in child mental health during the pandemic. As unhealthy lifestyle and unfavorable family environment are contributory factors, prioritized interventions are needed to reduce socioeconomic inequality in child mental health problems.","Li, Wen; Wang, Zijing; Wang, Guanghai; Ip, Patrick; Sun, Xiaoning; Jiang, Yanrui; Jiang, Fan",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33761325/,685

OBJECTIVE To unravel the most challenging aspects of COVID-19 in a nonclinical adult population and identify predictors of lost balance and consequent allostatic overload (AO). We examined the role of regular, moderate-intensity formula aerobic exercise (312 meridian exercise) in preventing allostatic overload through increasing well-being. METHODS An online survey was conducted to measure CO-VID-related allostatic overload according to clinimetric criteria. The Psychosocial Index (PSI), Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (KSQ), short Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), Public Health Surveillance Well-Being Scale -(PHS-WB), and Whiteley-7 were used to explore mental health characteristics. Univariate statistics logistic regression analysis and a general linear model were used. RESULTS According to 442 valid answers, 217 adults practiced physical exercise (PE) frequently (fPE, 3-5 times/every day) while 120 did it less regularly (1-2 times/week), and 105 did not exercise/practiced irregularly (controls). Restriction-related stressors were most challenging, resulting in AO in 29% (n = 128) of the sample. The main predictors were additional stressors (p = 0.005) and anxiety symptoms (p < 0.001). The prevalence of AO was lower (p = 0.018) in the fPE group when compared to controls. KSQ distress symptoms were also lower in fPE (p < 0.0001), while total well-being was increased (p < 0.001) after adjusting for sex, age, and number of chronic diseases. According to the PHS-WB, both physical and mental well-being were higher (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively) in fPE. CONCLUSIONS Frequent moderate exercise is associated with better mental and physical well-being and a lower prevalence of AO.","Eöry, Ajandek; Békési, Dora; Eöry, Ajandok; Rózsa, Sandor",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,https://doi.org/10.1159/000514331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33691321/,685

Postoperative digestive morbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophageal stricture are common. The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of and potential risk factors for digestive morbidities after EA/TEF repair. We retrospectively reviewed all EA/TEF patients who underwent repair at a single institution between January 1999 and December 2018, excluding patients who died prior to discharge. Patient demographics, perioperative management, and postoperative GERD and esophageal stricture rates were collected. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to examine risk factors associated with postoperative GERD and esophageal stricture. The study enrolled 58 infants (58.6% male, 17.2% with type A EA/TEF, 62.1% with associated anomalies). Postoperative GERD occurred in 67.2% of patients and was the most common digestive morbidity. Esophageal stricture occurred in 37.9% of patients after EA/TEF repair. Multivariate analysis showed that long-gap EA/TEF and postoperative GERD were independent risk factors for esophageal stricture after repair surgery.Conclusion: The incidence of postoperative GERD and esophageal stricture was 67.2% and 37.9%, respectively. The risk factors for postoperative esophageal stricture were long-gap EA/TEF and postoperative GERD. What is Known: • EA/TEF is a congenital digestive tract anomaly with a high postoperative survival rate but can be complicated by many long-term morbidities. What is New: • Long-gap EA/TEF and postoperative GERD are risk factors of anastomotic stricture after repair. • Surgeons and pediatricians should be highly experienced in managing anastomotic tension and the GERD.","Lu, Yi-Hsuan; Yen, Ting-An; Chen, Chien-Yi; Tsao, Po-Nien; Lin, Wen-Hsi; Hsu, Wen-Ming; Chou, Hung-Chieh",European journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-020-03733-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648144/,685

111808,Efforts to deploy COVID-19 vaccine in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region within the first 100 days of 2021.,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND Joint hypermobility in athletes is associated with increased risk of knee injuries, but its role in relation to shoulder injuries has not been scrutinized. Therefore, our aim was to synthesize the evidence on the association between joint hypermobility and shoulder injuries in athletes. METHODS Data sources were MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and SPORTDiscus from inception to 27th February 2021. Eligibility criteria were observational studies of athletes (including military personnel), mean age ≥ 16 years, and with a transparent grouping of those with and without joint hypermobility. A broad definition of joint hypermobility as the exposure was accepted (i.e., generalised joint hypermobility (GJH), shoulder joint hypermobility including joint instability). Shoulder injuries included acute and overuse injuries, and self-reported pain was accepted as a proxy for shoulder injuries. The Odds Ratios (OR) for having shoulder injuries in exposed compared with non-exposed athletes were estimated using a random effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the effect of sex, activity type, sports level, study type, risk of bias, and exposure definition. Risk of bias and the overall quality of evidence were assessed using, respectively, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS Among 6207 records, six studies were included with 2335 (range 118-718) participants (34.1% females; athlete mean age 19.9 years). Athletes with joint hypermobility were more likely to have shoulder injuries compared with athletes without joint hypermobility (OR = 3.25, 95% CI 1.64, 6.43, I2 = 75.3%; p = 0.001). Exposure definition (GJH, OR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.32, 2.94; shoulder joint hypermobility, OR = 8.23, 95% CI 3.63, 18.66; p = 0.002) and risk of bias (low, OR = 5.25, 95% CI 2.56, 10.8; high, OR = 1.6, 95% CI 0.78, 3.29; p = 0.024) had large impacts on estimates, while the remaining subgroup analyses showed no differences. The overall quality of evidence was low. CONCLUSION Joint hypermobility in athletes is associated with a threefold higher odds of having shoulder injuries, highlighting the need for prevention strategies in this population. However, due to low quality of evidence, future research will likely change the estimated strength of the association.

Only 187 urine samples have been reported to have been tested in the literature to date despite over 4 million cases of respiratory Covid 19 positive cases being reported worldwide. Of these 187 urine tests 6 were positive for the virus and this persisted in urine in once case for up to 42 days. The urine sample was still positive for Covid 19 despite respiratory swabs being negative. There is a potential concern therefore that Endourologists who generally perform a high number of urine prone procedures could be at risk of exposure to the virus peri operatively. There is still confusion as to the type of PPE Endourologists should use and in what circumstances.

We undertook a prospective cohort study to look into the seizure patterns and incidence of recurrence in association with two of the most common causes of RELs after gradually stopping AEDs at least 18 months after acheiving seizure control. METHODS Ninety patients with neurocysticercosis (NCC) and twenty-nine patients with tuberculoma were treated with anti-helminthic and anti-tubercular drugs according to current recommended guidelines, and followed up for a minimum of 2 years after the last seizure free day. In every patient included in the study, AEDs were tapered within six months of attaining a seizure-free interval of 18 months. We looked at the incidence of recurrent seizures after stopping AEDs in both groups of patients. RESULTS The frequency of baseline seizures (2.1 vs 1.5 per year, p < 0.001) and number of antiepileptic drugs (2.12 vs 1.48, p < 0.001) were greater in patients with NCC than those with tuberculoma. Patients with NCC had a greater incidence of recurrent seizures (1.17 vs 0.07 in the next six months, p < 0.001) after stopping the AEDs. The median interval to seizure recurrence after stopping AEDs was 2.2 months in patients with NCC. CONCLUSIONS Among RELs, NCC lesions have a greater epileptogenic potential than tuberculomas. AEDs can be tapered in patients with tuberculoma after a seizure free period of 18 months with a very low risk of recurrence.","Pradhan, Sunil; Das, Animesh; Mulmuley, Madhura; Das, Ananya",Seizure,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seizure.2020.03.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32278296/,685

A 57-year-old Japanese woman with no preoperative comorbidity was diagnosed with early gastric cancer. The patient underwent LADG using the pneumoperitoneum method. During surgery, the patient was unintentionally subjected to single-lung ventilation for approximately 247 minutes due to intratracheal tube dislocation. One hour after surgery, she developed severe dyspnea and produced a large amount of pink frothy sputum. Chest radiography results showed diffuse ground-glass attenuation and alveolar consolidation in both lungs without cardiomegaly. A diagnosis of pulmonary edema was made, and the patient was immediately intubated and received ventilatory support with high positive end-expiratory pressure. The patient gradually recovered and was weaned from the ventilatory support on the third postoperative day. This case shows that single-lung ventilation may be a risk factor for reexpansion pulmonary edema during laparoscopic surgery with pneumoperitoneum.","Yajima, Kazuhito; Kanda, Tatsuo; Tanaka, Ryo; Sato, Yu; Ishikawa, Takashi; Kosugi, Shin-Ichi; Honda, Tadayuki; Hatakeyama, Katsuyoshi",Case reports in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/863163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23227412/,685

Autonomic nervous system dysfunction is often present. This study evaluated the cardiac sympathetic function in patients with SCA2 using (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) in comparison with patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and control subjects. METHODS Nine patients with SCA2, nine patients with PD, and nine control subjects underwent (123)I-MIBG imaging studies from which early and late heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratios and myocardial washout rates were calculated. RESULTS Early (F = 12.3, p < 0.0001) and late (F = 16.8, p < 0.0001) H/M ratios were significantly different among groups. In controls, early and late H/M ratios (2.2 ± 0.12 and 2.1 ± 0.20) were significantly higher than in patients with SCA2 (1.9 ± 0.23 and 1.8 ± 0.20, both p < 0.05) and with patients with PD (1.7 ± 0.29 and 1.4 ± 0.35, both p < 0.001). There was also a significant difference in washout rates among groups (F = 11.7, p < 0.0001). In controls the washout rate (19.9 ± 9.6%) was significantly lower (p < 0.005) than in patients with PD (51.0 ± 23.7%), but not different from that in SCA2 patients (19.5 ± 9.4%). In SCA2 patients, in a multivariable linear regression analysis only the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score was independently associated with early H/M ratio (β = -0.12, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy demonstrated an impairment of cardiac sympathetic function in patients with SCA2, which was less marked than in PD patients. These results suggest that (123)I-MIBG cardiac imaging could become a useful tool for analysing the pathophysiology of SCA2.","De Rosa, Anna; Pappatà, Sabina; Pellegrino, Teresa; De Leva, Maria Fulvia; Maddaluno, Gennaro; Fiumara, Giovanni; Carotenuto, Raffaella; Petretta, Mario; Filla, Alessandro; De Michele, Giuseppe; Cuocolo, Alberto",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-013-2524-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23929432/,685

We investigated the clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 in patients <5 years of age during a recent coronavirus season. METHODS Respiratory viruses were detected using a multiplex molecular assay at St. Louis Children`s Hospital starting in November 2012. We analyzed demographic and clinical data from all patients <5 years of age with solo detection of HCoV-OC43 (n = 52) and HCoV-NL63 (n = 44) and for comparison, samples of children with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and picornaviruses. RESULTS During the study period, HCoV-OC43 (4%) was the 5th and HCoV-NL63 the 8th (2%) most common respiratory virus. Coinfections were detected in 35% and 38% of children with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63, respectively. Croup was more common with HCoV-NL63 (30%) than with HCoV-OC43 (2%). Lower respiratory tract infection occurred in 33% of children with HCoV-OC43 and 25% of children with HCoV-NL63. Severe illness was less common in HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and parainfluenza virus (14%, each) compared with respiratory syncytial virus (30%) and picornaviruses (26%; P = 0.055 for HCoVs combined compared with the other respiratory viruses) and occurred mainly in those with underlying medical conditions. CONCLUSIONS Infections caused by HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 are common and include some with lower respiratory tract involvement and severe disease, especially in children with underlying medical conditions.

Yet, literature is still scarce on the epidemiology of HIV-TB co-infection among migrants. In this study, we characterized native and migrant HIV patients followed in Portuguese hospitals who were diagnosed with TB, regarding their sociodemographic, clinical and genomic characteristics. Among 67 patients with HIV and TB diagnoses, there were 24 migrants, most from sub-Saharan Africa. Most patients had CD4+ T cell counts below 350 cells/µL, and were diagnosed simultaneously for HIV and TB. When compared to natives, migrants presented a higher proportion of non-B HIV-1 infections. Patients infected with these non-B HIV-1 strains presented higher viral loads, which can have an important impact for the transmissibility and pathogenicity of both diseases. Future studies should investigate different HIV strains and consequences for TB and HIV transmission and disease outcomes, especially among vulnerable populations.","Tavares, Ana; Pingarilho, Marta; Batista, Judite; Viveiros, Miguel; Dias, Sónia; Toscano, Cristina; Gomes, Perpétua; Abecasis, Ana B",AIDS research and human retroviruses,https://doi.org/10.1089/aid.2020.0119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962419/,685

Supplementary percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may be useful in these patients. Aim To assess the safety of the stenting procedure in the proximal oesophagus in patients with unresectable upper oesophageal cancer, performed simultaneously with PEG insertion. Material and methods Patients with obstructing upper oesophageal tumours were scheduled for an oesophageal stenting procedure and simultaneous PEG insertion. Degree of dysphagia, body weight loss, daily energy requirement, body mass index and performance status before and after the stenting procedure as well as complications were assessed. Results Forty-five patients aged 19-88 years were included in the study. Six of them had a fistula to the trachea and underwent stenting of the oesophagus or both the oesophagus and the airway. The technical success rate was 100%. Following the procedure all patients were able to swallow fluids and semi-liquids, and PEG was used as the primary feeding route. Body mass index increased from 20.4 to 21.1 (p = 0.0001), body weight gain improved from -10.1 to +2.0 kg and metabolic requirements improved (p = 0.0001).

Patients and Methods Intra- and post-operative outcomes for MALTA were assessed in seven consecutive patients with a preoperative diagnosis of Siewert type II AEG at Hokkaido University Hospital. Results None of the patients were converted to open surgery. The mean surgical duration was 434.0 ± 71.4 min, and mean blood loss was 20.7 ± 16.7 ml. On pathological examination, the median proximal margin was 24.6 ± 12.5 mm. No reoperations were needed, and there were no surgery-related complications. Conclusions This novel technique shows considerable advantages, such as ensuring the proximal margin, intrathoracic oesophagojejunostomy and increased operative field exposure of the lower mediastinal area for Siewert type II AEG.","Ebihara, Yuma; Kurashima, Yo; Murakami, Soichi; Shichinohe, Toshiaki; Hirano, Satoshi",Journal of minimal access surgery,https://doi.org/10.4103/jmas.jmas_228_17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30178772/,685

The present study is a first step toward improved understanding of infectious diseases in the species' home regions. Serum samples obtained from 73 red pandas in 10 captive facilities in southwest, east, and northeast China from October to December 2004 were tested for antibodies against nine common infectious pathogens of carnivores. Antibody titers against canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), and canine adenovirus (CAV) in the three facilities in which red pandas were vaccinated were highly variable. The CAV titer in one vaccinated red panda was high enough to suggest infection with the field virus following vaccination. Together with anecdotal reports of vaccine-associated morbidity and mortality, our results suggest that the Chinese vaccine is not suitable for this species. In the seven unvaccinated groups, CDV titers were low and occurred in 20-100% of the animals; antibody titers against CPV were found in seven of eight areas. Only one of 61 and two of 61 unvaccinated red pandas had CAV and canine coronavirus titers, respectively, and these titers were all low. Positive titers to Toxoplasma gondii were found in four locations (33-94% seropositive); the titers in 52% of seropositive individuals were of a magnitude consistent with active disease in other species (1:1,024 to > or = 1:4,096). One red panda in each of three locations was seropositive for Neospora caninum. Antibodies against canine herpesvirus and Brucella canis were not detected in any of the samples. Only one of the 73 red pandas had a weak positive influenza A titer. The results of this study emphasize the need for research on and protection against infectious diseases of red pandas and other endangered species in China.","Qin, Qin; Wei, Fuwen; Li, Ming; Dubovi, Edward J; Loeffler, I Kati",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17469274/,685

This article summarizes subsisting strategies that can be implemented immediately. Pre-emptive weekly multicenter projections of CKRT demand based on evolving COVID-19 epidemiology and routine workload should be made. Corresponding consumables should be quantified and acquired, with diversification of sources from multiple vendors. Supply procurement should be stepped up accordingly so that a several-week stock is amassed, with administrative oversight to prevent disproportionate hoarding by institutions. Consumption of CKRT resources can be made more efficient by optimizing circuit anticoagulation to preserve filters, extending use of each vascular access, lowering blood flows to reduce citrate consumption, moderating the CKRT intensity to conserve fluids, or running accelerated KRT at higher clearance to treat more patients per machine. If logistically feasible, earlier transition to intermittent hemodialysis with online-generated dialysate, or urgent peritoneal dialysis in selected patients, may help reduce CKRT dependency. These measures, coupled to multicenter collaboration and a corresponding increase in trained medical and nursing staffing levels, may avoid downstream rationing of care and save lives during the peak of the pandemic.","Chua, Horng-Ruey; MacLaren, Graeme; Choong, Lina Hui-Lin; Chionh, Chang-Yin; Khoo, Benjamin Zhi En; Yeo, See-Cheng; Sewa, Duu-Wen; Ng, Shin-Yi; Choo, Jason Chon-Jun; Teo, Boon-Wee; Tan, Han-Khim; Siow, Wen-Ting; Agrawal, Rohit Vijay; Tan, Chieh-Suai; Vathsala, Anantharaman; Tagore, Rajat; Seow, Terina Ying-Ying; Khatri, Priyanka; Hong, Wei-Zhen; Kaushik, Manish",Am J Kidney Dis,,685

As approximately one-third of the world´s population is living under ""lockdown"" conditions, medical resources are being reallocated and hospital admissions are limited to emergencies. We examined the decision-making impact of these actions and their effects on access to hospital treatment in patients with neurosurgical conditions. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzes hospital admissions of two major neurosurgical services in Germany during the nationwide lockdown period (March 16th to April 16th, 2020). Spinal or cranial conditions requiring immediate hospital admission and treatment constituted emergencies. RESULTS: A total of 243 in-patients were treated between March 16th and April 16th 2020 (122 patients at the University Medical Center Mainz, 121 patients at the University Medical Center Göttingen). Of these, 38.0±16% qualified as emergency admission. Another 1,688 admissions were reviewed during the same periods in 2018 and 2019, providing a frame of reference. Overall, emergency admissions declined by 44.7±0.7% during lockdown. Admissions for cranial emergencies fell by 48.1±4.44%, spinal emergencies by 30.9±14.6%. CONCLUSION: Above findings indicate that in addition to postponing elective procedures, emergency admissions were dramatically curtailed during the COVID-19 lockdown. As this surely is unexpected and unintended, reasons are undoubtedly complex. As consequences in morbidity and mortality are still unpredictable, efforts should be made to accommodate all patients in need of hospital access going forward.","Krenzlin, Harald; Bettag, Christoph; Rohde, Veit; Ringel, Florian; Keric, Naureen",PLoS One,,685

Methods: We followed 94% of all COVID-19 cases diagnosed in the Australian state of New South Wales between January and May 2020 using 3-4 weekly telephone interviews and linkage to hospitalisation and death data to determine if they had recovered from COVID-19 based on symptom resolution. Proportional hazards models with competing risks were used to estimate time to recovery adjusted for age and gender. Findings: In analyses 2904 cases were followed for recovery (median follow-up time 16 days, range 1-122, IQR 11-24).There were 2572 (88.6%) who reported resolution of symptoms (262/2572 were also hospitalised), 224 (7.8%) had not recovered at last contact (28/224 were also hospitalised), 51 (1.8%) died of COVID-19, and 57 (2.0%) were hospitalised without a documented recovery date. Of those followed, 20% recovered by 10 days, 60% at 20, 80% at 30, 91% at 60, 93% at 90 and 96% at 120 days. Compared to those aged 30-49 years, those 0-29 years were more likely to recover (aHR 1.22, 95%CI 1.10-1.34) while those aged 50-69 and 70+ years were less likely to recover (aHR respectively 0.74, 95%CI 0.67-0.81 and 0.63, 95%CI 0.56-0.71).

There are problems, like the presence of biases in the training data, which question the generalization capability of these models. In this work we propose EnD, a regularization strategy whose aim is to prevent deep models from learning unwanted biases. In particular, we insert an""information bottleneck""at a certain point of the deep neural network, where we disentangle the information about the bias, still letting the useful information for the training task forward-propagating in the rest of the model. One big advantage of EnD is that we do not require additional training complexity (like decoders or extra layers in the model), since it is a regularizer directly applied on the trained model. Our experiments show that EnD effectively improves the generalization on unbiased test sets, and it can be effectively applied on real-case scenarios, like removing hidden biases in the COVID-19 detection from radiographic images.","Tartaglione, Enzo; Barbano, Carlo Alberto; Grangetto, Marco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02023v1.pdf,685

Methods We conducted a combined assessment of the changes in neutralising antibody levels and SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses over time in 27 patients up to 7 months after infection. Results The neutralising antibody remained detectable in 96.3% of the patients at their second visit at about 7 months post-onset of symptoms. However, their humoral responses, including titres of the spike receptor-binding domain IgG and neutralising antibody, decreased significantly compared with those at first clinic visit. By contrast, the proportions of spike-specific CD4+ T cells, but not CD8+ T cells, in COVID-19 patients after recovery were persistently higher than those in healthy controls. No significant change was observed in the proportion of spike-specific CD4+ T cells in patients who had recovered from COVID-19 within 7 months. Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immune responses persisted, while the neutralising antibodies decayed. Further studies are needed to extend the longevity of neutralising antibodies and to evaluate whether these T cells are sufficient to protect patients from reinfection.","Chen, Jun Liu Xiaomin Zhang Xinyu Lin Yixiao Liu Danping Xun Jingna Wang Zhenyan Gu Ling Li Qian Yin Dan Yang Junyang Lu Hongzhou",Clinical &amp; Translational Immunology,,685
440858,Eastern Cape Healthcare Workers Acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 (ECHAS): Cross-Sectional (Nested Cohort) Study Protocol,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation are under-detected and under-reported. The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe out-ofhospital emergency care providers' experiences of identifying elder abuse. METHODS: Individual theme interviews were conducted with nine prehospital emergency care providers and three community paramedics in spring 2019. The transcribed data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Although the short duration of care contacts made the identification of elder abuse challenging, the emergency care providers detected indicators of physical, psychological and social abuse, unethical action, material exploitation, and self-neglect/self-abuse. The professionals based their observations on patient and family interviews, on clues in the home environment, on caregiving quality combined with the patient's medical history, and on physical signs, which were the easiest to identify. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The identification of elder abuse may be improved by multiprofessional collaboration, by increased attention given to risk groups and common indicators of abuse, and by adoption or creation of screening tools to assist detection and reporting. Training on the detection of elder abuse should be included in nursing and social work curricula and in the continuing professional development of emergency care providers.","Salminen-Tuomaala, Mari; Tiainen, Juha; Mikkola, Riitta; Paavilainen, Eija",Res. theory nurs. pract.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Does short term exposure to ambient air pollution influence COVID-19 related mortality? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: Using time series analyses we tested the association between daily changes in air pollution measured by stationary monitors in and around Santiago, Chile and deaths from laboratory confirmed or suspected COVID-19 between March 16 and August 31, 2020. Results were adjusted for temporal trends, temperature and humidity, and stratified by age and sex. RESULTS: There were 10,069 COVID-19 related deaths of which 7659 were laboratory confirmed. Using distributed lags, the cumulative relative risk (RR) (95% CI) of mortality for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in CO, NO2 and PM2.5 were 1.061 (1.033-1.089), 1.067 (1.023-1.103) and 1.058 (1.034-1.082), respectively There were no significant differences in RR by sex.. In those at least 85 years old, an IQR increase in NO2 was associated with a 12.7% (95% CI 4.2-22.2) increase in daily mortality. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that daily increases in air pollution increase the risk of dying from COVID-19, especially in the elderly.","Dales, Robert; Blanco-Vidal, Claudia; Romero-Meza, Rafael; Schoen, Stephanie; Lukina, Anna; Cakmak, Sabit",Environ Res,,685
477015,[Eating better to improve resistance to sars-Cov-2],2020,"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has been presented as politically independent, asserting it is free from industry influence and conflicts of interest so that its decisions may be led by evidence and science. We consider the ways in which soft political factors operate in guideline development processes at NICE such that guidelines are not truly led by science. We suggest that while NICE procedures explicitly incorporate scientific principles and mechanisms, including independent committees and quality assurance, these fail to operate as scientific practices because, for example, decisions may only be challenged through the courts, which regard NICE as a scientific authority. We then examine what the NICE rapid guideline procedure for COVID-19 reveals about the practical reality of claims about the scientific integrity of NICE guidelines. Changes to guideline development processes during the COVID-19 emergency demonstrated how easy it is to undermine the scientific integrity of NICE's decision-making. The cancellation of the guideline programme and the publication of a rapid guideline process specifically to address the COVID-19 pandemic removed scientific checks and balances, including independent committees, stakeholder consultation and quality assurance, demonstrating that the relationship between NICE and the UK government is more complex than a scientific principle truism. We suggest that NICE is not (and indeed cannot be) truly independent of government in practice, nor can it be truly led by science, in part because of its relationship to the state, which it is simultaneously constituted by and constitutive of.","McPherson, S J; Speed, Ewen",BMJ Evid.

In this article, the binding interface was obtained by analyzing the interaction modes between 2019-nCoV coronavirus and the human specific target protein ACE2. Based on the ""SIFT server"" and the ""bubble"" identification mechanism, 9 amino acid sites were selected as potential mutation-sites from the 2019-nCoV-S1-ACE2 binding interface. Subsequently, one total number of 171 mutant systems for 9 mutation-sites were optimized for binding-pattern comparsion analysis, and 14 mutations that may improve the binding capacity of 2019-nCoV-S1 to ACE2 were selected. The Molecular Dynamic Simulations were conducted to calculate the binding free energies of all 14 mutant systems. Finally, we found that most of the 14 mutations on the 2019-nCoV-S1 protein could enhance the binding ability between the 2019-nCoV coronavirus and the human protein ACE2. Among which, the binding capacities for G446R, Y449R and F486Y mutations could be increased by 20%, and that for S494R mutant increased even by 38.98%.

AimTo assess the level of fear of COVID-19 among nurses in mobile COVID-19 testing units and compare it with demographic characteristics. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted during November and December 2020. Study population included 57 nurses working in mobile COVID-19 testing units in Attica, Greece. We collected demographic data from the nurses, i.e. gender, age, marital status, children, living status (alone or with others), clinical experience, and chronic disease. We used the fear of COVID-19 scale to measure fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. ResultsThe mean score on the fear of COVID-19 scale was 14.3. Among nurses, 31.6% experienced elevated fear indicative of presence of anxiety symptoms, while the respective percentages for health anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptomatology were 22.8% and 17.5%. Fear of COVID-19 was not affected by demographic variables. However, fear was higher in females, nurses who had children and nurses who lived with others. Increased clinical experience was related with decreased fear. ConclusionsCreating a secure work environment for nurses in these units could decrease fear of COVID-19 and increase work performance.","Galanis, Petros A; Petrogianni, Emmanouela; Vraka, Irene; Konstantakopoulou, Olympia; Siskou, Olga; Bilali, Angeliki; Kaitelidou, Daphne",,,685

The purpose was to assess and triage potential COVID-19 symptoms and to reduce the number of calls to public health-care helplines. The device was used almost 150,000 times in a few weeks and was described by politicians and administrators as a solution and success. However, high usage cannot serve as the sole criterion of success. What might be adequate criteria? And should digital triage for citizens by default be considered low risk? METHODS: This paper reflects on the uncertain aspects of the performance, risks and issues of accountability pertaining to the digital diagnostic device in order to draw lessons for future improvements. The analysis is based on the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM), the EU and US regulations of medical devices and the taxonomy of uncertainty in health care by Han et al. RESULTS: Lessons for future digital devices are (a) the need for clear criteria of success, (b) the importance of awareness of other severe diseases when triaging, (c) the priority of designing the device to collect data for evaluation and (d) clear allocation of responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS: A device meant to substitute triage for citizens according to its own criteria of success should not by default be considered as low risk. In a pandemic age dependent on digitalisation, it is therefore important not to abandon the ethos of EBM, but instead to prepare the ground for new ways of building evidence of effect.","Haase, Christoffer Bjerre; Bearman, Margaret; Brodersen, John; Hoeyer, Klaus; Risor, Torsten",Scand J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33339468/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1403494820980268,685

Spinal surgery is unique in that the procedures include not only fully elective and fully emergent interventions, but also involve a separate group of semi-emergent surgeries, where delayed intervention may lead to permanent neurological deficits. Here, we present an evidence-based review on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on spinal surgery and our current knowledge about this issue. We conducted a thorough search of the PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases using the keywords, “COVID-19,” “COVID-19 impact on spine surgery,” “coronavirus impact on spine surgery,” “COVID-19 impact on neurosurgery,” “coronavirus impact on neurosurgery,” “COVID-19 impact on spine surgeons,” and “coronavirus impact on spine surgeons” on May 6, 2020. A total of 8,322 articles were identified in the initial search. Articles that were duplicated, those that did not pertain to COVID-19 or spine surgeries, those with details not pertaining to the current topic of interest, and those published in languages other than English were excluded from our analyses. After complete screening, six articles were included in this review. During the previous few weeks, the COVID pandemic has significantly influenced all major aspects of spine surgery across the world. Outpatient care has been gradually shifted from physical visits to tele-health and online consultations. General recommendations have favored the conservative approach over surgeries, although no patient should be deprived of standard care owing to concerns about COVID. The general principles followed by spine surgeons should include early detection of COVID symptomatology; triaging of patients based on underlying spinal pathology; prescription of appropriate investigations to confirm the COVID status; isolation, as needed; selection of optimal management method as per the guidelines; adherence to best intraoperative practices; and ensuring protective measures for non-infected patients, family members, fellow heath care providers, and themselves against the disease.","Viswanathan, Vibhu Krishnan; Subramanian, Surabhi; Rao, Arthi K.",Asian Spine J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32493004/; https://doi.org/10.31616/asj.2020.0248,685

To increase the consumption, its processing, and its transformation into new products would help spread them to the consumer’s table. In this study, after giving an overview of the physicochemical characteristics and the antioxidant activity, the objective was to optimize the osmotic dehydration (OD) of the berries. Response surface methodology was used to investigate the effect of dehydration factors: syrup concentration (30–70%), temperature (20–70 °C), and fruit-to-syrup ratio (1:10–2:10) on the water loss (WL), sugar gain (SG), weight reduction (WR), density (ρ), water activity (a(w)), and total color change (ΔE) of fruits after 10 h of OD. Results obtained by employing Box–Behnken design (three variables, three levels), and significant terms of regression equations indicated that the syrup concentration and temperature variation are the most affecting factors on the previously mentioned independent variables (WL SG, WR, ρ, a(w), and ΔE).
