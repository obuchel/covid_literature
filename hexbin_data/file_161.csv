355,Successful treatment of HIV-associated multicentric Castleman's disease and multiple organ failure with rituximab and supportive care: a case report,2010-01-30,"INTRODUCTION: Multicentric Castleman's Disease (MCD), a lymphoproliferative disorder associated with Human Herpes Virus-8 (HHV-8) infection, is increasing in incidence amongst HIV patients. This condition is associated with lymphadenopathy, polyclonal gammopathy, hepato-splenomegaly and systemic symptoms. A number of small studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, in treating this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 46 year old Zambian woman who presented with pyrexia, diarrhoea and vomiting, confusion, lymphadenopathy, and renal failure. She rapidly developed multiple organ failure following the initiation of treatment of MCD with rituximab. Following admission to intensive care (ICU), she received prompt multi-organ support. After 21 days on the ICU she returned to the haematology medical ward, and was discharged in remission from her disease after 149 days in hospital. CONCLUSION: Rituximab, the efficacy of which has thus far been examined predominantly in patients outside the ICU, in conjunction with extensive organ support was effective treatment for MCD with associated multiple organ failure. There is, to our knowledge, only one other published report of its successful use in an ICU setting, where it was combined with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and prednisolone. Reports such as ours support the notion that critically unwell patients with HIV and haematological disease can benefit from intensive care.","Johns, Robin H; Doyle, Tomas; Lipman, Marc C; Cwynarski, Kate; Cleverley, Joanne R; Isaacson, Peter G; Shaw, Steve; Agarwal, Banwari",J Med Case Reports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2825517/,161
446,Diagnostic value of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 and C-reactive protein for patients with lung infiltrates: an observational study,2010-09-29,"BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis of patients with lung infiltrates remains a challenge. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 is a neutrophil and monocyte receptor up-regulated during infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of TREM-1 and of C-reactive protein (CRP) from patients with lung infiltrates to discern community acquired lung infections. METHODS: 68 patients admitted to a medical ward with acute respiratory illness were enrolled in the study. Neutrophil and monocyte TREM-1 expression were measured by flow cytometry, sTREM-1 by an enzyme immunoassay and C-reactive protein by nephelometry. Clinical pulmonary infection score was recorded. RESULTS: 34 patients were diagnosed with bacterial community acquired pneumonia (group A) and 34 with non-bacterial pulmonary disease (group B). Median serum TREM-1 concentration was 102.09 pg/ml in group A and lower than 15.10 pg/ml (p < 0.0001) in group B. Mean±SE neutrophil TREM-1 expression was 4.67 ± 0.53 MFI in group A and 2.64 ± 0.25 MFI (p = 0.001) in group B. Monocyte TREM-1 expression was 4.2 ± 0.42 MFI in group A and 2.64 ± 0.35 MFI (p = 0.007) in group B and mean±SE CRP was 18.03 ± 2 mg/ml in group A and 7.1 ± 1.54 mg/ml (p < 0.001) in group B. A cut-off of 19.53 pg/ml of sTREM-1 with sensitivity 82.6% and specificity 63% to discriminate between infectious and non-infectious pulmonary infiltrates was found. sTREM-1 at admission greater than 180 pg/ml was accompanied with unfavourable outcome. CONCLUSION: TREM-1 myeloid expression and sTREM-1 are reliable markers of bacterial infection among patients with pulmonary infiltrates; sTREM-1 is a predictor of final outcome.","Porfyridis, Ilias; Plachouras, Diamantis; Karagianni, Vasiliki; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Papiris, Spyridon A; Giamarellou, Helen; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2955686/,161
464,Eosinophilic infiltrate in a patient with severe Legionella pneumonia as a levofloxacin-related complication: a case report,2010-11-11,INTRODUCTION: Legionella pneumonia can appear with different levels of severity and it can often present with complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 44-year-old Caucasian man with Legionella pneumonia with successive development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. During his stay in intensive care the clinical and radiological situation of the previously observed acute respiratory distress syndrome unexpectedly worsened due to acute pulmonary eosinophilic infiltrate of iatrogenic origin. CONCLUSION: Levofloxacin treatment caused the occurrence of acute eosinophilic infiltrate. Diagnosis was possible following bronchoscopic examination using bronchoaspirate and transbronchial biopsy.,"Facciolongo, Nicola; Menzella, Francesco; Castagnetti, Claudia; Cavazza, Alberto; Piro, Roberto; Carbonelli, Cristiano; Zucchi, Luigi",J Med Case Reports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2993722/,161
634,Severe influenza cases in paediatric intensive care units in Germany during the pre-pandemic seasons 2005 to 2008,2011-08-31,"BACKGROUND: Data on complications in children with seasonal influenza virus infection are limited. We initiated a nation-wide three-year surveillance of children who were admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with severe seasonal influenza. METHODS: From October 2005 to July 2008, active surveillance was performed using an established reporting system for rare diseases (ESPED) including all paediatric hospitals in Germany. Cases to be reported were hospitalized children < 17 years of age with laboratory-confirmed influenza treated in a PICU or dying in hospital. RESULTS: Twenty severe influenza-associated cases were reported from 14 PICUs during three pre-pandemic influenza seasons (2005-2008). The median age of the patients (12 males/8 females) was 7.5 years (range 0.1-15 years). None had received vaccination against influenza. In 14 (70%) patients, the infection had been caused by influenza A and in five (25%) by influenza B; in one child (5%) the influenza type was not reported. Patients spent a median of 19 (IQR 12-38) days in the hospital and a median of 11 days (IQR 6-18 days) in the PICU; 10 (50%) needed mechanical ventilation. Most frequent diagnoses were influenza-associated pneumonia (60%), bronchitis/bronchiolitis (30%), encephalitis/encephalopathy (25%), secondary bacterial pneumonia (25%), and ARDS (25%). Eleven (55%) children had chronic underlying medical conditions, including 8 (40%) with chronic pulmonary diseases. Two influenza A- associated deaths were reported: i) an 8-year old boy with pneumococcal encephalopathy following influenza infection died from cerebral edema, ii) a 14-year-old boy with asthma bronchiale, cardiac malformation and Addison's disease died from cardiac and respiratory failure. For nine (45%) patients, possibly permanent sequelae were reported (3 neurological, 3 pulmonary, 3 other sequelae). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza-associated pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections are relevant complications of seasonal influenza in Germany. The incidence of severe influenza cases in PICUs was relatively low. This may be either due to the weak to moderate seasonal influenza activity during the years 2005 to 2008 or due to under-diagnosis of influenza by physicians. Fifty% of the observed severe cases might have been prevented by following the recommendations for vaccination of risk groups in Germany.","Streng, Andrea; Grote, Veit; Liese, Johannes G",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175218/,161
1175,Clinical characteristics and antimicrobial susceptibilities of viridans streptococcal bacteremia during febrile neutropenia in patients with hematologic malignancies: a comparison between adults and children,2013-06-17,"BACKGROUND: This study was performed to compare the clinical characteristics and antibiotic susceptibilities of viridans streptococcal bacteremia (VSB) between febrile neutropenic adults and children with hematologic malignancies. METHODS: The consecutive medical records of neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies who were admitted to the Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center between April 2009 and July 2012, and who were subsequently diagnosed with VSB were reviewed retrospectively. A comparison was made between the clinical and laboratory characteristics of adults and pediatric patients and also between patients with cefepime susceptible or not susceptible VSB. RESULTS: A total of 202 episodes (141 in adults, 61 in children) of VSB were identified. Among them, 26 (12.9%) cases had severe complications including four (2.0%) cases of death attributable to VSB. For antibacterial prophylaxis, most adults received ciprofloxacin (97.1%), but children more frequently received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (86.9%). Oral mucositis (p = 0.005) and abdominal pain (p = 0.001) were found more frequently in adults, and cough was found more frequently in children (p = 0.004). The occurrence rates of severe complications and death attributable to VSB were not significantly different between adults and children. Susceptibility rate to cefepime was significantly higher in adults than children (85.7% vs. 66.1%, p = 0.002). However, in multivariate analysis, cefepime susceptibility had no impact on clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in clinical outcome between adults and children with VSB despite a difference in cefepime susceptibility. Hence, different antibiotic treatment strategies may not be necessary.","Han, Seung Beom; Bae, E Young; Lee, Jae Wook; Lee, Dong-Gun; Chung, Nack-Gyun; Jeong, Dae-Chul; Cho, Bin; Kang, Jin Han; Kim, Hack-Ki",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3685537/,161
1181,Herpes zoster encephalitis presenting as multiple cerebral hemorrhages – a rare presentation: a case report,2013-06-18,"INTRODUCTION: An infection by herpes zoster virus is a common and important cause of encephalitis. Herpes zoster virus encephalitis if not treated promptly can result in significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of herpes zoster virus encephalitis is based on clinical history, examination, neuroradiological imaging (magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography scan), cerebrospinal fluid analysis and identification of the pathogen in cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or anti-herpes zoster virus immunoglobulin G antibody in cerebrospinal fluid. Although ischemic intracerebral infarcts in patients with herpes zoster virus encephalitis or vasculopathy are reported in the literature, multiple intracerebral hemorrhages as a complication of herpes zoster virus encephalitis in an immunocompetent individual are extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old Indian man presented with an acute history of four episodes of seizures, fever, headache, drowsiness, focal neurological deficits and vesicular eruptions over the abdomen in a typical dermatomal distribution. His head computed tomography scan revealed multiple cerebral hemorrhages. Investigations (positive ratio between the cerebrospinal fluid/serum quotients for anti-herpes zoster virus immunoglobulin G and total immunoglobulin G antibodies) established its infective origin due to herpes zoster virus. He developed bilateral pneumonia during the hospital course. He had an excellent recovery following a 2 weeks’ course of intravenous acyclovir. CONCLUSION: Herpes zoster virus encephalitis or vasculopathy is a rare cause of multiple intracerebral hemorrhages and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with an acute history of fever, altered consciousness, and focal neurologic deficits with history of a typical herpetic rash. Its prompt recognition and treatment could alter the course of illness.","Saxena, Amrish; Khiangte, Benjamine; Tiewsoh, Iadarilang; Jajoo, Ulhas N",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693903/,161
1316,Incubation periods of viral gastroenteritis: a systematic review,2013-09-25,"BACKGROUND: Accurate knowledge of incubation period is important to investigate and to control infectious diseases and their transmission, however statements of incubation period in the literature are often uncited, inconsistent, and/or not evidence based. METHODS: In a systematic review of the literature on five enteric viruses of public health importance, we found 256 articles with incubation period estimates, including 33 with data for pooled analysis. RESULTS: We fit a log-normal distribution to pooled data and found the median incubation period to be 4.5 days (95% CI 3.9-5.2 days) for astrovirus, 1.2 days (95% CI 1.1-1.2 days) for norovirus genogroups I and II, 1.7 days (95% CI 1.5-1.8 days) for sapovirus, and 2.0 days (95% CI 1.4-2.4 days) for rotavirus. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates combine published data and provide sufficient quantitative detail to allow for these estimates to be used in a wide range of clinical and modeling applications. This can translate into improved prevention and control efforts in settings with transmission or the risk of transmission.","Lee, Rachel M; Lessler, Justin; Lee, Rose A; Rudolph, Kara E; Reich, Nicholas G; Perl, Trish M; Cummings, Derek AT",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3849296/,161
1417,New Perspectives in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) IV: Circulating ACE2 as a Biomarker of Systolic Dysfunction in Human Hypertension and Heart Failure,2014-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence exists for soluble Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (sACE2) as a biomarker in definitive heart failure (HF), but there is little information about changes in sACE2 activity in hypertension with imminent heart failure and in reverse remodeling. METHODS, FINDINGS: Patients with systolic HF (NYHAII-IV, enrolled for cardiac resynchronisation therapy, CRT, n = 100) were compared to hypertensive patients (n = 239) and to a healthy cohort (n = 45) with preserved ejection fraction (EF>50%) in a single center prospective clinical study. The status of the heart failure patients were checked before and after CRT. Biochemical (ACE and sACE2 activity, ACE concentration) and echocardiographic parameters (EF, left ventricular end-diastolic (EDD) and end-systolic diameter (ESD) and dP/dt) were measured. sACE2 activity negatively correlated with EF and positively with ESD and EDD in all patient's populations, while it was independent in the healthy cohort. sACE2 activity was already increased in the hypertensive group, where signs for imminent heart failure (slightly decreased EF and barely increased NT-proBNP levels) were detected. sACE2 activities further increased in patients with definitive heart failure (EF<50%), while sACE2 activities decreased with the improvement of the heart failure after CRT (reverse remodeling). Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) concentrations were lower in the diseased populations, but did not show a strong correlation with the echocardiographic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Soluble ACE2 activity appears to be biomarker in heart failure, and in hypertension, where heart failure may be imminent. Our data suggest that sACE2 is involved in the pathomechanism of hypertension and HF.","Úri, Katalin; Fagyas, Miklós; Mányiné Siket, Ivetta; Kertész, Attila; Csanádi, Zoltán; Sándorfi, Gábor; Clemens, Marcell; Fedor, Roland; Papp, Zoltán; Édes, István; Tóth, Attila; Lizanecz, Erzsébet",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3972189/,161
1469,Gluteal silicone injections and total hip arthroplasty: a case report,2014-05-06,INTRODUCTION: Silicone injection is a common procedure in cosmetic surgery. Granuloma formation and migration are the most commonly observed complications. CASE PRESENTATION: We report an unusual case of avascular necrosis of the hip in a 41-year-old woman from Thailand presenting with hip pain. Subcutaneous nodules were observed in the clinical examination. A pelvic X-ray revealed necrosis of the right femoral head and histological analysis of the punctuated nodules showed a reaction of foreign body granulomas. During surgical treatment with a hip replacement solitary silicone cysts were removed. CONCLUSIONS: This case report emphasizes that orthopedic surgeons treating patients with necrosis of the hip joint in combination with palpable granulomas in the gluteal region have to be aware of silicone augmentation and its potential complications before planning a hip replacement.,"Seeger, Jörn B; Ahmed, Gafar A; Basad, Erhan; Rickert, Markus; Ishaque, Bernd A",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032167/,161
1903,"Surgical site infection in critically ill patients with secondary and tertiary peritonitis: epidemiology, microbiology and influence in outcomes",2015-07-30,"BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI) remains a significant problem in the postoperative period that can negatively affect clinical outcomes. Microbiology findings are typically similar to other nosocomial infections, with differences dependent on microbiology selection due to antibiotic pressure or the resident flora. However, this is poorly understood in the critical care setting. We therefore aimed to assess the incidence, epidemiology and microbiology of SSI and its association with outcomes in patients with severe peritonitis in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We prospectively studied 305 consecutive patients admitted to our surgical ICU from 2010 to 2014 with a diagnosis of secondary or tertiary peritonitis. We collected the following data: SSI diagnosis, demographics, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score, type of surgery, microbiology, antibiotic treatment and outcomes. Microbiological sampling was done by means of swabs. RESULTS: We identified 269 episodes of SSI in 162 patients (53.1 %) aged 64.4 ± 14.3 years, of which 200 episodes occurred in men (64.6 %). The mean APACHE II and SAPS II scores were 19.7 ± 7.8 and 36.5 ± 16.1 respectively. The mean ICU and hospital stays were 19.8 ± 24.8 and 21.7 ± 30 days respectively. Pseudomonas spp. (n = 52, 19.3 %), Escherichia coli (n = 55, 20.4 %) and Candida spp. (n = 46, 17.1 %) were the most frequently isolated microorganisms, but gram-positive cocci (n = 80, 29.7 %) were also frequent. Microorganisms isolated from SSIs were associated with a higher incidence of antibiotic resistance (64.9 %) in ICU patients, but not with higher in-hospital mortality. However, patients who suffered from SSI had longer ICU admissions (odds ratio = 1.024, 95 % confidence interval 1.010–1.039, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SSI in secondary or tertiary peritonitis requiring ICU admission is very high. Physicians may consider antibiotic-resistant pathogens, gram-positive cocci and fungi when choosing empiric antibiotic treatment for SSI, although more studies are needed to confirm our results due to the inherent limitations of the microbiological sampling with swabs performed in our research. The presence of SSI may be associated with prolonged ICU stays, but without any influence on overall mortality.","Ballus, Josep; Lopez-Delgado, Juan C.; Sabater-Riera, Joan; Perez-Fernandez, Xose L.; Betbese, A.

3268,A critically ill patient after a colchicine overdose below the lethal dose: a case report,2018-07-04,"BACKGROUND: Although 0.8 mg/kg is considered a lethal dose of colchicine, fatal cases of patients who followed a critical disease course after an intake below this lethal dose have been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old Japanese woman who had taken an overdose of prescription colchicine (15 mg; 0.2 mg/kg) was brought to our emergency out-patient department. Although her colchicine intake was below 0.8 mg/kg (considered the lethal dose), she reached a critical state and underwent three phases characterizing colchicine poisoning (gastrointestinal symptoms, multiple organ failure, and recovery). Her condition was critical, with a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of a maximum of 14. CONCLUSIONS: Patients might reach a critical stage after colchicine ingestion at a non-lethal dose. Thus, it might be necessary to review which dose of colchicine should be considered lethal.","Hirayama, Ichiro; Hiruma, Takahiro; Ueda, Yoshihiro; Doi, Kent; Morimura, Naoto",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6030797/,161
4483,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of healthcare-associated infection in elderly patients in a large Chinese tertiary hospital: a 3-year surveillance study,2020-02-10,"The primary function of the respiratory system of gas exchange renders it vulnerable to environmental pathogens that circulate in the air. Physical and cellular barriers of the respiratory tract mucosal surface utilize a variety of strategies to obstruct microbe entry. Physical barrier defenses including the surface fluid replete with antimicrobials, neutralizing immunoglobulins, mucus, and the epithelial cell layer with rapidly beating cilia form a near impenetrable wall that separates the external environment from the internal soft tissue of the host. Resident leukocytes, primarily of the innate immune branch, also maintain airway integrity by constant surveillance and the maintenance of homeostasis through the release of cytokines and growth factors. Unfortunately, pathogens such as influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae require hosts for their replication and dissemination, and prey on the respiratory tract as an ideal environment causing severe damage to the host during their invasion. In this review, we outline the host-pathogen interactions during influenza and post-influenza bacterial pneumonia with a focus on inter- and intra-cellular crosstalk important in pulmonary immune responses.","LeMessurier, Kim S.; Tiwary, Meenakshi; Morin, Nicholas P.; Samarasinghe, Amali E.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7011736/,161
14788,Lethal multiple colon necrosis and perforation due to fulminant amoebic colitis: a surgical case report and literature review,2021-01-20,"BACKGROUND: Population intake goals intended to prevent diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have been defined for multiple nutrients. Yet, little is known whether the existing food supply in Africa is in conformity with these goals or not. We evaluated the African food balances against the recommendations for macronutrients, free sugars, types of fatty acids, cholesterol and fruits and vegetables over 1990 to 2017, and provided regional, sub-regional and country-level estimates. METHODS: The per capita supply of 95 food commodities for 45 African countries (1990–2017) was accessed from the FAOSTAT database and converted into calories, carbohydrate, fat, protein, free sugars, cholesterol, saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids contents using the Food Data Central database. The supply of fruits and vegetables was also computed. RESULTS: In Africa the energy supply increased by 16.6% from 2,685 in 1990 to 3,132 kcal/person/day in 2017. However, the energy contribution of carbohydrate, fat and protein remained constant and almost within acceptable range around 73, 10 and 9%, respectively. In 2017, calories from fats surpassed the 20% limit in upper-middle- or high-income and Southern Africa countries. Energy from SFA remained within range (<10%) but that of PUFA was below the minimum desirable level of 6% in 28 countries. Over the period, energy from free sugars remained constant around 7% but the figure exceeded the limit of 10% in upper-middle- or high-income countries (14.7%) and in Southern (14.8%) and Northern (10.5%) sub-regions. Between 1990 and 2017 the availability of dietary cholesterol per person surged by 14% but was below the upper limit of 300 mg/day. The supply of fruits and vegetables increased by 27.5% from 279 to 356 g/capita/day; yet, with the exception of Northern Africa, the figure remained below the target of 400 g/capita/day in all sub-regions. CONCLUSION: According to this population level data, in Africa most population intake goals are within acceptable range. Yet, the supply of fruits and vegetables and PUFAs are suboptimal and the increasing energy contributions of free sugars and fats are emerging concerns in specific sub-regions.","Gebremedhin, Samson; Bekele, Tilahun",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7799762/,161

14916,Child with predominant midline stereotypies and infrequent seizures,2021-01-20,"INTRODUCTION: A substantial share of urban Indians with diagnosed hypertension do not take regular treatment, potentially due to poor knowledge of hypertension consequences and treatment options. We describe hypertension knowledge and beliefs, treatment patterns, and reported reasons for treatment non-use among adults with diagnosed hypertension in Chennai, India. METHODS: We collected data on 833 adults ages 30+ with physician diagnosed hypertension using a door-to-door household survey within randomly selected wards of Chennai. We described the proportion of individuals who were not taking daily medications and their reported reasons for not doing so. Next, we described individuals’ knowledge of hypertension consequences and how to control blood pressure (BP) and assessed the association between knowledge and daily treatment use. RESULTS: Over one quarter (28% (95% CI 25% to 31%)) of diagnosed individuals reported not taking daily treatment. The largest proportion (18% (95% CI 16% to 21%)) were individuals who had discontinued prior treatment use. The primary reason individuals reported for non-daily use was that their BP had returned to normal. Just 23% (95% CI 20% to 26%) of individuals listed BP medications as the most effective way to reduce BP; however, these individuals were 11% points (95% CI 4% to 19%) more likely to take daily medications. Conversely, 43% (95% CI 40% to 47%) of individuals believed that BP medications should be stopped from time to time and these individuals were 15% points (95% CI −0.21 to –0.09) less likely to take daily treatment. While awareness of the consequences of hypertension was poor, we found no evidence that it was associated with taking daily medications. CONCLUSIONS: There were large gaps in consistency of BP medication use which were strongly associated with knowledge about BP medications. Further research is needed to identify whether addressing beliefs can improve daily treatment use among individuals with diagnosed hypertension.","Sudharsanan, Nikkil; Ali, Mohammed K; McConnell, Margaret",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7818807/,161
15301,Hemoadsorption to treat severe iatrogenic intoxication with Patent Blue: a case report,2021-02-09,"OBJECTIVE: We quantitatively assessed the fit failure rate of N95 respirators according to the number of donning/doffing and hours worn. DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: A tertiary-care referral center in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 10 infection control practitioners participated in the fit test. METHODS: The first experiment comprised 4 consecutive 1-hour donnings and fit tests between each donning. The second experiment comprised 2 consecutive 3-hour donnings and fit tests between each donning. The final experiment comprised fit tests after an 1-hour donning or a 2-hour donning. RESULTS: For 1-hour donnings, 60%, 70%, and 90% of the participants had fit failures after 2, 3, and 4 consecutive donnings, respectively. For 3-hour donnings, 50% had fit failure after the first donning and 70% had failures after 2 consecutive donnings. All participants passed the fit test after refitting whenever fit failure occurred. The final experiment showed that 50% had fit failure after a single use of 1 hour, and 30% had fit failure after a single use of 2 hours. CONCLUSIONS: High fit-failure rates were recorded after repeated donning and extended use of N95 respirators. Caution is needed for reuse (≥1 time) and extended use (≥1 hour) of N95 respirators in high-risk settings such as those involving aerosol-generating procedures. Although adequate refitting may recover the fit factor, the use of clean gloves and strict hand hygiene afterward should be ensured when touching the outer surfaces of N95 respirators for refitting.","Jung, Jiwon; Kim, Jiyun; Yang, Hyejin; Lim, Young-Ju; Kwak, Sun-Hee; Hong, Min Jee; Kim, Eun Ok; Kim, Sung-Han",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7870914/,161
16435,Septic shock due to Escherichia coli meningoencephalitis treated with immunoglobulin-M-enriched immunoglobulin preparation as adjuvant therapy: a case report,2021-03-29,"The mammalian genome comprehends a small minority of genes that encode for proteins (barely 2% of the total genome in humans) and an immense majority of genes that are transcribed into RNA but not encoded for proteins (ncRNAs). These non-coding genes are intimately related to the expression regulation of protein-coding genes. The ncRNAs subtypes differ in their size, so there are long non-coding genes (lncRNAs) and other smaller ones, like microRNAs (miRNAs) and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Due to their important role in the maintenance of cellular functioning, any deregulation of the expression profiles of these ncRNAs can dissemble in the development of different types of diseases. Among them, we can highlight some of high incidence in the population, such as cancer, neurodegenerative, or cardiovascular disorders. In addition, thanks to the enormous advances in the field of medical genomics, these same ncRNAs are starting to be used as possible drugs, approved by the FDA, as an effective treatment for diseases.","López-Jiménez, Elena; Andrés-León, Eduardo",Noncoding RNA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8006041/,161
16467,Risk factors for mortality in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia: a single center experience,2021-03-30,"Motor adaptation is commonly thought to be a trial-and-error process in which the accuracy of movement improves with repetition of behavior. We challenged this view by testing whether erroneous movements are necessary for motor adaptation. In the eye movement system, the association between movements and errors can be disentangled, since errors in the predicted stimulus trajectory can be perceived even without movements. We modified a smooth pursuit eye movement adaptation paradigm in which monkeys learn to make an eye movement that predicts an upcoming change in target direction. We trained the monkeys to fixate on a target while covertly, an additional target initially moved in one direction and then changed direction after 250 ms. The monkeys showed a learned response to infrequent probe trials in which they were instructed to follow the moving target. Additional experiments confirmed that probing learning or residual eye movements during fixation did not drive learning. These results show that motor adaptation can be elicited in the absence of movement and provide an animal model for studying the implementation of passive motor learning. Current models assume that the interaction between movement and error signals underlies adaptive motor learning. Our results point to other mechanisms that may drive learning in the absence of movement.","Cain, Matan; Botschko, Yehudit; Joshua, Mati",eNeuro,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8009667/,161

Electroencephalogram is a technology that allows thousands of neurons with equal spatial orientation of the duration of cerebral cortex electrical activity to be registered by postsynaptic potential. Therefore, in this paper, the time-dependent power spectrum descriptors are used to diagnose the electroencephalogram signal function from three groups: mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and healthy control test samples. The final feature used in three modes of traditional classification methods is recorded: k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis approaches, and documented results. Finally, for Alzheimer's disease patient classification, the convolutional neural network architecture is presented. The results are indicated using output assessment. For the convolutional neural network approach, the accurate meaning of accuracy is 82.3%. 85% of mild cognitive impairment cases are accurately detected in-depth, but 89.1% of the Alzheimer's disease and 75% of the healthy population are correctly diagnosed. The presented convolutional neural network outperforms other approaches because performance and the k-nearest neighbors' approach is the next target. The linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine were at the low area under the curve values.","Amini, Morteza; Pedram, MirMohsen; Moradi, AliReza; Ouchani, Mahshad",Comput Math Methods Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8088352/,161
18092,Possible immunoglobulin-E-dependent sugammadex-induced anaphylaxis caused by an epitope other than γ-cyclodextrin: a case report,2021-06-05,"BACKGROUND: Ensuring a sufficient supply and distribution of health care professionals is essential to meeting public health needs. Regulatory agencies protect their communities by ensuring that new health professionals have the required qualifications to practice safely and by tracking the volume and distribution of those professionals on an ongoing basis. The speed and accuracy of sharing these data could be greatly improved through the adoption of a data standard for information about health professionals. To date, however, no internationally accepted standard has emerged for this purpose. PURPOSE: This study examines three existing XML standards designed for the representation of individual worker data to determine if, and to what degree, each could be used for the tracking of health professionals. METHODS: The data elements of the Europass schema, the HR Open Standard Recruiting specification, and the MedBiquitous Healthcare Professional Profile standard were fully examined and matching elements were mapped to the 200+ elements identified from a prior content analysis as required by a sample of 20 international regulatory agencies. RESULTS: None of the schemas examined addressed more than half of the information elements required by regulators. All three schemas are found lacking in some key areas of interest, especially vital information that could disqualify ineligible applicant practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: The three standards could all be improved by including new elements essential to regulatory agencies. Regulatory agencies should be consulted in the development of new standards for representing potentially disqualifying information about candidates for professional practice.","Opalek, Amy",Hum Resour Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8179696/,161

The addition of benzodiazepine sedatives, such as midazolam, has been proposed to reduce the muscular rigidity and tremors in immobilised rhinoceroses. Twenty-three free-ranging, sub-adult white rhinoceros bulls were darted and captured using a combination of etorphine plus either azaperone or midazolam. Skeletal muscle tremors were visually evaluated and scored by an experienced veterinarian, and tremor scores and distance run were compared between groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. No statistical differences were observed in tremor scores (p = 0.435) or distance run (p = 0.711) between the two groups, and no correlation between these variables was detected (r = –0.628; p = 0.807). Etorphine–midazolam was as effective as etorphine–azaperone at immobilising rhinoceroses, with animals running similar distances. Although the addition of midazolam to the etorphine did not reduce tremor scores compared to azaperone, it might have other beneficial immobilising effects in rhinoceroses, and further investigation is necessary to elucidate possible methods of reducing muscle tremoring during chemical immobilisation of rhinoceroses.","Nasr, Mary; Meyer, Leith C.R.; Buss, Peter; Fàbregas, Maria C.; Gleed, Robin D.; Boesch, Jordyn M.; Pohlin, Friederike",J S Afr Vet Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8252159/,161

These channels modulate cellular excitability, input resistance, and response to synaptic stimulation. TASK-channel inhibition led to membrane depolarization. TASK-3 is expressed in different cancer cell types and neurons. Thus, the discovery of novel TASK-3 inhibitors makes these bioactive compounds very appealing to explore new cancer and neurological therapies. TASK-3 channel blockers are very limited to date, and only a few heterofused compounds have been reported in the literature. In this article, we combined a pharmacophore hypothesis with molecular docking to address for the first time the rational design, synthesis, and evaluation of 5-(indol-2-yl)pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines as a novel family of human TASK-3 channel blockers. Representative compounds of the synthesized library were assessed against TASK-3 using Fluorometric imaging plate reader—Membrane Potential assay (FMP). Inhibitory properties were validated using two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) methods. We identified one active hit compound (MM-3b) with our systematic pipeline, exhibiting an IC(50) ≈ 30 μM. Molecular docking models suggest that compound MM-3b binds to TASK-3 at the bottom of the selectivity filter in the central cavity, similar to other described TASK-3 blockers such as A1899 and PK-THPP. Our in silico and experimental studies provide a new tool to predict and design novel TASK-3 channel blockers.","Ramírez, David; Mejia-Gutierrez, Melissa; Insuasty, Braulio; Rinné, Susanne; Kiper, Aytug K.; Platzk, Magdalena; Müller, Thomas; Decher, Niels; Quiroga, Jairo; De-la-Torre, Pedro; González, Wendy",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8271858/,161

A total of 188 middle and high school students participated in 25 focus groups. Focus groups were led by study team members and included five to ten participants each. Adolescents were asked to discuss their cancer and cancer prevention knowledge, sources of cancer education, and preferences for cancer prevention education. Focus groups were audio-recorded, and professionally transcribed. Transcripts were content and thematically analyzed by two study team members using NVivo qualitative data software. Six themes were identified in focus groups: knowledge about cancer, negative perceptions of cancer, awareness of cancer prevention, engagement in cancer prevention, facilitators and barriers for action, and preferences for cancer education. Adolescents described a wide range of cancer education sources, including friends, family, healthcare professionals, school, technology, and pamphlets. Participants associated cancer with negative emotions, such as sadness and fear. Participants expressed interest in learning about cancer and cancer prevention, but also identified barriers to engaging in preventative behaviors, such as discomfort, lack of knowledge, and lack of personal connection to cancer. Adolescents preferred learning through personal presentations, online videos, school, educational games, and social situations. Adolescence is a critical period for learning and developing healthy behaviors. Awareness of cancer and cancer prevention is crucial to lowering cancer risk in the future. To be effective, cancer education for adolescents should target specific areas of cancer prevention and address barriers to engagement in preventative behaviors.

21531,"Rectal foreign body, an impacted plastic ball: A case report and review of literature",2021-09-16,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology with a high rate of disability. Traditional treatments for RA remain a challenging issue. For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have no therapeutic effects on joint destruction, and the prominent side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms. RA is characterized by recurrence and bone attrition. Therefore, regenerative medicine and the use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) therapies have recently emerged as potential options. UC-MSCs are multifunctional stem cells that are present in neonatal umbilical cord tissue and can differentiate into many kinds of cells, which have broad clinical application prospects in the tissue engineering of bone, cartilage, muscle, tendon, ligament, nerve, liver, endothelium, and myocardium. Moreover, UC-MSCs have advantages, such as convenient collection of materials and no ethical disputes; thus, these cells have attracted increasing attention from researchers. However, there are few clinical studies regarding UC-MSC therapy for RA. In this paper, we will review traditional drugs for RA treatment and then focus on UC-MSC therapy for RA, including preclinical and clinical UC-MSC applications for RA patients in the context of regenerative medicine. Finally, we will summarize the challenges and perspectives of UC-MSCs as a potential therapeutic strategy for RA. This review will help to design and discover more potent and efficacious treatments for RA patients and aid in advancing this class of cell therapy.","Lv, Xiaolan; Wang, Liming; Zou, XiaoRong; Huang, Shigao",Drug Des Devel Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8462093/,161

The child with septic shock may have simultaneous derangements in the function of virtually every system of the body including: cardiovascular, respiratory, immune, renal, coagulation, hepatic, metabolic and neurologic. The degree to which physiologic alterations are manifest in a given patient is variable and influenced by multiple host and non-host factors including: the developmental stage, the presence of co-morbidities, pathogen-related factors, and genetic influences on both the host inflammatory response as well as the response to pharmacologic agents, all combining to have a profound influence on outcome. The clinician must possess a systematic and multifaceted approach to these critically ill patients. The goal of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive description of the epidemiology, biology and pathophysiology (at both the cellular and organ level) of sepsis, as well as outlining the current principles of managing septic shock.

However, in the case of overparametrized complex systems modeling, the task of parameter-estimation through data assimilation can expand exponentially. It leads to unacceptable computational overhead, substantial inaccuracies in parameter matching, and wrong predictions. Here we define a Supermodel as a kind of ensembling scheme, which consists of a few sub-models representing various instances of the baseline model. The sub-models differ in parameter sets and are synchronized through couplings between the most sensitive dynamical variables. We demonstrate that after a short pretraining of the fully parametrized small sub-model ensemble, and then training a few latent parameters of the low-parameterized Supermodel, we can outperform in efficiency and accuracy the baseline model matched to data by a classical DA procedure.","Sendera, Marcin; Duane, Gregory S.; Dzwinel, Witold",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304721/,161

The Mercado’s upgrading plans emerge within the context of Maputo’s intensely urban transformation that has led gentrification effects, especially in the city’s wealthiest areas. This stems partly from private real estate investment, and also from large infrastructure and housing projects promoted by the Mozambican state. Modernist planning ideals and their ordering impulses shape the way municipal authorities view the city and its spaces of informality, contradicting the urban form produced and lived by the majority of Maputo’s inhabitants. While Mercado do Museu has enabled the production of urban social life and the foundations for urban inclusion and citizenship, the modernisation project brings forward “conflicting rationalities” (Watson Planning Theory and Practice, 4(4), 395–407, 2003). However as modernist views of cities are broadly shared across Mozambique’s urban society, the “conflicting rationalities” being played out are not only situated around urban material form; but rather between material expressions of urbanity and personhood; between urban form and urban citizenship.","Roque, Sandra; Mucavele, Miguel; Noronha, Nair",Urban Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7392367/,161

In analysing the administrative strategy, the article emphasises the role that the current system of constitutional separation of powers plays in emergency management and how this system can impact health risk assessment. An explanation of the risk management system in Italian and European Union (EU) law is provided and the following key legal issues are addressed: (1) the notion and features of emergency risk regulation from a pandemic perspective, distinguishing between risk and emergency; (2) the potential and limits of the precautionary principle in EU law; and (3) the Italian constitutional scenario with respect to the main provisions regulating central government, regional and local powers. Specifically, this article argues that the administrative strategy for effectively implementing emergency risk regulation based on an adequate and correct risk assessment requires “power sharing” across the different levels of government with the participation of all of the institutional actors involved in the decision-making process: Government, Regions and local authorities. “And the flames of the tripods expired.

Four major projects have been developed—Hibernia, Terra Nova, White Rose/North Amethyst, and Hebron—using two development concepts, gravity-base structures and floating production storage and offloading vessels. The region is characterized by severe storm and sea conditions, including the presence of icebergs, which challenge all aspects of exploration and development. From 1998 to 2019, exploration and delineation drilling cost averaged $90.9 million per well and $26,494 per meter drilled. Development wells drilled from mobile offshore drilling units over the same period averaged $91.1 million per producer well and $68.8 million per injector well. Regional development cost was $32.5/bbl since the start of production and is expected to fall to $22/bbl when recoverable volumes circa 2020 have been extracted. Average regional production cost from 2006 to 2019 is estimated at $23.4/bbl and ranges from $16.8/bbl at Hibernia to about $35/bbl at Terra Nova and White Rose.

Persistence of Respiratory and Non-respiratory Symptoms Among COVID-19 Patients Seeking Care at an Ambulatory COVID-19 Center,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) of nasopharyngeal specimens (NPS) have become standard for diagnosis of SARS-COV2. IDSA guidelines suggest repeat testing after 24–48 h when initially negative and clinical suspicion persists. We characterized patients from whom initial NPS were NAAT-negative, but repeats were NAAT-positive, in order to identify which patients might benefit from repeat NAAT for SARS-CoV-2, and the appropriate interval. METHODS: We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective review of laboratory and electronic medical record data for all patients evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Mount Sinai Health System, whose initial NAATs were done between March 16 – March 30, 2020, and who were retested within one month. NAATs were performed on NPS in viral transport medium using the Roche Diagnostics cobas® 6800 SARS-CoV-2 Test. Baseline patient characteristics, clinical and radiographic findings were identified. RESULTS: Of 235 patients eligible for inclusion, 172 (70.5%) were initially NAAT-negative, and 118 (68.6%) remained NAAT-negative over 1 month follow up. 54 (31.4%) converted to NAAT-positive over the next 1-month. Of patients who became NAAT-positive, 31 (57.4%) were inpatients who converted results within a single admission; the average interval was 6d 7h between the NAAT-negative and NAAT-positive results, and the minimum interval was 10.5 h. Symptoms examined for correlation for conversion to NAAT-positive were: fever, cough, shortness of breath, and combined nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. Duration of symptoms reported at triage did not appear to affect time to conversion to NAAT-positive. No individual symptom was more likely to be associated with conversion to NAAT- positive. However, time to conversion to NAAT-positive was shorter for patients with multiple symptoms. In general, chest radiography (CXR) findings correlated with NAAT results; interval to NAAT-positive was shorter for patients with worsening CXR findings. CONCLUSION: Our data supports repeat testing in patients with multiple clinical symptoms suggestive of SARS CoV-2 infection and negative initial NP test results. Further studies are needed to determine the true clinical sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 NAAT assays.

44119,547. A Retrospective Cohort Study of Treatment Patterns and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Disasters, including pandemics, disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. The Downtown Eastside (DTES) neighborhood of Vancouver has high prevalence of mental illness, substance use, infectious disease and homelessness. While studies have described clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in other centres worldwide, data is lacking on marginalized groups. We describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients seen at two urban hospitals who care for the vulnerable population in the DTES of Vancouver, British Columbia (BC), Canada. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on all COVID-19 patients ≥19 years seen at either centre from January 1 to June 10, 2020. Descriptive statistics assessed demographics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, laboratory values and outcomes, and were compared between subjects managed as inpatients (died vs. discharged) and outpatients. RESULTS: Of 71 COVID-19 subjects, mean age was 57y (SD 20); 36 (51%) were male. Time to presentation, symptoms and laboratory values were similar to other reports. 58 (82%) presented from the community, 3 (4%) from long-term care/rehabilitation centres, and 8 (11%) had no fixed address (NFA) or lived in the DTES. 45 (64%) had a known exposure, 20 (28%) were healthcare workers, 85% involved in direct patient care; 0/20 were admitted to hospital. Of the 8 NFA/DTES subjects, mean age was 46y (SD 13), 50% were male, 5 (63%) were admitted to hospital and all survived. Admitted subjects (n=34) were older (mean age 69 vs 46y, p< 0.001), 62% were male, and had more comorbidities (mean [SD] 3 [3] vs. 1 [2], p< 0.001). Eight (24%) died, 26 (76%) were discharged, 29% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 21% secondary infection, 18% renal failure, and 15% cardiac dysfunction. Of patients admitted to intensive care, 5/10 died. CONCLUSION: Our results concur with other studies showing older age and comorbidities contribute to more severe COVID-19 disease. 64% of subjects had a known exposure, and only 11% had NFA/DTES residence. Given that there is no financial barrier to access healthcare in Canada and these hospitals serve our most vulnerable populations, our results may indicate that BC Public Health has done an effective job of tracking and limiting community spread of COVID-19.

Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) in a Veterans Affairs Hospital at Suffolk County, Long Island, New York",2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor inhibitor that has been utilized for the prevention and treatment of the cytokine storm inflammatory reaction in COVID-19. The objectives of this analysis were to evaluate clinical outcomes of tocilizumab treatment in relation to respiratory status improvements and to analyze the association between initial inflammatory markers and treatment outcomes. METHODS: IRB approved retrospective chart review of adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab from March- May 2020. Data collection focused on relevant past medical history, hematologic and inflammatory markers before and after tocilizumab administration, concomitant COVID-19 treatments, and disease outcomes such as mortality and discharge. Assessed baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab prior to intubation versus after intubation, and evaluated for any significant markers of treatment success and failure. RESULTS: 84 patients were evaluated. Baseline characteristics did not vary between intubated and not intubated patients (Figure 1). Overall mortality in patients who received an IL-6 inhibitor was 43%. Mortality in patients who received IL-6 inhibitor when intubated (63%) compared to patients who were not intubated (26%) was significantly higher (p = 0.005). Patients with BMI’s of 30 or above and patients with diabetes had a higher rate of treatment failure (p < 0.05) (Figure 2). Patients with IL-6 levels of 1000 or above had higher rates of treatment failure (p = 0.0001); however, given the small sample size larger studies are required for further analysis (Figure 3).

One of the reasons for this is that the borders of most of these postcolonial states were drawn by their colonisers who paid little to no regard to the local realities. This article is focused on one such colonial border, i.e., the one between India and Nepal. It will highlight the relation between the drawing of borders and colonialism. It will also discuss the complicit role of international law in maintaining these colonial borders, through a discussion of the principle of uti possidetis. The article will highlight the problems with the principle of uti possidetis. The aim is to assess the Indo-Nepal border dispute through the lens of the colonial principle of uti possidetis. The article offers a few suggestions regarding other international law principles which can be used instead of uti possidetis, the principle of equity being one of them. So far no work has been done on the Indo-Nepal border dispute from the perspective of the principle of uti possidetis.

Methods: 48 survivors of BC were divided into the absentees group and the iMBSR groups according to their attending to the standardized, group-based, 8-week iMBSR. Based on practice time, survivors of BC in the iMBSR were categorized into three subgroups: group 1 (<30 min/day), group 2 (30–60 min/day), and group 3 (>60 min/day). In addition, participants were classified as partial attendees (<4 sessions) and completers (more than 4 sessions) of the iMBSR groups. All participants were evaluated for symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia at baseline, mid-intervention, and post-intervention. Results: After an 8-week iMBSR practice, at mid-intervention and post-intervention, participants in iMBSR group had significant improvement in scores and reduction rates of depression, anxiety, and insomnia compared to absentees. Scores of depression and insomnia, reduction rates of depression at post-intervention, scores of anxiety, reduction rates of anxiety and insomnia at mid-intervention and post-intervention, had significant differences among subgroups of practice time. Daily practice time was positively related to reduction rates of depression, anxiety and insomnia at post-intervention in the iMBSR group. Conclusion: Internet-based MBSR showed efficacy in reducing psychological symptoms among survivors of BC. For survivors of BC, iMBSR practice has a potential dose–response efficacy, with a threshold of >30 min daily practice for most optimal symptoms reduction.

59728,Risk factors and prognosis of late acute rejection in Chinese kidney transplant recipients.,2017,"PURPOSE Soft-tissue sarcomas most frequently metastasize to the lung. Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases is the primary treatment modality. Although lobectomy is widely acknowledged as the standard procedure to treat primary pulmonary tumors, the standard for pulmonary metastases is not well defined; furthermore, compromised lung function may tip the scales in favor of a less invasive approach. Here, we report the results of a patient treated with wedge resection and intraoperative cesium-131 ((131)Cs). METHODS AND MATERIALS A 58-year-old African American female was diagnosed with the American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage IIA mixed uterine leiomyosarcoma and underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by adjuvant external beam radiotherapy to a total dose of 45 Gy and vaginal brachytherapy to a total dose of 20 Gy. At 2 years, a routine CT scan of the chest revealed metastasis to right upper lobe of the lung. The patient's poor pulmonary function, related to a 45 pack-year smoking history and chronic emphysema, precluded a lobectomy. RESULTS After the patient underwent a lung-sparing wedge resection of the pulmonary right upper lobe metastasis and intraoperative brachytherapy with (131)Cs seeds to a total dose of 80 Gy, she remained disease free in the implanted area. At a 2-year followup, imaging continued to reveal 100% local control of the area treated with wedge resection and intraoperative (131)Cs brachytherapy. The patient had no complications from this treatment. CONCLUSIONS Such treatment approach may become an attractive option in patients with oligometastatic disease and compromised pulmonary function.","Wernicke, A Gabriella; Parikh, Apurva; Yondorf, Menachem; Trichter, Samuel; Gupta, Divya; Port, Jeffrey; Parashar, Bhupesh",Brachytherapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brachy.2013.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23850276/,161
61894,A systematic review of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.,2021-06-01,"The uncertainties and scale of the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised global anxieties and insecurities, and many cultural groups have conjuncturally embedded conspiracy theories within millennial and apocalyptic thought to explain and find meaning in the pandemic. The apocalypse lends itself well to conspiratorial thinking because conceptually it is flexible enough to reflect any crisis. To this end, the global development of Covid-19 conspiracism is what the authors term 'contagious conspiracism' which is defined as viral global cultural conspiracism. The paper explores how millennialist responses to Covid-19 in various media outlets transcend academic categories of analysis and cultural boundaries between, say, religious and secular, far-right and radical left. First explored is how the crisis became embedded in established (mainly American) contemporary millennial beliefs and prophecies through selected far-right, evangelical and radical left narratives. Second, it is shown how these theories have been 'improvised' to include 5 G and also travelled to Europe and taken on geographical significance in Belfast and Berlin. Third, the authors illustrate the shared ingredients, motivations, and semiotics across apocalyptic conspiratorial Covid-19 narratives, all of which resonate with concerns about power, specifically emergent surveillance technologies, governmental abuse of power, and neoliberal capital, with divergent truths about who is blame from 5 G/vaccine theories to corporate technocapitalism. The paper concludes that these shared discourses across apocalyptic and conspiratorial Covid-19 narratives mean many of us are conspiracists and/or conspiracy theorists at some level and is therefore both revealing of the similarities and has the potential to create democratic constituencies.","Sturm, Tristan; Albrecht, Tom",Anthropology & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/13648470.2020.1833684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33233926/,161

Several revisional procedures have been suggested to reinitiate further weight loss in this group of patients, and placing a silastic ring around the pouch proximal to the gastrojejunostomy is one among those procedures. The aim of our study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of salvage banding using a pericardial patch after RYGB for further weight loss. Between December 2009 and April 2013, a total of 46 patients underwent revision with pericardial patch ring after RYGB for weight regain/failure of weight loss. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed, noting the outcomes and complications of the procedure. The mean body mass index at the time of revision was 40.1 ± 6.8 kg/m2. Mean percentage of excess weight loss was 23.4 ± 15.7%, 39.0 ± 27.4%, and 18.9 ± 20.5% at 6, 12 and 24 months after revision, respectively. Eight (17.4%) patients required a total of 11 readmissions due to nausea, vomiting, dysphagia and abdominal pain. Six (13.0%) patients underwent a total of six reoperations, including four patients with laparoscopic removal of the pericardial patch and another revision of RYGB, and two patients with repair of perforated ulcers.

MicroRNAs act as an important component in glioma development and thus may be a potential target for the treatment of glioma. There were some researches indicated that miR-210-3p played a role in glioma development, but if it can inhibit glioma growth, as well as the underlying mechanism, is still uncertain. In the present study, we investigated the effects of miR-210-3p and its potential target gene Iscu on glioma (C6) cells proliferation and migration in vitro as well as the influence of miR-210-3p on glioma growth in vivo. The results showed that miR-210-3p inhibited the proliferation and migration of C6 cells by regulating the expression of its target gene Iscu in vitro. We also demonstrated that glioma growth was suppressed in immunodeficient mice when they were implanted with C6 cells overexpressing miR-210-3p. Our data indicated that miR-210-3p played an important role in the prevention of glioma growth by targeting Iscu and so miR-210-3p/Iscu axis might be a potential target for the treatment of glioma.","He, Hui; Liu, Juan; Li, Wen; Yao, Xiang; Ren, Qiqi; Shen, Beilei; Xue, Cheng; Zou, Linqing; Zhao, Heyan; Qin, Jianbing; Jin, Guohua",Neurochemical research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11064-020-03043-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388695/,161
69749,CMV pneumonitis in a patient with Crohn's disease taking azathioprine.,2021-04-23,"BACKGROUND Quality improvement (QI) is used in nursing homes (NH) to implement and sustain improvements in patient outcomes. Little is known about how QI strategies are used in NHs. This lack of information is a barrier to replicating successful strategies. Guided by the Framework for Implementation Research, the purpose of this study was to map-out the use, evaluation, and reporting of QI strategies in NHs. METHODS This scoping review was completed to identify reports published between July 2003 through February 2019. Two reviewers screened articles and included those with (1) the term ""quality improvement"" to describe their methods, or reported use of a QI model (e.g., Six Sigma) or strategy (e.g., process mapping) (2), findings related to impact on service and/or resident outcomes, and (3) two or more NHs included. Reviewers extracted data on study design, setting, population, problem, solution to address problem, QI strategies, and outcomes (implementation, service, and resident). Vote counting and narrative synthesis were used to describe the use of QI strategies, implementation outcomes, and service and/or resident outcomes. RESULTS Of 2302 articles identified, the full text of 77 articles reporting on 59 studies were included. Studies focused on 23 clinical problems, most commonly pressure ulcers, falls, and pain. Studies used an average of 6 to 7 QI strategies. The rate that strategies were used varied substantially, e.g., the rate of in-person training (55%) was more than twice the rate of plan-do-study-act cycles (20%). On average, studies assessed two implementation outcomes; the rate these outcomes were used varied widely, with 37% reporting on staff perceptions (e.g., feasibility) of solutions or QI strategies vs. 8% reporting on fidelity and sustainment. Most studies (n = 49) reported service outcomes and over half (n = 34) reported resident outcomes. In studies with statistical tests of improvement, service outcomes improved more often than resident outcomes. CONCLUSIONS This study maps-out the scope of published, peer-reviewed studies of QI in NHs. The findings suggest preliminary guidance for future studies designed to promote the replication and synthesis of promising solutions. The findings also suggest strategies to refine procedures for more effective improvement work in NHs.","Toles, Mark; Colón-Emeric, Cathleen; Moreton, Elizabeth; Frey, Lauren; Leeman, Jennifer",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06803-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34384404/,161

Phylogenetic analysis of the partial 3D genomic region suggested that one bat virus belonged to the species Enterovirus G (EV-G, formerly Porcine enterovirus B). Bat infection was supported by relatively high EV-G concentrations of 1.1×106 RNA copies per gram of faeces. All other bat viruses belonged either to the bat-associated genus Mischivirus, or to an unclassified Picornaviridae group distantly related to the genus Sapelovirus. Members of this unclassified sapelovirus-related group had RNA secondary structures in their 3'-nontranslated regions that were typical of enteroviruses and that resembled structures that occur in bat-associated coronaviruses, suggesting ancient recombination events. Based on sequence distances, several picornaviruses from European and Chinese bats were likely conspecific, suggesting connectivity of virus populations. Due to their high mutation rates and their diversity, picornaviruses may be useful tools for studies of bat and virus ecology.","Lukashev, Alexander N; Corman, Victor Max; Schacht, Daniel; Gloza-Rausch, Florian; Seebens-Hoyer, Antje; Gmyl, Anatoly P; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28555547/,161

Treatment with proline significantly reduced voluntary food intake at 2h and 3h after oral administration, while glutamic acid showed a less pronounced satiating effect at 3h. The mRNA expression of taste receptor subunits tas1r1, tas1r2a, tas1r2b, and tas1r3 was measured in the epithelium overlying the bony basyhyal of the fish (analogous to the tetrapod tongue) at 10, 20 or 30 min following treatment. No significant changes were observed, except for a tas1r down-regulation by valine at 30 mins. Of the downstream taste signalling genes that were analysed in parallel, plcb2 and possibly trpm5 (non-significant trend) were down-regulated 20 min after proline and glutamic acid treatment. The signal originated in the oropharyngeal and/or gastric cavity presumably relays to the brain since changes in genes involved in the regulation of food intake occurred in hypothalamus 10-30 min after oral treatment with amino acids. In particular, proline induced changes consistent with an increased anorexigenic potential in the hypothalamus. We have therefore demonstrated, for the first time in fish, that the peripheral (pre-absorptive) detection of an amino acid (L-proline), presumably by taste-related mechanisms, elicits a satiety signal that in hypothalamus is translated into changes in cellular signalling and neuropeptides regulating food intake, ultimately resulting in decreased food intake.","Comesaña, Sara; Conde-Sieira, Marta; Velasco, Cristina; Soengas, José L; Morais, Sofia",The Journal of experimental biology,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.221721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680900/,161

The employment of these external techniques is because the gain medium itself is incapable of modifying or multiplying the generated laser pulse. Herein, with single femtosecond laser pulse excitation, we achieve the double-pulsed stimulated emission with pulse duration of around 40 ps and pulse interval of around 70 ps from metal-halide perovskite multiple quantum wells. These unique stimulated emissions originate from one fast vertical and the other slow lateral high-efficiency carrier funneling from low-dimensional to high-dimensional quantum wells. Furthermore, such gain medium surprisingly possesses nearly Auger-free stimulated emission. These insights enable us a fresh approach to multiple the ultrashort laser pulse by gain medium.","Guo, Jia; Liu, Tanghao; Li, Mingjie; Liang, Chao; Wang, Kaiyang; Hong, Guo; Tang, Yuxin; Long, Guankui; Yu, Siu-Fung; Lee, Tae-Woo; Huang, Wei; Xing, Guichuan",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17096-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681066/,161

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an example of an animal virus that has developed diverse mechanisms to evade porcine antiviral immune responses. Two decades after its discovery, PRRSV is still one of the most globally devastating viruses threatening the swine industry. In this review, we discuss the molecular and cellular composition of the mammalian innate antiviral immune system with emphasis on the porcine system.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread over all 31 provinces of Iran, leading to the most cases and death among the Eastern Mediterranean countries. At the same time, Iran is under the United States political and economic sanctions that compromised Iran's health system. Although medicines and basic medical equipment exempted from the economic sanctions, direct and indirect effects of sanctions have restricted Iran's banking system, and consequently has led to a wide range of limitation on trade, manufacturing sector, insurance and ventures. All these circumstances have meant that Iran is restricted to provide the essential basic medical equipment for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the COVID-19. Although sanctions are not the sole reason for this high rate of mortality and morbidity in a short time period, the chronic and long-term effects of sanctions may be more tangible than their acute impact. In conclusion, providing health services is one of the major problems of Iran's health system during this pandemic that potentially influence on morbidity and mortality of the COVID-19. Iran needs to be free from sanctions for battling against this crisis. Key messages: Iran is one of the countries that significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

80727,Paradoxical gastrointestinal effects of interleukin-17 blockers.,2020-07-21,"Mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) receptor is not a functional receptor for MERS-CoV while human DPP4 (hDPP4) is, despite the high similarities between hDPP4 and mDPP4 receptors. The variability of DPP4 receptors against MERS-CoV is not fully investigated, especially conformational and structural differences. Therefore, investigating the conformational differences of the DPP4 receptors can aid in developing new small animal models for MERS-CoV vaccines and antiviral agents evaluation. Here we used MD simulations and docking techniques to investigate these structural differences in DPP4 receptors. The results showed chimeric mouse mDPP4 (cmDPP4) has a similar compact conformation as wild-type hDPP4 based on the structural analysis. Interestingly, a single Thr288Ala mutation induced a relaxed conformation in chimeric 2 hDPP4 (c2hDPP4) and chimeric 2 mDPP4 (c2mDPP4); in addition to its significant effect on the DPP4 flexibility. The Thr288 residue is known for its critical function in MERS-CoV RBD interaction. Moreover, MERS-CoV RBD adopts a ""standing"" conformation when docked to hDPP4 and cmDPP4 in blade IV and V regions. In conclusion, the results could explain the functionality differences between mouse and human DPP4 receptors against MERS-CoV.

To compare the respiratory pattern, variability, synchronization, and neuromuscular coupling within comparable ranges of assistance. DESIGN Prospective single-center physiologic study. SETTING A 13-bed university medical ICU. PATIENTS Eleven patients recovering from respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS The following levels of assistance were consecutively applied in a random order: neurally adjusted ventilatory assist levels: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, and 7 cm H2O/μvolt; pressure support levels: 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm H2O. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Flow, airway pressure, esophageal pressures, and peak electrical activity of the diaphragm were continuously recorded. Breathing effort was calculated. To express the percentage of assist assumed by the ventilator, the total pressure including muscular and ventilator pressure was calculated. The median percentage of assist ranged from 33% (24-47%) to 82% (72-90%) between pressure support 7 and 25 cm H2O. Similar levels of unloading were observed for neurally adjusted ventilatory assist levels from 0.5 cm H2O/μvolt (46% [40-51%]) to 2.5 cm H2O/μvolt (80% [74-84%]). Tidal variability was higher during neurally adjusted ventilatory assist and ineffective efforts appeared only in pressure support. In neurally adjusted ventilatory assist, double triggering occurred sometimes when electrical activity of the diaphragm signal depicted a biphasic aspect, and an abnormal oscillatory pattern was frequently observed from 4 cm H2O/μvolt. For both modes, the relationship between peak electrical activity of the diaphragm and muscle pressure depicted a curvilinear profile. CONCLUSIONS In patients recovering from acute respiratory failure, levels of neurally adjusted ventilatory assist between 0.5 and 2.5 cm H2O/μvolt are comparable to pressure support levels ranging from 7 to 25 cm H2O in terms of respiratory muscle unloading. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist provides better patient-ventilator interactions but can be sometimes excessively sensitive to electrical activity of the diaphragm in terms of triggering.","Carteaux, Guillaume; Córdoba-Izquierdo, Ana; Lyazidi, Aissam; Heunks, Leo; Thille, Arnaud W; Brochard, Laurent",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000001418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26540399/,161

By contrast, endemic diseases, such as HIV in 2017 and tuberculosis, struggle to maintain the same attention. For many, the paradox is that endemic disease, in its totality, continues to impose a far higher public health burden than epidemic disease. Overall, the swift political response to epidemics has resulted in success. It has proven possible to eradicate epidemic diseases, often without the availability of vaccines and other biomedical technologies. In recent times, only HIV has made the transition from epidemic to endemic, but diseases that have existed for centuries continue to cause most of the infectious disease burden.","Medley, Graham F; Vassall, Anna",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aam8333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28706039/,161

89387,Coronavirus disease 2019 management.,2021-02-16,"BACKGROUND We assessed the feasibility and safety of single-site laparoscopic surgery for patients with colorectal cancer who required perioperative heparinization. METHODS This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of 390 patients who underwent single-site laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer from January 2010 to December 2016. Antithrombotic drugs were stopped preoperatively and heparin was administered according to the operative risk of each patient, based on consultation with the cardiologist physician or neurosurgeon. Propensity score modeling was utilized to adjust for baseline characteristics. RESULTS Of 390 patients, 29 were treated with standard bridging intravenous heparin therapy. Propensity matching identified 119 patients: 22 patients in the heparinization group and 97 in the control group. The matched groups were not significantly different in operation times, bleeding volumes, or conversion rate. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 17.9 days in the heparinization group and 9.5 days in the control group (p = 0.034). Postoperative bleeding was observed in 4 patients (18.2%) in the heparinization group and 11 patients (11.4%) in the control group (p = 0.646), while other complications were similar in the two study groups (p = 0.502). Of these other complications, thromboembolic events were observed in two patients in the heparinization group and one patient in the control group. CONCLUSIONS We found that single-site laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer with heparinization was feasible and safe. Heparinization did not increase the risk of postoperative bleeding complications, but postoperative hospital stay was prolonged.","Iwamoto, Kazuya; Takahashi, Hidekazu; Fujii, Makoto; Haraguchi, Naotsugu; Hata, Taishi; Matsuda, Chu; Yamamoto, Hirofumi; Mizushima, Tsunekazu; Mori, Masaki; Yuichiro, Doki",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-019-07794-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493124/,161
90661,Touting Traditional Knowledge and Herbal Medicine to Combat and Prevent COVID-19.,2020,"Elucidating the impact of faunal activity on stream channels is an emerging field wherein ecologists, fluvial geomorphologists, and engineers collaborate to research and manage fluvial ecosystems. Here, we focused on the geomorphological effects of animals in mountain streams. This ecosystem merits conservation measures as it furnishes cold-water refugia. We searched literature addressing the impact of various animal taxa on the river/stream bed structure. The citation sources were the Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases covering 1975-early 2020. We examined all animal taxa with documented or potential zoogeomorphological effects upon streams and assigned spatiotemporal scales to their impacts. Interpreting the literature was challenging due to a lack of uniformity in data treatment between species groups and over time. Though human interactions prevail in stream channels, animals also have a substantial effect on a spatial scale and their modifications are more durable. In general, animals markedly influence aquatic habitats. This literature compilation revealed much information about the geomorphological effects of beavers, redd-building fish, and large bottom-dwelling fish. The scale of impact of invertebrates such as crayfish or case-building caddisfly larvae on stony-gravel bottoms has previously been demonstrated. However, previous research has concentrated on only one taxon and has not demonstrated the bioaccumulation effect of multiple taxa. Quantitative data have been presented only for large terrestrial mammals crossing streams. There was comparatively little information on the impact of other terrestrial taxa on stream geomorphology. There were also few or no quantitative data on the impacts of aquatic fauna on mountain stream channels. Much has been reported about the effects of burying invertebrates but relatively little is known about the impacts of burying fish such as lamprey larvae. The present review highlights numerous outstanding information gaps. It is hoped that this review will facilitate ongoing zoogeomorphological research.","Bylak, Aneta; Kukuła, Krzysztof",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818855/,161

We used baseline data from Engage, a cohort of GBM recruited by respondent-driven sampling, to examine patterns of combination HIV prevention use among Montreal GBM since PrEP became available. Latent class analysis, stratified by HIV status, was used to categorize GBM by self-reported use of biomedical and behavioural prevention strategies. Correlates of resulting classes were identified using multinomial logistic regression. Among HIV-negative/unknown GBM (n = 968), we identified four classes: low use of prevention (32%), condoms (40%), seroadaptive behaviour (21%), and biomedical (including PrEP; 7%). Those using prevention (condoms, seroadaptive behaviour, and biomedical) had a higher number of anal sex partners and were more likely to report a recent sexually transmitted infection diagnosis. GBM using biomedical prevention also had a higher level of formal education. Among GBM living with HIV (n = 200), we identified three classes: mainly antiretroviral treatment (ART) with viral suppression (53%), ART with viral suppression and condoms (19%), and ART with viral suppression and seroadaptive behaviour (18%). Again, the number of anal sex partners was higher among those using condoms and seroadaptive behaviours. Our findings show antiretroviral-based prevention, either alone or in combination with other strategies, is clearly a component of the HIV prevention landscape for GBM in Montreal. Nevertheless, PrEP uptake remains low, and there is a need to promote its availability more widely.","Doyle, Carla M; Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu; Lambert, Gilles; Mishra, Sharmistha; Apelian, Herak; Messier-Peet, Marc; Otis, Joanne; Grace, Daniel; Hart, Trevor A; Moore, David M; Lachowsky, Nathan J; Cox, Joseph",AIDS and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-020-02965-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648063/,161

The association between PM and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has not been well established in the current literature. We sought to summarize the limited body of literature regarding PM in patients with COVID-19 and characterize the presentation and clinical outcomes of PM in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-COV-2 pneumonia at our institution to better define the incidence, prognosis, and available treatment for this condition. Materials and Methods: All patients with a proven diagnosis of COVID-19 and PM between March 18, 2020 and May 5, 2020 were identified through hospital records. Retrospective analysis of radiology records and chart review were conducted. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were collected and descriptive statistics was analyzed. Results: Thirty-six patients met inclusion criteria. Out of the 346 intubated COVID-19 patients, 34 (10%) had PM. The incidence of PM increased for the first 4 weeks of the pandemic, and then began to decrease by week 5. At the endpoint of the study, 12 (33.33%) patients were alive and 24 patients (66.67%) had died. Conclusion: PM, although a rare phenomenon, was more prevalent in COVID-19 patients compared with historical patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome. The etiology of this condition may be attributed to higher susceptibility of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to a combination of barotrauma and airway injury.","Kangas-Dick, Aaron; Gazivoda, Victor; Ibrahim, Mudathir; Sun, Arony; Shaw, Jason P; Brichkov, Igor; Wiesel, Ory",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

In mathematics, we often conceive of two primary ways of representing 2D space, Cartesian coordinates, which capture horizontal and vertical relations, and polar coordinates, which capture angle and distance relations. Do either of these two coordinate systems play a representational role in the human mind? Six experiments, using a simple visual-matching paradigm, show that (a) representational format is recoverable from the errors that observers make in simple spatial tasks, (b) human-made errors spontaneously favor a polar coordinate system of representation, and (c) observers are capable of using other coordinate systems when acting in highly structured spaces (e.g., grids). We discuss these findings in relation to classic work on dimension independence as well as work on spatial representation at other spatial scales.","Yousif, Sami R; Keil, Frank C",Psychological science,https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797620972373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720784/,161

However, the value of prescribing opioids to manage postoperative pain after surgical discharge remains unclear. We propose a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the extent to which opioid analgesia impact postoperative pain intensity and adverse events in comparison to opioid-free analgesia in patients discharged after surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Major electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL and PsycINFO) will be searched for multi-dose randomised-trials examining the comparative effectiveness of opioid versus opioid-free analgesia after surgical discharge. Studies published from January 1990 to July 2019 will be targeted, with no language restrictions. The search will be re-run before manuscript submission to include most recent literature. We will consider studies involving patients undergoing minor and major surgery. Teams of reviewers will, independently and in duplicate, assess eligibility, extract data and evaluate risk of bias. Our main outcomes of interest are pain intensity and postoperative vomiting. Study results will be pooled using random effects models. When trials report outcomes for a common domain (eg, pain intensity) using different scales, we will convert effect sizes to a common standard metric (eg, Visual Analogue Scale). Minimally important clinical differences reported in previous literature will be considered when interpreting results. Subgroup analyses defined a priori will be conducted to explore heterogeneity. Risk of bias will be assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. The quality of evidence for all outcomes will be evaluated using the GRADE rating system. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required since this is a systematic review of published studies. Our results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant conferences. Further knowledge dissemination will be sought via public and patient organisations focussed on pain and opioid-related harms.","El-Kefraoui, Charbel; Olleik, Ghadeer; Chay, Marc-Aurele; Kouyoumdjian, Araz; Nguyen-Powanda, Philip; Rajabiyazdi, Fateme; Do, Uyen; Derksen, Alexa; Landry, Tara; Amar-Zifkin, Alexandre; Ramanakumar, Agnihotram V; Martel, Marc-Olivier; Baldini, Gabriele; Feldman, Liane; Fiore, Julio F",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32014880/,161

This underlines the need to monitor HL, including among adolescents, and to understand the factors explaining HL, with a view to decreasing differences in HL. The aim of this study was to objectively measure HL, and the relationship between HL and socio-demographic factors (gender, language of instruction, pupils' educational aspirations, parents' educational background and pupils' school achievement) among pupils (n = 3652) at the end of basic education in Finland. METHODS A nationally representative assessment, which included 55 items on HL, was conducted as a traditional paper-and-pencil test in schools. The data were analysed via descriptive statistics and a two-level hierarchical linear model to determine how the socio-demographic factors affected HL. RESULTS The pupils' average score on the HL test items was 58.9%, indicating a satisfactory HL level. A two-level hierarchical linear model showed that the variables (gender, language of instruction, pupils' educational aspirations, parents' educational background and pupils' school achievement) predicting the HL level had statistically significant effects. CONCLUSIONS Among ninth graders (15-16 years old), almost one third of the boys and 8% of the girls exhibited an unsatisfactory HL level. The study also confirmed the importance of school-related factors in explaining HL differences. Since low HL has been linked to several unfavourable health indicators and has been viewed as an underestimated problem in times of pandemic and other health crises, the findings suggest that the HL level of Finnish ninth graders is a clear public-health issue.","Summanen, Anna-Mari; Rautopuro, Juhani; Kannas, Lasse K; Paakkari, Leena T",Scandinavian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211019798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120530/,161

98129,Greetings from the editor.,2019,"Older adults in the United States have lower rates of mental health care utilization than young adults. To understand these lower rates of mental health care, we performed a systematic review, in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, of barriers that prevent older adults from seeking and accessing treatment. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Clinical Key to identify studies of barriers to mental health treatment in the older adult population (in individuals 50 y of age and older). Thirty-two articles met inclusion criteria (English language and focused on barriers to care in older adults) and exclusion criteria (focus on non-United States populations, focus on younger adults, or no focus on barriers to care). We identified 5 categories of barriers to mental health care in older adults: (1) attitudes and knowledge among older adults; (2) comorbid medical conditions; (3) provider-related factors; (4) other extrinsic barriers (eg, cost, transportation, reliance on caregivers); and (5) unique factors that affect older adults in minority populations. Large studies have primarily identified intrinsic barriers, including negative attitudes toward mental health care and lack of perceived need for treatment, as preventing older adults from seeking mental health care. Minority populations have also been found to face cultural barriers and increased levels of stigma compared with non-Hispanic whites, although several of the identified articles concerning barriers among minority older adults involved qualitative studies with small samples. Larger quantitative studies may help clarify the relative importance of barriers affecting this population. Interventions that have been shown to increase access to mental health services for older adults include community-based care and integrated primary and psychiatric care, but these strategies can be difficult to implement in low-resource settings. More research is needed to determine which interventions and policies are most effective in targeting particular barriers.","Lavingia, Richa; Jones, Kristin; Asghar-Ali, Ali Abbas",Journal of psychiatric practice,https://doi.org/10.1097/pra.0000000000000491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32936584/,161

We sought to assess the economic burden related to ventral hernia recurrences with a focused comparison of those with the initial open versus laparoscopic surgery. METHODS The Premier Alliance database from 2009 to 2014 was utilized to obtain patient demographics and comorbid indices, including the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Total hospital cost and resource expenses during index laparoscopic and open VHRs and subsequent recurrent repairs were also obtained. The sample was separated into laparoscopic and open repair groups from the initial operation. Adjusted and propensity score matched cost outcome data were then compared amongst groups. RESULTS One thousand and seventy-seven patients were used for the analysis with a recurrence rate of 3.78 %. For the combined sample, costs were significantly higher during recurrent hernia repair hospitalization ($21,726 versus $19,484, p < 0.0001). However, for index laparoscopic repairs, both the adjusted total hospital cost and department level costs were similar during the index and the recurrent visit. The costs and resource utilization did not go up due to recurrence, even though these patients had greater severity during the recurrent visit (CCI score 0.92 versus 1.06; p = 0.0092). Using a matched sample, the total hospital recurrence cost was higher for the initial open group compared to laparoscopic group ($14,520 versus $12,649; p = 0.0454). CONCLUSIONS Based on our analysis, need for recurrent VHR adds substantially to total hospital costs and resource utilization. Following initial laparoscopic repair, however, the total cost of recurrent repair is not significantly increased, as it is following initial open repair. When comparing the initial laparoscopic repair versus open, the cost of recurrence was higher for the prior open repair group.","Davila, D G; Parikh, N; Frelich, M J; Goldblatt, M I",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-016-1515-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27350558/,161

METHODS AND RESULTS During March 2018, an electronic search of databases including CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO was conducted. All randomised controlled trials, which examined an intervention strategy to help heart failure patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia cope with self-care, were included. An initial search yielded 1622 citations, six studies were included (N= 595 participants, mean age 68 years). There were no significant improvements in cognitive function and depression. However, significant improvements were seen in memory (p=0.015), working memory (p=0.029) and instrumental activities of daily living (p=0.006). Nurse led interventions improved the patient's heart failure knowledge (p=0.001), self-care (p<0.05) and quality of life (p=0.029). Key elements of these interventions include brain exercises, for example, syllable stacks, individualised assessment and customised education, personalised self-care schedule development, interactive problem-solving training on scenarios and association techniques to prompt self-care activities. CONCLUSIONS Modest evidence for nurse led interventions among heart failure patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia was identified. These results must be interpreted with caution in light of the limited number of available included studies.","Hickman, Louise; Ferguson, Caleb; Davidson, Patricia M; Allida, Sabine; Inglis, Sally; Parker, Deborah; Agar, Meera",European journal of cardiovascular nursing : journal of the Working Group on Cardiovascular Nursing of the European Society of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1474515119865755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31347402/,161

However, long-term experiences of LG for AGC as well as EGC rarely have been reported. METHODS A total of 528 patients with gastric cancer were enrolled in the study, and clinical experiences of LG were evaluated. RESULTS The study included 332 men and 196 women. The mean age was 61.3 ± 11.8 years. Of the 528 patients, 432 underwent distal gastrectomy, 87 had a total gastrectomy, and 9 had a proximal gastrectomy. There were 198 T1a, 139 T1b, 63 T2, 83 T3, and 45 T4a lesions. In 127 patients, lymph node metastasis was observed, and the rate of it was 1.5% in T1a, 12.2% in T1b, 34.9% in T2, 59.0% in T3, and 80.0% in T4a. The median follow-up period was 24 months (range, 1-83 months). The 5-year survival and disease-free survival rates according to the stage of tumor were 99.3% and 97.8% in stage I, 95.4% and 89.7% in stage II, and 44.4% and 31.3% in stage III, respectively. Operation related morbidities occurred in 45 patients, and there were 2 mortalities. Tumors recurred in 36 patients consisting of 2 in T1a, 2 T1b, 2 T2, 12 T3, and 18 T4a.

The objective was to compare TEM using a disposable material vs a standard platform through a case-matched study. METHODS Patients who underwent TEM for rectal neoplasms were identified from prospective databases in two tertiary referral centers and matched according to four criteria (sex, tumor location, size, distance from the anal verge): TEM using a disposable material (GelPoint Applied®; group A) and TEM using a standard TEO® platform (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany; group B). RESULTS A total of 74 patients were included and divided into group A (n = 33) and group B (n = 41). Full-thickness resection was less frequent in group A (85%) than B (100%; p = 0.01). Adenocarcinoma was less frequent in group A than B: 27 vs 42% (p = 0.03). No difference was noted regarding median operative time (53 vs 53 min; p = 0.6) and a peritoneal perforation rate (6 vs 20%; p = 0.17). Median length of stay was shorter in group A than B (4 vs 5 days; p < 0.008). No significant difference was noted for major morbidity (12 vs 10%; p = 0.66), R1 resection (21 vs 10%; p = 0.2), and recurrence rates (8 vs 7%; p = 0.62). No difference was noted for rectal stenosis (3 vs 12%; p = 0.22) and transit disorder rates (12 vs 17%; p = 0.74).

Recognizing the risk factors for this complication and improving the technique of dural closure may reduce the associated morbidity and its surgical burden. The aim of this paper was to investigate whether the addition of TachoSil on top of the dural suture reduces postoperative CSF leakage compared with dural suturing alone and to assess the frequency and risk factors for dural leakage and potentially related complications after elective craniotomy. METHODS The authors conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blinded single-center trial in patients undergoing elective craniotomy with dural opening. They compared their standard dural closure by running suture alone (with the use of a dural patch if needed) to the same closure with the addition of TachoSil on top of the suture. The primary end point was the incidence of CSF leakage, defined as CSF collection or any open CSF fistula within 30 days. Secondary end points were the incidence of infection, surgical revision, and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) or intermediate care (IMC) unit. The site of craniotomy, a history of diabetes mellitus, a diagnosis of meningioma, the intraoperative need of a suturable dural substitute, and blood parameters were assessed as potential risk factors for CSF leakage. RESULTS The authors enrolled 241 patients, of whom 229 were included in the analysis. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage, mostly self-limiting subgaleal collections, occurred in 13.5% of patients. Invasive treatment was performed in 8 patients (3.5%) (subgaleal puncture in 6, lumbar drainage in 1, and surgical revision in 1 patient). Diabetes mellitus, a higher preoperative level of C-reactive protein (CRP), and the intraoperative need for a dural patch were positively associated with the occurrence of the primary end point (p = 0.014, 0.01, and 0.049, respectively). Cerebrospinal fluid leakage (9.7% vs 17.2%, OR 0.53 [95% CI 0.23-1.15], p = 0.108) and infection (OR 0.18 [95% CI 0.01-1.18], p = 0.077) occurred less frequently in the study group than in the control group. TachoSil significantly reduced the probability of staying in the IMC unit for 1 day or longer (OR 0.53 [95% CI 0.27-0.99], p = 0.048). Postoperative epidural hematoma and empyema occurred in the control group but not in the study group. CONCLUSIONS Dural leakage after elective craniotomy/durotomy occurs more frequently in association with diabetes mellitus, elevated preoperative CRP levels, and the intraoperative need of a dural patch. This randomized controlled trial showed no statistically significant reduction of postoperative CSF leakage and surgical site infections upon addition of TachoSil on the dural suture, but there was a significant reduction in the length of stay in the IMC unit. Dural augmentation with TachoSil was safe and not related to adverse events. Clinical trial registration no.

112630,Living with an ever-present breathlessness: Women's experiences of living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage III or IV.,2021-05-18,"Aim To evaluate the clinical picture and factors associated with unfavorable outcomes in admitted patients with COVID-19.Material and methods This study included all patients admitted to the COVID Center of the National Research Center of Cardiology of the Russian Ministry of Health Care from May 1 through May 31, 2020. Clinical demographic, laboratory, and instrumental indexes and associated factors were studied with one-way and multivariate logistic regression analysis.Results This study included 402 patients aged 18 to 95 years (mean age, 62.9±14.6 years); 43.0 % of them were older than 65 years. COVID-19 was frequently associated with chronic comorbidities, including arterial hypertension (74.4 %), obesity (41.6 %), history of ischemic heart disease (12.9 %), atrial fibrillation (18.9 %), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (13.0 %), and oncological diseases (9.2 %). 13.0 % of patients were smokers; less than 10% had chronic lung diseases. 3.9% of patients had a combination of COVID-19 and acute coronary pathology, including acute myocardial infarction (MI) in 3.2 % (13) and unstable angina in 0.7 % (3). The most frequent clinical manifestation of COVID-19 were four symptoms: cough (81.1 %), weakness (80.3 %), shortness of breath (71.6 %), and fever (62.7 %). 46.5% of patients had shortage of breath and chest pain/compression, 40.3% had headache, 31.1% had myalgia, 28.8% had anosmia, and 25.5% had ageusia. Arterial oxygen saturation was <93.0 % in 55.7 % of cases. According to laboratory blood tests the patients had anemia (58.2 %), lymphopenia (34.8 %), neutropenia (19.2 %), thrombocytopenia (11.9 %), and increased levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP, 87.3 %), interleukin-6 (89.3 %), ferritin (62.1 %), and D-dimer (49.2 %). 56.2% of patients required various regimens of oxygen support. 83 (20.6%) patients were admitted to intensive care and resuscitation units; invasive artificial ventilation was performed only for 34 (8.5 %) patients. In-hospital mortality was 7.7 % (31 / 402). One-way regression analysis identified major factors associated with death during the stay in the hospital: age >55 years, NEWS scale score >4.0, oxygen saturation <92.0 %, blood glucose >5.4 mmol/l, hs-CRP >25.7 mg/l, and creatinine clearance <72.0 ml/min. Furthermore, the risk increased with increasing degree of changes in each factor. According to results of the multivariate regression analysis, three most significant predictors of the hard endpoint, all-cause death during the stay in the hospital, were more than 5-fold increases in aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase compared to normal levels (relative risk (RR) 16.8 at 95 % confidence interval (CI) 5.0-56.3, р<0.001), pronounced changes in the lungs consistent with a CT-4 picture as shown by computed tomography (CT) (RR 13.4; 95 % CI 3.9-45.5, р<0.001), and MI/unstable angina during the stay in the hospital (RR 11.3; 95 % CI 1.4-90.6, р=0.023). The probability of death was also considerably increased by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, impaired kidney function (creatinine clearance estimated by Cockcroft-Gault <60.0 ml/min), type 2 DM, oncological diseases, and dementia.Conclusion This study established factors associated with unfavorable outcomes in admitted patients with COVID-19. This will allow identifying in advance patients with a high risk of complications that require increased attention to take more active diagnostic and therapeutic measures at prehospital and hospital stages.","Boytsov, S A; Pogosova, N V; Paleev, F N; Ezhov, M V; Komarov, A L; Pevsner, D V; Gruzdev, K A; Barinova, I V; Suvorov, A Yu; Alekseeva, I A; Milko, O V",Kardiologiia,https://doi.org/10.18087/cardio.2021.2.n1532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734042/,161
112664,Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children related to COVID-19: An update regarding the presentation of two critically ill patients.,2021-02-01,"Purpose Although knee arthroplasty (KA) is the largest source of hospitalization costs for knee osteoarthritis (OA), some studies have suggested reducing the use of ""low-value"" interventions, such as intra-articular hyaluronic acid (HA), to lower health care costs. However, those studies fail to consider that HA has demonstrated benefits in extending time to more costly KA or avoiding KA altogether. We evaluated 1) the overall knee OA costs (direct) within a 2-year period; 2) the relative contribution of HA and KA costs; 3) the direct cost savings from HA patients not undergoing KA. Patients and methods Knee OA patients were identified from the Optum Clinformatics data set, which includes physician, facility, and pharmacy claims data from privately insured patients of all ages. Patients were stratified in the no HA, non-hylan G-F 20, and hylan G-F 20 cohorts. The cumulative costs (payer perspective) were evaluated for all knee OA-related claims (adjusted to Consumer Price Index Jan 2017$) for patients who had at least 2 years follow-up. Costs were stratified into various clinical categories. Results The study cohort included 2,030,497 knee OA patients, of which 65,144 patients (3.2%) underwent KA. The cost of treating knee OA within the 2-year follow-up period was estimated to be $4.99 billion (B). The majority of the costs (69%) were attributed to KA patients (3.2% of patients). In all, 15.9% of the HA patients underwent KA within 2 years, but HA only contributed 1.7% to the total costs for these patients. The remaining 84.1% of HA patients did not undergo KA, which saved an estimated total of $1.54B (average $20,740 per patient) or 83.9%, after accounting for their non-KA therapies. Conclusion Our study estimated substantial cost savings through a large percentage of HA patients not undergoing KA. Although a fraction of patients moved on from their conservative therapy to undergo KA within the 2-year period, HA attributed to <2% of their total treatment costs.","Ong, Kevin L; Runa, Maria; Lau, Edmund; Altman, Roy D",ClinicoEconomics and outcomes research : CEOR,https://doi.org/10.2147/ceor.s170119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30936730/,161

Here, we combine bulk RNA sequencing, single cell RNA sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses, including weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA), to investigate the gene regulatory networks regulating hiPSC differentiation under chondrogenic conditions. We identify specific WNTs and MITF as hub genes governing the generation of off-target differentiation into neural cells and melanocytes during hiPSC chondrogenesis. With heterocellular signaling models, we further show that WNT signaling produced by off-target cells is responsible for inducing chondrocyte hypertrophy. By targeting WNTs and MITF, we eliminate these cell lineages, significantly enhancing the yield and homogeneity of hiPSC-derived chondrocytes. Collectively, our findings identify the trajectories and molecular mechanisms governing cell fate decision in hiPSC chondrogenesis, as well as dynamic transcriptome profiles orchestrating chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.","Wu, Chia-Lung; Dicks, Amanda; Steward, Nancy; Tang, Ruhang; Katz, Dakota B; Choi, Yun-Rak; Guilak, Farshid",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20598-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33441552/,161
115095,Delayed Diagnosis of Pulmonary Thromboembolism Due to Overfocus on COVID-19.,2020,"Bacteria hiding in host phagocytes are difficult to kill, which can cause phagocyte disorders resulting in local and systemic tissue damage. Effective accumulation of activatable photosensitizers (PSs) in phagocytes to realize selective imaging and on-demand photodynamic ablation of bacteria is of great scientific and practical interests for precise bacteria diagnosis and treatment. Herein, HClO-activatable theranostic nanoprobes, DTF-FFP NPs, for image-guided bacterial ablation in phagocytes are introduced. DTF-FFP NPs are prepared by nanoprecipitation of an HClO-responsive near-infrared molecule FFP and an efficient PS DTF with aggregation-induced emission characteristic using an amphiphilic polymer Pluronic F127 as the encapsulation matrix. As an energy acceptor, FFP can quench both fluorescence and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of DTF, thus eliminating the phototoxicity of DTF-FFP NPs in normal cells and tissues. Once delivered to the infection sites, DTF-FFP NPs light up with red fluorescence and efficiently generate ROS owing to the degradation of FFP by the stimulated release of HClO in phagocytes. The selective activation of fluorescence and photosensitization is successfully confirmed by both in vitro and in vivo results, demonstrating the effectiveness and theranostic potential of DTF-FFP NPs in precise bacterial therapy.","Wu, Min; Wu, Wenbo; Duan, Yukun; Liu, Xingang; Wang, Meng; Phan, Chi Uyen; Qi, Guobin; Tang, Guping; Liu, Bin",Advanced materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202005222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079417/,161

Older adults have been particularly hard hit, dying in disproportionately higher numbers, especially in long-term care facilities. Local, regional, and national government actions taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 have thus served, in part, to shield older adults from the virus, though not without adverse side effects, including increased social isolation, enhanced economic risk, revealed ageism, delayed medical treatment, and challenges getting basic needs met.

In doing so, we argue that we are currently presented with a window of opportunity to better address the social determinants of health. First, through assessing the problem stream, an understanding of inequity as a problem gained wider recognition through the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19. Second, in the policy stream, we demonstrate that appropriate and unprecedented policies can be enacted even in the face of changing evidence or evidentiary uncertainty, which are needed to address upstream factors that influence health. Lastly, in the politics stream, we demonstrate that addressing a public health 'problem' can be well-received by the public, making it politically viable. However, it is important to ensure the 'problem' is clearly relayed to the public and that this information is not perceived to change, as this can undermine trust. The social, political, and behavioural lessons presented by the COVID-19 pandemic should be drawn on in this pivotal moment for global public health.","Amri, Michelle M; Logan, Dilani",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1925942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34044747/,161

There have been a number of published studies over the last decade, which explores the feasibility of minimally invasive techniques in breast cancer treatment. In this review, we will discuss the most recent data on radiofrequency ablation and examine the current methods, outcomes, complications, and limitations of RFA in breast cancer therapy. METHODS Pub Med search for English Language articles on RFA in breast cancer. RESULTS More than 25 studies were reviewed and we searched for number of tumors, average size, electrode used, if they successfully ablated the tumor, when the tumor was then resected and if the patients experienced any complication from the ablation. CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency ablation is an emerging minimally invasive therapy in small, localized breast cancer. Currently, no clinical trials have been published to directly compare RFA to the current standard of surgical resection. Ultimately, RFA will need clinical trials to evaluate oncologic outcomes involving long interval follow-up to determine survival, local control and disease progression before it becomes a reasonable alternative to surgical resection.","Nguyen, Tiffany; Hattery, Eleanor; Khatri, Vijay P",Gland surgery,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2227-684x.2014.03.05; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25083506/,161

Resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) of the CNS tissue under appropriate conditions are mobilized to proliferate, migrate, and differentiate, in order to produce new myelin sheaths in the demyelinated lesion. In multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common immune-mediated demyelinating disease, remyelination efficiency declines with increasing age and disease duration. As myelin regeneration attempts in clinical trials so far are scarce, and have been met with limited success, the need to explore new remyelinating strategies is more compelling. Recently, ageing and cellular senescence have been implicated to the pathophysiology of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis. Evidence on OPC senescence brings forward the possibility of exploiting cellular senescence as a possible target for promoting the endogenous remyelinating capacity of the CNS. Here we discuss the data indicating how cellular senescence affects remyelination, and the putative benefits to be drawn through the use of senolytic or senomorphic therapies targeting senescent cell populations in MS.","Koutsoudaki, Paraskevi N; Papadopoulos, Dimitrios; Passias, Panagiotis-Georgios; Koutsoudaki, Pinelopi; Gorgoulis, Vassilis G",Mechanisms of ageing and development,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mad.2020.111366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991921/,161

Known risk factors for PSVT include malignancy and splenomegaly. While these patients are believed to be hypercoagulable, the specific mechanism is unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether specific acquired prothrombotic risk factors contribute to the development of PSVT following laparoscopic splenectomy (LS). METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing LS were prospectively studied between 2005 and 2013. Preoperatively, patients were screened for prothrombotic states and surveillance duplex ultrasonography was performed between 1 week and 1 month postoperatively to assess for PSVT. The association between baseline prothrombotic disorders and PSVT was explored using descriptive statistics. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients were included in the analysis, and 17 (25 %) of these developed PSVT. There were no differences in patients with and without PSVT with respect to age, body mass index, gender or surgical time. Preoperative spleen size, as determined by diagnostic imaging, and intraoperative blood transfusion were associated with PSVT. Seven of 9 patients (78 %) with massive splenomegaly (>20 cm) developed PSVT compared with 4 of 13 patients (31 %) with moderate splenomegaly (15-20 cm) and 6 of 45 patients (13 %) without (p < 0.001). Abnormalities in baseline prothrombotic screening tests were common, with 52 patients (75 %) demonstrating at least one; however, none were associated with the development of PSVT.

Social media has also been used to communicate information between public health organizations and reinforce consistent messaging about enduring threats to public health. It has been applied with some success to coordinate of disaster response and for keeping the public informed during other emergency situations. However, social media has also been weaponized against the public health community to spread disinformation and misinformation, and the public health community has yet to devise a successful strategy to mitigate this destructive use of social media.

Although iron and folic acid (IFA) supplements were available free of charge, coverage among pregnant women was very low. In response, the Government of Nepal launched the Iron Intensification Programme (IIP) in 2003 to improve the coverage of IFA supplementation and anthelminthic treatment during pregnancy, as well as promote the utilization of antenatal care. This review examined how the IIP programme contributed to Nepal's success in increasing the consumption of IFA supplements during pregnancy. Nepal's cadre of Female Community Health Volunteers were engaged in the IIP to support the community-based distribution of IFA supplements to pregnant women and complement IFA distribution through health facilities and outreach services. As a result, the country achieved a fourfold increase in the proportion of women who took IFA supplements during pregnancy between 2001 and 2016 (from 23% to 91%) and a 12-fold increase in the proportion who took IFA supplements for at least 90 days during pregnancy (from 6% to 71%).

137700,Acute Epiglottitis Due to COVID-19 Infection.,2021,"OBJECTIVE Studies have suggested that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears to be more serious in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. This meta-analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Embase, and Google Scholar on 16 October 2020, to identify observational studies that provided data on gastrointestinal symptoms and severity of COVID-19. Gastrointestinal symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The severe rate and the odds ratio (OR) were pooled. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. RESULTS A total of 21 studies with 5285 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The severe rate of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea was 41.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 31.0-51.5%], and the OR of association between diarrhea and severe COVID-19 was 1.41 (95% CI: 1.05-1.89); sensitivity analysis showed that the results for the OR and 95% CI were unstable. For abdominal pain, the severe rate and OR of association with severe COVID-19 were 59.3% (95% CI: 41.3-76.4%) and 2.76 (95% CI: 1.59-4.81), respectively; for nausea, 41.4% (95% CI: 23.2-60.7%) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.59-1.43), respectively; for vomiting, 51.3% (95% CI: 36.8-65.8%) and 1.68 (95% CI: 0.97-2.92), respectively. CONCLUSION The severe rate was more than 40% in COVID-19 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Abdominal pain was associated with a near 2.8-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19; the relationship between diarrhea and the severity of COVID-19 was regionally different; nausea and vomiting were limited in association with an increased risk of severe COVID-19.","Zeng, Weibiao; Qi, Kai; Ye, Miao; Zheng, Li; Liu, Xinliang; Hu, Sheng; Zhang, Wenxiong; Tang, Wenjing; Xu, Jianjun; Yu, Dongliang; Wei, Yiping",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000002072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33470700/,161

Several reports have described the gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations in the infected patients. The systematic review was designed to highlight the gaps in our knowledge about the prevalence and clinical significance of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19. METHODS We searched PubMed database and Google articles published in both English and Chinese up to June 3, 2020, using search terms ""Clinical features"", ""2019 novel coronavirus"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""COVID-19"", or ""SARS-Cov-2"". Observational studies, case reports or letters describing the clinical features or observational studies regarding the detection and/or isolation of SARS-Cov-2 viruses in stools were included. RESULTS A total of 22 publications were finally selected. It was reported that GI symptoms occurred in about 3%-40.7% of patients. GI manifestations included nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, belching, abdominal distension and GI haemorrhage. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom. Infected patients had various degrees of liver dysfunction, and the severity of liver dysfunction was significantly associated with the severity of the disease. Therapy focusing on digestive system like liver supportive therapy or nutrition support or probiotics have been demonstrated to be effective interventions, which greatly improve prognosis. Fecal-oral transmission route is a potential risk for transmission. CONCLUSIONS GI symptoms are common in COVID-19. Strengthening the recognition on abnormalities in digestive system of patients with COVID-19 is crucial for early identification and timely treatment, especially for those atypical patients. Hygiene protection and keep drainpipe free-flowing are necessary for everyone.","Ye, Lei; Yang, Zhao; Liu, Jiong; Liao, Lianming; Wang, Fangyu",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33150978/,161

The main aim was to assess the association of complete blood indices measured at baseline with COVID-19 related in-hospital clinical outcomes, including length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, receiving mechanical ventilation, degree of lung injury and in-hospital death, and post-recovery status. This retrospective study included patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 infection from August 20, to September 25, 2020. The initial study cohort included 127 patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. Of whom 26 patients were excluded, leaving 101 patients for final analysis. low lymphocytes % [Odds ratio and confidence intervals = OR (CI)] [0.2(0.0-0.2, p=0.03] increased the odds of ICU stay length while high platelet mean volume (PMV) [0.9 (1.1-5, p<0.00], high platelet distribution width (PDW) [0.3(0.4-1.9), p<0.00], and low lymphocytes % [0.2 (0.0-0.2), p=0.02] increased the odds of length of hospital stay. Decreased lymphocytes % showed significant independent association with increased risk for mechanical ventilation use [0.9 (0.9-1), p=0.04], extensive degree of lung injury [0.2 (0.1-0.7), p<0.00], and in-hospital death [0.5 (0.3-0.8), p=0.01]. High lymphocytes %[0.9 (0.9-1), p<0.00] and high PMV [0.3 (0.3-0.8), p=0.02] were significantly associated with complete recovery while increased neutrophil % [1 (1-1.1), p=0.04] was associated with increased risk for post recovery fatigue. In conclusion, low lymphocytes % and high neutrophil % are useful markers for predicting adverse in-hospital outcome and post-recovery persistent fatigue, respectively.

Methods: From February 2018 to June 2019, 16 patients were diagnosed with LPH in our hospital were included in this study. All patients received PPP and BTA treatment to expand abdominal volume and extend abdominal muscle before surgery. The laparoscopic Sugarbaker method was preferred for defect close. Results: Before and after PPP and BTA, the mean volume of the parastomal hernia (VPH) was 1,522 and 1,644 cc, respectively (P < 0.01), and the mean volume of the abdominal cavity (VAC) was 5,847 and 9,408 cc, respectively (P < 0.01). The VPH/VAC ratio was decreased by an average of 8.4% after the combination management. And the lateral abdominal muscle length was increased by an average of 4.8 cm/side (P < 0.01). These patients underwent surgery successfully, and no hernia recurrence after (17.6 ± 2.4) months of follow-up.

146696,COVID-19 and Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System: A Pharmacogenomic View.,2021,"OBJECTIVES To report descriptive statistics for minor parotidectomy complications. METHODS A systematic review was performed, selecting 235 studies for analysis. The incidence of complications was tabulated, and descriptive statistics calculated. Outlier studies, 1 standard deviation above the mean, were reexamined to determine potential causal factors for each complication. All studies were examined for statistically significant differences for any potential causal factor. RESULTS The pooled incidence of minor complications reported were hematoma 2.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-3.5), wound infection 2.3% (95% CI: 1.8-2.9), sialocele 4.5% (95% CI: 3.5-5.7), salivary fistula 3.1% (95% CI: 2.6-3.7), flap necrosis 1.7% (95% CI: 1.1-2.5), scar issues 3.6% (95% CI: 2.4-5.4), numbness 33.9% (95% CI: 25.6-43.4), and deformity 11.8 (95% CI: 6.9-19.5). Implants result in more wound complications, such as hematoma, sialocele, or salivary fistula. Sialocele and salivary fistula appear more frequently after less extensive parotid surgery, whereas hematoma, wound infections, flap necrosis, and aesthetic considerations are worse with more extensive resections. CONCLUSIONS Minor parotidectomy complications are more frequent than generally assumed and related to certain factors that should be investigated.

In search of new diagnostic tools, focus has shifted towards the biological properties of the HNSCC, and the number of different biomarkers under investigation is rapidly growing. OBJECTIVES The objective was to review the current literature regarding aberrantly methylated DNA found in peripheral blood plasma or serum in patients with HNSCC and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these changes. METHODS The inclusion criteria were clinical studies involving patients with verified HNSCC that reported findings of aberrantly methylated DNA in peripheral blood serum or plasma. We systematically searched PubMed, OVID Embase and Cochrane Library. In addition to the search, we performed forward and backward chaining in references and Web of Science. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO: CRD42019135406. Two authors independently extracted data. The quality and the risk of bias of the included studies were assessed by the QUADAS-2 tool. RESULTS A total of 1,743 studies were found eligible for screening, while ultimately seven studies were included. All studies were found to have methodological weaknesses, mainly concerning patient selection bias. The best individual marker of HNSCC was Septin 9 in plasma with a sensitivity of 57% and a specificity of 95%. CONCLUSIONS None of the aberrantly methylated genes found in the retrieved studies are applicable as single diagnostic markers for HNSCC and the best gene-panels still lack diagnostic accuracy. Future studies may benefit from newer sequencing techniques but validation studies with well-designed cohorts are also needed in the process of developing epigenetic based diagnostic tests for HNSCC.","Danstrup, Christian Sander; Marcussen, Mette; Pedersen, Inge Søkilde; Jacobsen, Henrik; Dybkær, Karen; Gaihede, Michael",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332423/,161

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the extent to which AI systems in primary care examine the inherent bias toward or against vulnerable populations and appraise how these systems have mitigated the impact of such biases during their development. METHODS We will conduct a search update from an existing scoping review to identify studies on AI and primary care in the following databases: Medline-OVID, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, MathSciNet, AAAI, and arXiv. Two screeners will independently review all abstracts, titles, and full-text articles. The team will extract data using a structured data extraction form and synthesize the results in accordance with PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. RESULTS This review will provide an assessment of the current state of health care equity within AI for primary care. Specifically, we will identify the degree to which vulnerable patients have been included, assess how bias is interpreted and documented, and understand the extent to which harmful biases are addressed. As of October 2020, the scoping review is in the title- and abstract-screening stage. The results are expected to be submitted for publication in fall 2021. CONCLUSIONS AI applications in primary care are becoming an increasingly common tool in health care delivery and in preventative care efforts for underserved populations.

Clustering of ANCA-associated vasculitis: single-centre observation of a spatiotemporal pattern'.,2021-01-06,"Dairy calves are routinely disbudded by cauterization with a hot iron. To mitigate the intra-operative and initial post-operative pain associated with this procedure some farmers provide calves general and local anesthetics, but it is unknown if the procedure remains aversive. We used a place-conditioning paradigm to assess aversion caused by hot-iron cautery with a local anesthetic compared to a sham procedure. A test area was divided into three equally sized pens: two 'treatment' pens with distinct visual cues were connected by a central 'neutral' pen. Each calf went through the disbudding procedure and a 6-h recovery period in one treatment pen and the control procedure in the other treatment pen. In three tests (48, 72 and 96 h after the second treatment), calves could freely roam among the pens until they chose to lie down, ending the session. Calves spent less time in either of the treatment pens compared to the central pen. When only comparing the two treatment pen, calves spent less time in the disbudding pen, especially during the first test. Calves were also less likely to lie down in the pen associated with the disbudding procedure. We conclude that even with the use of a local anesthetic, hot-iron disbudding is salient and aversive for calves, indicating the need to refine or avoid the procedure.","Ede, Thomas; Lecorps, Benjamin; von Keyserlingk, Marina A G; Weary, Daniel M",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41798-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926934/,161

METHODS PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI and Wanfang databases were searched. We selected studies ensuring that diagnosis of ICBs in PD patients depends on semi-structured interviews according to the clinical diagnostic criteria of ICBs. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate quality of the included studies. The analyzed factors included demographic information, clinical characteristics of PD and medications. RESULTS A total of 856 records were screened and 66 full texts were evaluated, and 13 studies (684 PD patients with ICBs [PD-ICBs] and 3,382 PD patients without ICBs [PD-non-ICBs]) were included. Compared with PD-non-ICBs, PD-ICBs were younger in age (- 3.7 [- 5.53, - 1.87], P < 0.0001), with a greater proportion of males (1.64 [1.21, 2.22], P = 0.001), with a younger age of PD onset (- 5.42 [- 7.87, - 2.97], P < 0.0001) and a longer course of PD (1.30 [0.38, 2.22], P = 0.005). PD-ICBs were also associated with higher HAM-D (1.74 [0.47, 3.01], P = 0.007), more levodopa dosage (1.74 [1.09, 2.77], P = 0.02) and dopamine receptor agonists (DA) use (3.96 [2.74, 5.71), P < 0.00001), and higher average dose (levodopa 117.53 [53.59, 181.46], P = 0.0003; DA 80.03 [46.16, 113.90], P < 0.00001), as well as more amantadine use (2.20 [1.42, 3.40], P = 0.0004). The meta-analysis of most factors showed less heterogeneity, except age, age of onset, PD duration, Hoehn and Yahr stage, MMSE and drug dosage. However, whether rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, dyskinesia, genetic polymorphism and other factors are risk factors for PD-ICBs remains unclear. CONCLUSION This meta-analysis suggests that males, young, early disease onset, long disease duration, depression, dose of levodopa, dopamine receptor agonists and amantadine are risk factors of ICBs in PD patients.","Cao, Lanxiao; Xu, Tian; Zhao, Gaohua; Lv, Dayao; Lu, Jinyu; Zhao, Guohua",Journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-021-10724-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370054/,161

We continuously monitored the regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) in the brain, liver, and lower limb muscle during HD. The time course of changes in rSO2 ratios in each region was evaluated throughout HD. The rSO2 ratio was defined as the ratio of rSO2 value at t (min) during HD to the rSO2 value before HD. During the early phase of HD, blood pressure (BP) gradually decreased and both hepatic and lower limb muscle rSO2 ratios decreased with changes in BP, whereas the cerebral rSO2 ratio was relatively maintained. At around 90 min after HD initiation, the BP decreased to 71/46 mmHg (mean BP, 54 mmHg) and the previously maintained cerebral rSO2 ratio also suddenly decreased. Soon after the onset of IDH, ultrafiltration was stopped, normal saline was infused, and intravenous noradrenaline infusion was started. After the BP recovered, cerebral and hepatic rSO2 ratios improved, but the lower limb muscle rSO2 ratio remained low. After restarting ultrafiltration, improvement in the lower limb muscle rSO2 ratio was delayed, although cerebral and hepatic oxygenation were maintained.

Traumatic events like COVID-19 can often lead to significant resource loss and negatively affect mental health. As a result, people often go through various types of struggles, including those that are religious or spiritual (e.g., existential doubt). Also, in the wake of trauma, people often try to engage in coping strategies, including drawing on religious or spiritual resources, to work through negative emotions in the face of adversity. The current qualitative study explored religious and spiritual struggles and coping strategies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 172) described the types of religious and spiritual struggles they experienced, as well as the types of coping strategies they engaged in. Four themes of religious and spiritual struggles emerged: interpersonal struggles, moral struggles, doubt struggles, and ultimate meaning struggles. Four themes of coping strategies emerged: psychological coping, health-related coping, religious/spiritual (R/S) coping, and interpersonal/social coping. These themes suggested a wide range of R/S struggles and coping strategies and provided implications for the intersection between R/S and trauma as well as patterns of coping in a pandemic context.

In particular, the pandemic has had deleterious effects on students' mental health, leading to increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD;Healthy Minds Network & American College Health Association [HMN], 2020). Students' mental health has become a paramount concern to institutional leaders. As faculty, student affairs practitioners, administrators, and mental health providers brace for the impact of increasing numbers of students who experience mental health disorders in upcoming semesters, they may benefit from an enhanced understanding of the students who are likely to experience mental health disorders and of the roles that other stressors or supports can play in students' mental health. The unique context surrounding the pandemic may create conditions that alter previous research findings related to students' mental health. This study is to examine the associations between individual, interpersonal, institutional, health, and stress-related factors and undergraduates' risks for clinically significant MDD and GAD.","Soria, Krista M.; Horgos, Bonnie",Journal of College Student Development,https://doi.org/10.1353/csd.2021.0024,161

The excessive use of sedatives can lead to serious short- and long-term complications;conversely the inadequate management of pain and agitation can further complicate patients’ course of illness. Delirium is highly prevalent in critically ill patients, frequently underrecognized, and associated with adverse outcomes. Early mobilization can help reduce sedation use and may improve delirium management. In this chapter we address ideal sedation management in critically ill patients, and how it can positively impact patients wellbeing.","Carini, Federico C.; Ferreyro, Bruno L.; Mehta, Sangeeta",Encyclopedia of Respiratory Medicine (Second Edition),https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102723-3.00219-5,161

Professional learning in such an environment needs to be adjusted to become fast-paced, chunk-sized and self-directed for relevancy and efficiency. COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced the problem, making traditional classroom training unavailable and the efficiency of self-directed learning hard to evaluate. Microlearning approach provides small sized development opportunities for employees without spending lots of time outside their actual work and the opportunity to apply the new knowledge almost immediately to work situations. Learning analytics helps evaluate the need and effectiveness of microlearning, it is useful in training situations that want to predict and manage the success of their students, but is harder to apply in professional environment because of how indicators for learning results translate to success in work situations. The paper describes the initial results of a case study of development and implementation of work-related microlearning modules and training tests and the use of learning analytics to predict the training results based on progress and to supply the managers with information for decision making. In this case participation in microlearning activities and positive attitude towards them was linked to increased test scores suggesting that it can be used for predicting employee success in work situations. © 2021 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.

However, the costs or benefits of geoengineering for human health are largely unknown. We project how geoengineering could impact malaria risk by comparing transmission suitability and populations-at-risk today against moderate and high emissions scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) with and without geoengineering over the next half-century. We show that if geoengineering deployment cools the tropics, it could help protect high elevation populations in eastern Africa from the encroachment of malaria, but could increase transmission in lowland sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Compared to extreme warming, we also find that by 2070, geoengineering would nullify a projected reduction of nearly one billion people at risk of malaria. Our results indicate that geoengineering strategies designed to offset warming are not guaranteed to unilaterally improve health outcomes, and could produce regional trade-offs among Global South countries that are often excluded from geoengineering conversations.","Carlson, C.

Emergency Medical Professionals are first responders and hence bear the brunt of exposure to the virus as well as dealing with critically ill patients. The aim of the study is to assess psychological resilience towards COVID 19 amongst Emergency Medical Professionals. Study Design: Descriptive Study. Place and Duration of Study: Symbiosis Centre for Health Skills, Pune in April 2021. Methodology: The study was conducted amongst 120 Emergency Medical Professionals in Pune, India. The data was collected during the month of April 2021. Professionals who have completed Post Graduate Diploma in Emergency Medical Services and working in COVID centres for at least one year were included in the study. A 38-item questionnaire was developed for frontline Emergency Medical Professionals and included questions adapted from the tools which are available in public domain. Results and Discussion: Working in a stressful environment along with continuous fear of self-exposure and risk of transmission to family members affects the efficacy and productivity of Emergency Medical Services Professionals. Debriefing, training for effective 'breaking bad news' stress management workshops and counselling sessions should be integrated into their work routine to enhance their psychological capacity. Conclusion: The findings indicate that even after a year of serving COVID 19 patients, Emergency Medical Professionals demonstrate a high degree of resilience. Yet there are areas requiring improvement which need to be focussed upon immediately in the interest of the mental well-being of Emergency Medical Professionals.","Rishipathak, P.; Vijayraghavan, S.; Hinduja, A.",Journal of Pharmaceutical Research International,https://doi.org/10.9734/jpri/2021/v33i42a32379,161

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of infection among HCW in medical disciplines with AGP. Design: A nationwide questionnaire-based study in in- and outpatient settings was conducted between 12/16/2020 and 01/24/2021. Data on SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCW and potential risk factors were investigated. Results: 2,070 healthcare facilities with 25,113 employees were included in the study. Despite a higher rate of pre-interventional testing, clinics treated three times more confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases than private practices (28.8% vs. 88.4%, p<0.001). Overall infection rate among HCW accounted for 4.7%. Multivariate analysis revealed that ZIP-regions having comparably higher incidences were significantly associated with increased risk of infection. Furthermore, clinical setting and the GIE specialty have more than double the risk of infection (OR 2.63; 95% CI 2.501-2.817, p<0.01 and OR 2.35; 95% CI 2.245-2.498, p<0.01). The number of procedures performed per day was also significantly associated with an increased risk of infection (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.007-1.014), p<0.01). No treatment of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases was tending to lower the risk of infection (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.507-1.025, p=0.068). Conclusion: HCW in GIE seem to be at higher risk of infection than those in other AGP, especially in the clinical setting.

Theory predicts that FPUC should decrease job applications, while the effect on vacancy creation is ambiguous. We estimate the effect of FPUC on job applications and vacancy creation week by week, from March to July 2020, using granular data from the online jobs platform Glassdoor. We exploit variation in the proportional increase in benefits across local labor markets. To isolate the effect of FPUC, we flexibly allow for different trends in local labor markets differentially exposed to the COVID-19 crisis. We verify that trends in outcomes prior to the FPUC do not correlate with future increases in benefits, which supports our identification assumption. First, we find that a 10% increase in unemployment benefits caused a 3.6% decline in applications, but did not decrease vacancy creation;hence, FPUC increased labor market tightness (vacancies/applications). Second, we document that tightness was unusually depressed during the FPUC period. Altogether, our results imply that the positive effect of FPUC on tightness was likely welfare improving: FPUC decreased competition among applicants at a time when jobs were unusually scarce. Our results also help explain prior findings that FPUC did not decrease employment.","Marinescu, Ioana Skandalis Daphné Zhao Daniel",Journal of Public Economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2021.104471,161

170601,Impact of COVID19 in spondyloarthritis (SPA) patients in a Tertiary Hospital,2021,"Genomic surveillance in the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has the potential to identify emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains that may be more transmissible, virulent, evade detection by standard diagnostic tests, or vaccine escapes. The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 strain from southern England to other parts of the country and globe is a clear example of the impact of such strains. Early discovery of the B.1.1.7 strain was enabled through the proactive COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) program and the UKs commitment to genomic surveillance, sequencing about 10% of positive samples.1 In order to enact more aggressive public health measures to minimize the spread of such strains, genomic surveillance needs to be of sufficient scale to detect early emergence and expansion in the broader virus population. By modeling common performance characteristics of available diagnostic and sequencing tests, we developed a model that assesses the sampling required to detect emerging strains when they are less than 1% of all strains in a population. This model demonstrates that 5% sampling of all positive tests allows the detection of emerging strains when they are a prevalence of 0.1% to 1.0%. While each country will determine their risk tolerance for the emergence of novel strains, as vaccines are distributed and we work to end the pandemic and prevent future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, genomic surveillance will be an integral part of success.","Vavrek, Darcy; Speroni, Lucia; Curnow, Kirsten J; Oberholzer, Michael; Moeder, Vanessa; Febbo, Phillip G",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.12.21249613,161

Although several such tools have already been developed, few focus on the probability of entry of an exotic pathogen into a territory and even fewer are able to rank multiple pathogens at the same time. We developed a semi-quantitative multi-criteria model to estimate the probability of incursion of an exotic pathogen into a European country and use Italy as a case study. We consider the import of 37 animal diseases of importance to Italy, based on OIE notification guidelines, and determine a disease status around the world based on current country-level reporting to the OIE. We identify seven possible pathways for the introduction of a pathogen and for each of them we determine a scoring system to assess for each disease the probability of introduction via each pathway. These scores, alongside the disease status, are used to calculate an overall risk score for each pathogen. The results indicate that the risk of incursion of Echinococcus multilocularis, African swine fever virus, Trichinella sp., lumpy skin disease and foot and mouth disease virus are ranked the highest. Additional analyses identified that the disease ranking is sensitive to the relative importance of the pathways of entry and also the impact of potential mitigation measures. The model is designed to be periodically updated with new data as they become available, e.g. global disease prevalence and trade volume. Therefore, it can be used by official authorities on a regular basis to obtain up-to-date results and consequentially strengthen surveillance towards those pathogens with the highest probability of entry.","Condoleo, Roberto Taylor Rachel A.; Simons, Robin R.

In the particular case of the broadcasting business, this potential threat combines with the drastic changes brought by the advent of digital platforms and on-line contents, setting a new scenario of uncertainty. The traditional engagement of the audience and the TVs and society relationship is at stake, and the 70 years old business model we know may be coming to an end. Indeed, the TV business has already evolved to be more economically resilient. The lessons learnt with the past crisis in 2008–2011, were harsh for all and fatal for some. The case for regional broadcasting appears to be especially interesting to study since it gathers two different managerial approaches, public (classic) and private (outsourced), with their corresponding views and actions to endure the crisis. Even though the whole sector was strongly hit by the crisis, the management model adopted by the companies had a notable influence in how they reacted to the crisis, and how they found themselves in the aftermath, bringing precious information on how to confront the incoming COVID-19 crisis. This paper looks to extract the lessons learnt by Spanish regional TVs managing finance and credibility, in order to determine which strategy could be the most advisable to adopt in face of the coming challenges for the sector from both the managerial and stakeholders’ perspective. The paper results show how the management model adopted and the subsequent financial decisions and communication strategy, together with the level of transparency are key elements to become more resilient and be ready to tackle the future scenario of broadcasting.

An ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 called as coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), has forced people towards digital transaction of data all over the world. Telemedicine allows health care service providers to evaluate, diagnose and treat patients at a distance using telecommunications tools and technology. Patients communicate the medical reports, medical images and related documents by email. Data that carries PHI information, is communicated via public networks in the form of image and are vulnerable. An effective encryption technique is always in need to transfer such information securely. Visual Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme is an efficient encryption scheme that decodes the image by dividing into number of shares. Individual shares do not reveal any secret and stacking of all shares can reveal the secret image. In this article, Semantic Visual Secret Sharing scheme (SVSS) is proposed, which can be applicable for both gray-scale and color images. In this SVSS, the secret color image I is converted into semantic image SI by reducing the pixel errors. This SI decreases the encoding complexity without affecting the quality. The proposed SVSS avoids pixel expansion issues faced by traditional VSS schemes. Also, the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) value of the reconstructed secret color image shows better quality of the reconstructed secret image. The pixel errors that get introduced during share generation phase is reduced. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed SVSS and ensures secure transmission.","Blesswin, A.

To this end, an integrative review was carried out in June 2020, with the axes used to categorize ethics, pandemic, global health, prevention, protection, prudence and precaution. The data of the present study, in the section provided by the analysis of 159 articles, allowed to characterize the ethical perspective of pandemics in the scientific environment. The low adherence in the discussion and reflection on the ethical foundations that guide decisions before, during and after pandemics illustrate the existence of gaps that can potentiate risks at all levels.

181934,Treatment access and adherence during social preventive and mandatory isolation in argentinian patients with spondylarthritis,2021,"Purpose: This paper aims to underscore major opportunities for shared value innovation based on data management efficiency, which has often been overlooked so far. By integrating prior research about digital transformation, shared value creation, entrepreneurial marketing and the innovation-based view of firm performance, it addresses a major gap in the literature. Design/methodology/approach: The innovation-based arguments illustrate how efficient data management may lead to different types of innovation, which provide opportunities for growth and efficiency gains after the coronavirus pandemic. Findings: Many companies’ digitalization programs have concentrated on strengthening the efficiency of current business processes. Thus, these initiatives have contributed to the efficiency of traditional analog activities by using data and smart algorithms. In contrast, the efficiency of the underlying data management was largely neglected, but the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted its importance. To overcome the limited emphasis on sustainability and efficiency in the digital context, this paper focuses on data management efficiency. After detailing this concept, it is linked to the growing literature about creating shared value, and a process segmentation for implementing shared value innovations in the field of digital efficiency is developed. Originality/value: The paper extends research into digital transformation by emphasizing that the distinction of effectiveness and efficiency is as relevant in the digital context as in the traditional analog environment. It further provides new insights into creating shared value because it increases the awareness of researchers and managers to consider data management efficiency as a basis for shared value innovation with positive effects on the triple bottom line. The paper also contributes to entrepreneurial marketing research because data management efficiency provides significant opportunities for entrepreneurs, startup firms and innovators in established organizations to develop entirely new markets based on new services, solutions and business models.

184662,Montelukast and Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Scoping Review.,2021-08-07,"With the widespread prevalence of trauma in schools due to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and exacerbated by COVID-19, teachers are faced with a myriad of challenges, both in their professional and personal lives. Resilience can help teachers cope with these challenges. Resilience is the ability to adapt well, cope, and rebound in the face of challenges. Resilience is the inner strength we all have that helps us deal with challenges in healthy ways. The strength of our resilience tends to ebb and flow;there are times that you will be more resilient than other times. Being resilient does not mean that you won’t experience stress or difficulties. But you’ll be able to harness your strengths to effectively adapt and deal with them, learn, and grow. The behaviors, thoughts, and actions associated with resilience can be learned, developed, and strengthened.","Wuest, Deborah A.; Subramaniam, Prithwi Raj",Strategies,https://doi.org/10.1080/08924562.2021.1948476,161
188484,Non-invasive versus invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure in severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2005,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic creates unique challenges for healthcare systems. While mass casualty protocols and plans exist for trauma-induced large-scale resource utilization events, contagious infectious disease mass casualty events do not have such rigorous procedures established. COVID-19 forces Emergency Departments (EDs) to simultaneously treat seriously ill patients and evaluate large influxes of 'worried well'-while maintaining both staff and patient safety. METHODS The objectives of this project are to create an avenue to evaluate large surges of patients while minimizing hospital-acquired infections. After identifying areas for improvement and anticipating potential failures, we devised eight healthcare delivery innovations to address those areas and meet our objectives: (1) Parallel ED Lanes (2) Universal Respiratory Precautions (3) Respiratory Drive Through (RDT) (4) Medical Company (5) Provider Triage (6) ED Quarterback Patient Liaison (EDQB) (7) Virtual Registration (8) Virtual Ward. RESULTS To date, no staff members have contracted COVID-19 within the ED footprint. Our RDT has seen 16,994 patients and the medical company 1,109. Provider triage has redirected 465 patients, while our EDQB has interacted with 532 and redirected 93 patients for same-day appointments with their Primary Care Manager (PCM). CONCLUSION The system of care establish at our Military Treatment Facility (MTF) has been effective in maximizing staff and patient safety, while providing a new patient-centered healthcare delivery apparatus.","Gragg, James I; Miller, Joel A; Donham, Benjamin P; Allen, Sean; Hall, Brian T; Malish, Richard G",Medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33666910/,161

201601,18th Annual ENETS Conference for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Neuroendocrine Tumor Disease 25 - 27 February 2021,2021,"The spike protein (S; surface projection) of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain M41 comprises two glycopolypeptides, S1 (mol. wt. 90 X 10(3] and S2 (mol. wt. 84 X 10(3], in equimolar proportions. The apparent mol. wt. of S was calculated as 354 (+/- 17) X 10(3) following co-sedimentation with catalase in sucrose gradients. Incubation of radiolabelled IBV with urea resulted in the removal of most S1, but none of S2, from the virus particle. A similar result was obtained using low concentrations of SDS, although some nucleocapsid, but not matrix, protein was also released. 2% SDS alone was as effective as 2% SDS plus 2% 2-mercaptoethanol for the separation of S1 and S2 prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Dithiothreitol did not remove S from virions but did decrease the buoyant density of the virus from 1.18 g/ml to 1.16 g/ml, and changed the configuration of S. It is concluded that IBV S protein is an oligomer comprising two copies of each of S1 and S2, although the possibility that there are three copies of each glycopolypeptide cannot be discounted. S is attached to the membrane by S2, while S1 has little or no contact with the membrane and may form the major part of the bulbous end of S. Interpeptide disulphide bonds do not occur in S, and the association of S1 and S2 is weak.","Cavanagh, D",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6319549/,161

States must have agreements in place to ensure mutual aid to facilitate effective responses to public health emergencies and to detect and control potential infectious disease outbreaks. The 2005 hurricanes triggered activation of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), a mutual aid agreement among the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Although EMAC facilitated the movement of an unprecedented amount of mutual aid to disaster areas, inadequacies in the response demonstrated a need for improvement. Mutual aid may also be beneficial in circumstances where EMAC is not activated.

DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING Outpatient clinic of a rehabilitation department. PARTICIPANTS Patients, more than three months post stroke, with hemiplegic shoulder pain associated with shoulder adductor and elbow flexor spasticity, randomly assigned to BT-A or placebo. INTERVENTION One-time injection of BT-A (500 units) into the pectoralis major and biceps brachii on the hemiplegic side. MAIN MEASURES Visual analogue scale of shoulder pain (0 -10), shoulder adductor and elbow flexor tone using the Ashworth Scale and passive range of shoulder abduction. These were assessed at baseline, four weeks, eight weeks and 12 weeks post injection. RESULTS Seventeen patients were enrolled, eight in the BT-A group and nine in the placebo group. At baseline, the median visual analogue scale score for shoulder pain was 6, the median Ashworth Scale shoulder adductor and elbow flexor spasticity score was 2 and the median range of shoulder abduction 76 degrees. Subjects who received BT-A showed significantly greater improvements in median shoulder adductor and elbow flexor Ashworth Scale scores than placebo at week 4 (P B / 0.01) but not at week 8 and 12. For shoulder pain and passive shoulder abduction range, all subjects showed postinjection improvements and no difference could be demonstrated between the two groups. DISCUSSION Possible reasons for the negative finding in this study include the small sample size and the presence of causes of shoulder pain not related to spasticity which could have confounded outcome.","Kong, Keng-He; Neo, Jong-Jong; Chua, Karen Sg",Clinical rehabilitation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17213238/,161
203658,Asthma in patients with suspected and diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019,2021,"CD8+ T cells are crucial for anti-viral immunity, however, understanding T cell responses requires the identification of epitopes presented by Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). To date, few SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes have been described. Internal viral proteins are typically more conserved than surface proteins and are often the target of CD8+ T cells. Therefore, we have characterised eight peptides derived from the internal SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01, the most common HLA molecule in the global population. We determined not all peptides could form a complex with HLA-A*02:01, and the six crystal structures determined revealed that some peptides adopted a mobile conformation. We therefore provide a molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cell epitopes. Furthermore, we show that there is limited pre-existing CD8+ T cell response towards these epitopes in unexposed individuals. Together, these data show that SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid might not contain potent epitopes restricted to HLA-A*02:01.","Szeto, Christopher; Chatzileontiadou, Demetra S M; Nguyen, Andrea T; Sloane, Hannah; Lobos, Christian A; Jayasinghe, Dhilshan; Halim, Hanim; Smith, Corey; Riboldi-Tunnicliffe, Alan; Grant, Emma J; Gras, Stephanie",iScience,,161

The technology is widely implemented as a security mechanism in the area such as public surveillance and mobile communication to identify the identity of a person. Today, wearing a face mask is mandatory during COVID-19 pandemic. However, it has become challenging for facial recognition technology to recognize the identity of a person wearing a face mask. This preliminary study set out to develop and measure the effectiveness of a face recognition system to identify the identity of a person with a face mask. The system uses a deep learning model for face mask detection and Procrustes analysis to measure the face identity similarity. A combination of standard face recognition performance measures was used to measure the effectiveness of the system. A self-obtained dataset consists of 35 images of persons with a face mask from different identity background was investigated. The results indicate that the system effectively recognizes the identity of a person with a face mask up to 97.14% accuracy. Despite its exploratory nature, this study offers some insight into face masked identity recognition. A natural progression of this work is to explore other types of face mask detection and similarity methods. © 2021 IEEE.","Mazli Shahar, M.

The use of IMV without ICU admission (non-ICU) in acute care hospitals in the US and its impact on patients' outcomes were not examined. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using statewide inpatient data in Texas to identify hospitalizations aged &#8805;18 years receiving IMV in acute care hospitals with ICU care capability during January 2014 through September 2015. Use of non-ICU IMV, patient characteristics, and hospital mortality were examined. RESULTS: Among 136,728 IMV hospitalizations, 4531 (3.3%) were non-ICU. As compared to ICU admissions, non-ICU IMV hospitalizations were younger (age 18-44 years: 24.9% vs. 17.2%), with lower burden of major comorbidities (no major comorbidity: 24.7% vs. 14.5%), and lower occurrence of non-respiratory organ failures (no non-respiratory organ failure: 32.7% vs. 19.8%). Risk-adjusted hospital mortality of non-ICU vs. ICU IMV hospitalizations was 48.7% (95% CI 48.1-49.4) and 29.9% (95% CI 29.8-30.0), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Non-ICU IMV was provided in 1 in 30 IMV hospitalizations in acute care hospitals. Although non-ICU IMV hospitalizations were younger and healthier than those admitted to ICU, their hospital mortality was markedly higher.","Oud, Lavi; Garza, John",J Crit Care,,161

The changing activity could effect on physical and mental health caused by student’s behavior during learning from home. Survey showed that 84% students of Industrial Engineering, Mulawarman University used smartphone while learning from home. Therefore, this study aimed to identify students’ behavior, to measure physical (i.e., musculoskeletal and visual fatique) and mental health (i.e., stress and smartphone addiction) problems that occurred when they were learning from home, as well as to suggest ergonomic recommendation for reducing the negative effects. At the time of the study, they were 155 students studied in the IE department and a total of 134 (86.45%) participated in the online survey. Musculoskeletal disorder was assessed using Nordic Body Map and visual fatique was evaluated using symptoms that were reported on previous studies. Additionally, Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were administered to identify smartphone addiction tendency and stress level respectively. The results showed that MSD occurred in left and right shoulder (95%), followed by upper neck (82.14%) and back (72.62%). 86% of participants experienced visual fatique with headache (71.55%), ache eye (68%) and dry eye (60.34%) symptoms. Subsequently, this survey revealed that 35% of the participants addicted to smartphone and 68.66% experienced moderate level of stress. To alleviate these physical problems, several ergonomic recommendations were proposed i.e., supporting the arm that holding the smartphone with the other hand, practicing the 20-20-20 rule and applying stop, drop and flop slogan. Moreover, cooperation among parents, students and lecturers was needed to create conducive learning environment so as the mental health problems could be minimized.","Fathimahhayati, Lina Dianati; Pawitra, Theresia Amelia; Tambunan, Willy",Operations Excellence: Journal Of Applied Industrial Engineering,,161

Paediatric surgery patient care could potentially benefit from these technologies. This systematic review summarises the current literature on the use of mHealth for postoperative care after children's surgery. METHODS: Seven databases were searched by a senior medical librarian. Studies were included if they reported the use of mHealth systems for postoperative care for children <18 years old. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed in duplicate. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included after screening. mHealth use was varied and included appointment or medication reminders, postoperative monitoring and postoperative instruction delivery. mHealth systems included texting systems and mobile applications, and were implemented for a wide range of surgical conditions and countries. DISCUSSION: Studies showed that mHealth systems can increase the postoperative follow-up appointment attendance rate (p < 0.001), decrease the rate of postoperative complications and returns to the emergency department and reliably monitor postoperative pain. mHealth systems were generally appreciated by patients. Most non-randomised and randomised studies had many methodological problems, including lack of appropriate control groups, lack of blinding and a tendency to devote more time to the care of the intervention group. mHealth systems have the potential to improve postoperative care, but the lack of high-quality research evaluating their impact calls for further studies exploring evidence-based mHealth implementation.","Nguyen, Nam; Leveille, Etienne; Guadagno, Elena; Kalisya, Luc Malemo; Poenaru, Dan",J Telemed Telecare,,161

Due to the improved prenatal diagnostic modalities, the diagnosis of cardiac disease is increasing in newborns. Fetal echocardiography is considered a good and accurate diagnostic method for congenital heart disease. Objective To study the common indications of fetal echocardiography and the detection of congenital heart disease in Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital. Method In this hospital-based, retrospective study, we reviewed medical records of 324 fetuses who were indicated for fetal echocardiography at Dhulikhel Hospital over 24 months period of time (September 1, 2017 to August 31, 2019). Result The mean age of pregnant women at presentation for fetal echocardiography was 30.7 ± 4.7 years. The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 28.9 ± 4.9 weeks. Among all the pregnant women, 208 (65%) presented during the second trimester and 112 (35%) presented during the third trimester. Maternal indications for fetal echocardiography were seen in48.12% cases, whereas fetal indications were seen in 42.81% cases. The most common indication was for maternal gestational diabetes (30.31%). Among the 324fetal echocardiography results, 65.43% cases had normal findings, echogenic intra-cardiac foci were seen in 18.82% and significant abnormal findings were seen in 15.74% of cases. Among all women having maternal indication for echocardiography, 34 (22.07%) fetus had some form of abnormal findings, whereas only 17 (12.40%) fetus with fetal indication showed abnormal findings (p < 0.05). Conclusion Indication of fetal echocardiography is increasing and can be a good diagnostic tool to improve prognosis and outcome of a newborn. It has become widely used in pediatric cardiology. Raising awareness is necessary regarding the importance of fetal echocardiography in the management and outcome of a newborn with cardiac anomalies.","Joshi, A; Shrestha, R P B; Shrestha, P S",Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),,161

211788,COVID-19 transmission in the U.S. before vs. after relaxation of statewide social distancing measures,2020,"BACKGROUND: DM is a common chronic metabolic disease. COVID-19 is an infectious disease infected by enveloped single-stranded RNA coronavirus. Meanwhile, DM is a common comorbidity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus can directly or indirectly damage the pancreatic islets and cause stress hyperglycemia by causing cytokine storms, acute inflammatory reactions, binding to the ACE2 receptor, etc. At the same time, hyperglycemia is a risk factor for severe infection and an independent risk factor for mild to severe disease. However, there is no evidence-based medicine to confirm the relationship between hyperglycemia and the infection of COVID-19 in diabetic patients. Therefore, we will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the existing clinical evidence. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will retrieve each database from December 2019 to July 2020. Chinese literature comes from CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, CBM databases. English literature mainly searches Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE. At the same time, we will look for clinical trial registration and gray literature. This study only included clinical randomized controlled trials. The reviewers independently conduct literature selection, data analysis, bias risk assessment, subgroup and sensitivity analysis. The primary outcomes include fasting blood glucose, 2-hour postprandial blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, fasting insulin, adverse effects, etc. Finally, we will conduct a meta-analysis through Review Manager software version 5.3. RESULTS: The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals. CONCLUSION: This study will explore the relationship between hyperglycemia and COVID-19 infection in diabetic patients. It will provide evidence-based support for clinical regulation of blood glucose and combating the COVID-19 epidemic.

215143,2020 Update on the Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone System in Pediatric Kidney Disease and Its Interactions with Coronavirus,2021,"Chest imaging is often used as a complementary tool in the evaluation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, helping physicians to augment their clinical suspicion. Despite not being diagnostic for COVID-19, chest CT may help clinicians to isolate high suspicion patients with suggestive imaging findings. However, COVID-19 findings on CT are also common to other pulmonary infections and non-infectious diseases, and radiologists and point-of-care physicians should be aware of possible mimickers. This state-of-the-art review goal is to summarize and illustrate possible etiologies that may have a similar pattern on chest CT as COVID-19. The review encompasses both infectious etiologies, such as non-COVID viral pneumonia, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pneumocystis jiroveci, and pulmonary granulomatous infectious, and non-infectious disorders, such as pulmonary embolism, fat embolism, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, non-specific interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.","Hochhegger, Bruno; Zanon, Matheus; Altmayer, Stephan; Mandelli, Nicole S; Stüker, Guilherme; Mohammed, Tan-Lucien; Verma, Nupur; Meirelles, Gustavo Souza Portes; Marchiori, Edson",Br J Radiol,,161

Here, we collected measures on perceived stress, resilience, and behavioral coping strategies, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a cross-sectional sample of 141 community dwelling older adults (mean age = 74.4 ± 8.4, 59% females) who were part of two longitudinal observational studies in Massachusetts, U.S. Our results indicate that participants demonstrated moderate levels of stress related to COVID-19 and showed relatively high levels of resilience. Higher resilience was associated with greater use of adaptive coping behaviors and less use of maladaptive coping behaviors. The use of maladaptive coping strategies was associated with more stress. Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that resilience was the strongest unique predictor of stress, thus, largely accounting for the observed coping-outcome associations. Individual differences in resilience levels moderated the effects of two coping strategies (planning and self-blame) on stress. Specifically, planning was associated with increased levels of stress for people with low resilience. In contrast, high personal resilience attenuated the negative effect of self-blame on their stress levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that resilience is critical for coping with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future approaches for augmenting resilience could prove to be important potential interventions to help support older adults navigating stressful situations as well as lessen adverse effects on neurocognitive and mental health in the future.","Vannini, Patrizia; Gagliardi, Geoffroy P; Kuppe, Madeline; Dossett, Michelle L; Donovan, Nancy J; Gatchel, Jennifer R; Quiroz, Yakeel T; Premnath, Pranitha Y; Amariglio, Rebecca; Sperling, Reisa A; Marshall, Gad A",J Psychiatr Res,,161

Multistage random sampling procedure was adopted for the primary survey and data was collected through face-to-face personal interview from 18,609 cattle and buffalo rearing farm households from 123 districts across twelve states and one Union Territory. Besides epidemiological parameters, different farm-level direct and indirect loss associated with FMD was assessed at disaggregated level (states) by employing deterministic mathematical models. Highest number of affected villages and disease incidence was observed in non- FMD control programme (FMD-CP) implemented Madhya Pradesh and Assam states, respectively whereas negligible incidence was in FMD-CP implemented Punjab state. The disease incidence was high during 2013-14 and declined during 2014-15 and 2015-16, respectively implied severe incidence scenario (2013-14) succeeded by moderate (2014-15) and mild (2015-16) scenarios. The crossbred and high productive animals were severely affected than local breeds whereas on sexwise and agewise comparison revealed higher incidence in females and adult animals. During severe incidence scenario, milk loss/animal ranged from USD 6.87-47.44, 18.42-125.88, 16.33-91.43, and 27.17-123.62; mortality loss/animal ranged from USD 32.61-804.27, 30.76-577.7, 65.36-502.2, and 188.04-413.7; distress sale loss/animal ranged from USD 3.22-188.63, 64.34-519.3, 214.47-341.8, and 209.11-450.3; and opportunity cost of labour/animal from USD 5.49-54.29, 5.49-67.78; 7.95-31.37 and 9.83-72.38 in indigenous cattle, crossbred cattle, local and improved buffalo, respectively. The estimated draught power loss/animal varied from USD 39.46-142.94 with least being in Madhya Pradesh and highest in Assam states whereas the median treatment cost/animal was USD 9.18 and USD 27.07 in indigenous cattle and upgraded buffaloes, respectively. The total farm-level economic loss projected due to FMD in cattle and buffaloes in India was USD 3159 million (INR 221,110 million), USD 270 million (INR 18,910 million) and USD 152 million (INR 10,610 million), respectively during the severe, moderate and mild incidence scenarios at 2015-16 constant prices. The loss varied across the states, and in severe incidence scenario, the country might lose USD 3.2 billion/year and hence, the bi-annual vaccination schedule need to be strictly implemented in all the states. Besides timely vaccination coverage, managing unabated animal movement, educating and motivating the farmers to vaccinate their animals might reduce the incidence and consequential losses to various stakeholders in endemic states like India.","G, Govindaraj; B, Ganesh Kumar; A, Krishnamohan; Hegde, Raveendra; Kumar, Nanda; Prabhakaran, Kokila; Wadhwan, Vinay Mohan; Kakker, Naresh; Lokhande, T; Sharma, Krishna; Kanani, Amit; K, Natchimuthu; Pn, Ananth; De, Arup Kumar; Khan, Tanveer Ahmed; Misri, Jyoti; Dash, B B; Pattnaik, Bramhadev; Habibur, Rahman",Prev Vet Med,,161

Adaptive intelligence is the ability to adapt to, shape, and select real-world environments in ways that result in positive outcomes not only for oneself, but also for others and the world. Edward Zigler was among the first to recognize the importance of levels of adaptation to intellectual deficiency, arguing from early on that intellectual challenges needed to be recognized not just in terms of IQ but also in terms of adaptive functioning. Adaptive intelligence is compared to and contrasted with general intelligence, which is usually defined as the first factor in a factor analysis of psychometric tests. I first introduce the main issues in the article. Then I discuss how one even would decide what intelligence is. Next I discuss broader theories of intelligence and especially the theory of adaptive intelligence. Then I talk about the perishability of theories of intelligence and other things-to what extent are they set up so that people are willing and able to move beyond them? Finally, I discuss how individual outcomes do not necessarily predict collective outcomes.","Sternberg, Robert J",Dev Psychopathol,,161

This critical situation necessitates novel formulations for already existing, FDA approved, but poorly absorbable drug candidates, such as niclosamide (NIC), which is of great relevance. In this context, we have rationally designed NIC-loaded hydrotalcite composite nanohybrids, which were further coated with Tween 60 or hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and characterized them in vitro. The optimized nanohybrids showed particle sizes &lt;300 nm and were orally administrated to rats to determine whether they could retain an optimum plasma therapeutic concentration of NIC that would be effective for treating COVID-19. The pharmacokinetic (PK) results clearly indicated that hydrotalcite-based NIC formulations could be highly potential options for treating the ongoing pandemic and we are on our way to understanding the in vivo anti-viral efficacy sooner. It is worth mentioning that hydrotalcite-NIC nanohybrids maintained a therapeutic NIC level, even above the required IC50 value, after just a single administration in 8-12 h. In conclusion, we were very successfully able to develop a NIC oral formulation by immobilizing with hydrotalcite nanoparticles, which were further coated with Tween 60 or HPMC, in order to enhance their emulsification in the gastrointestinal tract.","Choi, G.; Piao, H.; Rejinold, N.

Myocardial injury can be caused by direct or indirect damage, particularly mediated by a cytokine storm, a disordered immune response that can cause myocarditis, abnormal coagulation, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, and myocardial infarction. The present review focuses on the mechanisms of this viral infection, cardiac biomarkers, consequences, and the possible therapeutic role of purinergic and adenosinergic signalling systems. In particular, we focus on the interaction of the extracellular nucleotide adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with its receptors P2X1, P2X4, P2X7, P2Y1, and P2Y2 and of adenosine (Ado) with A2A and A3 receptors, as well as their roles in host immune responses. We suggest that receptors of purinergic signalling could be ideal candidates for pharmacological targeting to protect against myocardial injury caused by a cytokine storm in COVID-19, in order to reduce systemic inflammatory damage to cells and tissues, preventing the progression of the disease by modulating the immune response and improving patient quality of life.","Dos Anjos, Fernanda; Simões, Júlia Leão Batista; Assmann, Charles Elias; Carvalho, Fabiano Barbosa; Bagatini, Margarete Dulce",J Immunol Res,,161

However, the exclusive breastfeeding rate in China is low and decreasing. Mobile technologies have rapidly developed; communication apps such as WeChat (one of the largest social networking platforms in China) are widely used and have the potential to conveniently improve health behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of using WeChat to improve breastfeeding practices. METHODS: This 2-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted among pregnant women from May 2019 to April 2020 in Huzhu County, Qinghai Province, China. Pregnant women were eligible to participate if they were aged 18 years or older, were 11 to 37 weeks pregnant with a singleton fetus, had no known illness that could limit breastfeeding after childbirth, used WeChat through their smartphone, and had access to the internet. A total of 344 pregnant women were recruited at baseline, with 170 in the intervention group and 174 in the control group. Women in the intervention group received breastfeeding knowledge and promotion information weekly through a WeChat official account from their third month of pregnancy to 6 months postpartum. The primary outcome of exclusive and predominant breastfeeding rate was measured 0-1 month, 2-3 months, and 4-5 months postpartum. RESULTS: At 0-1 month postpartum, the exclusive breastfeeding rate was significantly higher in the intervention group than that in the control group (81.1% vs 63.3%; odds ratio [OR] 2.75, 95% CI 1.58-4.78; P<.001). Similarly, mothers in the intervention group were more likely to provide predominantly breast milk (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.55-4.96; P<.001) and less likely to give dairy products to their children (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21-0.75; P=.005). There was no statistically significant difference for exclusive breastfeeding rate 2-3 months (P=.09) and 4-5 months postpartum (P=.27), though more children in the intervention group were exclusively breastfed than those in the control group 2-3 months postpartum (intervention: 111/152, 73.0%; control: 96/152, 63.2%) and 4-5 months postpartum(intervention: 50/108, 46.3%; control: 46/109, 42.2%). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first effort to promote exclusive breastfeeding through WeChat in China, which proved to be an effective method of promoting exclusive breastfeeding in early life.

226850,Factoring in a COVID-19 seasonality - Experiences from Germany,2021,"Being the health pandemic with the highest impact on the global financial market, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant risk transmissions across stock markets. Although an increasing number of studies have examined the effects of the pandemic on financial markets, we provide novel insights into the volatility connectedness between conventional and Islamic stock markets. First, the analysis is conducted at the sectoral level, considering nine sectors for each category. Second, a greater novelty is applied by determining if the actual COVID-19 occurrence or speculations or sentiments raised by it is responsible for the connectedness. Summarily, findings show that markets are strongly connected. In addition, the Technology and Utilities sectors of both stock market types, and the Oil and Gas conventional stocks are the net receivers of volatility shocks. On average, however, Islamic markets tend to be more immune to the pandemic than conventional markets. Finally, both causal factors considered significantly affect the connectedness measures, although the effect is heterogeneous and stronger for the speculative/sentiment indicators.

226851,Factoring in a COVID-19 seasonality - Experiences from Germany,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with cancer may be more susceptible to and have higher morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 than the general population, while epidemiologic data specifically addressed to hematologic patients are limited. To investigate whether patients with hematologic diseases undergoing therapy are at increased risk for acquiring SARS CoV-2 infection compared to the general population, a retrospective study was carried out at a referral hematologic center in Rome, Italy, during the period of the greatest epidemic spread (March 8 to May 14, 2020). METHODS: All adult and pediatric patients with a diagnosis of a neoplastic or a nonneoplastic hematologic disease who underwent treatment (chemotherapy or immunosuppressive or supportive therapy) during the study period or in the previous 6 months were considered. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the overall outpatient and inpatient population undergoing hematologic treatment compared to that of the general population was analyzed. The measures taken to manage patients during the epidemic period are described. RESULTS: Overall, 2,513 patients with hematological diseases were considered. Out of 243 (9.7%) patients who were screened for SARS CoV-2, three of 119 (2.5%) outpatients with fever or respiratory symptoms and none of 124 asymptomatic patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Three further patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and managed in other hospitals in Rome. As of May 14, 2020, the prevalence of COVID-19 in our hematologic population accounted for 0.24% (95% CI 0.23-0.25; 6 of 2,513 patients: 1 case in every 419 patients) as compared to 0.12% (7,280 of 5,879,082 residents; 1 case in every 807 residents) in the general population (p = 0.14). Three of 6 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 required critical care and 2 died while still positive for SARS CoV-2. Out of 225 healthcare providers on duty at our Institution during the study period, 2 (0.9%) symptomatic cases were diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In our experience, the prevalence of COVID-19 in hematologic patients, mainly affected by malignancies, was not significantly higher compared to that of the general population. Definition of adapted strategies for healthcare services, while continuing to administer the standard hematologic treatments, represents the crucial challenge for the management of hematologic diseases in the COVID-19 era.","Girmenia, Corrado; Gentile, Giuseppe; Micozzi, Alessandra; Petrucci, Luigi; Malaspina, Francesco; Di Prima, Alessio; Baldacci, Erminia; Bianchi, Simona; Pugliese, Pellegrina; Turriziani, Ombretta; Antonelli, Guido; Tombolini, Vincenzo; Foà, Robin; Martelli, Maurizio",Acta Haematol,,161

227578,Rapid recovery achieved by intensive therapy after preterm cesarean section for worsening COVID-19-induced acute respiratory failure: A case report and literature review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacists have long been involved in public health and emergency preparedness and response (EP&R), including through preventive measures such as screening, vaccinations, testing, medical and pharmaceutical countermeasures, as well as ensuring medication safety and access during natural disasters and pandemics. Pharmacy professionals are considered essential partners in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Community and hospital pharmacies are expanding services and hours to provide essential services, putting pharmacists and their co-workers at the frontlines for patient care and safety to improve public health. In addition, pharmacy professionals are increasingly integrating into global, national, state and local EP&R efforts, including into interprofessional teams, such as Medical Reserve Corps (MRCs). However, lacunae exist for further integration of pharmacists into public health and safety initiatives. There are increasing opportunities and recommendations that should be expanded upon to provide improved patient care and population health interventions, and to ensure healthcare worker and public health safety. OBJECTIVE: Develop a Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness and Response (PEPR) Framework and recommendations for pharmacy professional pathways towards full integration within public health EP&R efforts (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and enhanced recognition of pharmacists' skills, roles and contributions as integral members of the interprofessional healthcare team. METHODS: This paper draws on the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) 2003 Statement on the Role of Health-System Pharmacists in Emergency Preparedness and lessons learned from previous and current public health emergencies, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic, to provide expanded guidance for pharmacists and pharmacy professionals across all practice settings in EP&R. The proposed PEPR framework also incorporates information and recommendations from The Pharmacy Organizations' Joint Policy Recommendations to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic (March 2020), CDC-NIOSH, International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Guidance, health departments and emergency preparedness guidance and resources, Boards of Pharmacy, and other pharmacy professional organizations and educational institutions. RESULTS: Based on methods and resources utilized in developing this proposed PEPR Framework, five key focus areas were identified, as follows: CONCLUSION: Pharmacists and pharmacy professionals have been at the frontlines in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, challenges remain, such as limited availability of personal protection equipment, high risk of infectious exposures inherent in healthcare professions, and legislative hurdles resulting in lack of provider status and related reimbursements. Recommendations to enhance pharmacy's scope as public health professionals involved in EP&R include targeted training and education on key framework areas and policymaking. Pharmacy professionals should further integrate with interdisciplinary public health teams. Additional research and dissemination on impacts and outcomes of EP&R can enhance recognition of pharmacy professionals' contribution and value during public health emergencies. The proposed PEPR Framework can be utilized to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate results in order to strengthen existing efforts and to establish new initiatives in EP&R.","Aruru, Meghana; Truong, Hoai-An; Clark, Suzanne",Res. soc. adm. pharm,,161

228347,"COVID-19-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis, March-August 2020",2021,"First cases of COVID-19 were reported from Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and it progressed rapidly. On 30 January, WHO declared the new disease as a PHEIC, then as a Pandemic on 11 March. By mid-March, the virus spread widely; Djibouti was not spared and was hit by the pandemic with the first case detected on 17 March. Djibouti worked with WHO and other partners to develop a preparedness and response plan, and implemented a series of intervention measures. MoH together with its civilian and military partners, closely followed WHO recommended strategy based on four pillars: testing, isolating, early case management, and contact tracing. From 17 March to 16 May, Djibouti performed the highest per capita tests in Africa and isolated, treated and traced the contacts of each positive case, which allowed for a rapid control of the epidemic. COVID-19 data included in this study was collected through MoH Djibouti during the period from 17 March to 16 May 2020. A total of 1,401 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were included in the study with 4 related deaths (CFR: 0.3%) and an attack rate of 0.15%. Males represented (68.4%) of the cases, with the age group 31-45 years old (34.2%) as the most affected. Djibouti conducted 17,532 tests, and was considered as a champion for COVID-19 testing in Africa with 18.2 tests per 1000 habitant. All positive cases were isolated, treated and had their contacts traced, which led to early and proactive diagnosis of cases and in turn yielded up to 95-98% asymptomatic cases. Recoveries reached 69% of the infected cases with R0 (0.91). The virus was detected in 4 regions in the country, with the highest percentage in the capital (83%). Djibouti responded to COVID-19 pandemic following an efficient and effective strategy, using a strong collaboration between civilian and military health assets that increased the response capacities of the country. Partnership, coordination, solidarity, proactivity and commitment were the pillars to confront COVID-19 pandemic.","Elhakim, Mohamed; Tourab, Saleh Banoita; Zouiten, Ahmed",PLoS One,,161
228351,"Chronological Changes of Viral Shedding in Adult Inpatients With COVID-19 in Wuhan, China",2020,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the pooled global prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). DATA SOURCES: Literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were conducted on April 19, 2020, to include articles written in English that reported the prevalence of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. REVIEW METHODS: Search strategies developed for each database contained keywords such as anosmia, dysgeusia, and COVID-19. Resulting articles were imported into a systematic review software and underwent screening. Data from articles that met inclusion criteria were extracted and analyzed. Meta-analysis using pooled prevalence estimates in a random-effects model were calculated. RESULTS: Ten studies were analyzed for olfactory dysfunction (n = 1627), demonstrating 52.73% (95% CI, 29.64%-75.23%) prevalence among patients with COVID-19. Nine studies were analyzed for gustatory dysfunction (n = 1390), demonstrating 43.93% (95% CI, 20.46%-68.95%) prevalence. Subgroup analyses were conducted for studies evaluating olfactory dysfunction using nonvalidated and validated instruments and demonstrated 36.64% (95% CI, 18.31%-57.24%) and 86.60% (95% CI, 72.95%-95.95%) prevalence, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and may represent early symptoms in the clinical course of infection. Increased awareness of this fact may encourage earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as heighten vigilance for viral transmission. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to report on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 patients.","Tong, Jane Y; Wong, Amanda; Zhu, Daniel; Fastenberg, Judd H; Tham, Tristan",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,161
228450,Efficacy and safety of nintedanib for pulmonary fibrosis in severe pneumonia induced by COVID-19: An interventional study,2021,"Event occurrence is not only subject to the environmental changes, but is also facilitated by the events that have occurred in a system. Here, we develop a method for estimating such extrinsic and intrinsic factors from a single series of event-occurrence times. The analysis is performed using a model that combines the inhomogeneous Poisson process and the Hawkes process, which represent exogenous fluctuations and endogenous chain-reaction mechanisms, respectively. The model is fit to a given dataset by minimizing the free energy, for which statistical physics and a path-integral method are utilized. Because the process of event occurrence is stochastic, parameter estimation is inevitably accompanied by errors, and it can ultimately occur that exogenous and endogenous factors cannot be captured even with the best estimator. We obtained four regimes categorized according to whether respective factors are detected. By applying the analytical method to real time series of debate in a social-networking service, we have observed that the estimated exogenous and endogenous factors are close to the first comments and the follow-up comments, respectively. This method is general and applicable to a variety of data, and we have provided an application program, by which anyone can analyze any series of event times.","Koyama, Shinsuke; Shinomoto, Shigeru",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00659v1.pdf,161

In the absence of trust, public health authorities have not adequately fulfilled their professional and ethical obligations to protect African American communities from the negative effects of COVID-19. As institutional distrust is shaped by individual and collective experiences of untrustworthiness, we propose a paradigm shift from increasing trust among African Americans to increasing trustworthiness among medical and public health institutions/systems throughout the United States. This narrative review extends the literature describing how social determinants contribute to COVID-19 inequities by demonstrating how institutional distrust develops over time and is reinforced through systems of injustice. Additionally, we illustrate consequences of institutional distrust for COVID-19 inequities and provide recommendations for building trustworthiness through ethical public health practice.","Best, Alicia L; Fletcher, Faith E; Kadono, Mika; Warren, Rueben C",J Health Care Poor Underserved,,161

Recently, many studies highlighted the role of canine olfactory ability in the medical field, specifically in detecting different infectious, metabolic and neoplastic conditions. The objective of this literature review is to clarify the rationale behind dog's ability to detect diseases, to assess the possible application for COVID-19 detection and to discuss the evidence available on the matter. Available evidence shows that properly trained disease-detector dogs are an efficient tool for identification of specific disease-associated volatile organic compounds marker profiles for a particular disease. And since COVID-19 positive persons have a specific volatilome different from non-infected persons, they can be recognised by the dogs, by sniffing different body fluids consequently aiding in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Possible applications of dogs as COVID-19 detectors will be an easy real-time mobile diagnostic aid with low cost and good performance. More evidence is needed to be able to describe standardised measures concerning the best fluid to test, testing procedure, time of possible detection according to disease evolution, risks associated with the dog exposure and to translate the good results in study setting into the real-life operational one.","Sakr, Rania; Ghsoub, Cedra; Rbeiz, Celine; Lattouf, Vanessa; Riachy, Rachelle; Haddad, Chadia; Zoghbi, Marouan",Postgrad. med. j,,161

The pandemic has exposed inequities, the fragility of economic and political systems, and in many cases, skewed priorities. Population health, not to mention planetary health, is suffering as a result. Nevertheless, the global health crisis in which we are embroiled has provided opportunities for effective collaboration, scientific innovation and real dialog around health and equity. Dr Amaylid Arteaga-García, director of Cuba's National Clinical Trials Coordinating Center (CENCEC), emphasized these opportunities when discussing Cuba's clinical trials in times of COVID-19. Founded in 1991 in response to the groundbreaking research emerging from the country's biopharmaceutical sector-including the first safe, effective vaccine against serogroup B meningococcal disease, VA-MENGOC-BC in 1989 and a recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B, Heberbiovac in 1990-CENCEC now coordinates some 100 clinical trials annually, many of them multi-site trials involving thousands of volunteers. Little did Dr Arteaga García know what problems lurked when she became CENCEC director in 2019. In February 2020, Cuba implemented its National COVID-19 Prevention & Control Plan. This included a scientific Innovation Committee tasked with evaluating promising projects, products and research that might be used in the health system to control and treat COVID-19. This approach taps into two of Cuba's strengths: biotechnology and primary health care.

In parts of Yemen, reports indicated a peak in hospital admissions and burials during May-June 2020. To estimate excess mortality during the epidemic period, we quantified activity across all identifiable cemeteries within Aden governorate (population approximately 1 million) by analysing very high-resolution satellite imagery and compared estimates to Civil Registry office records. METHODS: After identifying active cemeteries through remote and ground information, we applied geospatial analysis techniques to manually identify new grave plots and measure changes in burial surface area over a period from July 2016 to September 2020. After imputing missing grave counts using surface area data, we used alternative approaches, including simple interpolation and a generalised additive mixed growth model, to predict both actual and counterfactual (no epidemic) burial rates by cemetery and across the governorate during the most likely period of COVID-19 excess mortality (from 1 April 2020) and thereby compute excess burials. We also analysed death notifications to the Civil Registry office over the same period. RESULTS: We collected 78 observations from 11 cemeteries. In all but one, a peak in daily burial rates was evident from April to July 2020. Interpolation and mixed model methods estimated &#8776;1500 excess burials up to 6 July, and 2120 up to 19 September, corresponding to a peak weekly increase of 230% from the counterfactual. Satellite imagery estimates were generally lower than Civil Registry data, which indicated a peak 1823 deaths in May alone. However, both sources suggested the epidemic had waned by September 2020. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first instance of satellite imagery being used for population mortality estimation. Findings suggest a substantial, under-ascertained impact of COVID-19 in this urban Yemeni governorate and are broadly in line with previous mathematical modelling predictions, though our method cannot distinguish direct from indirect virus deaths.

This prospective cross-sectional study is exploring the effect of the pandemic on mental health of medical students. The study was conducted at six Jordanian medical schools using an online survey to collect students' socio-demographic and academic data. Assessment of mental wellbeing status was done using Kessler's psychological stress scale (K10); the impact of COVID-19 on life activities and strategies followed to manage the situation were also examined. A total of 553 medical students were recruited for the study. Men constituted 40.1%, and women were 59.9%. Students reported that COVID-19 has affected the aspects of physical fitness (73.1%), study (68.4%), and social relationships (65.6%) the most. Sixty-six percent of the students were concerned about family members' affection, and more than half (58.4%) explained their concerns about the inability to get clinical sessions and labs. Cooking, baking, and hobby practicing were the most popular methods to improve their mental wellbeing. About half of the participants had a severe mental disorder, and only 13.2% were likely to be well. The study indicates that half of our medical students suffer severe mental disorders, with physical fitness, exercise, and studying being among the most affected aspects during the COVID 19 pandemic. It is recommended that measures need be taken to alleviate students' stress, which might have deleterious effects in many aspects.","Seetan, Khaled; Al-Zubi, Mohammad; Rubbai, Yousef; Athamneh, Mohammad; Khamees, Almu039; atasim,; Radaideh, Tala",PLoS One,,161

The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib may be intolerable for some patients. Acalabrutinib is a more selective BTK inhibitor that may be better tolerated by patients who are intolerant to ibrutinib. A phase 2 study of acalabrutinib was conducted in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL who were ibrutinib-intolerant and had continued disease activity. Intolerance was defined as having discontinued ibrutinib due to persistent grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) or persistent/recurrent grade 2 AEs despite dose modification/interruption. Patients received oral acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily until disease progression or intolerance. Sixty patients were treated. Overall response rate to acalabrutinib was 73% and three patients (5%) achieved complete remission. At median follow-up of 35 months, the median progressionfree and overall survival were not reached; 24-month estimates were 72% and 81%, respectively. The most frequent AEs with acalabrutinib were diarrhea (53%), headache (42%), contusion (40%), dizziness (33%), upper respiratory tract infection (33%), and cough (30%). Most common reasons for acalabrutinib discontinuation were progressive disease (23%) and AEs (17%). Most patients with baseline samples (49/52; 94%) and all with on-treatment samples (3/3; 100%) had no detectable BTK and/or PLCG2 mutations.

233332,COVID-19 presenting with diarrhoea and hyponatraemia,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced universities to adopt emergency remote teaching strategies. This sudden switch from face-to-face teaching to online format prompted appropriate faculty training by the institutions. A university in Saudi Arabia organized a faculty development program to train its educators to design and implement a virtual classroom using the flipped teaching (FT) method. The flipped classroom is a student-centered instructional design where students are expected to learn basic concepts on their own using resources provided by the instructor outside of class. The class time is used to rehearse and master this knowledge through discussion and application. Moving lectures outside of class allows opportunity to engage students with the content using student-centered activities during class where more interaction between the faculty and students as well as among peers is expected. The present study tested the effectiveness of a remote faculty training program at an international institution in the development of their own remote flipped courses. The training was stretched over six biweekly sessions for which a course was created on Moodle, the Learning Management System. The participants (n=13) were guided to develop pre-class assignments such as lecture videos, formative assessments to encourage students in pre-class preparation, in-class student engagement activities, and assessments. The faculty participants were given a pre- and a post-training survey to learn about their knowledge, attitude, and confidence towards FT. The pre-course survey results indicated that 62% of the participants had never tried FT and about 46% were not familiar with FT prior to receiving training while only 54% felt ready to flip. However, all participants intended to implement the FT method after completing the course. Following the training, all participants reportedly felt they could confidently flip their courses and implement FT strategies.

METHODS: We searched for articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases till 02 April 2020, with the following keywords: ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""infection"", ""pathogenesis"", ""incubation period"", ""transmission"", ""clinical features"", ""diagnosis"", ""treatment"", ""diabetes"", with interposition of the Boolean operator ""AND"". RESULTS: The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19. No conclusive evidence exists to support the discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers or thiazolidinediones because of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Caution should be taken to potential hypoglycemic events with the use of chloroquine in these subjects. Patient tailored therapeutic strategies, rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might reduce adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Suggestions are made on the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, and its management. No definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence. Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted.","Hussain, Akhtar; Bhowmik, Bishwajit; do Vale Moreira, Nayla Cristina",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,161

The underlying reasons why a smaller percentage of patients present with severe pulmonary symptoms whereas the majority is only mildly affected are to date not well understood. Comparing the immunological phenotype in healthy donors and patients with mild versus severe COVID-19 shows that in COVID-19 patients, NK-/B-cell activation and proliferation are enhanced independent of severity. As an important precondition for effective antibody responses, T-follicular helper cells and antibody secreting cells are increased both in patients with mild and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beyond this, T cells in COVID-19 patients exhibit a stronger activation profile with differentiation toward effector cell phenotypes. Importantly, when looking at the rates of pulmonary complications in COVID-19 patients, the chemokine receptor CCR4 is higher expressed by both CD4 and CD8 T cells of patients with severe COVID-19. This raises the hypothesis that CCR4 upregulation on T cells in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 promotes stronger T-cell attraction to the lungs leading to increased immune activation with presumably higher pulmonary toxicity. Our study contributes significantly to the understanding of the immunological changes during COVID-19, as new therapeutic agents, preferentially targeting the immune system, are highly warranted.","Spoerl, Silvia; Kremer, Anita N; Aigner, Michael; Eisenhauer, Nina; Koch, Pauline; Meretuk, Lina; Löffler, Patrick; Tenbusch, Matthias; Maier, Clara; Überla, Klaus; Heinzerling, Lucie; Frey, Benjamin; Lutzny-Geier, Gloria; Winkler, Thomas H; Krönke, Gerhard; Vetter, Marcel; Bruns, Heiko; Neurath, Markus F; Mackensen, Andreas; Kremer, Andreas E; Völkl, Simon",Eur J Immunol,,161

While people of all ages are affected in some way by the pandemic, older persons have been far more likely to suffer the most severe health consequences. For this reason, how people have responded to mitigating behaviors to COVID-19 may differ by age. Using a nationally representative sample from the longitudinal data of the Understanding America Study (UAS), we examined differentials in behavioral responses to COVID-19 by age and how they changed over the first three months of the pandemic. Behavioral responses and changes in behavior over time differed by age, type of behaviors and time reference. At the beginning of the pandemic (March, 2020), older and younger people were similar in their likelihood of engaging in preventive personal behaviors when controlling for other influences. As the pandemic progressed, however, older people adopted mitigating personal behavioral changes more than younger people, such that about 1-2 months after the pandemic started, older people were more likely to comply with suggested behaviors and regulations including practicing better hygiene, quarantining, and social distancing. One month into the pandemic, older people were less likely than younger people to engage in two of four risky behaviors. The change in risky behavior over time did not differ by age; but both younger and older people were more likely to engage in risky behaviors after two months. Being female, a member of a racial/ethnic minority group, higher socioeconomic status, having more COVID-19 cases in one's state of residence, a higher perceived risk for infection and dying, and a more left-leaning political orientation were related to adopting more pandemic mitigating behaviors.","Kim, Jung Ki; Crimmins, Eileen M",PLoS One,,161

Here we isolate a panel of 44 anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from an individual who received two doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine at a 12-week interval. We show that despite a relatively low serum neutralization titre, mAbs with potent neutralizing activity against the current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2) were obtained. The vaccine elicited neutralizing mAbs form 8 distinct competition groups and bind epitopes overlapping with neutralizing mAbs elicited following SARS-CoV-2 infection. AZD1222 elicited mAbs are more mutated than mAbs isolated from convalescent donors 1-2 months post infection. Spike reactive IgG+ B cells were still detectable 9-months post boost. These findings give molecular insights into AZD1222 elicited antibody response.","Roberts, Rebekah; Waters, Anele",,,161

DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): A 36-year-old amenorrheic patient was referred for fertility preservation (FP) counseling with a diagnosis of autoimmune POI. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (21.0 and 36.3 mIU/mL) and luteinizing hormone (35.0 and 60.0 mIU/mL) levels taken 4 weeks apart were around the menopausal range. Although serum antimüllerian hormone level was low (0.76 and 0.65 ng/mL), total counts of antral follicles remained unexpectedly normal (24 and 22). Significant levels of serum antiperoxidase, anti-21-hydroxylase, and antiovary antibodies led to the diagnosis of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy. Due to the unknown time before follicular exhaustion, we undertook a FP program. INTERVENTION(S): After unsuccessful follicular growth following a trial of ovarian stimulation using recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (300 IU/day for 10 days), we decided to try IVM of immature oocytes aspirated from the remaining antral-stage follicles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Obtention of immature oocyte capable of maturing in vitro in a context of acute ovarian dysfunction. RESULT(S): Two cycles of IVM were performed, leading, after human chorionic gonadotropin priming, to six and 10 cumulus-oocyte complexes recovered and four and eight metaphase II oocytes. Finally, after intracytoplasmic sperm injection, a total of eight cleavage-stage embryos were frozen. When the patient presented in the clinic 1 year later for reutilization of the cryopreserved embryos, thyroid and adrenal functions were controlled with levothyroxine and hydrocortisone. Endometrium was primed with 17ß-estradiol (2 mg/day, vaginally) for 14 days. Progesterone (600 mg/day, vaginally) was subsequently combined with E2. Two embryos were thawed and further transferred into the uterus. The patient became pregnant and uneventfully delivered two baby boys at term. CONCLUSION(S): We report the first pregnancy and live birth achieved using IVM for FP in a woman diagnosed with autoimmune POI. The confirmation of our results would lead to modification in the management of young women diagnosed with autoimmune POI, who are usually not considered candidates for FP and often referred for egg donation when seeking pregnancy.","Grynberg, Michaël; Jacquesson, Laetitia; Sifer, Christophe",Fertil. steril,,161

Despite considerable inter-individual variation across bacterial species, the dominant phyla are generally highly conserved. There are several exogenous and gut environmental factors that play a role in modulating the composition and activities of colonic bacteria including diet with intakes of different macronutrients, including protein, accounting for approximately 20% of the microbial variation. Certain bacterial species tend to be considered as generalists and can metabolise a broad range of substrates, including both carbohydrate- and protein-derived substrates, whilst other species are specialists with a rather limited metabolic capacity. Metabolism of peptides and amino acids by gut bacteria can result in the formation of a wide range of metabolites several of which are considered deleterious to health including nitrosamines, heterocyclic amines and hydrogen sulphide as some of these products are genotoxic and have been linked to colonic disease. Beneficial metabolites however include SCFA and certain species can use amino acids to form butyrate which is the major energy source for colonocytes. The impact on health may however depend on the source of these products. In this review, we consider the impact of diet, particularly protein diets, on modulating the composition of the gut microbiota and likely health consequences and the potential impact of climate change and food security.","Duncan, Sylvia H; Iyer, Ajay; Russell, Wendy R",Proc Nutr Soc,,161

253105,The impact of COVID-19 on patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder; a pilot study,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) required the declaration of a state of emergency in Hungary from 11 March 2020 to 18 June 2020 These governmental actions led to changes in everyday life, implementation of new rules, and reduced access to healthcare Hospital beds were reserved for emergency use, face-to-face ambulatory care was mainly replaced by telemedicine In our study we assessed opinion of the patients in two outpatient psychiatric care units in Budapest regarding the state of emergency METHODS: We enrolled 438 patients in the survey (305 women and 133 men, mean age: 51 9±16 2 years) The patients completed a short questionnaire on a voluntary and anonymous basis following verbal informed consent The questionnaire was comprised of 10 items and a 12-item ""Problem Evaluation Scale"" (fear, isolation and healthcare subscales) The comparison of groups was done using general linear models (GLM), pairwise comparison was performed using Tukey's test for post hoc analysis The data set was analyzed with SPSS software, version 24 0 RESULTS: Up to 34% of enrolled patients believed that their condition worsened during the state of emergency, but 12% of these patients thought that this worsening was not related to the state of emergency Twice as many patients (12 8%) were concerned about their financial situation than about their health status (6 1%) Loneliness and the implementation of specific regulations didn't cause relevant distress in almost half of the patients, isolation was the most frequently (55 2%) reported difficulty The worsening of health status was reported more frequently (p=0 001) by the patients younger than 50 years, the sensation of fear was stronger (p=0 045), and they reported more serious adaptation difficulties (p=0 003) than subjects older than 50 years Isolation caused significantly (p=0 003) more serious distress among women The abundance of pandemic-related information caused more distress in the case of patients treated for anxiety than participants treated for psychotic disorders (p=0 024) Patients suffering from affective disorders perceived more pronounced feelings of vulnerability compared to patients treated for psychotic disorders (p=0 004) CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the enrolled psychiatric patients was able to adapt to this situation without major difficulties, the other half of this sample was more or less distressed by these circumstances Unfortunately, depletion of emotional, psychological, social and material resources can be expected during the next stage of the pandemic As a result, we can expect further worsening of the above presented aspects","Pogany, L.; Horvath, A.

253449,Factors Associated with Readmission in the US Following Hospitalization with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: In Korea, there were issues regarding the use of immunoassays for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies to detect infection. So, we compared antibody results of eight kinds of commercial immunoassays using clinical remnant specimens. METHODS: We compared the results of several immunoassay kits tested on 40 serum samples from 15 confirmed patients and 86 remnant serum samples from clinical laboratory. Eight kinds of IVD kits-four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, two lateral flow rapid immunochromatographic assays, and two chemiluminescent immunoassays with one RUO kit were tested. RESULTS: Among 40 serum samples from 15 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, 35 yielded at least one positive result for detecting antibodies in the combined assessment. There were inconsistent results in 12 (28%) samples by single immunoassay. Forty samples collected in 2019 before the first COVID-19 Korean case showed negative results except for one equivocal result. CONCLUSION: The discrepant results obtained with different immunoassay kits in this study show that serological assessment of SARS-CoV-2 by a single immunoassay requires caution not only in detecting infection but also in assessing immunologic status.","Lee, Sun Min; Kim, In Suk; Lim, Seungjin; Lee, Su Jin; Kim, Won Joo; Shin, Kyung Hwa; Moon, Soo Young; Chang, Chulhun L",J Korean Med Sci,,161

Remote proctored exams have become an important tool to ensure integrity and academic honesty in distance education. This mixed methods study aimed at understanding to what extent remote proctored exams impacted the learning process of online graduate students and their academic integrity (ethics), besides the technological factor involved. Results revealed a significant impact of remote proctored exams as regards personal academic honesty because they minimized the possibility of performing acts of dishonesty. Students attributed this to a sense of obligation and the feeling of being watched, rather than internal motivation or a personal reflective process. Lack of privacy and anxiety emerged as aspects of concern for students.

We recruited 1034 adolescents (mean age 15.76 ± 1.20 years) from China. The results showed that loneliness was positively associated with escape motivation and adolescent problematic mobile phone use. Furthermore, when controlling for gender, escape motivation mediated the relationship between loneliness and problematic mobile phone use, and self-control moderated the relationship between escape motivation and problematic mobile phone use. Specifically, as self-control increased, escape motivation was less likely to induce problematic mobile phone use. Thus, loneliness and escape motivation may be factors that increase the risk of problematic mobile phone use, and self-control should be considered in prevention and intervention strategies aimed at attenuating adolescent problematic mobile phone use.","Li, Jiayu; Zhan, Danni; Zhou, Yuhong; Gao, Xuemei",Addict Behav,,161
258384,Spontaneous pneumomediastinum in an 18-year-old woman: the importance of excluding oesophageal perforation,2021,"BACKGROUND: Emotional neglect can be characterized as cold or critical parenting and denotes a parent intentionally or unintentionally overlooking the signs that a child needs comfort or attention and ignoring its emotional needs. Parental emotional neglect is widely posited as an antecedent of anxiety disorder, with attachment researchers arguing for anxious-ambivalent attachment style as a mediating factor. METHOD: Childhood experience of neglect and abuse, including antipathy (cold, critical parenting), attachment styles, and anxiety disorders were assessed in a high-risk sample of 160 adolescents and young adults by means of interview measures. RESULTS: Antipathy was associated with 12-month prevalence of anxiety disorders in the sample. Anxious-ambivalent attachment scores statistically mediated the relationship between antipathy and anxiety disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians treating anxiety disorders in youths need to consider that emotional neglect in childhood in the form of antipathy could lead to anxious-ambivalent internal working models operating around fear of rejection and fear of separation.","Schimmenti, Adriano; Bifulco, Antonia",Child Adolesc Ment Health,,161

259383,A case of coinfection with SARS-COV-2 and cytomegalovirus in the era of COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Here we summarize current knowledge about multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a presumed postinfectious inflammatory condition that has emerged as an important COVID-19-associated complication, to help clinicians identify and manage cases. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical presentation of MIS-C is dominated by significant inflammation. Fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiac dysfunction, and hypotension are common features. Kawasaki disease-like findings are common, but epidemiologic data and recent mechanistic studies suggest that distinct inflammatory pathways mediate Kawasaki disease and MIS-C. A broad diagnostic approach is recommended, given overlapping presentations between MIS-C and many other disease processes. Current management of MIS-C is highly variable, depending on illness severity, and can range from supportive care to aggressive immune modulation. A multidisciplinary approach with early involvement of multiple pediatric subspecialists is recommended for complicated cases. SUMMARY: Several studies have described the clinical manifestations of MIS-C, but definitive diagnosis remains challenging. Robust information about long-term outcomes awaits further study, as do immunologic data to refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","Soma, Vijaya L; Shust, Gail F; Ratner, Adam J",Curr. opin. pediatr,,161

Also, a major impact on the individual and societal experience of death, dying, and bereavement has been observed. Factors such as social distancing, unexpected death or not being able to say goodbye, which might predict Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), are taking place. Moreover, hospitals have become a habitual place for End of Life (EOL) situations but not in the usual conditions because, for example, mitigation measures prevent families from being together with hospitalized relatives. Therefore, we implemented an EOL program with a multidisciplinary team involving health social workers (HSW) and clinical psychologists (CP) in coordination with the medical teams and nursing staff. Objectives: We aim to describe an EOL intervention program implemented during COVID-19 in the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital (HUVH). We present its structure, circuit, and functions. Descriptive analyses of the sample and the interventions that required psychological and social attention are reported. Material and methods: The total sample consists of 359 relatives of 219 EOL patients. Inclusion criteria were families cared for during the COVID-19 pandemic with family patients admitted to the HUVH in an EOL situation regardless of whether or not the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19.","Beneria, A.; Castell-Panisello, E.; Sorribes-Puertas, M.; Forner-Puntonet, M.; Serrat, L.; Garcia-Gonzalez, S.; Garriga, M.; Simon, C.; Raya, C.; Montes, M.

We recently developed Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity (IBEX), an iterative immunolabeling and chemical bleaching method that enables multiplexed imaging (>65 parameters) in diverse tissues, including human organs relevant for international consortia efforts. IBEX is compatible with over 250 commercially available antibodies, 16 unique fluorophores, and can be easily adopted to different imaging platforms using slides and non-proprietary imaging chambers. The overall protocol consists of iterative cycles of antibody labelling, imaging, and chemical bleaching that can be completed at relatively low cost in 2-5 days by biologists with basic laboratory skills. To support widespread adoption, we provide extensive details on tissue processing, curated lists of validated antibodies, and tissue-specific panels for multiplex imaging. Furthermore, instructions are included on how to automate the method using competitively priced instruments and reagents. Finally, we present a software solution for image alignment that can be executed by individuals without programming experience using open source software and freeware. In summary, IBEX is an open and versatile method that can be readily implemented by academic laboratories and scaled to achieve high content mapping of diverse tissues in support of a Human Reference Atlas or other such applications.","Radtke, Andrea J.; Chu, Colin J.; Yaniv, Ziv; Yao, Li; Marr, James; Beuschel, Rebecca T.; Ichise, Hiroshi; Gola, Anita; Kabat, Juraj; Lowekamp, Bradley; Speranza, Emily; Croteau, Joshua; Thakur, Nishant; Jonigk, Danny; Davis, Jeremy; Hernandez, Jonathan M.; Germain, Ronald N.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11364v1.pdf,161

METHODOLOGY: Distributions of incubation period and serial interval of Jiangxi epidemic data were fitted by ""fitdistrplus"" package of R software, and the meta-analysis was conducted by ""meta"" package of R software. RESULTS: Based on the epidemic data of Jiangxi, we found the median days of incubation period and serial interval were 5.9 days [IQR: 3.8 - 8.6] and 5.7 days [IQR: 3.6 - 8.3], respectively. The median days of the infectivity period at pre-symptomatic was 1.7 days [IQR: 1.1 - 2.4]. The meta-analysis based on 64 papers showed the pooled means of the incubation period and serial interval were 6.25 days (95% CrI: 5.75 - 6.75) and 5.15 days (95% CrI: 4.73 - 5.57), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19 and provide useful parameters for modelling the dynamics of disease transmission. The serial interval is shorter than the incubation period, which indicates that the patients are infectious at pre-symptomatic period, and isolation of detected cases alone is likely to be difficult to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Zhang, Tianchen; Ding, Sheng; Zeng, Zhili; Cheng, Huijian; Zhang, Chengfeng; Mao, Xiangqun; Pan, Huanhong; Xia, Guanghui; Che, Daping",J Infect Dev Ctries,,161

263555,Tuberculosis Elimination in the Era of COVID-19: A Moving Target,2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most frequently observed complication in COVID-19 patients with high mortality rates. OBJECTIVE OF STUDY: To observe the clinical effect of plasmapheresis on excessive inflammatory reaction and immune features in patients with severe COVID-19 at risk of ARDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-center study, we included 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Masih Daneshvari Hospital, in March 2020 in Tehran, Iran. COVID-19 cases were confirmed by RT-PCR and CT imaging according to WHO guidelines. Plasmapheresis was performed to alleviate cytokine-induced ARDS. The improvement in oxygen delivery (PaO2/FiO2), total number of T cells, liver enzymes, acute reaction proteins, TNF-&#945; and IL-6 levels were evaluated. RESULTS: Inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-&#945;, IL-6), and acute phase reaction proteins including ferritin and CRP were high before plasmapheresis. After plasmapheresis, the levels of PaO2/FiO2, acute phase reactants, inflammatory mediators, liver enzymes and bilirubin were significantly reduced within a week (pâ¯<â¯0.05). In contrast, although the number of T helper cells decreased immediately after plasmapheresis, they rose to above baseline levels after 1 week. Nine out of fifteen patients on non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) survived whilst the six patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) died. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that plasmapheresis improves systemic cytokine and immune responses in patients with severe COVID-19 who do not undergo IMV. Further controlled studies are required to explore the efficacy of plasmapheresis treatment in patients with COVID-19.","Hashemian, Seyed MohammadReza; Shafigh, Navid; Afzal, Golnaz; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Tabarsi, Payam; Marjani, Majid; Malekmohammad, Majid; Mortazavi, Seyed Mehdi; Khoundabi, Batoul; Mansouri, Davood; Moniri, Afshin; Hajifathali, Abbas; Roshandel, Elham; Mortaz, Esmaeil; Adcock, Ian M","Pulmonology (Barc., Print)",,161

While several new virtual learning programs have been recently implemented, the perspective of urology trainees regarding their usefulness still needs to be investigated. METHODS: A cross-sectional, 30-item, web-based Survey was conducted through Twitter from April 4th, 2020 to April 18th, 2020, aiming to evaluate the urology residents' perspective on smart learning (SL) modalities (pre-recorded videos, webinars, podcasts, and social media [SoMe]), and contents (frontal lessons, clinical case discussions, updates on Guidelines and on clinical trials, surgical videos, Journal Clubs, and seminars on leadership and non-technical skills). RESULTS: Overall, 501 urology residents from 58 countries completed the survey. Of these, 78.4, 78.2, 56.9 and 51.9% of them considered pre-recorded videos, interactive webinars, podcasts and SoMe highly useful modalities of smart learning, respectively. The contents considered as highly useful by the greatest proportion of residents were updates on guidelines (84.8%) and surgical videos (81.0%). In addition, 58.9 and 56.5% of responders deemed seminars on leadership and on non-technical skills highly useful smart learning contents. The three preferred combinations of smart learning modality and content were: pre-recorded surgical videos, interactive webinars on clinical cases, and pre-recorded videos on guidelines. CONCLUSION: Our study provides the first global «big picture¼ of the smart learning modalities and contents that should be prioritized to optimize virtual Urology education.

CASES DESCRIPTION: Case 1, female, 10-month-old child, pre-existing chronic disease, hospitalized since birth, mechanical ventilation dependency via tracheotomy, progressed with hypoxemia, requiring oxygen therapy, and increased ventilator parameters, and a diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed. Airway clearance and pulmonary expansion maintenance therapies were performed. During hospitalization, the child acquired cephalic control, sitting without support, rolling, holding, and reaching objects. Recommendations were provided to a family member to maintain motor development milestones. Case 2, male, nine years old, previous psychiatric disease and obesity, showed worsening of the sensory state, requiring intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation, with the diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection. The physical therapy was performed to maintain airway clearance, pulmonary expansion, and early mobilization, showing ventilatory improvement during the intensive care hospitalization and successfully extubated after 17 days. The physical therapy evolved from passive to resistive exercises during the hospitalization, and the patient was able to walk without assistance at discharge, with the same previous functional status. COMMENTS: The COVID-19 showed different manifestations in both cases. Physical therapy treatment was essential to maintain and to recover the functional status of the patients. Future studies are needed to improve the understanding of disease course and its functional consequences to offer an efficient treatment to pediatric patients with COVID-19.","Schaan, Camila Wohlgemuth; Vieira, Vanessa de Souza; Miller, Cristina; Peiter, Ana Paula Dattein; Piccoli, Taciana; Cavion, Gabriela; Lukrafka, Janice Luisa; Ferrari, Renata Salatti",Rev Paul Pediatr,,161

In fact, it is one of the must-have gadgets for any medical professional. The vein-viewer is device that helps to access easily veins when trying to collect a blood sample or for administering Intravenous (IV) cannulation. It is also an aid for dermatologist/aesthetic physician to access client's veins for sclerotherapy procedures or avoiding veins in cosmetic procedures. The vein-viewer is highly applicable where vascular positioning is really difficult; examples while canulating infants, obese, hairy/dark skins, dialysis/cancer patients etc. In addition, frequent attempts affect patients, causing trauma and subcutaneous haemorrhage. As palm/finger vein patterns are unique and complex, difficult to duplicate or steal as it is beneath the skin. So, in this Covid19 pandemic time, the vein-viewer finds applications in the secure non-contact bio-metric authentications for secure banking and attendance registering system to identify an individual.

265043,Alternatives to conventional hospitalisation that enhance health systems' capacity to treat COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially N95 respirators. Efficient, effective and economically feasible methods for large-scale PPE decontamination are urgently needed. AIMS: (1) to develop protocols for effectively decontaminating PPE using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP); (2) to develop novel approaches that decrease set-up and take-down time while also increasing decontamination capacity; (3) to test decontamination efficiency for N95 respirators heavily contaminated by make-up or moisturizers. METHODS: We converted a decommissioned Biosafety Level 3 laboratory into a facility that could be used to decontaminate N95 respirators. N95 respirators were hung on metal racks, stacked in piles, placed in paper bags or covered with make-up or moisturizer. A VHP® VICTORY&#8482; unit from STERIS was used to inject VHP into the facility. Biological and chemical indicators were used to validate the decontamination process. FINDINGS: N95 respirators individually hung on metal racks were successfully decontaminated using VHP. N95 respirators were also successfully decontaminated when placed in closed paper bags or if stacked in piles of up to six. Stacking reduced the time needed to arrange N95 respirators for decontamination by approximately two-thirds while almost tripling facility capacity. Make-up and moisturizer creams did not interfere with the decontamination process. CONCLUSIONS: Respirator stacking can reduce the hands-on time and increase decontamination capacity. When personalization is needed, respirators can be decontaminated in labelled paper bags. Make up or moisturizers do not appear to interfere with VHP decontamination.","Russo, R; Levine, C; Grady, C; Peixoto, B; McCormick-Ell, J; Block, T; Gresko, A; Delmas, G; Chitale, P; Frees, A; Ruiz, A; Alland, D",J Hosp Infect,,161

This study evaluated trends in emergency department (ED) access for seizure-related reasons in the first 8 weeks of lockdown in Italy. METHODS: All ED accesses of children (<14 years of age) at two university hospitals, in Turin and Rome, Italy, between January 6, 2020 and April 21, 2020, were examined and compared with the corresponding periods of 2019. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 lockdown period (February 23-April 21, 2020), there was a 72 % decrease in all pediatric ED accesses over the corresponding 2019 period (n = 3,395 vs n = 12,128), with a 38 % decrease in seizure-related accesses (n = 41 vs n = 66). The observed decrease of seizure-related ED accesses was not accompanied by significant changes in age, sex, type of seizure, or hospitalization rate after the ED visit. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown was accompanied by a sudden decrease in seizure-related hospital emergency visits. School closure, social distancing, reduced risk of infection, and increased parental supervision are some of the factors that might have contributed to the finding.","Davico, Chiara; Marcotulli, Daniele; Lux, Caterina; Calderoni, Dario; Terrinoni, Arianna; Di Santo, Federica; Ricci, Federica; Vittorini, Roberta; Amianto, Federico; Urbino, Antonio; Ferrara, Mauro; Vitiello, Benedetto",Seizure,,161

271990,Airborne Transmission of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: There are currently no evidence-based guidelines that provide standardized criteria for the discharge of COVID-19 patients from the hospital. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap in practice guidance, we reviewed published guidance and collected discharge protocols and procedures to identify and synthesize common practices. DESIGN: Rapid review of existing guidance from US and non-US public health organizations and professional societies and qualitative review using content analysis of discharge documents collected from a national sample of US academic medical centers with follow-up survey of hospital leaders SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We reviewed 65 websites for major professional societies and public health organizations and collected documents from 22 Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) in the US participating in the HOspital MEdicine Reengineering Network (HOMERuN). RESULTS: We synthesized data regarding common practices around 5 major domains: (1) isolation and transmission mitigation; (2) criteria for discharge to non-home settings including skilled nursing, assisted living, or homeless; (3) clinical criteria for discharge including oxygenation levels, fever, and symptom improvement; (4) social support and ability to perform activities of daily living; (5) post-discharge instructions, monitoring, and follow-up. LIMITATIONS: We used streamlined methods for rapid review of published guidance and collected discharge documents only in a focused sample of US academic medical centers. CONCLUSION: AMCs studied showed strong consensus on discharge practices for COVID-19 patients related to post-discharge isolation and transmission mitigation for home and non-home settings. There was high concordance among AMCs that discharge practices should address COVID-19-specific factors in clinical, functional, and post-discharge monitoring domains although definitions and details varied.","Greysen, S Ryan; Auerbach, Andrew D; Mitchell, Matthew D; Goldstein, Jennifer N; Weiss, Rachel; Esmaili, Armond; Kuye, Ifedayo; Manjarrez, Efren; Bann, Maralyssa; Schnipper, Jeffrey L",J Gen Intern Med,,161

METHODS: This is a single-centre prospective observational study of patients with COVID-19 (as confirmed by RT-PCR) and renal failure requiring haemodialysis. Their clinical profiles and outcomes were analysed, vis-à-vis the changing disease severity. FINDINGS: A total of 483 patients were included, of whom 416 had end-stage renal disease and were on maintenance haemodialysis. Patients who were symptomatic at presentation had significantly higher levels of Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p < 0.001), higher degrees of lung involvement (p < 0.001) and required more respiratory support (p < 0.001). The overall mortality observed was 18.8%. In the late phases of the outbreak, there was a significant increase in disease severity without a statistically significant increase in mortality. Predictors of mortality on univariate analysis were age, diabetes mellitus, acute on chronic kidney disease, presence of symptoms on admission, NLR, CRP, LDH, computed tomography (CT) chest grades 3 and 4, and need for respiratory support; however, only age and the renal syndrome of acute on chronic kidney disease retained significance on multivariate analysis (p0.003 and p0.019, respectively). CONCLUSION: Among patients on haemodialysis, higher mortality was observed in patients who were older, and among those with acute on chronic kidney disease. In the late phase of the outbreak, there was a statistically significant increase in disease severity without a corresponding increase in mortality.","Nithya, Govindasamy; Lamech, Tanuj Moses; Arumugam, Venkatesh; Dineshkumar, Thanikachalam; Gopalakrishnan, Natarajan; Aiswarya, Dhanapalan; Shaji, Sajmi; Sastry, Bhagavatula V R H; Solomon, Dolphin; Kannan, Badri Srinivasan; Sakthirajan, Ramanathan; Rajendran, Padmaraj",J. nephrol,,161

276007,Clinical and virological data of the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe: a case series,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and become a pandemic. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) not only infects the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and causes GI symptoms, but also increases nosocomial transmission risk during endoscopic procedures for aerosol generation. We hereby share our infection control strategies aiming to minimize COVID-19 transmission in the endoscopy center. METHODS: We established our infection control strategies based on the guidance of Chinese Society of Digestive Endoscopy and inputs from hospital infection control experts: admission control through the procedure and patient triage, environmental control to reduce possible virus exposure, proper usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), and scope disinfection and room decontamination. All endoscopic procedures accomplished during COVID-19 outbreak and progress of stepwise resumption of elective endoscopy procedures were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Only urgent or semi-urgent procedures were performed during COVID-19 outbreak. After no local new-onset COVID-19 case in Beijing for four weeks, we reopened the endoscopy center for elective procedures and monitored the outbreak continuously while maintaining a sustainable endoscopy service. CONCLUSIONS: It is imperative that all endoscopy centers should establish standard infection control strategies in order to fight COVID-19 pandemic based on national guidance and academic society guidelines and tailor them to individual resources. These measures and setup can also be reserved for future pandemics.","Zhang, Shengyu; Wu, Xi; Pan, Hui; Wu, Dong; Xu, Tao; Shen, Ning; Zhang, Yizhen; Feng, Yunlu; Wang, Qiang; Jiang, Qingwei; Guo, Tao; Wu, Dongsheng; Tang, Shou-Jiang; Yang, Aiming",,,161
276645,COVID-19 Vaccines: Should We Fear ADE?,2020,"While individuals infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifested a broad range in susceptibility and severity to the disease, the pre-existing immune memory to related pathogens cross-reactive against SARS-CoV-2 can influence the disease outcome in COVID-19. Here, we investigated the potential extent of T cell cross-reactivity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that can be conferred by other coronaviruses and influenza virus, and generated an in silico map of public and private CD8+ T cell epitopes between coronaviruses. We observed 794 predicted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes of which 52% were private and 48% were public. Ninety-nine percent of the public epitopes were shared with SARS-CoV and 5.4% were shared with either one of four common coronaviruses, 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43. Moreover, to assess the potential risk of self-reactivity and/or diminished T cell response for peptides identical or highly similar to the host, we identified predicted epitopes with high sequence similarity with human proteome. Lastly, we compared predicted epitopes from coronaviruses with epitopes from influenza virus deposited in IEDB, and found only a small number of peptides with limited potential for cross-reactivity between the two virus families. We believe our comprehensive in silico profile of private and public epitopes across coronaviruses would facilitate design of vaccines, and provide insights into the presence of pre-existing coronavirus-specific memory CD8+ T cells that may influence immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.","Lee, Chloe H; Pinho, Mariana Pereira; Buckley, Paul R; Woodhouse, Isaac B; Ogg, Graham; Simmons, Alison; Napolitani, Giorgio; Koohy, Hashem",Front Immunol,,161

However, the precise clinical and biochemical variables associated with AKI progression in patients with severe COVID-19 remain unclear. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 278 hospitalized patients who were admitted to the ward and intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020, at the University Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil. Patients aged &#8805; 18 years with COVID-19 confirmed on RT-PCR were included. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. We evaluated the incidence of AKI, several clinical variables, medicines used, and outcomes in two sub-groups: COVID-19 patients with AKI (Cov-AKI), and COVID-19 patients without AKI (non-AKI). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: First, an elevated incidence of AKI (71.2%) was identified, distributed across different stages of the KDIGO criteria. We further observed higher levels of creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the Cov-AKI group than in the non-AKI group, at hospital admission. On univariate analysis, Cov-AKI was associated with older age (>62 years), hypertension, CRP, MCV, leucocytes, neutrophils, NLR, combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatment, use of mechanical ventilation, and vasoactive drugs. Multivariate analysis showed that hypertension and the use of vasoactive drugs were independently associated with a risk of higher AKI in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we preferentially found an altered erythrocyte and leukocyte cellular profile in the Cov-AKI group compared to the non-AKI group, at hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the development of AKI in patients with severe COVID-19 was related to inflammatory blood markers and therapy with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, with vasopressor requirement and hypertension considered potential risk factors. Thus, attention to the protocol, hypertension, and some blood markers may help assist doctors with decision-making for the management of COVID-19 patients with AKI.","de Almeida, Danilo Candido; Franco, Maria do Carmo Pinho; Dos Santos, Davi Rettori Pardo; Santos, Marina Colella; Maltoni, Isabela Soucin; Mascotte, Felipe; de Souza, Alexandra Aparecida; Pietrobom, Paula Massaroni; Medeiros, Eduardo Alexandrino; Ferreira, Paulo Roberto Abrão; Machado, Flavia Ribeiro; Goes, Miguel Angelo",PLoS One,,161

278963,Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Gene Polymorphism and Severe Lung Injury in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"Objectives: Efficiency analyses of health systems are often limited to hospital applications or macroeconomic evaluations considering a single production process. This application using a two-stage prevention and cure network perspective highlights nonparametric frontier estimations more coherently with the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario. Methods: This two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis methodology estimates cost efficiencies of preventing an increasing propagation of COVID-19 using the Federal Government COVID-19 expenditures as input and the inverse rate of cases as output (standardized by population) in the first stage. The second stage for the technical efficiency (cure model) has the number of ICUs, ventilators and medical staff (nurses, assistants and physicians) as input and success rate (the difference between the number of infected and deaths) as output. Results: Two efficient states on both prevention and cure models (Acre and Roraima). Pernambuco is deemed efficient in preventing COVID-19 (3 states total), and São Paulo, Mato Grosso, Amapá, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul (7 states) in cure. About 1400 ICU admissions, 590 ventilators and more than 100 thousand medical staff can be spared directed by best practices from these seven efficient states. The most inefficient states in preventing the pandemic are São Paulo (0.028), Bahia (0.076), Rio Grande do Sul (0.087) and Paraná (0.098), also reporting low social isolation. The most inefficient states in cure are Rio de Janeiro (0.231), Pernambuco (0.277), and Rio Grande do Norte (0.439). Conclusions: The proposed methodology offers an interesting framework combining both public health perspectives as responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Brief comments can be made on Pernambuco's mapping technologies available for the general population;the cooperation between the government and NGOs in Roraima for providing EPIs, tests, food and hygiene items for indigenous districts (reducing potential propagations without expanding governments expenditures);and Acre's campaigns for basic hygiene, and pandemic control.","Nepomuceno, T.; Silva, W.

To date, the phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells remain poorly defined. Using 38-parameter CyTOF, we phenotyped longitudinal specimens of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from nine individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were exclusively Th1 cells and predominantly Tcm cells with phenotypic features of robust helper function. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells were predominantly Temra cells in a state of less terminal differentiation than most Temra cells. Subsets of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells express CD127, can proliferate homeostatically, and can persist for over 2 months. Our results suggest that long-lived and robust T cell immunity is generated following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and support an important role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in host control of COVID-19.","Neidleman, Jason; Luo, Xiaoyu; Frouard, Julie; Xie, Guorui; Gill, Gurjot; Stein, Ellen S; McGregor, Matthew; Ma, Tongcui; George, Ashley F; Kosters, Astrid; Greene, Warner C; Vasquez, Joshua; Ghosn, Eliver; Lee, Sulggi; Roan, Nadia R",Cell Rep Med,,161

Scientific literature on the clinical data record of COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh is inadequate. Our study analyzes the clinical data of COVID-19 positive patients based on molecular identification and risk factor correlated with three variables (age, sex, residence) and COVID-19 prevalence in the four districts of Chattogram Division (Noakhali, Feni, Lakshmipur and Chandpur) with an aim to understand the trajectory of this pandemic in Chattogram, Southern Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study is conducted in the context of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 positive 5,589 individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection from the COVID-19 testing laboratory, Abdul Malek Ukil Medical College, Noakhali-3800, Bangladesh. For molecular confirmation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), standard diagnostic protocols through real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were conducted. Different patient demographics were analyzed using SPSS version 22 for exploring the relationship of three factors - age, sex, and residence with a cumulative number of COVID-19 positive cases and prevalence of COVID-19 in four districts in Chattogram division. The data was recorded between May to July, 2020. Results: Among the three parameters, the present study revealed that 20-40 cohort had the highest incidence of infection rate (51.80%, n=2895) among the different age groups. Among the infected individuals, 56.8% (n=3177) were male and 43.2% (n=2412) were female, denoting males being the most susceptible to this disease. Urban residents (52.7%, n=2948) were more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those residing in rural areas (47.3%, n=2641). The prevalence of COVID-19 positive cases among the four districts was recorded highest in the Noakhali district with 36.8% (n=2057), followed by the Feni, Lakshmipur and Chandpur districts with 25.9% (n=1448), 20.8% (n=1163) and 16.5% (n=921), respectively. Conclusions: This study presents a statistical correlation of certain factors linked to Bangladesh with confirmed COVID-19 patients, which will enable health practitioners and policy makers to take proactive steps to control and mitigate disease transmission.","Ali, Roushan; Chowdhury, Rayhan; Mas-Ud, Atik; Islam, Shirmin; Shimu, Ajmeri Sultana; Mina, Fahmida Begum; Sharmin, Nur E; Hasan, Faruk",Heliyon,,161
280413,"Delayed, transient and self-resolving neutropenia following COVID-19 pneumonia",2021,"During the COVID-19 crisis, disposable N-95 filtering face piece respirators became a critical supply in many health care institutions. Infection preventionists nationwide struggled with ensuring their facilities had personal protective equipment available while utilizing crisis capacity strategies. Many facilities began using US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and US Food and Drug Administration guidance to disinfect and reprocess N95 respirators for extended use. N95 respirators are collected for all clinical units on a scheduled basis by the sterile processing department (SPD) in individually labeled bins. Bins are checked into SPD and logged into electronic system to track mask volumes by unit. Masks are inspected by SPD team members, packaged in sterile peel packs on the decontamination side and sent to the clean side of the department. Masks are then reprocessed in the appropriate equipment based on the US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization guidelines.

METHODS: A literature search (of PubMed, Google Scholar, PEDro and Cochrane databases) was performed for relevant publications from January to April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2,835 articles were retrieved, and the search resulted in a final total 31 published articles. A narrative synthesis of the selected articles was then performed. CONCLUSION: For COVID-19 patients, an integrated rehabilitative process is recommended, involving a multidisciplinary and multi-professional team providing neuromuscular, cardiac, respiratory, and swallowing interventions, and psychological support, in order to improve patients' quality of life. The intervention of a physician expert in rehabilitation should be taken into consideration, and a dedicated intervention set up after thorough assessment of the patient's clinical condition, in collaboration with all rehabilitation team professionals.","Agostini, Francesco; Mangone, Massimiliano; Ruiu, Pierangela; Paolucci, Teresa; Santilli, Valter; Bernetti, Andrea",J. rehabil. med,,161
282949,"Bilateral, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy following unilateral midbrain infarct",2020,"Colonial empires, scientists, philanthropists and Hollywood studios have long sustained an image of islands as remote places with unique ecologies and cultures, experimental labs, or loci of escapism. The climate crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic have contributed to a predominant view of islands as both exceptional spaces and testbeds to be scaled up onto continental or planetary levels. Likewise, the metaphor of the island is foundational to Western thought yet has been less explored in the context of scientific processes and technology development. Bringing together science and technology studies (STS) with critical Island Studies and related fields, this special section expands upon the spatial dimension of sociotechnical imaginaries to consider islands and their imaginations as both preexisting and channeling visions of science and technology. The introduced concept of Island Imaginaries captures the mutual constitution of island visions and their materialization in scientific, technological and technocratic endeavors that are imagined and pursued by scientific communities, policymakers, and other social collectives. Such an approach explores the co-constitutive dynamic of islands as sites for the foundation of technoscientific knowledge regimes, and the concomitant rendering of islands as conducive places for discovery and experimentation. The special section offers empirical case studies with insights into islands as synecdoche for larger wholes (the Earth), as experimental and exceptional sites for trialing business creation and political orders (in Singapore, and for Asia), and as variously interpreted laboratory paradise (of Hawai‘i). Further research themes for STS are suggested in the Conclusion.

Patients with cancer are immunocompromised and may be vulnerable to COVID-related morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to determine if patients with cancer have worse outcomes compared with patients without cancer and to identify demographic and clinical predictors of morbidity and mortality among patients with cancer. METHODS: We used data from adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to two New York-Presbyterian hospitals between March 3 and May 15, 2020. Patients with cancer were matched 1:4 to controls without cancer in terms of age, sex, and number of comorbidities. Using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test, we compared morbidity (intensive care unit admission and intubation) and mortality outcomes between patients with cancer and controls. Among those with cancer, we identified demographic and clinical predictors of worse outcomes using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: We included 585 patients who were COVID-19 positive, of whom 117 had active malignancy, defined as those receiving cancer-directed therapy or under active surveillance within 6 months of admission. Presenting symptoms and in-hospital complications were similar between the cancer and noncancer groups. Nearly one half of patients with cancer were receiving therapy, and 45% of patients received cytotoxic or immunosuppressive treatment within 90 days of admission. There were no statistically significant differences in morbidity or mortality (P = .894) between patients with and without cancer. CONCLUSION: We observed that patients with COVID-19 and cancer had similar outcomes compared with matched patients without cancer. This finding suggests that a diagnosis of active cancer alone and recent anticancer therapy do not predict worse COVID-19 outcomes and therefore, recommendations to limit cancer-directed therapy must be considered carefully in relation to cancer-specific outcomes and death.","Brar, Gagandeep; Pinheiro, Laura C; Shusterman, Michael; Swed, Brandon; Reshetnyak, Evgeniya; Soroka, Orysya; Chen, Frank; Yamshon, Samuel; Vaughn, John; Martin, Peter; Paul, Doru; Hidalgo, Manuel; Shah, Manish A",J Clin Oncol,,161

The goal is to retain automation of repetitive tasks while allowing complex parts to come together. We recognize the fragility and how hard it is to create traditional automation. We introduce a method which converts one really hard problem of producing sustainable production code into three simpler problems being data, patterns and working prototypes. We use developer seniority as a metric to measure whether the proposed method is easier. By using agent-based simulation and NanoVC repos for agent arbitration, we are able to create a simulated environment where patterns developed by people are used to transform working prototypes into templates that data can be fed through to create the robots that create the production code. Having two layers of robots allow early implementation choices to be replaced as we gather more feedback from the working system. Several benefits of this approach have been discovered, with the most notable being that the Robot of Robots encodes a legacy of the person that designed it in the form of the 3 ingredients (data, patterns and working prototypes). This method allows us to achieve our goal of reducing the fragility of the production code while removing the difficulty of getting there.","Machowski, Lukasz; Marwala, Tshilidzi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04755v1.pdf,161

290932,Breastmilk and COVID-19: What Do We Know?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the #Radiology conversation on Twitter social media platform during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 1 to December 31, 2020, all tweets with a #Radiology hashtag were identified using the healthcare social media analytics tool, Symplur Signals. Data collected included number of tweets, retweets, impressions, links, and user characteristics. Data were stratified by the presence of a COVID-19-related keyword, and a social media network analysis was further performed. RESULTS: Of the 68,172 tweets, 10,093 contained COVID-19 content from 2809 users generating 65,513,669 impressions. More tweets with COVID-19 content contained links than without (P < 0.01). Network analysis demonstrated most users were physicians (48.10%), authoring the most tweets (40.38%), using the most mentions (32.15%), and retweeting the most (51.45%). The most impressions, however, were by healthcare organizations not providing clinical care (20,235,547 impressions, 30.89%). Users came from 80 countries, most from the United States (29.3%) and the United Kingdom (8.69%). During early March, COVID-19 dominated the #Radiology conversation, making up 54.67% of tweets the week of March 14 and 64.74% of impressions the week of March 21 compared to 13.97% of tweets and 16.76% of impressions in the remainder of the study period (P < 0.01).There was an influx of new users to the #Radiology conversation during this time period with more users tweeting about COVID-19 than not (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Discussion of COVID-19 in the #Radiology community increased significantly during the early weeks of the pandemic. Real time sharing and collaboration proved a useful tool when rapid information dissemination was needed to manage an emerging pathogen.","Lazaga, Maegan K G; Dowell, Joshua D; Makary, Mina S",Curr Probl Diagn Radiol,,161

295914,"The Perspective of Coronavirus Disease Outbreak: Epidemiology, Transmission, and Possible Treatment",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to the academic medicine community, including the cancellation of most medical and health professions conferences. In this Perspective, the authors examine both the short- and longer-term implications of these cancellations, including the effects on the professional development and advancement of junior faculty and learners. While the COVID-19 pandemic is new in 2020, impediments to conference attendance and participation are not. Cost, personal responsibilities at home, and clinical duties have always restricted attendance. The authors argue that the unprecedented hardships of this pandemic present a unique opportunity to reimagine how conferences can be conducted and to rethink what it means to be part of an academic community. While there are challenges with this digital transformation of academia, there are also undeniable opportunities: online abstracts and recorded presentations enable wider viewership, virtual sessions permit wider participation and greater interactivity, and the elimination of travel facilitates more diverse expert panel participation. The authors conclude with proposals for how conference organizers and participants can expand access by leveraging available distance learning technology and other virtual tools, both during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Lessing, Juan N; Anderson, Lauren R; Mark, Nicholas M; Maggio, Lauren A; Durning, Steven J",Acad Med,,161

In such situations, pregnant women are suspected of being among the vulnerable groups. The aim of this study was to report clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and obstetrical complications, maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women. We searched the Cochrane library, MEDLINE/PubMed, and Web of Sciences from their inception to April 5, 2020. Any study involving pregnant women with COVID-19 which evaluated the effect of the disease on pregnancy outcomes and fetal and neonatal complications was included in the study. The outcomes were the symptoms and laboratory findings, obstetrical complications, mode of delivery, and maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. The search resulted in 69 titles and abstracts, which were narrowed down to 12 studies involving 68 women. The three most common symptoms of patients were fever, cough, and fatigue. The most common laboratory findings were an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphopenia. The most common obstetrical complication was preterm labor (33.3%). No maternal deaths were reported. The Cesarean section rate was 83.3% and the vertical transition rate was 2.23%. The findings showed that the clinical symptoms and laboratory measures of pregnant women affected by COVID-19 did not differ from the general population. In general, the prognosis of mothers who suffered from COVID-19 and their newborns was satisfactory. However, there is a need for further rigorous studies to confirm these findings as the pandemic progresses.","Makvandi, Somayeh; Mahdavian, Mitra; Kazemi-Nia, Goli; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Guest, Paul C; Karimi, Leila; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,,161

METHODS: In this living systematic review and meta-analyses, we searched seven electronic databases for cross-sectional studies and longitudinal studies on psychological problems on COVID-19 patients from Jan 1, 2020 to Oct 7, 2020. The primary outcome was prevalence of various psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, somatization, and fear. We pooled data for prevalence with their 95% confidence interval (CI) using random effect models and assessed the study quality based on the 11-item checklist recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. RESULTS: Fourty-four studies, including studies from China(35), Italy(2), Iran(2), India(1), Korea(1), Ecuador(1), Switzerland(1), Germany(1), were identified by comprising a total of 8587 completed questionnaires and 38 studies for meta-analyses. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD), insomnia, somatization, and fear in patients with COVID-19 was 16.6% (10.1%-23.1%), 37.7% (29.3%-46.2%), 41.5% (9.3%-73.7%), 68.3% (48.6%-88.0%), 36.5% (20.2%-52.8%), 47.6% (9.4%-85.7%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in severe COVID-19 patients (intensive care unit inpatients) was higher than mild or clinically stable COVID-19 patients. LIMITATIONS: A significant degree of heterogeneity in terms of populations, sampling methods, scales was noted across studies. CONCLUSIONS: There existed high proportions of COVID-19 patients with psychological problem. The prevalence of psychological problems was closely related to the patients themselves, their surroundings and social support. It is imperative to provide ontime psychological care service for COVID-19 patients and to follow-up them for a longer period.","Dong, Fei; Liu, Hong-Liang; Dai, Ning; Yang, Ming; Liu, Jian-Ping",J Affect Disord,,161

The problem is motivated by the practice in the video game industry, where a retailer offers discounts on selected supportive products (e.g. video games) to customers who have also purchased the core products (e.g. video game consoles). We formulate this problem as an optimization problem to determine the prices of different products and the selection of products with add-on discounts. To overcome the computational challenge of this optimization problem, we propose an efficient FPTAS algorithm that can solve the problem approximately to any desired accuracy. Moreover, we consider the revenue management problem in the setting where the retailer has no prior knowledge of the demand functions of different products. To resolve this problem, we propose a UCB-based learning algorithm that uses the FPTAS optimization algorithm as a subroutine. We show that our learning algorithm can converge to the optimal algorithm that has access to the true demand functions, and we prove that the convergence rate is tight up to a certain logarithmic term. In addition, we conduct numerical experiments with the real-world transaction data we collect from a popular video gaming brand's online store on Tmall.com. The experiment results illustrate our learning algorithm's robust performance and fast convergence in various scenarios. We also compare our algorithm with the optimal policy that does not use any add-on discount, and the results show the advantages of using the add-on discount strategy in practice.","Simchi-Levi, David; Sun, Rui; Zhang, Huanan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00947v1.pdf,161
304773,"Renin-angiotensin system blockers and susceptibility to COVID-19: an international, open science, cohort analysis",2021,"OBJECTIVE: This paper extends a prior human operator model to capture human steering performance in the teleoperation of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in path-following scenarios with varying speed. BACKGROUND: A prior study presented a human operator model to predict human steering performance in the teleoperation of a passenger-sized UGV at constant speeds. To enable applications to varying speed scenarios, the model needs to be extended to incorporate speed control and be able to predict human performance under the effect of accelerations/decelerations and various time delays induced by the teleoperation setting. A strategy is also needed to parameterize the model without human subject data for a truly predictive capability. METHOD: This paper adopts the ACT-R cognitive architecture and two-point steering model used in the previous work, and extends the model by incorporating a far-point speed control model to allow for varying speed. A parameterization strategy is proposed to find a robust set of parameters for each time delay to maximize steering performance. Human subject experiments are conducted to validate the model. RESULTS: Results show that the parameterized model can predict both the trend of average lane keeping error and its lowest value for human subjects under different time delays. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model successfully extends the prior computational model to predict human steering behavior in a teleoperated UGV with varying speed. APPLICATION: This computational model can be used to substitute for human operators in the process of development and testing of teleoperated UGV technologies and allows fully simulation-based development and studies.","Li, Chen; Tang, Yue; Zheng, Yingshi; Jayakumar, Paramsothy; Ersal, Tulga",Hum Factors,,161

They are the basis for calculating the annual average daily traffic volume, obtaining information about the relevant traffic volume, or calculating indicators for converting traffic volume from short-term measurements to average daily traffic volume. The covid-19 pandemic has contributed to extensive social and economic anomalies worldwide. In addition to the health consequences, the impact on travel behavior on the transport network was also sudden, extensive, and unpredictable. Changes in the transport behavior resulted in different values of traffic volume on the road and street network than before. The article presents road traffic volume analysis in the city before and during the restrictions related to covid-19. Selected traffic characteristics were compared for 2019 and 2020. This analysis made it possible to characterize the daily, weekly and annual variability of traffic volume in 2019 and 2020. Moreover, the article attempts to estimate daily traffic patterns at particular stages of the pandemic. These types of patterns were also constructed for the weeks in 2019 corresponding to these stages of the pandemic. Daily traffic volume distributions in 2020 were compared with the corresponding ones in 2019. The obtained results may be useful in terms of planning operational and strategic activities in the field of traffic management in the city and management in subsequent stages of a pandemic or subsequent pandemics.","Macioszek, Elżbieta Kurek Agata",Remote Sensing,,161

Previous studies with coronavirus (SARS-CoV) point to gender differences in infection and disease progression with increased susceptibility in male patients, indicating that estrogens may be associated with physiological protection against the coronavirus. Therefore, the objectives of this work are threefold. First, we aim to summarize the SARS-CoV-2 infection pathway and the roles both the virus and patient play in COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) progression, clinical symptomatology, and mortality. Second, we detail the effect estrogen has on viral infection and host infection response, including its role in both the regulation of key viral receptor expression and the mediation of inflammatory activity. Finally, we describe how ERs (estrogen receptors) and RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-products) play a critical role in metabolic pathways, which we envisage could maintain a close interplay with SARS-CoV and COVID-19 mortality rates, despite a current lack of research directly determining how. Taken together, we present the current state of the field regarding SARS-CoV-2 research and illuminate where research is needed to better define the role both estrogen and metabolic comorbidities have in the COVID-19 disease state, which can be key in screening potential therapeutic options as the search for effective treatments continue.","Stilhano, Roberta Sessa; Costa, Angelica Jardim; Nishino, Michelle Sayuri; Shams, Shahin; Bartolomeo, Cynthia Silva; Breithaupt-Faloppa, Ana Cristina; Silva, Eduardo Alexandre; Ramirez, Ana Lopez; Prado, Carla Maximo; Ureshino, Rodrigo Portes",FASEB J,,161

METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting with ACS at 18 Centers in Northern-Italy during the Covid-19 outbreak were included. In-hospital all-cause death was the primary outcome. In-hospital cardiovascular death along with mechanical and electrical complications were the secondary ones. A case period (February 20, 2020-May 3, 2020) was compared vs. same-year (January 1-February 19, 2020) and previous-year control periods (February 20-May 3, 2019). ACS patients with Covid-19 were further compared with those without. RESULTS: Among 779 ACS patients admitted during the case period, 67 (8.6%) tested positive for Covid-19. In-hospital all-cause mortality was significantly higher during the case period compared to the control periods (6.4% vs. 3.5% vs. 4.4% respectively; p 0.026), but similar after excluding patients with COVID-19 (4.5% vs. 3.5% vs. 4.4%; p 0.73). Cardiovascular mortality was similar between the study groups. After multivariable adjustment, admission for ACS during the COVID-19 outbreak had no impact on in-hospital mortality. In the case period, patients with concomitant ACS and Covid-19 experienced significantly higher in-hospital mortality (25% vs. 5%, p < 0.001) compared to patients without. Moreover, higher rates of cardiovascular death, cardiogenic shock and sustained ventricular tachycardia were found in Covid-19 patients. CONCLUSION: ACS patients presenting during the Covid-19 pandemic experienced increased all-cause mortality, driven by Covid-19 positive status due to higher rates of cardiogenic shock and sustained ventricular tachycardia. No differences in cardiovascular mortality compared to non-pandemic scenarios were reported.","D039,; Ascenzo, Fabrizio; De Filippo, Ovidio; Borin, Andrea; Barbieri, Lucia; Adamo, Marianna; Morici, Nuccia; Truffa Giachet, Alessandra; Iannaccone, Mario; Crimi, Gabriele; Gaido, Luca; Bocchino, Pier Paolo; Pivato, Carlo Andrea; Campo, Gianluca; Trabattoni, Daniela; Chieffo, Alaide; Gaibazzi, Nicola; Angelini, Filippo; Rubboli, Andrea; Rognoni, Andrea; Musumeci, Giuseppe; Ugo, Fabrizio; Gili, Sebastiano; Cortese, Bernardo; Vadalà, Paolo; Dusi, Veronica; Gallone, Guglielmo; Patti, Giuseppe; de Ferrari, Gaetano Maria",Int J Cardiol,,161

This article describes the author's experience providing nursing care to a female patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning to Taiwan from overseas. During the patient's period of isolation (February 5th to February 29th, 2020), the author used Roy's adaptation model to perform first-level holistic physical, psychological, and social nursing assessments and collected health-problem information using face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, and observations via a remote monitoring system. A second level of assessment confirmed that the problems faced by the patient included (1) existing infections related to COVID-19 and (2) anxiety related to uncertainties about disease prognosis, forgiveness from the family, and potential violations of personal privacy by the media. Due to the special nature of the isolation ward, the author used a remote physiological monitoring system to monitor the vital signs, fever, and shortness of breath status of the patient to quickly decrease her physical discomfort and to improve her self-care ability during hospitalization. Environmental cleanliness was strictly maintained to reduce the risk of cross-infection and ensure patient safety. To alleviate patient anxiety, the author established a good therapeutic interpersonal relationship with the patient by making 10-60 minutes of caring calls to her each day, by providing individual care measures, and by using the Internet to play audio and video to teach mindfulness meditation. Caring for COVID-19 cases is a completely new experience.

318767,The relative transmissibility of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections among close contacts,2020,"Peptides are promising antagonists against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To expedite drug discovery, a computational approach is widely employed for the initial screening of anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidates. This study aimed to investigate the potential of peptides from quinoa seed proteins as multi-target antagonists against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain, main protease, and papain-like protease. Five quinoa proteins were hydrolyzed in silico by papain and subtilisin. Among the 1465 peptides generated, seven could interact stably with the key binding residues and catalytic residues of the viral targets, mainly via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The seven peptides were comparable or superior to previously reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 peptides based on docking scores. Key residues in the seven peptides contributing to binding to viral targets were determined by computational alanine scanning. The seven peptides were predicted in silico to be non-toxic and non-allergenic. The peptides ranged between 546.66 and 3974.87 g/mol in molecular mass, besides exhibiting basic and cationic properties (isoelectric points: 8.26-12.10; net charges: 0.1-4.0). Among the seven peptides, VEDKGMMHQQRMMEKAMNIPRMCGTMQRKCRMS was found to bind the largest number of key residues on the targets. In conclusion, seven putative non-toxic, non-allergenic, multi-target anti-SARS-CoV-2 peptides were identified from quinoa seed proteins.

Secondary analysis was undertaken of an online mixed-methods survey open to all mental health care staff in the UK involving 363 staff working with women in the perinatal period. Staff perceived the mental health of perinatal women to be particularly vulnerable to the impact of stressors associated with the pandemic such as social isolation (rated by 79.3% as relevant or extremely relevant; 288/363) and domestic violence and abuse (53.3%; 192/360). As a result of changes to mental health and other health and social care services, staff reported feeling less able to assess women, particularly their relationship with their baby (43.3%; 90/208), and to mobilise safeguarding procedures (29.4%; 62/211). While 42% of staff reported that some women engaged poorly with virtual appointments, they also found flexible remote consulting to be beneficial for some women and helped time management due to reductions in travel time. Delivery of perinatal care needs to be tailored to women's needs; virtual appointments are perceived not to be appropriate for assessments but may be helpful for some women in subsequent interactions. Safeguarding and other risk assessment procedures must remain robust in spite of modifications made to service delivery during pandemics.","Wilson, C A; Dalton-Locke, C; Johnson, S; Simpson, A; Oram, S; Howard, L M",,,161

Moreover, metabolic diseases-such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia-predispose to severe complications and mortality from COVID-19. We investigate the prevalence and consequences of undiagnosed metabolic illnesses, particularly DM and pre-diabetes, in international migrant workers with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, we analyzed the medical records of international migrant workers with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in Singapore from April 21 to June 1, 2020. We determined the prevalence of DM and pre-diabetes, and analyzed the risk of developing complications, such as pneumonia and electrolyte abnormalities, based on age and diagnosis of DM, and pre-diabetes. Results: Two hundred and fouty male migrant workers, with mean age of 44.2 years [standard deviation (SD), 8.5years], were included. Twenty one patients (8.8%) were diagnosed with pre-diabetes, and 19 (7.9%) with DM. DM was poorly controlled with a mean HbA1c of 9.9% (SD, 2.4%). 73.7% of the patients with DM and all the patients with pre-diabetes were previously undiagnosed. Pre-diabetes was associated with higher risk of pneumonia [odds ratio (OR), 10.8, 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.65-32.1; P < 0.0001], hyponatremia (OR, 8.83; 95% CI, 1.17-66.6; P = 0.0342), and hypokalemia (OR, 4.58; 95% CI, 1.52-13.82; P = 0.0069). Moreover, patients with DM or pre-diabetes developed COVID-19 infection with lower viral RNA levels. Conclusions: The high prevalence of undiagnosed pre-diabetes among international migrant workers increases their risk of pneumonia and electrolyte abnormalities from COVID-19.","Tee, Louis Y; Alhamid, Sharifah Munirah; Tan, Jeriel L; Oo, Theik Di; Chien, Jaime; Galinato, Primavera; Tan, Seow Yen; Humaira, Shafi; Fong, Raymond Kok Choon; Puar, Troy H; Loh, Wann Jia; Santosa, Anindita; Khoo, Joan; Rosario, Barbara Helen",Front Public Health,,161

COVID-19 leads to a mild to severe respiratory disease and affects different organs and has become a global concern since December 2019. Meanwhile, molecular biology and diagnostic laboratories played an essential role in diagnosis of the disease by introducing serological and molecular tests. Molecular-based techniques are reliable detection tools for SARS-CoV-2 and used for diagnosis of patients especially in the early stage of the disease. While, serological assays are considered as additional tools to verify the asymptomatic infections, tracing previous contacts of individuals, vaccine efficacy, and study the seroprevalance. The average time of the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the patient's serum is 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms for both IgM and IgA and 10-18 days for IgG. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, FDA has approved and authorized a series of serological laboratory tests for early diagnosis. Serological assays have low-cost and provide fast results but have poor sensitivity in the early stage of the viral infection. Although the serological tests may not play an important role in the active case of COVID-19, it could be effective to determine the immunity of health care workers, and confirm late COVID-19 cases during the outbreak. In this review, we compared various laboratory diagnostic assays for COVID-19.","Mansourabadi, Amir Hossein; Sadeghalvad, Mona; Mohammadi-Motlagh, Hamid-Reza; Amirzargar, Aliakbar",Iran J Immunol,,161

Materials and Methods: The study includes 386 consecutive patients recruited from 10 March to 30 June 2020 among those being treated at the Institute of Psychopathology in Rome (Italy) with an age &#8805;18 years and meeting DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (35.2%), bipolar I (BD-I) (21.5%) or II (BD-II) (28.8%) disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (7.5%), panic disorder (PD) (7.0%) or social anxiety (SA). A total of 34.2% had lifetime comorbid Axis I disorders and 15.3% had alcohol/drug abuse disorders. Using a semi-structured interview, we investigated if the impact of COVID-19 stress for patients has been similar, higher or lower than that of their family and friends and, for patients with relapse/symptoms worsening, if there was a relationship between the clinical condition worsening and the pandemic stress. Results: Compared with that experienced by their family members and friends, the psychological impact of pandemic stress was similar in 52.1% of the sample, better in 37.1% and worse in 10.8%. In 21 patients (5.4%), the stress triggered a recurrence or worsened the symptoms. Patients with OCD had a higher rate of worsening due to pandemic stress compared to patients with MDD (p = 0.033), although, overall, the &#967;2 test was not significant among primary diagnoses (&#967;2 = 8.368; p = 0.057). Conclusions: The psychological and psychopathological consequences of COVID-19 stress in our outpatients were very modest.

Design/Methodology/Approaeh: Assessing the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 on all aspects of human civilization is an urgent scientific challenge today. However, it is already clear that it is human potential that will be impacted most by the pandemic. Using artificial neural networks with radial basis functions, the article predicts the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on staff turnover, which is one of the most important indicators ofpersonnel security. Findings: The network architecture is built and its mathematical description is made. The main factors influencing staff turnover as one of the main components ofpersonnel security have been defined. Staff turnover in the EU in 2020 and its dependence on the GDP change value has been analyzed. Practical Implications: Personnel security of enterprises and organizations is the basis of economic security nationwide. Nowadays, the Covid-19 pandemic first and foremost hits staff, especially their mental and physical health, thus having a direct impact on the level of personnel security. That is why, in order to effectively prevent a decline in the level of economic security, the impact of the pandemic on key personnel security indicators should be monitored in a timely manner. This is possible then using our metod. Originality/Value: The value of the research is to test the adequacy of the artificial neural network with RBF in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on personnel security. It also offers testing the prognostic properties of this type of ANN and considers the possibility of their use for analysis, evaluation and forecasting of socio-economic phenomena and processes.","Martyniuk, Volodymyr Tsygylyk Natalia Skowron Stanisław",European Research Studies,,161

A reduced-bias estimation approach for multivariate regression is employed to address the issue of small-sample bias. We find that the PIF index has a negative and significant impact on cumulative stock market returns. The impact of PIF is persistent, which can be explained by mispricing from investors' excessive pessimism. We further reveal that the PIF index directly predicts stock market returns through noise trading. Investors' Internet search behaviors enhance the fear of the pandemic, and pandemic-induced fear determines future stock market returns, rather than the number of cases and deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Su, Zhi Liu Peng Fang Tong",Global Finance Journal,,161

As many as half of all HCWs will exhibit clinically significant distress. This distress may endure for years, and health care institutions must respond to these emotional needs. We propose the Matched Emotional Supports in Health Care (MESH) Framework to guide institutions in implementing a tiered, or ""stepped care"" model for deploying sustainable emotional support programs for HCWs for COVID-19 and beyond. Recognizing the variability in HCWs' response to stress, MESH outlines a continuum of services, including universal (e.g., self-help), selected (e.g., support from trained volunteers), and indicated (e.g., professional therapy, psychotropic medication management) interventions matched to individual need. We provide a targeted review of evidence-based resources available at each level of care and potential processes for determining when higher levels of care are needed. Finally, we delineate key implementation factors for institutions to consider in developing, implementing, and sustaining services for HCWs. Employing the MESH Framework may also facilitate health care institutions' ability to meet the fourth aim of the Quadruple Aims of Health Care to ensure a healthy workforce for this and future crises.

Objective: The objective of the study was to study the effect of the reduced form of methylene blue (MB) on the improvement of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and respiratory rate (RR). Methods: In an academic medical center, 80 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 were randomly assigned to receive either oral MB along with standard of care (SOC) (MB group, n = 40) or SOC only (SOC group, n=40). The primary outcomes were SpO2 and RR on the 3rd and 5th days. The secondary outcomes were hospital stay and mortality within 28 days. Results: In the MB group, a significant improvement in SpO2 and RR was observed on the 3rd day (for both, p < 0.0001) and also the 5th day (for both, p < 0.0001). In the SOC group, there was no significant improvement in SpO2 (p = 0.24) and RR (p = 0.20) on the 3rd day, although there was a significant improvement of SpO2 (p = 0.002) and RR (p = 0.01) on the 5th day. In the MB group in comparison to the SOC group, the rate ratio of increased SpO2 was 13.5 and 2.1 times on the 3rd and 5th days, respectively. In the MB group compared with the SOC group, the rate ratio of RR improvement was 10.1 and 3.7 times on the 3rd and 5th days, respectively. The hospital stay was significantly shortened in the MB group (p = 0.004), and the mortality was 12.5% and 22.5% in the MB and SOC groups, respectively. Conclusions: The addition of MB to the treatment protocols significantly improved SpO2 and respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients, which resulted in decreased hospital stay and mortality.

334443,"Estimating asymptomatic, undetected and total cases for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan: a mathematical modeling study",2021,"Although the COVID-19 pandemic shows no signs of abating, public health strategies have transitioned from containment to harm reduction. In light of this paradigm shift, it is critical that individuals take steps to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In the United States, the CDC recommends that individuals wear face coverings in public places, such as grocery stores. As lockdowns are being phased out around the world, authorities are requiring the use of such masks in public places while maintaining social distance. Individuals (including healthcare professionals outside of their clinical settings) and manufacturers are following the CDC’s recommendation. But, many currently available masks are not form-fitting, are not customizable, and are uncomfortable with even short-term use, thereby undercutting their effectiveness. Moreover, because cotton absorbs and retains the moisture found in an exhaled breath masks made of cotton have the potential to increase the wearer’s risk of infection. Thus, as we shift to harm reduction and social distancing measures relax, it is imperative that these shortcomings in fabric masks are addressed and that is the motivation for this research. The overall objective of the research is to design, develop, and test a fabric mask that is effective while being comfortable during continuous use over long periods of time. As the first step in the design process, we reviewed the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. We analyzed a medical mask and a fabric mask in the market and identified their shortcomings. We carried out an in-depth analysis of user needs and developed the performance requirements of the proposed mask. We defined the architecture of the mask comprising the following principal components: Barrier, Form-Fitting, Positioning, and Fastening. We tested and evaluated candidate materials for the components and developed the design specifications and construction details for the mask. We produced the mask and carried out subjective testing on a user in a typical workplace setting; we demonstrated that the mask was form-fitting, customizable, washable, and could be worn continuously and routinely over extended periods of time by individuals and therefore could serve as an effective means to reduce the harm from SARS-CoV-2.","Park, Sungmee; Jayaraman, Sundaresan",J.

Hence, to collect high-quality data on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be the immediate priority. METHODS: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases was conducted from January 1, 2020 to December 26, 2020 for eligible studies reporting on the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Studies meeting the following criteria were included in the analysis: (1) included patients with COVD-19; (2) recorded the prevalence of depression, anxiety, or insomnia symptom; (3) sample size &#8805;30; (4) with validated screening tools; and (5) passed through the international peer-review process. Data extraction and quality assessment was independently performed by two reviewers. The quality effects meta-analysis was conducted further to calculate the pooled prevalence. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included for analysis with a total of 4318 patients. The pooled prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms was 38% (95% CI = 25-51), 38% (95% CI = 24-52), and 48% (95% CI = 11-85), respectively. Neither subgroup analysis nor sensitivity analysis can explain the source of high heterogeneity. In addition, the prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms varied based on different screening tools. CONCLUSIONS: The present systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms are prevalent in a considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19. Thus, early detection and properly intervention for mental illness in this population are of great significance. Additionally, the quality of included studies to date has been variable, and ongoing surveillance is essential.","Liu, Chaomeng; Pan, Weigang; Li, Li; Li, Bing; Ren, Yanping; Ma, Xin",J Psychosom Res,,161

337769,Management of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with COVID-19 Infection,2021,"Camera-based physiological measurement is a growing field with neural models providing state-the-art-performance. Prior research have explored various ``end-to-end'' models; however these methods still require several preprocessing steps. These additional operations are often non-trivial to implement making replication and deployment difficult and can even have a higher computational budget than the ``core'' network itself. In this paper, we propose two novel and efficient neural models for camera-based physiological measurement called EfficientPhys that remove the need for face detection, segmentation, normalization, color space transformation or any other preprocessing steps. Using an input of raw video frames, our models achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on three public datasets. We show that this is the case whether using a transformer or convolutional backbone. We further evaluate the latency of the proposed networks and show that our most light weight network also achieves a 33% improvement in efficiency.","Liu, Xin; Hill, Brian L.; Jiang, Ziheng; Patel, Shwetak; McDuff, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04447v1.pdf,161

342394,"Development and validation of the long covid symptom and impact tools, a set of patient-reported instruments constructed from patients' lived experience",2021,"As células germinativas primordiais (CGPs) são capazes de gerar um novo indivíduo, são originárias de gametas, os quais transmitirão os materiais genéticos para as futuras gerações. Normalmente, a linha germinal de mamífero é determinada por fatores genéticos e epigenéticos que possuem funções essenciais para guiar na direção e desenvolvimento das CGPs, bem como das células germinativas embrionárias (CGEs). A reprogramação epigenética é fundamental para a regulação do genoma durante o desenvolvimento das células germinativas responsáveis por originar a linhagem gametogênica nos mamíferos. A metilação e desmetilação em CGPs são um evento único, essencial para apagar a memória epigenética e também prevenir transmissões de epimutações para a próxima geração. Assim, o completo entendimento das vias e mecanismos para a migração inicial e diferenciação destas células em CGEs podem ser importantes para identificar e corrigir falhas possíveis nesses processos, o que será importante, no futuro, para o desenvolvimento e desempenho reprodutivo. A maioria dos estudos com CGPs e CGEs é realizado em camundongos, porém nem sempre esta espécie torna-se o melhor modelo de estudo quando se quer transpor esses conhecimentos a humanos. O cão doméstico (Canis lúpus familiaris) apresenta-se como um modelo ideal para o estudo do desenvolvimento em mamíferos, pois possui inúmeras similaridades com a bioquímica, fisiologia e genética. Deste modo, torna-se interessante expandir os estudos sobre as CGPs e CGEs na espécie canina, a fim de mostrar a importância de diferentes modelos que se assemelham a seres humanos. Portanto, objetiva-se, nesta proposta, identificar qual é a dinâmica de marcadores pluripotentes, germinativos e epigenéticos que são importantes para o desenvolvimento das CGPs e CGEs caninas. Para tal procedimento, essa pesquisa foi dividida em duas fases: a primeira, consiste no processo in vivo, desde o desenvolvimento inicial do embrião até a completa formação da crista gônadal. Análises de Q-PCR e imunofluorescência para marcadores pluripotentes, germinativos e epigenéticos foram realizados para criar um perfil de genes que são importantes para o desenvolvimento das CGPs caninas. Prosseguiu-se para a segunda fase in vitro, que incide na derivação e caracterização das CGEs caninas. Ensaios de alcalina fosfatase, imunofluorescência, Q-PCR e formação de teratoma foram efetivados para comprovar a linhagem de células CGEs. Como resultado in vivo, percebe-se que diferentes padrões de marcações e genes foram expressos nas CGPs, comprovando que a espécie canina se assemelha mais com os humanos do que com os camundongos. Os resultados in vitro mostraram que foi possível derivar as células CGEs e que estas conseguem reter sua pluripotencialidade e que diminuem a expressão dos genes germinativos. Porém, essas células tendem a se diferenciar em outros tecidos somáticos, mesmo com a adição de suplementos, fato também notado em CGEs humanas.","SOUZA, ALINE FERNANDA DE",,,161

The IL-6 receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody tocilizumab has been repurposed for COVID-19, but prospective trials and dose-finding studies in COVID-19 have not yet fully reported. We conducted a single-arm phase II trial of low-dose tocilizumab in nonintubated hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, radiographic pulmonary infiltrate, fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) &#8805; 40 mg/L. We hypothesized that doses significantly lower than the emerging standards of 400 mg or 8 mg/kg would resolve clinical and laboratory indicators of hyperinflammation. A dose range from 40 to 200 mg was evaluated, with allowance for one repeat dose at 24 to 48 hours. The primary objective was to assess the relationship of dose to fever resolution and CRP response. Thirty-two patients received low-dose tocilizumab, with the majority experiencing fever resolution (75%) and CRP decline consistent with IL-6 pathway abrogation (86%) in the 24-48 hours following drug administration. There was no evidence of a relationship between dose and fever resolution or CRP decline over the dose range of 40-200 mg. Within the 28-day follow-up, 5 (16%) patients died. For patients who recovered, median time to clinical recovery was 3 days (interquartile range, 2-5). Clinically presumed and/or cultured bacterial superinfections were reported in 5 (16%) patients. Low-dose tocilizumab was associated with rapid improvement in clinical and laboratory measures of hyperinflammation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 256 participants age 60 through 95 completed the following self-administered questionnaires: Perceived Susceptibility, Life Orientation Test (LOT-R), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Symptoms of Depression (CES-D) and health-related quality of life (SF-12v2 Health Survey). Data were collected from June to July 2020, 3 months after the COVID-19 state of emergency was declared in Israel. Participants were interviewed by family medicine residents via telephone. Statistical analyses included Pearson correlations, t-tests between groups, regression analyses, and Hayes' PROCESS to analyze a moderated mediation model. RESULTS: Of the elderly participants, 37.5% were classified as having depression. Optimism, social support and health-related quality of life were positively associated. Higher optimism and social support were related to lower perceived susceptibility and lower depression. Results of a multivariate regression explained 29% of the variance in depression and 19% of the variance in health-related quality of life. The relationships assessed by 4 Process models were significant, such that higher optimism and social support were related to lower perceived susceptibility, which in turn was related to higher depression and lower health-related quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Optimism and social support may be effective in coping with challenges and buffering depression. Perceived susceptibility may mediate the association of optimism and social support with higher depression and lower health-related quality of life. The conclusions of this study underscore the need to treat depression among older adults during this period. Hence, healthcare providers should also support elderly patients living at home. In giving this type of help, healthcare providers should strive to increase social support and optimism among older adults.","Levkovich, Inbar; Shinan-Altman, Shiri; Essar Schvartz, Neta; Alperin, Mordechai",J Prim Care Community Health,,161

METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of SDD after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy. Eligibility criteria included age younger than 80 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I/II, caretaker for &#8805;24 hours postoperatively, and surgical start before 1 PM. Perioperative data were obtained through the medical record and direct patient inquiry. A satisfaction survey was administered at the postoperative visit. A historical control group was used to compare outcomes. RESULTS: Forty-seven women met the eligibility criteria. Mean age was 62 (±9) years. Most were White (95.7%), were overweight (body mass index, 27.7 ± 5.5 kg/m2), and had stage 3 prolapse (63.8%). Same-day discharge was achieved for 37 patients (78.7%). Patient characteristics of the SDD cohort were similar to the routine-care cohort, with the exception of previous hysterectomy (57.5% vs 100.0%, P < 0.001) and the American Society of Anesthesiologists score (2 [1-2] vs 2 [1-3], P = 0.002). There were significantly fewer postoperative telephone calls in the SDD cohort but no other differences in health care resource utilization. Adverse events did not differ between groups.

The aim of the present study was to validate the Hebrew version of the Desire Thinking Questionnaire (DTQ; Caselli & Spada, 2011) in a sample of adolescents and to investigate its relationship with measures of thought suppression, impulsivity and individual-based compulsive sexual behaviour. Methods: In Study 1, a convenience sample of 718 adolescents completed the newly translated Desire Thinking Questionnaire in Hebrew (DTQ-H) and results were subjected to an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). In Study 2, a convenience sample of 379 adolescents completed a battery of questionnaires including the DTQ-H. A Confirmatory Factors Analysis was performed on the DTQ-H and validity was ascertained by correlating with other measures. Results: In Study 1, a 9-item two-factor structure was identified. A 6-item two-factor structure was confirmed in Study 2. Results also indicated that the DTQ-H has acceptable levels of reliability, and good concurrent and incremental validity in predicting compulsive sexual behaviour. Conclusions: The 6-item DTQ-H appears to be a reliable and valid measure of desire thinking and may be used also on adolescents - an understudied population.","Efrati, Yaniv; Kolubinski, Daniel C; Caselli, Gabriele; Spada, Marcantonio M",J Behav Addict,,161

348066,COVID-19: Poor outcomes in patients with zinc deficiency,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the respiratory and physical function of patients who retested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA during post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rehabilitation. METHODS: A total of 302 discharged COVID-19 patients were included. Discharged patients were followed up for 14 days to 6 months. The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, Borg rating of perceived exertion, and manual muscle testing (MMT) scores on day 14 and at 6 months after discharge were compared between the redetectable positive (RP) and non-RP (NRP) groups. Prognoses of respiratory and physical function were compared between patients who recovered from moderate and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the study patients, 7.6% were RP. The proportion of patients who used antiviral drugs was significantly lower in the RP group than in the NRP group. There were no differences in mMRC, Borg, or MMT scores within the RP and NRP groups. The mMRC, Borg, and MMT scores were worse for patients with severe disease when compared to those with moderate disease at both follow-up time points. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients who did not take antiviral drugs were more likely to be RP after discharge. The recovery of respiratory and physical function was not related to re-positivity during rehabilitation, but was related to disease severity during hospitalization.","Wu, Qian; Hou, Xinwei; Li, Hongwei; Guo, Jing; Li, Yajie; Yang, Fangfei; Zhang, Yan; Xie, Yi; Li, Li",Int J Infect Dis,,161

Our objective was to update the data in a living systematic review of the literature concerning the efficacy and toxicity of the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Data sources were Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus up, preprint servers and Google from 8th October 2020 till 24th February 2021. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies at low or moderate risk of bias. The participants were hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and intervention was tocilizumab versus placebo or standard of care. We pooled crude risk ratios (RRs) of RCTs with a random effects model and evaluated inconsistency between studies with I2. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Of 1600 citations, eight RCTs and 28 cohorts were eligible. The eight RCTs had low risk of bias, and with 6311 patients they examined the effect of tocilizumab on short-term mortality; pooled RR was 0.91 (95%CI 0.78-1.07, I2 25%). Only the REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY trials, with the majority of their patients on concomitant corticosteroids, showed lower 30-day mortality with tocilizumab use: RR 0.74 (95%CI 0.59-0.93) and 0.89 (95%CI 0.81-0.97), respectively. Seven RCTs, with 5391 patients, examined the effect of tocilizumab on risk of mechanical ventilation; pooled RR was 0.84 (95%CI 0.76-0.93), I2 0%, with a corresponding number needed to treat of 20 (95%CI 14.3-33.3). Eight RCTs, with 5340 patients, examined the effect of tocilizumab on a composite of poor outcome; pooled RR was 0.82 (95%CI 0.76-0.90, I2 3%). Data from the RCTs showed a lower risk of infections and no higher risk of serious adverse events with tocilizumab: pooled RR 0.67 (95%CI 0.45-0.99, eight RCTs) and 0.85 (95%CI 0.63-1.16, seven RCTs), respectively. Among 28 cohorts with 15 484 patients, the pooled adjusted RR for mortality was 0.53 (95%CI 0.43-0.67, I2 76%). CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative high-certainty evidence shows that tocilizumab reduces the risk of mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that tocilizumab reduces the risk of poor outcome and the risk of secondary infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

348795,Favourable outcome after a delayed complication secondary to COVID-19,2021,"World Health Organization (WHO) stated COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, 26,795,847 cases have been reported worldwide, and 878,963 lost their lives due to the illness by September 3, 2020. Prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic will enable policymakers to optimize the use of healthcare system capacity and resource allocation to minimize the fatality rate. In this research, we design a novel hybrid reinforcement learning-based algorithm capable of solving complex optimization problems. We apply our algorithm to several well-known benchmarks and show that the proposed methodology provides quality solutions for most complex benchmarks. Besides, we show the dominance of the offered method over state-of-the-art methods through several measures. Moreover, to demonstrate the suggested method's efficiency in optimizing real-world problems, we implement our approach to the most recent data from Quebec, Canada, to predict the COVID-19 outbreak. Our algorithm, combined with the most recent mathematical model for COVID-19 pandemic prediction, accurately reflected the future trend of the pandemic with a mean square error of 6.29E-06. Furthermore, we generate several scenarios for deepening our insight into pandemic growth. We determine essential factors and deliver various managerial insights to help policymakers making decisions regarding future social measures.","Khalilpourazari, Soheyl; Hashemi Doulabi, Hossein",Ann Oper Res,,161
348796,Favourable outcome after a delayed complication secondary to COVID-19,2021,"In December 2019, a novel disease, coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan, People's Republic of China. COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) presumed to have jumped species from another mammal to humans. This virus has caused a rapidly spreading global pandemic. To date, over 300,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in England and over 40,000 patients have died. While progress has been achieved in managing this disease, the factors in addition to age that affect the severity and mortality of COVID-19 have not been clearly identified. Recent studies of COVID-19 in several countries identified links between air pollution and death rates. Here, we explored potential links between major fossil fuel-related air pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 mortality in England. We compared current SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths from public databases to both regional and subregional air pollution data monitored at multiple sites across England. After controlling for population density, age and median income, we show positive relationships between air pollutant concentrations, particularly nitrogen oxides, and COVID-19 mortality and infectivity. Using detailed UK Biobank data, we further show that PM2.5 was a major contributor to COVID-19 cases in England, as an increase of 1 m3 in the long-term average of PM2.5 was associated with a 12% increase in COVID-19 cases. The relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 withstands variations in the temporal scale of assessments (single-year vs 5-year average) and remains significant after adjusting for socioeconomic, demographic and health-related variables. We conclude that a small increase in air pollution leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 infectivity and mortality rate in England. This study provides a framework to guide both health and emissions policies in countries affected by this pandemic.","Travaglio, Marco; Yu, Yizhou; Popovic, Rebeka; Selley, Liza; Leal, Nuno Santos; Martins, Luis Miguel",Environ Pollut,,161
349376,Nutritional status of patients with COVID-19,2020,"A infecção pelo Feline leukemia virus (FeLV), agente causador da Leucemia Viral Felina, pode levar a neoplasias fatais, doenças degenerativas do sistema hematopoiético e imunossupressão. O contato próximo favorece a transmissão do FeLV entre gatos que compartilham o mesmo espaço e instalações. Para a execução de testes diagnósticos, atualmente, o sangue e seus derivados são as principais amostras biológicas utilizadas. A coleta de sangue é geralmente por punção venosa, exigindo contenção física ou química do animal. Tornar o diagnóstico das retroviroses felinas mais prático e fácil é crucial para reduzir os impactos negativos na saúde animal e aumentar o número de animais testados. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o uso de amostras de swab de mucosa oral, conjuntival e retal, no diagnóstico molecular da infecção pelo FeLV. Além do sangue total utilizado como amostra de referência, foram coletados de cada animal dois swab orais, dois conjuntivais e um retal. Todas as amostras séricas foram submetidas a testes imunoenzimáticos e à reação em cadeia da polimerase (PCR) para a amplificação do fragmento do gene gag do DNA proviral. A mesma PCR também foi realizada em todas as amostras obtidas por swab. Foram selecionados para o experimento 145 animais de forma aleatória. A ocorrência para o FeLV na população estudada foi de 49,66% por diagnóstico molecular em capa leucocitária, e 22,76% por identificação da antigenemia (p27 circulante). A acurácia para cada metodologia avaliada foi igual a 91,72% para a PCR de amostras obtidas por swab oral; 91,23% para as de swab conjuntival e de 85,50% para as obtidas por swab retal. A sensibilidade e a especificidade de cada PCR avaliada em relação à PCR de referência foram, respectivamente, 86,11% e 97,26% para a PCR de swab oral; 90% e 92,59% para a PCR de swab conjuntival; e 74,24% e 95,77% para a PCR de swab retal. Os valores do coeficiente Kappa para PCR de Swab Oral, PCR de Swab Conjuntival e PCR de Swab Retal foram, respectivamente, 0,89; 0,89 e 0,82. A obtenção de amostras por meio de swab de mucosas oral, conjuntival e retal, para o diagnóstico molecular da infecção pelo FeLV, constitui uma excelente alternativa à venopunção, especialmente em locais onde a presença de profissionais treinados e habilitados é limitada ou inexistente, ou em abrigos onde a população de felinos é grande. Além disso, trata-se de uma metodologia mais rápida, menos laboriosa, de menor custo e melhor aceitação pelo animal. Outro achado relevante desse estudo foi a detecção do DNA proviral do FeLV em células das mucosas oral e conjuntival, possibilitando o diagnóstico de animais em fase regressiva da infecção.","VICTOR, RAPHAEL MATTOSO",,,161

352282,A 95-year-old patient with unexpected coronavirus disease 2019 masked by aspiration pneumonia: a case report,2020,"BACKGROUND: The role of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for COVID-19 has been a subject of considerable discussion. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 based on randomised controlled trials is required. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether vitamin D supplementation is effective and safe for the treatment of COVID-19 in comparison to an active comparator, placebo, or standard of care alone, and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 11 March 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies investigating preventive effects, or studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following prioritised outcome categories: individuals with moderate or severe COVID-19: all-cause mortality, clinical status, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events, and for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease: all-cause mortality, development of severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three RCTs with 356 participants, of whom 183 received vitamin D. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical progression scale, two studies investigated participants with moderate or severe disease, and one study individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease. The control groups consisted of placebo treatment or standard of care alone. Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We included two studies with 313 participants. Due to substantial clinical and methodological diversity of both studies, we were not able to pool data. Vitamin D status was unknown in one study, whereas the other study reported data for vitamin D deficient participants. One study administered multiple doses of oral calcifediol at days 1, 3 and 7, whereas the other study gave a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol at baseline. We assessed one study with low risk of bias for effectiveness outcomes, and the other with some concerns about randomisation and selective reporting. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge (313 participants) We found two studies reporting data for this outcome. One study reported no deaths when treated with vitamin D out of 50 participants, compared to two deaths out of 26 participants in the control group (Risk ratio (RR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.13). The other study reported nine deaths out of 119 individuals in the vitamin D group, whereas six participants out of 118 died in the placebo group (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.04]. We are very uncertain whether vitamin D has an effect on all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (very low-certainty evidence). Clinical status assessed by the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (237 participants) We found one study reporting data for this outcome. Nine out of 119 participants needed invasive mechanical ventilation when treated with vitamin D, compared to 17 out of 118 participants in the placebo group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.13). Vitamin D supplementation may decrease need for invasive mechanical ventilation, but the evidence is uncertain (low-certainty evidence). Quality of life We did not find data for quality of life. Safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We did not include data from one study, because assessment of serious adverse events was not described and we are concerned that data might have been inconsistently measured. This study reported vomiting in one out of 119 participants immediately after vitamin D intake (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.30). We are very uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation is associated with higher risk for adverse events (very low-certainty). Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and asymptomatic or mild disease We found one study including 40 individuals, which did not report our prioritised outcomes, but instead data for viral clearance, inflammatory markers, and vitamin D serum levels. The authors reported no events of hypercalcaemia, but recording and assessment of further adverse events remains unclear. Authors administered oral cholecalciferol in daily doses for at least 14 days, and continued with weekly doses if vitamin D blood levels were > 50 ng/mL. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment of COVID-19. The evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of COVID-19 is very uncertain. Moreover, we found only limited safety information, and were concerned about consistency in measurement and recording of these outcomes. There was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity of included studies, mainly because of different supplementation strategies, formulations, vitamin D status of participants, and reported outcomes. There is an urgent need for well-designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate randomisation procedure, comparability of study arms and preferably double-blinding. We identified 21 ongoing and three completed studies without published results, which indicates that these needs will be addressed and that our findings are subject to change in the future. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically.","Stroehlein, Julia Kristin; Wallqvist, Julia; Iannizzi, Claire; Mikolajewska, Agata; Metzendorf, Maria-Inti; Benstoem, Carina; Meybohm, Patrick; Becker, Marie; Skoetz, Nicole; Stegemann, Miriam; Piechotta, Vanessa",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,161

354825,COVID-19 and the pulmonary vascular injury,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, the syndrome caused by the novel SARS-CoV2, is associated with high rates of acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). It is well known that despite the ease of bedside insertion, the use of nontunneled dialysis catheters (NTDCs) is associated with increased complications compared to tunneled dialysis catheters (TDCs). Our objective was to develop a strategy for TDC placement at the bedside to provide effective dialysis access, conserve resources and decrease personnel exposure at our medical center in an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A technique for bedside TDC insertion with ultrasound and plain radiographs in the intensive care unit was developed. Test or clinically COVID-19-positive patients requiring RRT were evaluated for bedside emergent NTDC or nonemergent TDC placement. Patients who underwent NTDC placement were monitored for ongoing RRT needs and were converted to TDC at the bedside after 3-5 days. We prospectively collected patient data focusing on complications and mortality. RESULTS: Of the 36 consultations for dialysis access in COVID-positive patients from March 19 through June 5, 2020, a total of 24 bedside TDCs were placed. Only one patient developed a complication, which was pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade during line placement. In-hospital mortality in the cohort was 63.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Bedside TDC placement has served to conserve resources, prevent complications with transport to and from the operating room, and decrease personnel exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic. This strategy warrants further consideration and could be used in critically ill patients regardless of COVID status.","Williams, Austin D; Qaqish, Michael; Elnagar, Jaafar; Michos, Lia; Nantermet, Sebastian; Meisner, Robert; DiGiovanni, Vincent; Uribe, Alexander",Ann. vasc. surg,,161

355467,Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Inhibitors and COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: To compare 3D postoperative deformity correction using two distinct commonly utilized techniques for the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). METHODS: AIS patients with major thoracic (Lenke 1-2) curves at two sites who underwent deformity correction via posterior spinal instrumented fusion using one of two distinct techniques were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were matched 1:1 between sites for Lenke type (95% Lenke 1) and follow-up time. The ""band site"" performed posteromedial translation using thoracic sublaminar bands and 5.5-mm rods. The ""screw site"" performed spine derotation using differential rod contouring with pedicle screws and 5.5-mm rods. 3D measures of deformity from spinal reconstructions were compared between sites. RESULTS: Preoperatively, the groups had similar thoracic curve magnitudes (band, 55 ± 12° vs. screw, 52 ± 10°; p > 0.05); the ""screw site"" had less T5-T12 kyphosis (2 ± 14° vs. 7 ± 12°, p = 0.05) and greater thoracic apical rotation (- 19 ± 7° vs. - 14 ± 8°, p = 0.007). Postoperatively, the ""screw site"" had greater percent correction (61% vs. 76%, p < 0.001) and kyphosis restoration (p = 0.002). The groups achieved a similar amount of apical derotation (p = 0.9). The ""band site"" used cobalt chromium rods exclusively; the ""screw site"" used cobalt chromium (3%) and stainless steel (97%; p < 0.001). The ""band site"" performed significantly longer fusions. CONCLUSIONS: Significant variations were found between two commonly utilized techniques in AIS surgery, including rod material, correction mechanisms, and fusion levels. Significantly, a greater 3D deformity correction of the coronal and sagittal planes was observed at the ""screw site"" compared to the ""band site"", but with no difference in axial plane correction.","Sikora-Klak, Jakub; Upasani, Vidyadhar V; Ilharreborde, Brice; Cross, Madeline; Bastrom, Tracey P; Mazda, Keyvan; Yaszay, Burt; Newton, Peter O",Childs nerv. syst,,161

359260,Pneumatosis intestinalis in a patient with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has focussed public attention on the management of communicable disease like never before. Surveillance, contact tracing, and case management are recognised as key components of outbreak prevention. Development of guidance for COVID-19 has drawn from existing management of other communicable diseases, including Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD). IMD is a rare but severe outcome of Neisseria meningitidis infection that can be prevented through vaccination. Cases still occur sporadically, requiring ongoing surveillance and consistent management. To this end, national and international public health agencies have developed and published guidance for identification and management of IMD cases. AIM: To assess national and international guidelines for the public health management of IMD, with a focus on the recommendations for identification and management of ""close contacts"" to IMD cases. METHODS: Guidelines from six national and international public health agencies were assessed using a modified version of the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) Instrument in four key domains: stakeholder involvement, developmental rigour, clarity, and applicability. A direct comparison of terminology and recommendations for identification and management of close contacts to IMD cases was also conducted. RESULTS: Guidelines from Europe and the United Kingdom rated most highly using the AGREE II Instrument, both presenting a clear, critical assessment of the strength of the available evidence, and the risks, costs, and benefits behind recommendations for management of close contacts. Direct comparison of guidelines identified inconsistencies in the language defining close contacts to IMD cases. CONCLUSION: Discrepancies between guidelines could be due to limited evidence concerning mechanisms behind disease transmission, along with the lack of a consistent process for development and review of guideline recommendations. COVID-19 management has demonstrated that international collaboration for development of public health guidance is possible, a practice that should be extended to management of other communicable diseases.","Morello, Brianna R; Milazzo, Adriana; Marshall, Helen S; Giles, Lynne C",J Infect Public Health,,161

The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has risen steeply, and a SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.617, is believed to be responsible for many of these cases. The spike protein of B.1.617 harbors two mutations in the receptor binding domain, which interacts with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and constitutes the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, we analyze whether B.1.617 is more adept in entering cells and/or evades antibody responses. B.1.617 enters two of eight cell lines tested with roughly 50% increased efficiency and is equally inhibited by two entry inhibitors. In contrast, B.1.617 is resistant against bamlanivimab, an antibody used for COVID-19 treatment.

361734,COVID-19 in solid organ transplant: A multi-center cohort study,2020,"Increasing evidence points to endothelial cell dysfunction as a key pathophysiological factor in severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), manifested by platelet aggregation, microthrombi and altered vasomotor tone. This may be driven by direct endothelial cell entry by the virus, or indirectly by activated inflammatory cascade. Major risk groups identified for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 are diabetes, and those from the Black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) populations. Hyperglycaemia (expressed as glycated haemoglobin or mean hospital glucose) correlates with worse outcomes in COVID-19. It is not known whether hyperglycaemia is causative or is a surrogate marker - persistent hyperglycaemia is well known as an aetiological agent in microangiopathy. In this article, we propose that pre-existing endothelial dysfunction of microangiopathy, more commonly evident in diabetes and BAME groups, makes an individual vulnerable to the subsequent 'endothelitis' of COVID-19 infection.","Whyte, Martin B; Vas, Prashanth; Heiss, Christian; Feher, Michael D",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,161

We highlight four areas where the application of OH has the potential to significantly improve the governance of infectious diseases in general, and of COVID-19 in particular. First, more integrated surveillance infrastructure and monitoring of the occurrence of infectious diseases in both humans and animals can facilitate the detection of new infectious agents sharing similar genotypes across species and the monitoring of the spatio-temporal spread of such infections. This knowledge can guide public and animal health officials in their response measures. Second, application of the OH approach can improve coordination and active collaboration among stakeholders representing apparently incompatible domains. Third, the OH approach highlights the need for an effective institutional landscape, facilitating adequate regulation of hotspots for transmission of infectious agents among animals and humans, such as live animal markets. And finally, OH thinking emphasizes the need for equitable solutions to infectious disease challenges, suggesting that policy response mechanisms and interventions need to be reflective of the disproportionate disease burdens borne by vulnerable and marginalized populations, or by persons providing health care and other essential services to those sick.","Ruckert, Arne; Zinszer, Kate; Zarowsky, Christina; Labonté, Ronald; Carabin, Hélène",Can J Public Health,,161

This study used the state-designed Local Government Unit Disaster Preparedness Journal: Checklist of Minimum Actions for Mayors in assessing the readiness to natural hazards of 92 profiled municipalities in central Philippines inhabited by 2.4 million people. Anchored on the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015, it assessed their preparedness in 4 criteria-systems and structures, policies and plans, building competencies, and equipment and supplies. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social sciences, frequency count, percentage, and weighted mean. The local governments were found highly vulnerable to tropical cyclone and flood while vulnerable to earthquake, drought, and landslide. They were partially prepared regardless of profile, but the coastal, middle-earning, most populated, having the least number of villages, and middle-sized had higher levels of preparedness. Those highly vulnerable to earthquake and forest fire were prepared, yet only partially prepared to flood, storm surge, drought, tropical cyclone, tornado, tsunami and landslide. The diverse attitude of stakeholders, insufficient manpower, and poor database management were the major problems encountered in executing countermeasures. Appointing full-time disaster managers, developing a disaster information management system, massive information drive, organizing village-based volunteers, integrating disaster management into formal education, and mandatory trainings for officials, preparing for a possible major volcanic eruption and crafting a comprehensive plan against emerging emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a 360° preparedness.","Dariagan, Johnny D; Atando, Ramil B; Asis, Jay Lord B",Nat Hazards (Dordr),,161

DESIGN: Cross-sectional design. SETTING: The Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the Department of Pediatric Endocrinology outpatient clinic of Cumhuriyet University in Sivas, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty female adolescents aged 12-18 years who were diagnosed as having PCOS and 37 healthy adolescents aged 12-18 years. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All adolescents were evaluated by a child and adolescent psychiatrist using a semi-structured interview (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children) and asked to complete the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and Body Image Scale (BIS). RESULTS: The rate of psychiatric disorders in the PCOS group was significantly higher than in the controls (32% vs. 13.5%, respectively, p=0.046). The most common disorder was major depressive disorder. The RSES and BIS scores of the PCOS group were lower (p=0.03; p<0.001, respectively), and CDI scores were higher (p=0.03) than in the control group. There was no significant relationship between obesity, hirsutism, and insulin resistance with any psychiatric disorders in the PCOS group. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with PCOS had more psychopathology than their peers.

We speculate that animal health will likely be impacted by COVID-19 through the immediate consequences of sudden human confinement and inactivity, and through the long-term consequences of the upcoming economic crisis on farmer livelihoods and veterinary service capacities. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis to impact negatively on the control of diseases that are already present in Europe, as well as on the European capacity to prevent and respond in a timely manner to new and emerging animal diseases. We also expect an increased attention to the animal health implications of coronavirus infections in animals. Mechanisms explaining these outcomes include increased wildlife-livestock contacts due to human confinement; disruption of ongoing testing schemes for endemic diseases; lower disease surveillance efforts; and lower capacity for managing populations of relevant wildlife reservoirs. The main mitigation action consists in adapting animal health management strategies to the available resources.","Gortázar, Christian; de la Fuente, José",Prev Vet Med,,161

Here, we investigated Spike-specific memory B cells and humoral responses in 145 subjects, up to six months after the BNT162b2 vaccine (Comirnaty) administration. Spike-specific antibody titers peaked 7 days after the second dose and significant titers and neutralizing activity were still observed after six months, despite a progressive decline over time. Concomitant to antibody reduction, Spike-specific memory B cells, mostly IgG class-switched, increased in blood of vaccinees and persisted six months after vaccination. Following in vitro restimulation, circulating memory B cells reactivated and produced Spike-specific antibodies. A high frequency of Spike-specific IgG+ plasmablasts, identified by computational analysis 7 days after boost, positively correlated with the generation of IgG+ memory B cells at six months. These data demonstrate that mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine elicits strong B cell immunity with Spike-specific memory B cells that still persist six months after vaccination, playing a crucial role for rapid response to SARS-CoV-2 virus encounter.

373188,Rapid implementation of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing to investigate cases of health-care associated COVID-19: a prospective genomic surveillance study,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 virion responsible for the current world-wide pandemic COVID-19 has a characteristic Spike protein (S) on its surface that embellishes both a prefusion state and fusion state. The prefusion Spike protein (S) is a large trimeric protein where each protomer may be in a so-called Up state or Down state, depending on the configuration of its receptor binding domain (RBD) within its distal, prefusion S1 domain. The Up state is believed to allow binding of the virion to ACE-2 receptors on human epithelial cells, whereas the Down state is believed to be relatively inactive or reduced in its binding behavior. We have performed detailed all-atom, dominant energy landscape mappings for noncovalent interactions (charge, partial charge, and van der Waals) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in its static prefusion state based on two recent and independent experimental structure publications. We included both interchain interactions and intrachain (domain) interactions in our mappings in order to determine any telling differences (different so-called ""glue"" points) between residues in the Up and Down state protomers. The S2 proximal, fusion domain demonstrated no appreciable energetic differences between Up and Down protomers, including interchain as well as each protomer's intrachain, S1-S2 interactions. However, the S1 domain interactions across neighboring protomers, which include the RBD-NTD cross chain interactions, showed significant energetic differences between Up-Down and Down-Down neighboring protomers. This included, for example, a key RBD residue ARG357 in the Up-Down interaction and a three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522, associated with a turn structure in the RBD of the Up state protomer, acting as a stabilizing interaction with the NTD of its neighbor protomer. Additionally, our intra chain dominant energy mappings within each protomer, identified a significant ""glue"" point or possible ""latch"" for the Down state protomer between the S1 subdomain, SD1, and the RBD domain of the same protomer that was completely missing in the Up state protomer analysis. Ironically, this dominant energetic interaction in the Down state protomer involved the backbone atoms of the same three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522 of the RBD with the amino acid R-group of GLN564 in the SD1 domain. Thus, this same three residue sequence acts as a stabilizer of the RBD in the Up conformation through its interactions with its neighboring NTD chain and a kind of latch in the Down state conformation through its interactions with its own SD1 domain. The dominant interaction energy residues identified here are also conserved across reported variations of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the closely related virions SARS-Cov and the bat corona virus RatG13. We conducted preliminary molecular dynamics simulations across 0.1 µ seconds to see if this latch provided structural stability and indeed found that a single point mutation (Q564G) resulted in the latch releasing transforming the protomer from the Down to the Up state conformation. Full trimeric Spike protein studies of the same mutation across all protomers, however, did not exhibit latch release demonstrating the critical importance of interchain interactions across the S1 domain, including RBD-NTD neighboring chain interactions. Therapies aimed at disrupting these noncovalent interactions could be a viable route for the physico-chemical mitigation of this deadly virion.","Peters, Michael H; Bastidas, Oscar; Kokron, Daniel S; Henze, Christopher E",PLoS One,,161

374956,Hopefulness of 'Hope',2020,"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. In Ecuador, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded on 29 February 2020. Despite efforts to control its spread, SARS-CoV-2 overran the Ecuadorian public health system, which became one of the most affected in Latin America on 24 April 2020. The Hospital General del Sur de Quito (HGSQ) had to transition from a general to a specific COVID-19 health center in a short period of time to fulfill the health demand from patients with respiratory afflictions. Here, we summarized the implementations applied in the HGSQ to become a COVID-19 exclusive hospital, including the rearrangement of hospital rooms and a triage strategy based on a severity score calculated through an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted chest computed tomography (CT). Moreover, we present clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data from 75 laboratory tested COVID-19 patients, which represent the first outbreak of Quito city. The majority of patients were male with a median age of 50 years. We found differences in laboratory parameters between intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU cases considering C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphocytes. Sensitivity and specificity of the AI-assisted chest CT were 21.4% and 66.7%, respectively, when considering a score >70%; regardless, this system became a cornerstone of hospital triage due to the lack of RT-PCR testing and timely results. If health workers act as vectors of SARS-CoV-2 at their domiciles, they can seed outbreaks that might put 1,879,047 people at risk of infection within 15 km around the hospital.

Early analyses indicated that baseline quality was not predictive of nursing home cases, but a more nuanced study of the role of nurse staffing is needed to target resources and better respond to future outbreaks. We sought to understand whether baseline nurse staffing is associated with the presence of COVID-19 in nursing homes and whether staffing impacts outbreak severity. DESIGN: We analyzed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) facility-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths merged with nursing home and county characteristics. We used logistic regressions to examine the associations of staffing levels from Nursing Home Compare with the outcomes of any COVID-19 cases and, conditional on at least one case, an outbreak. Among facilities with at least one case, we modeled count of deaths using hurdle negative binomial-2 regressions. SETTING: All nursing homes in the CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset with reports that passed the CMS Quality Assurance Check as of June 25, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of nursing homes that met COVID-19 reporting requirements. MEASUREMENTS: A nursing home is defined as having at least one case is if one or more confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case among residents or staff is reported. Conditional on at least one case, we examine two outcomes: an outbreak, defined as confirmed cases/certified beds >10% or total confirmed and suspected cases/beds >20% or >10 deaths, and the total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 among residents and staff. RESULTS: A total of 71% of the 13,167 nursing homes that reported COVID-19 data as of June 14 had at least one case among residents and/or staff. Of those, 27% experienced an outbreak. Higher registered nurse-hours are associated with a higher probability of experiencing any cases. However, among facilities with at least one case, higher nurse aide (NA) hours and total nursing hours are associated with a lower probability of experiencing an outbreak and with fewer deaths. The strongest predictor of cases and outbreaks in nursing homes is per capita cases in the county. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the community remains the strongest predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes, but higher NA hours and total nursing hours may help contain the number of cases and deaths.","Gorges, Rebecca J; Konetzka, R Tamara",J. am. geriatr. soc,,161

While the main route for the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is person to person from respiratory droplets, survival of the virus in the air and its ability to infect subsequently have raised concerns. COVID-19 outbreaks in meat and other food processing plants raise concern for potential of foodborne spread. We focus on the survivability of the virus in the food subjected to various unit operations during processing, storage and distribution and the risk to consumers. While the risk of contamination of food products is possibly due to survival of the virus in the air in food processing operations if preventive measures are not followed, survival of the virus on fresh foods is dependent on the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the specific foods and antimicrobial interventions used during production. Even if the virus remains infective on contaminated foods, maintenance of infectivity after ingestion of food and subsequent invasion of tissue has not been reported. An alternate route of infection from contaminated foods can be during handling of foods and subsequent spread of the virus to other surfaces such as face, nose, leading to infection.

Recently, some HFP activities have grown (e.g. gardening), while other activities (e.g. hunting) have become less common in the United States. Anecdotally, COVID-19 has sparked an increase in HFP evidenced by increased hunting licenses and shortages in seeds and canning supplies. HFP may have positive benefits for food security and diet quality, though research beyond gardening is especially limited in high-income countries. METHODS: We examine HFP activities since the COVID-19 pandemic began, and their relationship to food security and dietary quality using multivariable logit models and matching analysis with a statewide representative survey (n = 600) of residents of Vermont, United States. RESULTS: We find 29% of respondent households classified as food insecure since COVID-19, and higher prevalence of food insecurity among those experiencing a negative job change since COVID-19, households earning less than $50,000 annually, Hispanic and multi-race respondents. Nearly 35% of respondents engaged in HFP activities since the COVID-19 pandemic began; the majority of those gardened, and more than half pursued HFP activities more intensely than before the pandemic or for the first time. Food insecure households were more likely to pursue HFP more intensely, including more gardening, fishing, foraging, and hunting. Respondents who were food insecure, Black, Indigenous, People of Color, those with a negative job disruption, and larger households all had greater odds of increased intensity of HFP during the COVID-19 pandemic. HFP was significantly associated with eating greater amounts of fruits and vegetables; however, this effect was only significant for food secure households. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results suggest that HFP activities have increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be an important safety net for food insecure households. However, HFP for food insecure households does not translate into the same higher fruit and vegetable intake as found among food secure HFP households, suggesting this population may be trying to maintain intake, or that they may have potential important resource or technical assistance needs. Long-term, HFP activities may have important food security and diet quality impacts, as well as conservation implications, which should be more thoroughly explored. Regardless, the increased interest and intensity of HFP demonstrates opportunities for educational and outreach efforts.","Niles, Meredith T; Wirkkala, Kristen Brassard; Belarmino, Emily H; Bertmann, Farryl",BMC Public Health,,161
382192,Evidence for significant COVID-19 community transmission in Somalia using a clinical case definition,2020,"A large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals remains asymptomatic. Little is known about the extent and quality of their antiviral humoral response. Here, we analyze antibody functions in 52 asymptomatic infected individuals, 119 mild and 21 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We measured anti-Spike IgG, IgA and IgM levels with the S-Flow assay and map IgG-targeted epitopes by Luminex. We also evaluated neutralization, complement deposition and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 or reporter cell systems. We show that COVID-19 sera mediate complement deposition and kill infected cells by ADCC. Sera from asymptomatic individuals neutralize the virus, activate ADCC and trigger complement deposition. Antibody levels and functions are lower in asymptomatic individuals than in symptomatic cases. Antibody functions are correlated, regardless of disease severity. Longitudinal samplings show that antibody functions follow similar kinetics of induction and contraction. Overall, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits polyfunctional antibodies neutralizing the virus and targeting infected cells.","Dufloo, Jérémy; Grzelak, Ludivine; Staropoli, Isabelle; Madec, Yoann; Tondeur, Laura; Anna, François; Pelleau, Stéphane; Wiedemann, Aurélie; Planchais, Cyril; Buchrieser, Julian; Robinot, Rémy; Ungeheuer, Marie-Noelle; Mouquet, Hugo; Charneau, Pierre; White, Michael; Lévy, Yves; Hoen, Bruno; Fontanet, Arnaud; Schwartz, Olivier; Bruel, Timothée",Cell Rep Med,,161

382825,Lower motor neuron facial palsy in a postnatal mother with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a pandemic worldwide. Old age and underlying illnesses are associated with poor prognosis among COVID-19 patients. However, whether frailty, a common geriatric syndrome of reduced reserve to stressors, is associated with poor prognosis among older COVID-19 patients is unknown. The aim of our study is to investigate the association between frailty and severe disease among COVID-19 patients aged &#8805; 60 years. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 114 hospitalized older patients (&#8805; 60 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted between 7 February 2020 and 6 April 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data on admission were extracted from electronic medical records. All patients were assessed for frailty on admission using the FRAIL scale, in which five components are included: fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight. The outcome was the development of the severe disease within 60 days. We used the Cox proportional hazards models to identify the unadjusted and adjusted associations between frailty and severe illness. The significant variables in univariable analysis were included in the adjusted model. RESULTS: Of 114 patients, (median age, 67 years; interquartile range = 64-75 years; 57 [50%] men), 39 (34.2%), 39 (34.2%), and 36 (31.6%) were non-frail, pre-frail, and frail, respectively. During the 60 days of follow-up, 43 severe diseases occurred including eight deaths. Four of 39 (10.3%) non-frail patients, 15 of 39 (38.5%) pre-frail patients, and 24 of 36 (66.7%) frail patients progressed to severe disease. After adjustment of age, sex, body mass index, haemoglobin, white blood count, lymphocyte count, albumin, CD8+ count, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein, frailty (HR = 7.47, 95% CI 1.73-32.34, P = 0.007) and pre-frailty (HR = 5.01, 95% CI 1.16-21.61, P = 0.03) were associated with a higher hazard of severe disease than the non-frail. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, assessed by the FRAIL scale, was associated with a higher risk of developing severe disease among older COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggested that the use of a clinician friendly assessment of frailty could help in early warning of older patients at high-risk with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ma, Yao; Hou, Lisha; Yang, Xiufang; Huang, Zhixin; Yang, Xue; Zhao, Na; He, Min; Shi, Yixin; Kang, Yan; Yue, Jirong; Wu, Chenkai",BMC Med,,161
382877,"Risk Factors for Death Among the First 80 543 COVID-19 Cases in China: Relationships Between Age, Underlying Disease, Case Severity, and Region",2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been causing varying severities of illness. Some are asymptomatic and some develop severe disease leading to mortality across ages. This contrast triggered us explore the causes, with the background that a vaccine for effective immunization or a drug to tackle COVID-19 is not too close to reality. We have discussed strategies to combat COVID-19 through immune enhancement, using simple measures including nutritional supplements. Discussion: A literature search on mortality-related comorbid conditions was performed. For those conditions, we analyzed the pro-inflammatory cytokines, which could cause the draining of the immune reservoir. We also analyzed the immune markers necessary for the defense mechanism/immune surveillance against COVID-19, especially through simple means including immune enhancing nutritional supplement consumption, and we suggest strategies to combat COVID-19. Major comorbid conditions associated with increased mortality include cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, being immunocompromised by cancer, and severe kidney disease with a senile immune system. Consumption of Aureobasidium pullulans strain (AFO-202) beta 1,3-1,6 glucan supported enhanced IL-8, sFAS macrophage activity, and NK cells' cytotoxicity, which are major defense mechanisms against viral infection. Conclusion: People with co-morbid conditions who are more prone to COVID-19-related deaths due to immune dysregulation are likely to benefit from consuming nutritional supplements that enhance the immune system. We recommend clinical studies to validate AFO-202 beta glucan in COVID-19 patients to prove its efficacy in overcoming a hyper-inflammation status, thus reducing the mortality, until a definite vaccine is made available.","Rao, Kosagi-Sharaf; Suryaprakash, Vaddi; Senthilkumar, Rajappa; Preethy, Senthilkumar; Katoh, Shojiro; Ikewaki, Nobunao; Abraham, Samuel J K",Front Immunol,,161

384445,Importance of Pediatric Inclusion in COVID-19 Therapeutic Trials,2020,"PURPOSE: To develop an evidence-based clinical practice guideline to assist in clinical decision making for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: ASCO convened an Expert Panel to conduct a systematic review of published phase III randomized controlled trials (2007-2020) on systemic therapy for advanced HCC and provide recommended care options for this patient population. RESULTS: Nine phase III randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. RECOMMENDATIONS: Atezolizumab + bevacizumab (atezo + bev) may be offered as first-line treatment of most patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh class A liver disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0-1, and following management of esophageal varices, when present, according to institutional guidelines. Where there are contraindications to atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab, tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib or lenvatinib may be offered as first-line treatment of patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh class A liver disease, and ECOG PS 0-1. Following first-line treatment with atezo + bev, and until better data are available, second-line therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be recommended for appropriate candidates. Following first-line therapy with sorafenib or lenvatinib, second-line therapy options for appropriate candidates include cabozantinib, regorafenib for patients who previously tolerated sorafenib, or ramucirumab (for patients with &#945;-fetoprotein &#8805; 400 ng/mL), or atezo + bev where patients did not have access to this option as first-line therapy. Pembrolizumab or nivolumab are also reasonable options for appropriate patients following sorafenib or lenvatinib. Consideration of nivolumab + ipilimumab as an option for second-line therapy and third-line therapy is discussed. Further guidance on choosing between therapy options is included within the guideline.

The pandemic has impacted the life and economy. Especially, there is a shortage in medical including a lack of technology, facility and equipment. One of those, ventilators are the essential equipment that does not provide enough requirements for the hospital. A ventilator is an essential unit in hospitals because it seems to be the first step to protect the life of the patient getting sick. Some low-income countries aim to make a simple ventilator using locally available and low-cost materials for primary care and palliative care. One of the simple principles of ventilators is to adopt an artificial manual breath unit (AMBU) bag with paddles. Unfortunately, the squeezing angle of paddles is not proportional to the exhaust air volume from the AMBU bag. This paper analyzes the character of the squeezing angle of the paddles and the exhaust air volume of the adult AMBU bag through experiments. The result can be used to control the squeezing angle through a DC motor mounted with paddles to obtain the desired air volume.","Truong, Cong Toai; Huynh, Kim Hieu; Duong, Van Tu; Nguyen, Huy Hung; Pham, Le An; Nguyen, Tan Tien",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08019v1.pdf,161

We aimed to describe the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC), including virological characteristics and clinical severity in contemporaneous patients with and without the variant. METHODS: In this cohort study, samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR that were collected from Nov 9, 2020, for patients acutely admitted to one of two hospitals on or before Dec 20, 2020, in London, UK, were sequenced and analysed for the presence of VOC-defining mutations. We fitted Poisson regression models to investigate the association between B.1.1.7 infection and severe disease (defined as point 6 or higher on the WHO ordinal scale within 14 days of symptoms or positive test) and death within 28 days of a positive test and did supplementary genomic analyses in a cohort of chronically shedding patients and in a cohort of remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load was compared by proxy, using PCR cycle threshold values and sequencing read depths. FINDINGS: Of 496 patients with samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR and who met inclusion criteria, 341 had samples that could be sequenced. 198 (58%) of 341 had B.1.1.7 infection and 143 (42%) had non-B.1.1.7 infection. We found no evidence of an association between severe disease and death and lineage (B.1.1.7 vs non-B.1.1.7) in unadjusted analyses (prevalence ratio [PR] 0·97 [95% CI 0·72-1·31]), or in analyses adjusted for hospital, sex, age, comorbidities, and ethnicity (adjusted PR 1·02 [0·76-1·38]). We detected no B.1.1.7 VOC-defining mutations in 123 chronically shedding immunocompromised patients or in 32 remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load by proxy was higher in B.1.1.7 samples than in non-B.1.1.7 samples, as measured by cycle threshold value (mean 28·8 [SD 4·7] vs 32·0 [4·8]; p=0·0085) and genomic read depth (1280 [1004] vs 831 [682]; p=0·0011). INTERPRETATION: Emerging evidence exists of increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7, and we found increased virus load by proxy for B.1.1.7 in our data. We did not identify an association of the variant with severe disease in this hospitalised cohort.

395916,Possible Benefit of Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers in COVID-19 Patients: A Case Series,2021,"The stock market is an organized body where public companies offer their stocks through initial public offerings and traders buy/sell these stocks so as to obtain profits. It is dynamic and volatile in nature which makes the task of stock market trend prediction a complex problem. In recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic has made this task even harder. With the rising number of COVID-19 cases across the globe, the market has never been more volatile. This has resulted in the poor performance of various traditional trend prediction algorithms because these algorithms do not account for the impact of the pandemic on the stock market trends. The proposed work aims to enhance the stock market prediction ability of various common prediction models by taking into account the factors related to COVID-19. The forecasting techniques analysed are Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and Support Vector Regressor (SVR). Currently the most affected countries by COVID-19 are the United States of America, India and Russia. Therefore we have analysed the prediction performance of various approaches discussed in this paper on SP 500 Index, Nifty50 Index and RTS Index using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

396802,Clinical Features and Outcomes of Patients With Human Immunodeficiency Virus With COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can progress to a state of unregulated inflammation called cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). We describe formation and operation of a COVID-19 multidisciplinary consultation service that was allowed to individualize treatment for critically ill patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic. METHODS: Institutional experts from different subspecialties formed a COVID-19 CSS task force at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY. They agreed on a set of four clinical and six laboratory parameters that can help early identify COVID-19 CSS. We describe the formation and implementation of the COVID-19 task force. The case series description of the COVID-19 CSS consultation cohort highlights consultation volume, baseline characteristics, clinical and laboratory parameters, and how biologic treatments were allocated to these patients. RESULTS: Between April 4,2020, and May 7,2020, the COVID-19 CSS task force was formed, consisting of adult and pediatric rheumatologists and allergy and immunology physicians. The task force evaluated a total of 288 patients, of whom 197 (68%) were male, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 62 (51-70) years, 122 (42%) were Hispanic, and 88 (31%) were Black or African American. The common presenting symptoms in all referred patients were dyspnea (85%) and diarrhea (80%). Thirty-one patients who received biologic therapy were younger, with a median (IQR) age of 53 (32-63) years, as opposed to 62.5 (52-70) years in the nonbiologic group (P = 0.008). A higher proportion receiving biologics was in the critical care setting (26 [84%] vs 151 [59%]; P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multidisciplinary collaborative effort to provide individualized patient recommendations for evaluation and treatment of patients with COVID-19 who may have CSS. This working model helped to devise an approach that may have identified patients who were most likely to benefit from biologic therapy in the absence of evidence-based guidelines.","Ayesha, Bibi; Kumthekar, Anand; Jain, Ruchi; Patel, Sneha; Ramesh, Manish; Ferastraoaru, Denisa E; Hudes, Golda; Karagic, Merhunisa; Zafar, Sheema; Bartash, Rachel; Vasquez-Canizares, Natalia; Kitsis, Elizabeth; Tagoe, Clement; Wahezi, Dawn M; Rubinstein, Tamar; Broder, Anna",,,161

Nosocomial transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to frontline health care workers is well known, and health care workers may inadvertently become vectors for onward transmission. Ultrasound (US) service providers are at significant risk because scanning usually requires prolonged close patient contact. The bulky US equipment may also facilitate fomite transmission of disease. With increasing use of point-of-care and portable diagnostic US services, the risk is substantial. CONCLUSION.

400914,The Role of New Technologies for Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Near Future,2020,"BACKGROUND: The dissemination of scientific data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continually builds but, in April 2020, could not keep up with the spread of the disease. Through technology, surgeons in Italy and the UK, representing both peak and pre-peak infective time zones, were able to communicate so that the urgent lessons on the huge expected demands of care learned in Italy could be brought to the UK in advance. This paper specifically discusses the issues related to paediatric surgery, currently under-reported in the literature. METHODS: The aim of this paper is to conjoin experience from the field to provide a framework for a safe assessment and treatment of paediatric patients by adopting a systemic approach aimed at reducing the risk of contamination. We reviewed the processes and good practices that were undertaken in contexts of emergency such as in Italy and the UK and then adapted them within the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework to provide an assessment of how to reorganize the services in order to cope with an unexpected situation. The SEIPS model is the adopted theoretical framework, which allows to analyse the system in its main components with a human factors and ergonomics (HFE) perspective. RESULTS: The results introduce some of the good practices and recommendations developed during the emergency in the surgical scenario with a focus on the paediatric patients. They represent the lessons learned from the combination of the little existing evidence of literature and the experience from surgical teams who responded in an impromptu and unrehearsed way. CONCLUSIONS: Lessons learned from the frontline 'on the fly' during COVID-19 emergency should be consolidated and taken into the future. In order to prepare proactively for the next phases and get ahead of the curve of these hospital accesses, there is a need for a risk assessment of the new clinical pathways with a multidisciplinary approach centred on HFE with the adoption of the SEIPS model and an involvement of all the surgical teams.","Turner, Alexander M; Albolino, Sara; Morabito, Antonino",Int. j. qual. health care,,161
402251,COVID-19 infection in a kidney transplant recipient-special emphasis on pharmacokinetic interactions: A case report,2020,"Purpose; The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated profound adaptations in the delivery of healthcare to manage a rise in critically unwell patients. In an attempt to slow the spread of the virus nationwide lockdown restrictions were introduced. This review aims to scope the literature on the impact of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown on the presentation and management of trauma globally. Methods; A scoping review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A systematic search was carried out on the Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases to identify papers investigating presentation and management of trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. All studies based on patients admitted with orthopaedic trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Exclusion criteria were opinion-based reports, reviews, studies that did not provide quantitative data and papers not in English. Results; Three hundred and thirty seven studies were screened, with 17 meeting the eligibility criteria. Studies reported on the footfall of trauma in the UK, Europe, Asia, USA, Australia and New Zealand. A total of 29,591 patients during the pandemic were considered. Mean age was 43.7 years (range <1-103); 54.8% were male. Reported reductions in trauma footfall ranged from 20.3% to 84.6%, with a higher proportion of trauma occurring secondary to interpersonal violence, deliberate self-harm and falls from a height. A decrease was seen in road traffic collisions, sports injuries and trauma occurring outdoors. There was no significant change in the proportion of patients managed operatively, and the number of trauma patients reported to be COVID-19 positive was low. Conclusion; Whilst the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has caused a reduction in the number of trauma patients; the services managing trauma have continued to function despite infrastructural, personnel and pathway changes in health systems. The substantial effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on elective orthopaedics is well described, however the contents of this review evidence minimal change in the delivery of effective trauma care despite resource constraints during this global COVID-19 pandemic.","Waseem, S; Nayar, S K; Hull, P; Carrothers, A; Rawal, J; Chou, D; Khanduja, V",,,161

An analysis based on the classic four-quadrant ‘conscious–competence’ framework examines the current state of the COVID-19 crisis. It draws on qualitative current media reporting limited to international, fact-checked coverage of the pandemic. The focus of the analysis is on the first quadrimester of 2020, during which the pandemic made its first appearance. The analysis highlights key junctures along the evolving knowledge trajectory. The article posits that while progress is evident on many fronts, we are as yet primarily in the ‘conscious–ignorance’ learning stage in which a knowledge base-line is in the process of being established.","Tovstiga, Nicole; Tovstiga, George",Knowl.

Ethically this has been well analysed in terms of the intrinsic value of the human versus any utilitarian calculus of worth to society's function. We do not attempt to re-analyse this but do note that standard pandemic planning often disadvantages the weak and vulnerable in terms of allocation of resources to those with a greater chance of functional survival. We more argue from a debt that society owes its children in terms of the sacrifices they have made in terms of school, social life, healthcare and overall welfare during the pandemic from which they were at markedly less risk than adults. Society owes a debt to its young, and this on top of pre-existing commitments to the them that most nations fail to realise, calls for prioritisation of children and young people's issues as society rebuilds. The effects of poverty and systemic racism on many children must be tackled; so too the existential threats of climate change and pollution. COVID-19 provides a once in a generation opportunity to create a kinder, fairer society. Early signs are not good: Pub re-opening prioritised over school re-opening; no significant investment in children's services or women's health, a significant determinant of children's welfare. We highlight the way COVID-19 has, and continues, to harm children and argue that the contemporary erosion of the Birkenhead principle is simply amoral.","Brierley, Joe; Larcher, Vic",Postgrad. med. j,,161

This study aims to gain insight into the course of functional and medical recovery of persons who receive geriatric rehabilitation (GR) following SARS-CoV-2 infection across Europe. Special attention will be paid to the recovery of activities of daily living (ADL) and to the GR services offered to these patients. DESIGN: A multi-center observational cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This study will include several European countries (EuGMS member states) each providing at least 52 comparable routine datasets (core dataset) of persons recovering from a SARS-CoV-2 infection and receiving geriatric rehabilitation. The routine data will be anonymously collected in an online CASTOR database. The ethical regulations of each participating country will be followed. PRIMARY OUTCOME: ADL functioning. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: length of stay, discharge destination, hospital readmission and mortality. Other variables that will be collected are quality of life, treatment modalities, complications, cognition, frailty, mood/anxiety, BMI, nutrition and pain. All variables will be reported at admission and compared with follow-up scores (discharge, 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up). CONCLUSION: This study will explore the effect of geriatric rehabilitation on post-COVID-19 patients, especially on ADL recovery, and the variety of geriatric rehabilitation services across Europe. Information from this study may help improve recovery of older persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 and improve geriatric rehabilitation services in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Grund, S; Caljouw, M A A; Haaksma, M L; Gordon, A L; van Balen, R; Bauer, J M; Schols, J M G A; Achterberg, W P",J Nutr Health Aging,,161

Patients (aged 72 ± 6 years, 73% male) had moderate disability (Barthel index score 77 ± 26), hypoxemia and normocapnia at arterial blood gas analysis and mild pulmonary restriction at spirometry. Values of circulating markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein: CRP;erythrocyte sedimentation rate: ESR) and coagulation (D-dimer) were: 27.13 ± 37.52 mg/dL, 64.24 ± 32.37 mm/1 h and 1043 ± 729 ng/mL, respectively. At rest, femoral artery diameter was similar in COVID-19 and CTRL (p = 0.16). On the contrary, COVID-19 infection deeply impacted blood velocity (p = 0.001) and femoral blood flow (p &lt;0.0001). After sPLM, peak femoral blood flow was dramatically reduced in COVID-19 compared to CTRL (p = 0.001), as was blood flow ∆peak (p = 0.05) and the area under the curve (p &lt;0.0001). This altered vascular responsiveness could be one of the unknown components of long COVID-19 syndrome leading to fatigue, changes in muscle metabolism and fibers’ composition, exercise intolerance and increased cardiovascular risk. Impact of specific treatments, such as exercise training, dietary supplements or drugs, should be evaluated.","Paneroni, Mara Pasini Evasio Vitacca Michele Scalvini Simonetta Comini Laura Pedrinolla Anna Venturelli Massimo",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,161

This pandemic provides an emergency development of vaccines and drugs against this virus. As main proteases of CoV-19 have essential roles in the transmission and virulence of the virus. So, this enzyme has been considered as a critical target to inhibit COVID-19. Natural compounds are well known as rich sources of antiviral drugs due to their structural diversity and safety. In this study, we have screened thirteen phenolic acids (Cinnamic acid and Hydroxy benzoic derivatives) to compare the potential inhibitory activity of these molecules against COVID-19 protease. Systematic molecular docking simulation was done using AutoDock 4.2.6 to achieve the binding affinities and interactions between phenolic acids and protease. Cinnamic acids are better protease inhibitors in comparison with benzoic acid derivatives. Among Cinnamic acid derivatives, Rosmarinic acid exhibited the minimum Gibbs binding energy and highest docking scores. Also, Chorgenic &gt;Ellagic &gt;Ferulic acid could more effective respectively. According to obtained results, Rosmarinic acid has formed strong hydrogen bonding interaction with His163A, Ser144A, Cys145A, Gly143A and Thr26A, while the propyl cyclohexadione of Rosmarinic acid formed hydrophobic interaction with residue Gly 143A. It seems that Cinnamic acid derivatives of phenolic acid, particularly Rosmarinic acid could be efficient SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors. In the next step, it is necessary to survey the effect of these natural products in inhibition of SARS-CoV replication through cell culture and in vitro assays. This study will improve preclinical knowledge about potential of natural compounds as SARS-CoV inhibitors.","Sabet, R.; Sisakht, M.; Emami, L.; Sabahi, Z.",Trends in Pharmaceutical Sciences,,161

415422,"Monitoring disease transmissibility of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in Zhejiang, China",2020,"Unprecedented measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China. People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%. The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P<0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019. Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for Chinese residents to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices. Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to populations of a low socioeconomic status.","Zhong, Bao-Liang; Luo, Wei; Li, Hai-Mei; Zhang, Qian-Qian; Liu, Xiao-Ge; Li, Wen-Tian; Li, Yi",Int J Biol Sci,,161

Since then researchers worldwide have been struggling to detect the possible pathogenesis of this disease. COVID-19 showed a wide range of clinical behavior from asymptomatic to severe acute respiratory disease syndrome. However, the etiology of susceptibility to severe lung injury is not yet fully understood. Angiotensin-converting enzyme1 (ACE1) convert angiotensin I into Angiotensin II that was further metabolized by ACE 2 (ACE2). The binding ACE2 receptor to SARS-CoV-2 facilitate its enter into the host cell. The interaction and imbalance between ACE1 and ACE2 play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of ACE1 I/D polymorphism with severity of Covid-19. The study included RT-PCR confirmed 269 cases of Covid-19. All cases were genotyped for ACE1 I/D polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction and followed by statistical analysis (SPSS, version 15.0). We found that ACE1 DD genotype, frequency of D allele, older age (&#8805;46 years), unmarried status, and presence of diabetes and hypertension were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 patient. ACE1 ID genotype was significantly independently associated with high socio-economic COVID-19 patients (OR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.331-4.609). These data suggest that the ACE1 genotype may impact the incidence and clinical outcome of COVID-19 and serve as a predictive marker for COVID-19 risk and severity.","Verma, Sushma; Abbas, Mohammad; Verma, Shrikant; Khan, Faizan Haider; Raza, Syed Tasleem; Siddiqi, Zeba; Ahmad, Israr; Mahdi, Farzana",Infect Genet Evol,,161

This is well realized in the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a natural line of defense in many organisms, especially insects which survive in extreme niches. Here we identified AMPs from red spotted apollo butterflies found at high altitudes in Russia, China, and Korea. The larval development stage occurs on the months of December to April, when there are very low temperatures. The insects natural defense mechanism might contribute to withstand this condition, which is our point of interest, and we utilized the genomic information to identify AMPs from red spotted butterflies. The obtained AMPs were tested against a list of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Finally, we obtained one promising candidate active against Porphyromonas gingivalis, a causative organism for periodontitis. With further validations, this could be a lead antimicrobial agent in future. Classical antibiotics are the foremost treatment strategy against microbial infections. Overuse of this has led to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are natural defense elements present across many species including humans, insects, bacteria, and plants. Insect AMPs are our area of interest, because of their stronger abilities in host defense. We have deciphered AMPs from an endangered species Parnassius bremeri, commonly known as the red spotted apollo butterfly. It belongs to the second largest insect order Lepidoptera, comprised of butterflies and moths, and lives in the high altitudes of Russia, China, and Korea. We aimed at identifying the AMPs from the larvae stages. The rationale of choosing this stage is that the P. bremeri larvae development occurs at extremely low temperature conditions, which might serve as external stimuli for AMP production. RNA was isolated from larvae (L1 to L5) instar stages and subjected to next generation sequencing. The transcriptomes obtained were curated in in-silico pipelines. The peptides obtained were screened for requisite AMP physicochemical properties and in vitro antimicrobial activity. With the sequential screening and validation, we obtained fifteen candidate AMPs. One peptide TPS–032 showed promising antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis, a primary causative organism of periodontitis.

426139,Toxicological assessment of e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI) cartridges and constituents,2021,"In the Covid-19 pandemic, being older means being in a special focus: Probabilities for severe infections and mortality rise with increasing age and protective measures for this population group have been increased. This was accompanied by public discourse that portrayed older adults stereotypically as vulnerable and frail but also highlighted the hardships younger people have to endure to protect them. Given the possibly detrimental effects of ageism on individuals and societies, we were interested in older adults' perception of ageism in the Corona-crisis and its relation to their health and well-being. Furthermore, we were interested in subjective aging variables as moderators in the ageism-health relationship. In June 2020, N = 611 independently living people aged 60 + from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg were recruited via a survey research institute and interviewed online or by phone. They reported on perceived ageism in different contexts, their life satisfaction, subjective health, subjective age and self-perceptions of aging. Depending on context, ageism was perceived by around 20% of participants, and overall negatively related to subjective health and life satisfaction after the onset of the pandemic. Moderated hierarchical regressions showed that a younger subjective age buffered the negative effect of ageism on subjective health, while perceiving aging as social loss increased its effect on life satisfaction. We discuss the importance of addressing and reducing ageism (not only) in times of crisis and the consequences for individuals and societies.","Kornadt, Anna E; Albert, Isabelle; Hoffmann, Martine; Murdock, Elke; Nell, Josepha",Eur J Ageing,,161
428627,"Rare case of endogenous Klebsiella endophthalmitis associated with emphysematous prostatitis in a patient with diabetes, cirrhosis and COVID-19",2021,"A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was recently identified as the causative agent for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak that has generated a global health crisis. We use a combination of genomic analysis and sensitive profile-based sequence and structure analysis to understand the potential pathogenesis determinants of this virus. As a result, we identify several fast-evolving genomic regions that might be at the interface of virus-host interactions, corresponding to the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein, the three tandem Macro fold domains in ORF1a, and the uncharacterized protein ORF8. Further, we show that ORF8 and several other proteins from alpha- and beta-CoVs belong to novel families of immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished by being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert, and having a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover numerous Ig domain proteins from several unrelated metazoan viruses, which are distinct in sequence and structure but share comparable architectures to those of the CoV Ig domain proteins. Hence, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and other previously unidentified CoV Ig domain proteins fall under the umbrella of a widespread strategy of deployment of Ig domain proteins in animal viruses as pathogenicity factors that modulate host immunity. The rapid evolution of the ORF8 Ig domain proteins points to a potential evolutionary arms race between viruses and hosts, likely arising from immune pressure, and suggests a role in transmission between distinct host species.IMPORTANCE The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic strongly emphasizes the need for a more complete understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of its causative agent SARS-CoV-2. Despite intense scrutiny, several proteins encoded by the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like coronaviruses remain enigmatic. Moreover, the high infectivity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 in certain individuals make wet-lab studies currently challenging. In this study, we used a series of computational strategies to identify several fast-evolving regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins which are potentially under host immune pressure. Most notably, the hitherto-uncharacterized protein encoded by ORF8 is one of them. Using sensitive sequence and structural analysis methods, we show that ORF8 and several other proteins from alpha- and beta-coronavirus comprise novel families of immunoglobulin domain proteins, which might function as potential immune modulators to delay or attenuate the host immune response against the viruses.","Tan, Yongjun; Schneider, Theresa; Leong, Matthew; Aravind, L; Zhang, Dapeng",mBio (Online),,161

The aim of this retrospective study was to describe the role of a digital and artificial intelligence platform (DAIP) in facilitating the implementation of changes in a rehabilitation service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: We gathered qualitative and quantitative descriptors of the DAIP, including measures to assess its efficiency in scheduling therapy sessions, and staff satisfaction using two simple numeric rating scales and the System Usability Scale. We describe how the volume of activity and the quality of care of our rehabilitation service have changed when the DAIP was implemented by comparing the pre-COVID-19 and the pandemic periods for patients' [sex, age, co-morbidities, diagnosis, and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) gain] and service's (bed occupancy, patients' length of stay, and staff capacity) characteristics.","Saverino, A.; Baiardi, P.; Galata, G.; Pedemonte, G.; Vassallo, C.; Pistarini, C.",Frontiers in neurology [electronic resource].,,161
432242,Assess Ventilation When Determining Safe Distancing in Schools to Control COVID-19 Transmission,2021,"Longitudinal trajectories of vital signs and biomarkers during admission remain poorly characterized for COVID-19 patients despite their potential to provide critical insights about disease progression. We studied 1884 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection from 3/4/2020-6/25/2020 within one Maryland hospital system and used a retrospective longitudinal framework with linear mixed-effects models to investigate relevant biomarker trajectories leading up to three critical outcomes: mechanical ventilation, discharge, and death. Trajectories of four vital signs (respiratory rate, SpO2/FiO2, pulse, and temperature) and four lab values (C-reactive protein (CRP), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and D-dimer) clearly distinguished the trajectories of COVID-19 patients. Prior to any ventilation, log-CRP, log-ALC, respiratory rate, and SpO2/FiO2 trajectories diverge approximately 8-10 days before discharge or death. Following ventilation, log-CRP, log-ALC, respiratory rate, SpO2/FiO2, and eGFR trajectories again diverge 10-20 days prior to death or discharge. Trajectories improved until discharge and remained unchanged or worsened until death. Our approach characterizes the distribution of biomarker trajectories leading up to competing outcomes of discharge versus death. Moving forward, this model can contribute to quantifying the joint probability of future biomarkers and outcomes provided clinical data up to a given moment.","Bowring, Mary G; Wang, Zitong; Xu, Yizhen; Betz, Joshua; Muschelli, John; Garibaldi, Brian T; Zeger, Scott L",Am. j. epidemiol,,161
432624,Treatment of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever by Favipiravir in a Patient with Novel Coronavirus Co-Infection,2020,"Purpose: Sleep problems are common in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and have a large impact on child health and family functioning. This qualitative study aimed to explore parental perspectives regarding the care for sleep of their young child (age 1-8 years) with CP.Materials and methods: Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eighteen parents of a child with CP (GMFCS levels I-V). Inductive thematic analysis of the data was performed within each of the three preidentified domains: 1) Current situation; 2) Concerns; 3) Needs.Results: In total, sixteen themes were identified across the three domains. Within the families' Current situation, parents expressed various issues concerning the care for sleep of their child both at night and during daytime, which are hampered by perceived deficiencies in healthcare, such as limited attention for sleep and lack of knowledge among health professionals. Themes within the Concerns and Needs domains encompassed experiences in the home environment relating to child, family and social aspects, while experiences in the healthcare setting included clinical practices and attitudes of healthcare professionals, as well as the broader organisation of care for sleep.Conclusions: Parents face numerous challenges caring for their child's sleep and the burden placed on families by sleep problems is underappreciated. In order to break the vicious circle of sleep problems and their disastrous consequences on the wellbeing of families, we need to wake up to parent-identified issues and shortcomings in healthcare. Care for sleep should be integrated into paediatric rehabilitation through routine inquiries, using a family-centered and multidisciplinary approach.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThe heavy burden placed on families by sleep problems in children with cerebral palsy warrants acknowledgement in paediatric healthcare.Sleep should be routinely addressed by clinicians during health assessments using a family-centered, and multidisciplinary approach.Healthcare professionals ought to adopt a proactive, understanding, and non-judgmental attitude when addressing sleep problems.Future research should focus on developing sleep intervention strategies that take into account the diverse parental concerns and needs unique to each family situation.","Hulst, Raquel Y; Voorman, Jeanine M; Pillen, Sigrid; Ketelaar, Marjolijn; Visser-Meily, Johanna M A; Verschuren, Olaf",Disabil Rehabil,,161

436663,Excess deaths associated with the Iranian COVID-19 epidemic: A province-level analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae strains have recently come into existence worldwide; however, researchers in northeast China are not aware of their clinical features and molecular characteristics. METHODS: Here, the molecular and virulent characteristics of 44 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates collected from January 2015 to December 2017 were studied. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were carried out to define the clonal relatedness among the isolates. PCR and capsular serotyping of the virulence-associated genes, as well as biofilm formation and serum complement-mediated killing assays, were employed to determine the virulent potential. The genomic features and associated mobile genetic elements of JmsCRE57 were detected by whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: The only positive isolate was JmsCRE57, which belonged to the ST375 serotype K2 that expressed uge, mrkD, fimH, kpn, aerobactin and rmpA virulence-associated genes and showed strong biofilm formation and serum sensitivity. Sequencing results showed that the JmsCRE57 genome mainly consisted of a circular chromosome, three antimicrobial resistant plasmids and a virulent plasmid. The antimicrobial resistant plasmid expressing blaKPC-2, blaCTX-M-15, aph(3â³)-Ib, aph(6)-Id, qnrB1, aac(3)-IIa, aac(6')-Ib-cr, blaOXA-1, blaTEM-1B, catB4, sul2, dfrA14 and blaSHV-99. The virulent plasmid belonged to the IncHI1B group, which is mainly composed of mucoid phenotype genes and siderophore-associated genes. The remaining CRKP strains that expressed uge, fimH, mrkD and kpn virulence-associated genes were not successfully typed. CONCLUSION: Our results provide new insights on the epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant K2 hypervirulent K. pneumoniae ST375 and CRKP ST76 strains in northeast China, which may help control their future outbreaks.","Su, Shanshan; Zhang, Jisheng; Zhao, Yongxin; Yu, Lan; Wang, Yong; Wang, Yuchao; Bao, Mingjia; Fu, Yu; Li, Chunjiang; Zhang, Xiaoli",BMC Infect Dis,,161
436772,Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection in an Adolescent Patient After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,2020,"The first mitigation response to the Covid-19 pandemic was to limit person-to-person interaction as much as possible. This was implemented by the temporary closing of many workplaces and people were required to follow social distancing. Networks are a great way to represent interactions among people and the temporary severing of these interactions. Here, we present a network model of human-human interactions that could be mediators of disease spread. The nodes of this network are individuals and different types of edges denote family cliques, workplace interactions, interactions arising from essential needs, and social interactions. Each individual can be in one of four states: susceptible, infected, immune, and dead. The network and the disease parameters are informed by the existing literature on Covid-19. Using this model, we simulate the spread of an infectious disease in the presence of various mitigation scenarios. For example, lockdown is implemented by deleting edges that denote non-essential interactions. We validate the simulation results with the real data by matching the basic and effective reproduction numbers during different phases of the spread. We also simulate different possibilities of the slow lifting of the lockdown by varying the transmission rate as facilities are slowly opened but people follow prevention measures like wearing masks etc. We make predictions on the probability and intensity of a second wave of infection in each of these scenarios.","Maheshwari, Parul; Albert, R'eka",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09189v1.pdf,161

Therefore, this review aimed to examine the prevalence of antenatal and postnatal anxiety and depressive symptoms among pregnant women and postpartum mothers during the COVID-19 period. METHODS: Six electronic databases were systematically searched for articles from November 2019 to December 2020. Twenty-six observational studies and brief reports were included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of anxiety was greater than depression in both antenatal and postnatal periods, and the prevalence of depression was higher in the antenatal period than the postnatal period. The pooled prevalence for antenatal anxiety symptoms, antenatal depressive symptoms and postnatal depressive symptoms were 40% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.27-0.52), 27% (95% CI: 0.20-0.33) and 17% (95% CI: 0.10-0.24), respectively. Europe (56%, 95% CI: 0.28-0.85) had significantly higher prevalence of antenatal anxiety than Asia (16%, 95% CI: 0.09-0.23). CONCLUSIONS: The heightened prevalence of perinatal psychological disorders served as an impetus for healthcare professionals and policy makers to ramp up their support and mitigation strategies for pregnant women and mothers in times of health crisis.","Shorey, Shefal Y; Ng, Esperanza D; Chee, Cornelia Y I",Scand J Public Health,,161

Online educational engagement systems include all the activities of a learner like listening, reading, writing, and so on. While participating in these activities, a participant may show various levels of engagements like fully engaged, partially engaged and completely not engaged. The participation of online learners has to be identified for an effective learning process. The existing literature could be classified depending upon the learners’ participation as automatic, semi-automatic and manual. Further it could be sub categorised based on the data types used to identify the engagement system. In this paper, a review on computer based automatic online educational engagement detection systems is presented. Several educational engagement methods are applied for computer based online engagement detection systems. In these systems examining a participant’s presence and attention with the modalities of facial expression, eye movement and speech are found to be a challenging task. In this work, it is also identified that there are few challenges like preparation and usage of proper datasets, identifying suitable performance metrics for different tasks involved and providing recommendations for future enhancement of online educational engagement detection by combining the modalities of facial expression, eye movement and speech are still unattended. Though there are several research gaps involved, an online educational engagement system will help the learners to engage themselves in a productive way of learning and getting evaluated efficiently and effectively during the lockdown period of pandemic disease COVID-19 without interrupting their learning process and gaining knowledge. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

A fresh city profile of Jakarta is long overdue, given that there have been major events and developments since the turn of the millennium (the Asian Financial crisis and decentralisation in Indonesia, among the most important), as well as the fact that the city is a living entity with its own processes to be examined. The inhabitants of the city have also taken centre stage now in these urban processes, including the recent pandemic COVID-19 response. Our paper profiles Jakarta heuristically in two cuts: presenting the city from conventional and academic perspectives of megacities like it, which includes contending with its negative perceptions, and more originally, observing the city from below by paying attention to the viewpoints of citizens and practitioners of the city. In doing so, we draw from history, geography, anthropology, sociology and political science as well as from our experience as researchers who are based in the region and have witnessed the transformation of this megacity from within, with the idea that the portrayal of the city is a project permanently under construction.","Martinez, Rafael; Masron, Irna Nurlina",Cities,,161

We performed source apportionment of organic aerosol (OA) and robust statistical analyses to differentiate lockdown-related impacts from baseline seasonal and interannual variability. The primary pollutants NOx, CO, and BC were most reduced, primarily due to lower transportation emissions. Local and regional emissions such as agricultural burning decreased during the lockdown. PM2.5 declined but remained well above WHO guidelines. Despite the lockdown, NR-PM1 changed only moderately compared to prior years. Differences in the trends of hydrocarbon-like OA and BC suggest that some sources of primary aerosol may have increased. Despite notable reductions in some primary pollutants, the lockdown restrictions led to rather small perturbations in the primary fraction of NR-PM1, with secondary aerosol continuing to dominate. Overall, our results demonstrate the impact of secondary and primary pollution on Delhi's air quality and show that large changes in emissions within Delhi alone are insufficient to bring about needed improvements in air quality. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","Patel, K.; Campmier, M.

A common theme in all these alternate forms of communication is the art of storytelling that allows physicians to make a connection with a patient by understanding their perspectives. Apart from few situations where story telling can be distracting in many situations where the patient’s history is complex and require great listening skills and empathy.. Learning to be a good storyteller can help the physician help patients be a great change agent for them. Communicating with these patients can be done effectively using standard communication tools and using effective storytelling techniques can reinforce the patients trust in the provider and strengthen patient physician relationship. This could have a salutatory result both for the patient by increasing patient satisfaction and compliance with treatment and physician satisfaction by increasing to understand their patient’s true concerns. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

Study Type: Cross-sectional survey. Methods: A 6-13 question survey was sent to the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery membership. Descriptive analyses were performed, along with a Fisher's exact test. Results: We received 100 responses from a diverse group of surgeons across the United States. Overall, 91% of responders utilize telemedicine, of which 76.9% began during the COVID-19 pandemic. 33.3% of responders thought that their platforms were not Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant or were unsure. Of those that utilize telemedicine, the two biggest concerns were difficulties with physical examination (69.2%) and lack of human connection (44%). 75.8% of telemedicine utilizers plan to incorporate telemedicine into their practice moving forward. Of all responders, 71% believed that telemedicine will have a positive effect on the field of FPRS, although on univariate analysis those in practice >20 years were more likely to believe that there will be no effect or a negative effect (p = 0.014). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of telemedicine among FPRS in the United States. The great majority of responders plan to incorporate telemedicine into their practice even after the pandemic subsides and believe that telemedicine will have a net positive effect on the field of FPRS.","Salehi, Parsa P; Torabi, Sina J; Lee, Yan Ho; Azizzadeh, Babak",Facial Plast Surg Aesthet Med,,161
455342,Pneumatocele after recovering from COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine has shown an optimal protection for population. However the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in persons, who have received one or both doses of vaccine. The Hospital Universitario de Canarias began to vaccinate to healthcare workers on Febraury, 2021. We have detected several asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV2 infections in healthcare workers. METHODS: We performed PCR on health staff at our Centre after the two doses of vaccination, which were realized by screening in close contact with positive cases, new addition to the hospital or a requirement before traveling to another region in the country. In positive cases we determined the quantitative IgG (post-vaccine Spike1-RBD and nucleocapside) and IgM (Spike1-RBD). RESULTS: We detected five cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in properly vaccinated healthcare workers after 15 days of the second dose vaccine. All cases had high Cts values and were asymptomatics. The Post-vaccine IgG level was between 778.9-4,420.7 BAU/ml. CONCLUSIONS: This communication reflects how vaccination protected healthcare workers from disease; however, it remains to be analyzed the transmissibility of virus after vaccination. We consider the importance of preserving, at the moment, prevention measures against SARS-CoV-2 virus in the hospital environment, mainly by vaccinated healthcare staff.","Porto, Miriam Hernández; Castro, Beatriz; Diaz, Zaida; Pedroso, Yanet; Ramos, María José; Lecuona, María",Int. j. infect. dis,,161

While there are mRNA agents on the horizon as apotential prevention, adefinitive drug therapy is an unmet medical need. The hyperinflammatory response, known as the 'cytokine storm', is chiefly responsible for complications and deaths. The binding of spike-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 to TLR4 receptors has been documented in several studies and has been found to play arole in hyperinflammation; hence, there is an interest in TLR4 as apotential drug target.Areas covered: This review discusses the neurological and respiratory complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection and progresses to examine the role of the 'cytokine storm' and the involvement of TLR4 receptors in these complications. The possibility of using TLR4 modulators to curb the complications are considered and finally, ashort perspective on future potential drug treatments is offered. Various databases were searched including Pub-Med, Google Scholar, and Medline. The search mainly included research articles, meta-analysis, retrospective studies, reports, and systematic reviews.Expert opinion: TLR4 modulators are being investigated in clinical trials for COVID-19.

All patients were enrolled from the Department of Dermatology between February 12 and May 8, 2020, the duration of 4 weeks before COVID-19 and eight weeks after were analyzed in 3 parts consisting of 4 weeks. Data obtained from the database such as age, gender, diagnoses were anonymized. Repeated applications with the same diagnosis in ten days after the first presentation were ignored. Compared to the pre-outbreak, there was a 3.5-fold decrease in dermatology applications in the first month after COVID-19 and an 8.8-fold in the second month. We found a significant increase in the frequency of diagnoses such as generalized pruritus, pityriasis rosea, alopecia areata, bacterial skin/mucosa diseases, and zona zoster after COVID-19. The frequency declined in diseases such as verruca vulgaris, hyperpigmentation, skin tag, melanocytic nevus, seborrheic keratosis/solar lentigo. It has been found that the frequencies of most diseases, including acne (â25% of patients), did not change. We think that many factors, such as affecting the quality of life, risk perception, increased stress burden may cause a change in the diagnostic distribution of the dermatology applications.

469388,"Prevalence of COVID-19 Infection and Outcomes Among Symptomatic Healthcare Workers in Seattle, Washington",2020,"Nitrogen (N) is a critical component of food security, economy and planetary health. Human production of reactive nitrogen (Nr) via Haber-Bosch process and cultivation-induced biological N2 fixation (BNF) has doubled global N cycling over the last century. The most important beneficial effect of Nr is augmenting global food supplies due to increased crop yields. However, increased circulation of Nr in the environment is responsible for serious human health effects such as methemoglobinemia (""blue baby syndrome"") and eutrophication of coastal and inland waters. Furthermore, ammonia (NH3) emission mainly from farming and animal husbandary impacts not only human health causing chronic lung disease, inflammation of human airways and irritation of eyes, sinuses and skin but is also involved in the formation of secondary particulate matter (PM) that plays a critical role in environment and human health. Nr also affects human health via global warming, depletion of stratospheric ozone layer resulting in greater intensity of ultra violet B rays (UVB) on the Earth's surface, and creation of ground-level ozone (through reaction of NO2 with O2). The consequential indirect human health effects of Nr include the spread of vector-borne pathogens, increased incidence of skin cancer, development of cataracts, and serious respiratory diseases, besides land degradation. Evidently, the strategies to reduce Nr and mitigate adverse environmental and human health impacts include plugging pathways of nitrogen transport and loss through runoff, leaching and emissions of NH3, nitrogen oxides (NO x ), and other N compounds; improving fertilizer N use efficiency; reducing regional disparity in access to N fertilizers; enhancing BNF to decrease dependence on chemical fertilizers; replacing animal-based proteins with plant-based proteins; adopting improved methods of livestock raising and manure management; reducing air pollution and secondary PM formation; and subjecting industrial and vehicular NO x emission to pollution control laws. Strategic implementation of all these presents a major challenge across the fields of agriculture, ecology and public health. Recent observations on the reduction of air pollution in the COVID-19 lockdown period in several world regions provide an insight into the achievability of long-term air quality improvement. In this review, we focus on complex relationships between Nr and human health, highlighting a wide range of beneficial and detrimental effects.","Nieder, Rolf; Benbi, Dinesh K",Rev. environ. health,,161

Proctoscopic extraction from the distal sigmoid colon and proximal rectum can be technically difficult. Using a transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) approach, RFBs can be safely removed, avoiding an abdominal operation with associated morbidity. Patients without clinical findings concerning for acute colonic perforation undergo bedside digital rectal examination and proctoscopic attempt at removal of RFB. If unsuccessful, patients undergo rectal examination under anesthesia with proctoscopy and attempted RFB removal. If the RFB cannot be easily removed, a TAMIS port is inserted into the anal canal and pneumorectum is established. A laparoscopic camera and instruments are then used to facilitate removal of the RFB. To date, TAMIS was successful in all 10 patients with RFB requiring an operation. All patients tolerated the procedure well and were discharged to home from the postoperative recovery room. Unfortunately, none of the patients presented for follow-up visits, but there were no known complications. This technique can be considered prior to laparotomy for patients with RFBs after failed digital examination with proctoscopy.","Zhao, B; Roper, M T; Tomassi, M J; Wenger, S J; Klaristenfeld, D",Tech. coloproctol,,161

The new test measures the variance of the number of probtiles in a tiling over the whole sample. Using different tilings allow to check the dynamic and the distributional aspect of risk methodologies. The new test is very powerful, and new benchmarks need to be introduced to take into account subtle mean reversion effects induced by some risk estimations.

Patients and Methods: A total of 253 discharged COVID-19 patients in Shenzhen city, China were selected. The clinical characteristics of these patients were assessed. A 2-month follow-up and laboratory hematology test were performed to examine the status of patients' liver function. Results: Patients combined with liver diseases, especially fatty liver, are more likely to progress to severe condition (P<0.05). Patients in severe condition and those with liver diseases have higher rates of liver injuries during hospitalization, characterized by a significant increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST, P<0.01). The ALT, AST/ALT, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), and A/G levels showed significant differences in comparison with the control group (P<0.05, and P<0.001); and the outlier ratio of A/G, ALT, GGT and ALP of patients remained abnormal higher within 14 days after discharge (P<0.001). Liver injuries of COVID-19 patients may be related to the epidemiological characteristics, clinical indexes, basic diseases, symptoms, drug treatment during hospitalization and the complications. Indicators of liver function were correlated with cardiac function, renal function, thyroid function, lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, immune index, leukocyte, erythrocyte, hemoglobin and platelet related indexes. The outlier ratio of TP, ALB and GLB remained extremely low throughout the follow-up period; the outlier ratio of ALT, AST and GGT decreased below 10% from a high level at 40 days after discharged. However, the outlier ratio of A/G, AST/ALT and ALP remained high during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Abnormal liver function might indicate worse recovery of COVID-19 patients. Changes in liver function should be emphasized during long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge; the necessity of employing appropriate interventions for liver function repair should be emphasized.","An, Ya-Wen; Song, Shuo; Li, Wei-Xin; Chen, Yong-Xin; Hu, Xiao-Peng; Zhao, Jia; Li, Zhi-Wen; Jiang, Guang-Yu; Wang, Cheng; Wang, Jian-Chun; Yuan, Bo; Liu, Han-Qing",Int J Med Sci,,161

486031,Does vitamin D serum level affect prognosis of COVID-19 patients?,2021,"It has been reported that the transmission of COVID-19 can be influenced by the variation of environmental factors due to the seasonal cycle. However, its underlying mechanism in the current and onward transmission pattern remains unclear owing to the limited data and difficulties in separating the impacts of social distancing. Understanding the role of seasonality in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is imperative in formulating public health interventions. Here, the seasonal signals of the COVID-19 time series are extracted using the EEMD method, and a modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) model incorporated with seasonal factors is introduced to quantify its impact on the current COVID-19 pandemic. Seasonal signals decomposed via the EEMD method indicate that infectivity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 are both higher in colder climates. The quantitative simulation shows that the cold season in the Southern Hemisphere countries caused a 59.71 ± 8.72% increase of the total infections, while the warm season in the Northern Hemisphere countries contributed to a 46.38 ± 29.10% reduction. COVID-19 seasonality is more pronounced at higher latitudes, where larger seasonal amplitudes of environmental indicators are observed. Seasonality alone is not sufficient to curb the virus transmission to an extent that intervention measures are no longer needed, but health care capacity should be scaled up in preparation for new surges in COVID-19 cases in the upcoming cold season. Our study highlights the necessity of considering seasonal factors when formulating intervention strategies.","Liu, Xiaoyue; Huang, Jianping; Li, Changyu; Zhao, Yingjie; Wang, Danfeng; Huang, Zhongwei; Yang, Kehu",Environ Res,,161

METHODS: Correlational design, sample comprising 912 nursing students and graduates during the last 18 months from public and private universities of Mexico. To measure the variables, the study applied the instrument Fear of COVID-19 Scale, knowledge subscale of the scale Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19, and the instrument COVID Stress Scale. RESULTS: Relationship was found of the age variable with fear, danger of contamination, traumatic stress, knowledge and minor socioeconomic consequences (p<0.05). Likewise, relationship was observed of fear with stress regarding COVID-19, danger of contamination, socioeconomic consequences, xenophobia, traumatic stress, and compulsive checking (p<0.05). Stress and knowledge explain the presence of fear regarding COVID-19 in 50.3%, and fear and knowledge explain stress regarding COVID-19 in 50.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing students and recent graduates have high levels of stress and fear, besides low level of knowledge. The presence of high stress and low knowledge predict fear regarding COVID-19. Interventions are required on knowledge, stress, and fear regarding COVID-19 in the population studied.","Medina Fernández, Isai Arturo; Carreño Moreno, Sonia; Chaparro Díaz, Lorena; Gallegos-Torres, Ruth Magdalena; Medina Fernández, Josué Arturo; Hernández Martínez, Eva Kerena",Invest. educ. enferm,,161
489258,High prevalence of occult thrombosis in cases of mild/moderate COVID-19,2021,"This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report discusses the challenges of providing equitable health care for people with dementia in the United States. An estimated 6.2 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145%. This trajectory of deaths from AD was likely exacerbated in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 15.3 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2020. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $256.7 billion in 2020. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes - costs that have been aggravated by COVID-19. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2021 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $355 billion. Despite years of efforts to make health care more equitable in the United States, racial and ethnic disparities remain - both in terms of health disparities, which involve differences in the burden of illness, and health care disparities, which involve differences in the ability to use health care services. Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and Native Americans continue to have a higher burden of illness and lower access to health care compared with Whites. Such disparities, which have become more apparent during COVID-19, extend to dementia care. Surveys commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association recently shed new light on the role of discrimination in dementia care, the varying levels of trust between racial and ethnic groups in medical research, and the differences between groups in their levels of concern about and awareness of Alzheimer's disease. These findings emphasize the need to increase racial and ethnic diversity in both the dementia care workforce and in Alzheimer's clinical trials.","Anonymous,",Alzheimers Dement,,161

Immunomodulatory treatments may reduce morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a 7-day course of methylprednisolone (MP) administered with and without tocilizumab improves outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy, relative to historical controls. STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: In this randomized controlled study, patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 at Rashid Hospital, Dubai, in June 2020 were randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous MP (40 mg twice daily for 7 days) with or without a single dose of intravenous tocilizumab (400 mg). While data from the control arm, consisting of patients administered usual care, were obtained through retrospective review of their electronic medical records. The patients in the three arms were matched by disease severity and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary outcomes were day 45 all-cause mortality after randomization, rate of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), length of ICU stay, days on ventilators, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: In total, 76 patients were recruited, including 23 treated with MP, 26 with MP plus tocilizumab, and 27 historical controls. The rates of admission to the ICU and invasive mechanical ventilation were lowest in patients treated with MP alone, with the rates in this group being significantly lower than the rates in the control group (p = 0.04). Time on a ventilator was lowest in the MP group (1.09 ± 3.68 days) and highest in the control group (7.93 ± 14.86 days). The number of days in the ICU was significantly lower in the MP group than in the control and MP plus tocilizumab groups (p = 0.043). One patient (4.3%) in the MP group and five (18.5%) in the control arm died within 45 days. Survival was highest in patients treated with MP alone, with the addition of tocilizumab not improving survival or any of the other outcomes significantly. INTERPRETATION/CONCLUSION: In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia on oxygen support, administration of MP daily for 7 days had reduced mortality at 45 days and was associated with significantly lower ICU admission and ventilation rates compared with usual. Adding tocilizumab to MP did not improve any of the studied outcomes significantly.","Hamed, Dujana Mostafa; Belhoul, Khawla Mohammad; Al Maazmi, Naama Abdelrahman; Ghayoor, Farah; Moin, Muneeba; Al Suwaidi, Mahra; Narainen, Meeruna; Makki, Maryam; AbdulRahman, Mahera",J Infect Public Health,,161

492619,Surgical management of spontaneous post-partum bladder rupture in an Amazonian emergency hospital,2020,"Anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory therapies have been proposed for the treatment of COVID-19 and its most serious complications. Among others, the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is under investigation given their well-documented anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. However, some critical issues regarding the possibility that MSCs could be infected by the virus have been raised. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are the main host cell factors for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry but so far it is unclear if human MSCs express or do not these two proteins. To elucidate these important aspects, we evaluated if human MSCs from both fetal and adult tissues constitutively express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and, most importantly, if they can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated human MSCs derived from amnios, cord blood, cord tissue, adipose tissue and bone marrow. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed by the SARS-CoV-2-permissive human pulmonary Calu-3 cell line but not by all the MSCs tested. MSCs were then exposed to SARS-CoV-2 wild strain without evidence of cytopathic effect. Moreover, we also excluded that the MSCs could be infected without showing lytic effects since their conditioned medium after SARS-CoV-2 exposure did not contain viral particles. Our data, demonstrating that MSCs derived from different human tissues are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, support the safety of MSCs as potential therapy for COVID-19. © AlphaMed Press 2020 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) are currently under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19. However, the potential safety profile of hMSCs in this context has never been defined since none has described if they express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the main host cell factors for SARS-CoV-2 entry, and if they can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. We provide the first evidence that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not expressed in hMSCs derived from both adult and fetal human tissues and, most importantly, that hMSCs are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results support the safety of MSCs as potential therapy for COVID-19.","Avanzini, Maria A; Mura, Manuela; Percivalle, Elena; Bastaroli, Francesca; Croce, Stefania; Valsecchi, Chiara; Lenta, Elisa; Nykjaer, Giulia; Cassaniti, Irene; Bagnarino, Jessica; Baldanti, Fausto; Zecca, Marco; Comoli, Patrizia; Gnecchi, Massimiliano",Stem cells transl. med.

Lessons learned from an autopsy case,2020,"Neurological and neurosurgical early rehabilitation patients are often so critically ill that they must be weaned from mechanical ventilation in addition to early rehabilitative treatment. The German Society for Neurorehabilitation (DGNR) carried out a survey and asked neurological weaning units to provide information on structural characteristics of the facility, including personnel and technical resources and the number of cases and outcome based on anonymous data. In total 36 weaning units from 11 federal states with a total of 496 beds participated in the survey. From 2516 weaning cases documented in 2019, 2097 (83.3%) could primarily be successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation and only 120 (4.8%) had to be discharged with home ventilation. The mortality in this sample was 11.0% (nâ¯= 276). The results of the survey demonstrate that prolonged weaning during early neurological and neurosurgical rehabilitation is an important and effective component of healthcare provision for critically ill patients in Germany.","Rollnik, Jens D; Brocke, Jan; Gorsler, Anna; Groß, Martin; Hartwich, Michael; Pohl, Marcus; Schmidt-Wilcke, Tobias; Platz, Thomas",Nervenarzt,,161

Using a large-scale questionnaire survey of frontline community workers conducted in six Chinese cities in February 2020, we conduct statistical analysis and find that effectiveness of neighborhood collaboration in the pandemic control is predicted by both neighborhood social capital (i.e. civic engagement and citizen participation) and hierarchical steering by the government through setting policy priorities and providing support.

496497,Possible COVID-19 reinfection in a patient with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia,2021,"BACKGROUND: Rapid increases in cases of COVID-19 were observed in multiple cities in Iran towards the start of the pandemic. However, the true infection rate remains unknown. We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 18 cities of Iran as an indicator of the infection rate. METHODS: In this population-based cross-sectional study, we randomly selected and invited study participants from the general population (from lists of people registered with the Iranian electronic health record system or health-care centres) and a high-risk population of individuals likely to have close social contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals through their occupation (from employee lists provided by relevant agencies or companies, such as supermarket chains) across 18 cities in 17 Iranian provinces. Participants were asked questions on their demographic characteristics, medical history, recent COVID-19-related symptoms, and COVID-19-related exposures. Iran Food and Drug Administration-approved Pishtaz Teb SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in blood samples from participants. Seroprevalence was estimated on the basis of ELISA test results and adjusted for population weighting (by age, sex, and city population size) and test performance (according to our independent validation of sensitivity and specificity). FINDINGS: From 9181 individuals who were initially contacted between April 17 and June 2, 2020, 243 individuals refused to provide blood samples and 36 did not provide demographic information and were excluded from the analysis. Among the 8902 individuals included in the analysis, 5372 had occupations with a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and 3530 were recruited from the general population. The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted prevalence of antibody seropositivity in the general population was 17·1% (95% CI 14·6-19·5), implying that 4â265â542 (95% CI 3â659â043-4â887â078) individuals from the 18 cities included were infected by the end of April, 2020. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies varied greatly by city, with the highest estimates found in Rasht (72·6% [53·9-92·8]) and Qom (58·5% [37·2-83·9]). The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted seroprevalence in the high-risk population was 20·0% (18·5-21·7) and showed little variation between the occupations included. INTERPRETATIONS: Seroprevalence is likely to be much higher than the reported prevalence of COVID-19 based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Iran. Despite high seroprevalence in a few cities, a large proportion of the population is still uninfected. The potential shortcomings of current public health policies should therefore be identified to prevent future epidemic waves in Iran.

At the same time, ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) satellite-derived NO2 concentrations fell drastically across China. The increase in PM 2.5while NO 2decreased in BTH and across China is likely due to enhanced production of secondary particulates. These are formed when reductions in NOx result in increased ozone formation, thus increasing the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. Support for this explanation is provided by ground level air quality data showing increased volume of fine mode aerosols throughout February and March 2020, and increased levels of PM 2.5, relative humidity (RH), and ozone during haze episodes in the COVID-19 lockdown period. Backward trajectories show the origin of air masses affecting industrial centers of North and East China to be local. Other contributors to increased atmospheric particulates may include inflated industrial production in peripheral regions to compensate loss in the main population and industrial centers, and low wind speeds. Satellite monitoring of the extraordinary atmospheric conditions resulting from the COVID-19 shutdown could enhance understanding of smog formation and attempts to control it.","Nichol, Janet E.; Bilal, Muhammad; Ali, Arfan Md.; Qiu, Zhongfeng",Remote Sens.,,161
498793,Fulminant septic shock due to Edwardsiella tarda infection associated with multiple liver abscesses: a case report and review of the literature,2020,"This study investigated vaccine acceptance of putative COVID-19 vaccines among a national sample of vaccine hesitant parents. Vaccine hesitancy and politicization of vaccine development has led to a pronounced distrust of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. A total of 1,381 vaccine-hesitant parents participated in this study. Participants indicated a general unwillingness to vaccinate their children (M = 3.55, SD = 2.13) and themselves (M = 3.58, SD = 2.16) when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available. More educated parents were more likely to plan to vaccinate themselves [F(5, 533) = 9.93, p < .05] and their children [F(5, 533) = 10.278, p < .05]. Understanding vaccine hesitant parents offers crucial insights as a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available for the general public and as we wait for a vaccine to be approved for pediatric use.","Rhodes, Matthew E; Sundstrom, Beth; Ritter, Emily; McKeever, Brooke W; McKeever, Robert",J Health Commun,,161

As decision-makers shifted their priorities to COVID-19-related issues, the challenges in market authorisation, and price and reimbursement of CGTs were amplified. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to see that some CGT developers are adapting their efforts toward the development of promising COVID-19-related therapeutics and vaccines. Manufacturing resilience, digitalisation, telemedicine, value-based pricing, and innovative payment mechanisms will be increasingly harnessed to ensure that market access of CGTs is not severely disrupted.","Qiu, Tingting; Wang, Yitong; Liang, Shuyao; Han, Ru; Toumi, Mondher",Drug discov. today,,161
500295,"Publisher Correction to: COVID-19: interpreting scientific evidence - uncertainty, confusion and delays",2020,"BACKGROUND: This study presents a framework for determining the allocation and distribution of the limited amount of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: After analyzing the pandemic strategies of the major organizations and countries and with a literature review conducted by a core panel, a modified Delphi survey was administered to 13 experts in the fields of vaccination, infectious disease, and public health in the Republic of Korea. The following topics were discussed: 1) identifying the objectives of the vaccination strategy, 2) identifying allocation criteria, and 3) establishing a step-by-step vaccination framework and prioritization strategy based on the allocation criteria. Two rounds of surveys were conducted for each topic, with a structured questionnaire provided via e-mail in the first round. After analyzing the responses, a meeting with the experts was held to obtain consensus on how to prioritize the population groups. RESULTS: The first objective of the vaccination strategy was maintenance of the integrity of the healthcare system and critical infrastructure, followed by reduction of morbidity and mortality and reduction of community transmission. In the initial phase, older adult residents in care homes, high-risk health and social care workers, and personal support workers who work in direct contact with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients would be prioritized. Expansion of vaccine supply would allow immunization of older adults not included in phase 1, followed by healthcare workers not previously included and individuals with comorbidities. Further widespread vaccine supply would ensure availability to the extended adult age groups (50-64 years old), critical workers outside the health sector, residents who cannot socially distance, and, eventually, the remaining populations. CONCLUSION: This survey provides the much needed insight into the decision-making process for vaccine allocation at the national level. However, flexibility in adapting to strategies will be essential, as new information is constantly emerging.","Choi, Min Joo; Choi, Won Suk; Seong, Hye; Choi, Jun Yong; Kim, Jong Hyun; Kim, Yae Jean; Cho, Eun Young; Kim, Dong Hyun; Park, Hyesook; Lee, Heeyoung; Kim, Nam Joong; Song, Joon Young; Cheong, Hee Jin; Kim, Sang Il; Peck, Kyong Ran",J Korean Med Sci,,161
501406,Response to: 'COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases: what is the real mortality risk?' by Marques et al,2020,"People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are at risk for infections that can result in amplification of baseline symptoms and possibly trigger clinical relapses. Vaccination can prevent infection through the activation of humoral and cellular immune responses. This is particularly pertinent in the era of emerging novel vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), which affect the immune system, may impact immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines in people with MS. The objective of this article is to provide information on immune system responses to vaccinations and review previous studies of vaccine responses in people with MS to support the safety and importance of receiving currently available and emerging COVID-19 vaccines. Immunological studies have shown that coordinated interactions between T and B lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system are key to successful generation of immunological memory and production of neutralizing antibodies following recognition of vaccine antigens by innate immune cells. CD4+ T cells are essential to facilitate CD8+ T cell and B cell activation, while B cells drive and sustain T cell memory. Data suggest that some classes of DMT, including type 1 interferons and glatiramer acetate, may not significantly impair the response to vaccination. DMTs-such as sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, which sequester lymphocytes from circulation; alemtuzumab; and anti-CD20 therapies, which rely on depleting populations of immune cells-have been shown to attenuate responses to conventional vaccines. Currently, three COVID-19 vaccines have been granted emergency use authorization in the USA on the basis of promising interim findings of ongoing trials. Because analyses of these vaccines in people with MS are not available, decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccination and DMT choice should be informed by data and expert consensus, and personalized with considerations for disease burden, risk of infection, and other factors.","Coyle, Patricia K; Gocke, Anne; Vignos, Megan; Newsome, Scott D",Adv Ther,,161

503216,COVID-19-related myocarditis post-heart transplantation,2021,"During a pandemic, contact tracing is an essential tool to drive down the infection rate within a population. To accelerate the laborious manual contact tracing process, digital contact tracing (DCT) tools can track contact events transparently and privately by using the sensing and signaling capabilities of the ubiquitous cell phone. However, an effective DCT must not only preserve user privacy but also augment the existing manual contact tracing process. Indeed, not every member of a population may own a cell phone or have a DCT app installed and enabled. We present KHOVID to fulfill the combined goal of manual contact-tracing interoperability and DCT user privacy. At KHOVID's core is a privacy-friendly mechanism to encode user trajectories using geolocation data. Manual contact tracing data can be integrated through the same geolocation format. The accuracy of the geolocation data from DCT is improved using Bluetooth proximity detection, and we propose a novel method to encode Bluetooth ephemeral IDs. This contribution describes the detailed design of KHOVID; presents a prototype implementation including an app and server software; and presents a validation based on simulation and field experiments. We also compare the strengths of KHOVID with other, earlier proposals of DCT.","Cheng, Xiang; Yang, Hanchao; Krishnan, Archanaa S; Schaumont, Patrick; Yang, Yaling",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09375v1.pdf,161
504195,Correspondence on 'What comes after the lockdown? Clustering of ANCA-associated vasculitis: single-centre observation of a spatiotemporal pattern',2021,"BACKGROUND: There is an ongoing controversy about harms and benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in hypertensive patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given the unresolved debate, we investigated the association of ARBs with in-hospital outcomes of these patients. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we studied patients with COVID-19 who referred to Sina Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from February 20 to May 29, 2020. Patients with either positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction test of swab specimens, or high clinical suspicion according to the World Health Organization's interim guidance were included. We followed-up patients for incurring death, severe COVID-19, and in-hospital complications. RESULTS: We evaluated 681 patients with COVID-19 of whom 37 patients were excluded due to incomplete medical records and 8 patients who used ACEIs which left 636 patients in the analysis. In this cohort, 108 (17.0%) patients expired and 407 (64.0%) patients incurred severe COVID-19. Of 254 (39.9%) patients with hypertension, 122 (48.0%) patients were receiving an ARB. After adjustment for possible confounders, we found no independent association between taking ARBs and in-hospital outcomes except for acute kidney injury (AKI), in patients with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19, either hypertensive or not-hypertensive. We found that discontinuation of ARBs during hospitalization was associated with a greater risk of mortality, invasive ventilation, and AKI (All PË0.002). CONCLUSIONS: We found that taking ARBs by patients with hypertension and confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19 is not associated with poorer in-hospital outcomes after adjustment for possible confounders.","Soleimani, Abbas; Kazemian, Sina; Karbalai Saleh, Shahrokh; Aminorroaya, Arya; Shajari, Zahra; Hadadi, Azar; Talebpour, Mohammad; Sadeghian, Hakimeh; Payandemehr, Pooya; Sotoodehnia, Mehran; Bahreini, Maryam; Najmeddin, Farhad; Heidarzadeh, Ali; Zivari, Ensieh; Ashraf, Haleh",Am. j. hypertens,,161

In a country where patient to nurse ratios remain 6:1, even universal health care coverage cannot guarantee adequate patient care. These issues were further highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, where inadequate hospital funding and lack of attention to patients led to challenging situations in hotspot areas. Although this pandemic will shape us for many years to come with far reaching impacts, social distancing norms have accelerated technologies that enable services to be delivered remotely, a capability even more necessary in our health care system. By providing care that can be delivered remotely, we can focus in-person care in our hospitals to only the ones who really need it.

METHODS: We conducted two cohort studies from 1 March to 14 June 2020. Working on behalf of National Health Service England, we used routine clinical data in England linked to death data. In study 1, we identified people with an NSAID prescription in the last 3 years from the general population. In study 2, we identified people with rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis. We defined exposure as current NSAID prescription within the 4 months before 1 March 2020. We used Cox regression to estimate HRs for COVID-19 related death in people currently prescribed NSAIDs, compared with those not currently prescribed NSAIDs, accounting for age, sex, comorbidities, other medications and geographical region. RESULTS: In study 1, we included 536 423 current NSAID users and 1 927 284 non-users in the general population. We observed no evidence of difference in risk of COVID-19 related death associated with current use (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.14) in the multivariable-adjusted model. In study 2, we included 1 708 781 people with rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis, of whom 175 495 (10%) were current NSAID users. In the multivariable-adjusted model, we observed a lower risk of COVID-19 related death (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.94) associated with current use of NSAID versus non-use. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of a harmful effect of routinely prescribed NSAIDs on COVID-19 related deaths.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A single center, retrospective cohort study was conducted with transgender men who underwent surgical correction of their urethral stricture(s) between January 2013 and March 2020. The medical charts of 72 transgender men with 147 urethral strictures were reviewed. The primary outcomes were the success and recurrence rates after surgical treatment for urethral strictures. RESULTS: At last follow-up (median of 61 (IQR 25-202) months), 50/72 (69%) were able to void while standing (after one (60%), two (20%), three (6%), four (8%), five (4%), or seven (2%) procedures), 10/72 (14%) awaited further treatment, 2/72 (3%) sat to void in despite of good urodynamic function, and 10/72 (14%) had a definitive urethrostomy. Of 104 surgical treatments included in separate success rate analysis, 65 (63%) were successful (43/75 (57%) after phalloplasty, 22/29 (76%) after metoidioplasty). Highest success rates in short urethral strictures were seen after Heineke-Mikulicz procedure (6/7, 86%), and in longer or more complicated urethral strictures after two-stage with graft (4/6, 67%), two-stage without graft (10/12, 83%), pedicled flap (11/15, 73%), and single-stage graft (7/7, 100%) urethroplasties.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with COVID-19 older than 65 years who were treated in our hospital from January 28, 2020 to March 5, 2020, and explored the relationship between nutritional risk and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 141 patients with COVID-19 (46 common COVID-19, 73 severe COVID-19, and 22 extremely severe COVID-19) were enrolled in the study. NRS 2002 identified 85.8% of patients as having risk, with being identified 41.1% by MUST, 77.3% by MNA-sf, and 71.6% by NRI. The agreement strength was moderate between NRS 2002 and MNA-sf, NRI, fair between MUST and MNA-sf, NRI, fair between MNA-sf and NRI, poor between NRS 2002 and MUST (P < 0.01).

The study aimed to investigate the role of soluble (s)CD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels in predicting disease severity and characterize peripheral blood monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (COVID-19 subjects). Methods: On admission, in COVID-19 subjects sCD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels, and peripheral blood monocyte and DC subsets were compared to healthy donors (HDs). According to clinical outcome, COVID-19 subjects were divided into ARDS and non-ARDS groups. Results: Compared to HDs, COVID-19 subjects showed higher sCD163 (p<0.0001) and sCD14 (p<0.0001) plasmatic levels. We observed higher sCD163 plasmatic levels in the ARDS group compared to the non-ARDS one (p=0.002). The cut-off for sCD163 plasmatic level greater than 2032 ng/ml was predictive of disease severity (AUC: 0.6786, p=0.0022; sensitivity 56.7% [CI: 44.1-68.4] specificity 73.8% [CI: 58.9-84.7]). Positive correlation between plasmatic levels of sCD163, LDH and IL-6 and between plasmatic levels of sCD14, D-dimer and ferritin were found. Compared to HDs, COVID-19 subjects showed lower percentages of non-classical (p=0.0012) and intermediate monocytes (p=0.0447), slanDCs (p<0.0001), myeloid DCs (mDCs, p<0.0001), and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs, p=0.0014). Compared to the non-ARDS group, the ARDS group showed lower percentages of non-classical monocytes (p=0.0006), mDCs (p=0.0346), and pDCs (p=0.0492). Conclusions: The increase in sCD163 and sCD14 plasmatic levels, observed on hospital admission in COVID-19 subjects, especially in those who developed ARDS, and the correlations of these monocyte/macrophage activation markers with typical inflammatory markers of COVID-19 pneumonia, underline their potential use to assess the risk of progression of the disease. In an early stage of the disease, the assessment of sCD163 plasmatic levels could have clinical utility in predicting the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Zingaropoli, Maria Antonella; Nijhawan, Parni; Carraro, Anna; Pasculli, Patrizia; Zuccalà, Paola; Perri, Valentina; Marocco, Raffaella; Kertusha, Blerta; Siccardi, Guido; Del Borgo, Cosmo; Curtolo, Ambrogio; Ajassa, Camilla; Iannetta, Marco; Ciardi, Maria Rosa; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria; Lichtner, Miriam",Front Immunol,,161
515870,COVID-19 and hypertension,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to demonstrate that, in patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 resulting in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), administration of 120mg/kg of body weight of intravenous Prolastin®(plasma-purified alpha-1 antitrypsin) reduces circulating plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of intravenous Prolastin® on important clinical outcomes including the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). TRIAL DESIGN: Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial. PARTICIPANTS: The study will be conducted in Intensive Care Units in hospitals across Ireland. Patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection, moderate to severe ARDS (meeting Berlin criteria for a diagnosis of ARDS with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <200 mmHg), >18 years of age and requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation. All individuals meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline or during screening will be excluded from study participation: more than 96 hours has elapsed from onset of ARDS; age < 18 years; known to be pregnant or breastfeeding; participation in a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product (other than antibiotics or antivirals) within 30 days; major trauma in the prior 5 days; presence of any active malignancy (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) which required treatment within the last year; WHO Class III or IV pulmonary hypertension; pulmonary embolism prior to hospital admission within past 3 months; currently receiving extracorporeal life support (ECLS); chronic kidney disease receiving dialysis; severe chronic liver disease with Child-Pugh score > 12; DNAR (Do Not Attempt Resuscitation) order in place; treatment withdrawal imminent within 24 hours; Prisoners; non-English speaking patients or those who do not adequately understand verbal or written information unless an interpreter is available; IgA deficiency. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: Either a once weekly intravenous infusion of Prolastin® at 120mg/kg of body weight for 4 weeks or a single dose of Prolastin® at 120mg/kg of body weight intravenously followed by once weekly intravenous infusion of an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride for a further 3 weeks.

517429,Vigilance in selection of low-dose versus high-dose steroids in COVID-19,2021,"COVID-19 management guidelines have largely attributed critically ill patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, to a systemic overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cardiovascular dysfunction may also represent a primary phenomenon, with increasing data suggesting that severe COVID-19 reflects a confluence of vascular dysfunction, thrombosis and dysregulated inflammation. Here, we first consolidate the information on localized microvascular inflammation and disordered cytokine release, triggering vessel permeability and prothrombotic conditions that play a central role in perpetuating the pathogenic COVID-19 cascade. Secondly, we seek to clarify the gateways which SARS-CoV-2, the causative COVID-19 virus, uses to enter host vascular cells. Post-mortem examinations of patients' tissues have confirmed direct viral endothelial infection within several organs. While there have been advances in single-cell RNA sequencing, endothelial cells across various vascular beds express low or undetectable levels of those touted SARS-CoV-2 entry factors. Emerging studies postulate alternative pathways and the apicobasal distribution of host cell surface factors could influence endothelial SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication. Finally, we provide experimental considerations such as endothelial polarity, cellular heterogeneity in organoids and shear stress dynamics in designing cellular models to facilitate research on viral-induced endothelial dysfunctions. Understanding the vascular underpinning of COVID-19 pathogenesis is crucial to managing outcomes and mortality.","Wazny, Vanessa; Siau, Anthony; Wu, Kan Xing; Cheung, Christine",Open Biol,,161

METHODS: From 3rd April to 11th May 2020, 88 HCWs and 215 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Whole-genome sequences were obtained for 30 HCWs and 20 patients. RESULTS: Seven and 11 sequence types were identified in HCWs and patients, respectively. Cluster A was the most common sequence type, detected in 23 (77%) HCWs; of these, 14 (61%) had direct patient contact and nine (39%) had indirect patient contact. In addition, seven patients who were not hospitalized in the COVID-19 cohort isolation ward who became positive during their admission were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) cluster A. Following universal masking of all HCWs and emphasis on physical distancing during meals and breaks, no further evidence was found for patient-to-HCW or HCW-to-HCW transmission or vice versa. CONCLUSION: The finding that patients and HCWs were infected with SARS-CoV-2 cluster A suggests both HCW-to-HCW and HCW-to-patient transmission.","Paltansing, S; Sikkema, R S; de Man, S J; Koopmans, M P G; Oude Munnink, B B; de Man, P",J Hosp Infect,,161
519320,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV care in Guatemala,2021,"Previous data support that mental health is affected during pandemic and lockdown situations. Yet, little is known about the positive factors that protect mental health during a lockdown. This study analyzed mental health status-particularly emotional problems-and the role of several sociodemographic and clinical variables; it also explored whether there is a positive relationship between self-compassion and better mental health status. A cross-sectional study was carried out in Spain with the participation of 917 fluent Spanish-speaking residents in a survey conducted approximately midway through the COVID-19 lockdown. The survey tested for anxiety, depression, and stress using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) to measure self-compassion values, and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Questionnaire (PVDQ) to assess the degree of risk perceived by participants. Around 30% of the individuals surveyed (recruited by snowball sampling) showed clinically significant levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. The variables most frequently associated with anxiety, depression, and stress were low levels of self-compassion, age, gender, previous physical symptoms, a previous mental disorder, being a student, and perceived vulnerability to disease. We discuss the hypothetical protective role against anxiety, depression, and stress of certain skills such as self-compassion and the possibility that increasing self-compassion may be used to promote better mental health in similar situations.","Gutiérrez-Hernández, María Elena; Fanjul, Luisa Fernanda; Díaz-Megolla, Alicia; Reyes-Hurtado, Pablo; Herrera-Rodríguez, Jonay Francisco; Enjuto-Castellanos, María Del Pilar; Peñate, Wenceslao",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,161

The aim of this project is to capture the effect of COVID-19 on the volume of surgery and adaptations to the surgical care of patients at a breast centre in BC. METHODS: All proven or suspected breast cancer cases treated with surgery between March 16, 2019 and April 30, 2019 and March 16, 2020 and April 30, 2020 through the Providence Breast Centre were included in this review. The date ranges in 2020 mark the early COVID-19 pandemic period in BC and the large shift in operating room access during this time. RESULTS: In 2019, 99 patients underwent surgery for proven breast cancer and 30 patients for suspected breast cancer. In 2020, 162 patients underwent surgery for breast cancer and 34 for suspected breast cancer. Wait times from core biopsy to surgery and surgery to oncology consultation were improved in 2020 with a reduction of core biopsy to surgery time from 58 to 28 days for patients seen during the pandemic. There was an increased use of regional anesthesia and same day discharge compared to 2019 with increases in regional anesthesia (41%-89%) and same day discharge (64%-86%) after adaptations to the pandemic were implemented. CONCLUSIONS: Changes such as improved access to telemedicine, timing for cancer surgeries, and safer anesthetic techniques in response to the pandemic will change breast cancer surgical care beyond the pandemic era.

521258,Heart block in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: A case series of 3 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented global healthcare emergency and has devastated the global economy. The SARS-CoV-2 virus replicates in the host cells and is seemingly much more virulent compared to other flu viruses, as well as the SARS-CoV-1. The respiratory complications of the disease include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, systemic inflammation, and pulmonary fibrosis. Nanoceria (NC) is a versatile rare earth nanoparticle with remarkable catalase and superoxide dismutase mimetic redox regenerative properties. Interestingly, NC possesses promising anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-fibrotic properties making it an attractive tool to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 as well as the associated systemic complications. Until now, there is no clinically approved vaccine or drug for COVID-19, and the conquest to find a novel therapy for this global havoc is being undertaken at a warlike pace. Herein, based on preclinical evidence, we hypothesize that NC owing to its unique pharmacological properties might be an attractive preclinical candidate to win the battle over COVID-19. Further, it may be used as a prevention or treatment strategy in combination with other drugs.","Allawadhi, Prince; Khurana, Amit; Allwadhi, Sachin; Joshi, Kamaldeep; Packirisamy, Gopinath; Bharani, Kala Kumar",Nano Today,,161
521692,Compassionate Use of Remdesivir in Pregnant Women with Severe Covid-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Hyperventilation (HV) is one of the main and basic activation methods during ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG), unless medical reasons contraindicate it. During the COVID-19 pandemic, with the high risk of human-to-human infection, local guidelines and recommendations have been developed that suggest not to perform the HV maneuver routinely. Our objective was to characterize patients who present positive HV in an epilepsy center. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively all the ambulatory EEGs performed during one year in our specialized ambulatory child and adolescent epilepsy center, and describe patients with positive maneuver. RESULTS: A total of 305 EEGs were performed. Patients under 3 years and 11 months were excluded as well as all patients that did not fill up the criteria for epilepsy diagnosis. From the 252 EEGs that were included in the study, 194 EEGs (77%) were classified as abnormal and 58 (23%) as normal. From these same 252 EEGs, 150 EEG finished correctly the HV maneuver. Physiological slowing response was found in 54 EEGs (36%), no changes (negative) in 83 (55%), and abnormal response (positive) in 13 EEGs (9%). The 13 HV-positive EEGs showed 4 patients with an increase of epileptiform activity, 3 patients experienced an increase of basal preregistered abnormal slowing, and 6 EEGs showed trigger of bilaterally synchronous and symmetric 2-4 Hz spike-and-slow wave discharges and absences. None of these last 6 patients needed more than 3 minutes to elicit the paroxysmal discharge. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on these findings and according with other studies, the low positivity and high specificity of the HV maneuver support the idea that HV could be excluded during the COVID-19 pandemic situation, and also reevaluate whether it could be changed to a complementary maneuver, restricted only for cases where absence epilepsy is suspected.

590346,A national strategy to diagnose COVID-19 associated invasive fungal disease in the ICU,2020-08-29,"BACKGROUND: Early identification of different COVID-19 clinical presentations may depict distinct pathophysiological mechanisms and guide management strategies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2 using symptom progression in COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Historic cohort study of Mexican patients. Data from January-April 2020 were provided by the Health Ministry. SETTING: Population-based. Patients registered in the Epidemiologic Surveillance System in Mexico. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects who sought medical attention for clinical suspicion of COVID-19. All patients were subjected to RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: We measured the Period between initial symptoms and clinical progression to COVID-19 suspicion (PISYCS) and compared it to the primary outcomes (mortality and pneumonia). RESULTS: 65,500 patients were included. Reported fatalities and pneumonia were 2176 (3.32%), and 11568 (17.66%), respectively. According to the PISYCS, patients were distributed as follows: 14.89% in <24 hours, 43.25% between 1–3 days, 31.87% between 4–7 days and 9.97% >7 days. The distribution for mortality and pneumonia was 5.2% and 22.5% in <24 hours, 2.5% and 14% between 1–3 days, 3.6% and 19.5% between 4–7 days, 4.1% and 20.6% >7 days, respectively (p<0.001). Adjusted-risk of mortality was (OR [95% CI], p-value): <24 hours = 1.75 [1.55–1.98], p<0.001; 1–3 days = 1 (reference value); 4–7 days = 1.53 [1.37–1.70], p<0.001; >7 days = 1.67 [1.44–1.94], p<0.001. For pneumonia: <24 hours = 1.49 [1.39–1.58], p<0.001; 1–3 days = 1; 4–7 days = 1.48 [1.41–1.56], p<0.001; >7 days = 1.57 [1.46–1.69], p<0.001. LIMITATIONS: Using a database fed by large numbers of people carries the risk of data inaccuracy. However, this imprecision is expected to be random and data are consistent with previous studies. CONCLUSION: The PISYCS shows a U-shaped SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness pattern. Further studies are needed to corroborate the time-related pathophysiology behind these findings.","Morgenstern-Kaplan, Dan; Buitano-Tang, Bruno; Martínez-Gil, Mercedes; Zaldívar-Pérez Pavón, Andrea; Talavera, Juan O.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270769/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243268,161
590989,Favorable Outcome of COVID-19 Pneumonia in a Kidney Transplant Recipient Treated with Tocilizumab,2020-09-16,"A novel mannose-binding lectin (designated CML) was isolated from Clematis montana Buch.-Ham stem (Ranunculaceae) using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatographies on DEAE-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-100. The purified C. montana lectin was a homodimer of 11,968.9 Da subunits as determined by gel filtration and MS. The hemagglutinating activity of CML was inhibited by branched oligomannosides. The N-terminal 15-amino acid sequence of CML, DNVKYSGQVKNTGSA, has not been reported for other lectins. Also, the peptide mass fingerprinting assay confirmed that there is no match result of similar plant lectins for CML, indicating CML may be a novel plant lectin. CML showed marked antiviral activity against various viruses in cell culture. Subsequently, CML was also found to exhibit remarkable inhibitory effect on L929, HeLa, MCF7 and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, CML specially induced L929 cell apoptosis in dose-dependent manner as evidenced by MTT, fluorescent microscopy, LDH activity-based cytotoxicity assays and DNA ladder. Moreover, due to both caspase inhibitors and Western blot analyses, caspase was also found to play the important role in the potential apoptotic mechanism of CML. When the carbohydrate-binding site was fully inhibited by sugars, cytotoxicity was abruptly decreased and apoptotic phenomenon in L929 cells was not observed, suggesting a significant correlation between mannose-binding-specific activity and the antineoplastic mechanism.","Peng, Hao; Lv, Hui; Wang, Ying; Liu, Yan-hong; Li, Chun-yang; Meng, Liang; Chen, Fang; Bao, Jin-ku",Peptides,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2009.06.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019697810900268X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19577602/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019697810900268X,161
591425,Omphalopagus conjoined twins separation during coronavirus disease-19 pandemic era: A case report,2021-06-29,"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID­19 pandemic studies on workplace safety of hospital staff taking care of patients with this disease are a high priority. We decided to analyze the results of opportunistic screening for anti-SARS­CoV-2 antibodies among employees of a designated COVID-19 center. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate whether potential exposition to SARS­CoV-2 antigens is reflected in the results of serological studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Every employee who performed at least a single test between April 21 and July 20, 2020 was included in the study. The tests assessed the levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM+IgA. Employees working in direct contact with COVID­19 patients and those participating in aerosol­generating procedures were identified. RESULTS: The results of 2455 tests taken by 1572 employees were analyzed. A total of 357 participants (22.7%) had at least 1 positive or equivocal result during the study period. Linear mixed models revealed gradual increases in mean levels of both IgG and IgM+IgA antibodies among employees with all negative results. The rate of change was higher among persons who had direct contact with COVID­19 patients and the highest rate of change was observed among individuals participating in aerosol­generating procedures. CONCLUSIONS: We detected developing humoral immune response to a new set of coronavirus antigens among the study group. It is possible that employees of designated COVID­19 centers are regularly exposed to noninfectious doses of SARS­CoV-2 or its antigens.","Rzeplinski, Radoslaw; Szymanski, Piotr; Hamer, Karolina; Zdziebko, Magdalena; Szarowska, Agnieszka; Korcz, Tomasz; Zaczynski, Artur; Król, Zbigniew; Wierzba, Waldemar",Pol Arch Intern Med,https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.16025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34100280/,161
591550,Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19: a new virus and a new case presentation,2020-12-09,"PURPOSE: Obsessive and compulsive tendencies are known to occur in the general population and involve worry around specific concerns (obsessions) and an urge to resolve the concern with thoughts or behaviours (compulsions). Spontaneous, but not deliberate, mind wandering experiences (when attention turns to internal mentation), have been found to predict obsessive– compulsive tendencies [Seli, P., Risko, E.F., Purdon, C. & Smilek, D. (2017). Intrusive thoughts: linking spontaneous mind wandering and OCD symptomatology. Psychological Research, 81, 392–398. 10.1007/s00426-016-0756-3]. Recent cognitive theory suggests a particular role for future-oriented spontaneous thought in obsessive–compulsive (OC) symptoms. Thus, we hypothesised that future-oriented rather than past-oriented spontaneous mind wandering would predict OC symptoms, such that more future-oriented mind wandering would be associated with increases in OC symptoms. METHODS: In an online survey design (nonclinical sample of 104 adults), participants completed three measures: Mind wandering: Spontaneous (MW-S) and Deliberate (MW-D) (Carriere, Seli & Smilek, 2013); Involuntary Autobiographical Memory Inventory (Berntsen, Rubin & Salgado, 2015); and Dimensional Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (DOCS) (Abramowitz et al., 2010). We adopted a linear regression approach to examine our hypotheses. RESULTS: We provided the first replication of the finding that OC symptoms are predicted by the frequency of spontaneous (but not deliberate) mind wandering, with an underlying positive relationship. Additionally, we found that temporality of spontaneous thought had different predictive effects as a function of the dimension of OC symptoms (i.e., responsibility, unacceptable thoughts, need for symmetry/completeness). CONCLUSIONS: We found moderate support for our temporality hypothesis, which highlights how the construct of temporality can add to our understanding of OC symptoms. The present study also adds to recent conceptual debates regarding mind wandering. We suggest new cognitive and methodological approaches to enhance the understanding of obsessive–compulsive disorder, opening new avenues for clinical and experimental research.","Cole, Scott N.; Tubbs, Peter M.

In Canada, over 80% of COVID-19 deaths during the first pandemic wave occurred in LTCFs. We sought to evaluate the effect of mitigation measures in LTCFs including frequent testing of staff, and vaccination of staff and residents. We developed an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with disease-specific estimates, temporal sensitivity of nasopharyngeal and saliva testing, results of vaccine efficacy trials, and data from initial COVID-19 outbreaks in LTCFs in Ontario, Canada. Characteristics of staff and residents, including contact patterns, were integrated into the model with age-dependent risk of hospitalization and death. Estimates of infection and outcomes were obtained and 95% credible intervals were generated using a bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method. Weekly routine testing of staff with 2-day turnaround time reduced infections among residents by at least 25.9% (95% CrI: 23.3%–28.3%), compared to baseline measures of mask-wearing, symptom screening, and staff cohorting alone. A similar reduction of hospitalizations and deaths was achieved in residents. Vaccination averted 2–4 times more infections in both staff and residents as compared to routine testing, and markedly reduced hospitalizations and deaths among residents by 95.9% (95% CrI: 95.4%–96.3%) and 95.8% (95% CrI: 95.5%–96.1%), respectively, over 200 days from the start of vaccination. Vaccination could have a substantial impact on mitigating disease burden among residents, but may not eliminate the need for other measures before population-level control of COVID-19 is achieved.","Vilches, Thomas N.; Nourbakhsh, Shokoofeh; Zhang, Kevin; Juden-Kelly, Lyndon; Cipriano, Lauren E.; Langley, Joanne M.; Sah, Pratha; Galvani, Alison P.; Moghadas, Seyed M.",Prev Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33878351/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743521001481?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091743521001481,161

We retrospectively analyzed seven pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 who gave birth during the 1st July and 30thNovember 2020. The median age of pregnancy was 39 weeks. Three of the childbearing women presented rupture membranes at hospital admission and four gave birth by cesarean section (C-section). The women infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a good evolution, vertical transmission of the virus did not occur, measures to prevent mother-to-child transmission were applied. Apgar score was 9 for all new-born babies and they all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. There were no maternal deaths. One new born baby was preterm but didn’t present low birth weight or low Apgar score. Applying cesarean section as a method of birth did not influence vertical transmission. There is no evidence if it is necessary to anticipate the time of birth. We believe it is recommended to individualize each case according to the experience of the obstetrician and the severity of the maternal infection.","Radu, Mihaela C; Boeru, Calin; Marin, Mihaela; Manolescu, Loredana S",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.12811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500869/,161

594394,Association of prescribed medications with the risk of COVID-19 infection and severity among adults in South Korea,2020-12-19,"BACKGROUND: Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the effect of N95 respirators compared with medical masks to protect against acute respiratory infections. However, these studies are limited by modest sample sizes and inconclusive results. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to review the relevant and available published RCTs with the aid of the increased power of meta-analytic methods in order to assess the effectiveness of medical masks and N95 respirators in reducing the risk of respiratory infections. METHODS: This meta-analysis follows the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for conducting and reporting results. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases from inception through April 1, 2020 to identify potentially relevant studies. Two authors (LS and JS) independently searched the titles and abstracts of the potentially eligible articles. They independently retrieved required data from the eligible trials; the data were initially tabulated for statistical analysis. Two authors (JRL and LS) independently assessed the methodological quality of the included RCTs using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias. RESULTS: Six articles met the inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis showed that N95 respirators did not reduce the risk of infection with respiratory viruses compared with medical/surgical masks (5.7% vs. 7.9%; RR = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.88–1.41; p = 0.36); however, there was no statistically significant difference in laboratory-confirmed influenza between N95 and medical masks (RR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.77–1.07; p = 0.26). Medical masks provided similar protection against other viruses, including coronavirus (RR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.32–1.73; p = 0.49). Respiratory illness, as well as influenza-like illness were less frequently observed with N95 respirators. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that there are insufficient data to definitively determine whether N95 respirators are superior to medical masks in protection against transmissible acute respiratory infections. Further randomized trials are necessary to compare the above methods of respiratory protection in the context of COVID-19 incidence.","Barycka, Katarzyna; Szarpak, Lukasz; Filipiak, Krzysztof Jerzy; Jaguszewski, Milosz; Smereka, Jacek; Ladny, Jerzy Robert; Turan, Oguz",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33320847/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242901,161

Models exist predicting COVID-19 diagnosis, but significant concerns exist regarding methodology and generalisability. AIM: To generate the first COVID-19 diagnosis risk score for use at the time of hospital admission using the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) checklist. DESIGN: A multivariable diagnostic prediction model for COVID-19 using the TRIPOD checklist applied to a large single-centre retrospective observational study of patients with suspected COVID-19. METHODS: 581 individuals were admitted with suspected COVID-19; the majority had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (420/581, 72.2%). Retrospective collection was performed of electronic clinical records and pathology data. RESULTS: The final multivariable model demonstrated AUC 0.8535 (95% confidence interval (0.8121–0.8950). The final model used 6 clinical variables that are routinely available in most low and high resource settings. Using a cut-off of 2, the derived risk score has a sensitivity of 78.1% and specificity of 86.8%. At COVID-19 prevalence of 10% the model has a negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Our risk score is intended for diagnosis of COVID-19 in individuals admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. The score is the first developed for COVID-19 diagnosis using the TRIPOD checklist. It may be effective as a tool to rule out COVID-19 and function at different pandemic phases of variable COVID-19 prevalence. The simple score could be used by any healthcare worker to support hospital infection control prior to laboratory testing results.","Fink, D L; Khan, P Y; Goldman, N; Cai, J; Hone, L; Mooney, C; El-Shakankery, K H; Sismey, G; Whitford, V; Marks, M; Thomas, S",QJM,https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcaa305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165573/,161

OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility and acceptability of POD Adventures for adolescents with a felt need for psychological support, and to explore the intervention’s effects on self-reported mental health symptoms, prioritised problems, stress and well-being. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods pre-post cohort design. Participants were self-referred from grades 9–12 in two coeducational government-aided secondary schools in Goa, India. The intervention was delivered in two formats, ‘mixed’ (comprising individual and small group sessions) and ‘group’ (small group sessions only). FINDINGS: 248 participants enrolled in the study and 230 (92.7%) completed the intervention. Outcomes at 4 weeks showed significant improvements on all measures that were maintained at 12 weeks. Large effects were observed on problem severity scores (4 weeks, d=1.47; 12 weeks, d=1.53) while small to moderate effects were seen on mental health symptoms, stress and well-being. 22 students completed qualitative interviews about their experience of the intervention. Participants found POD Adventures easy to use, engaging and helpful in solving their problems. They were satisfied with the guidance provided by the counsellor irrespective of delivery format. CONCLUSIONS: POD Adventures was feasible to deliver with guidance from lay counsellors in Indian schools, acceptable to participants and associated with large improvements in problem severity and mental health symptom severity. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: POD Adventures has promise as an early intervention for adolescents with a felt need for psychological support in low-resource settings.","Gonsalves, Pattie P; Hodgson, Eleanor Sara; Bhat, Bhargav; Sharma, Rhea; Jambhale, Abhijeet; Michelson, Daniel; Patel, Vikram",Evid Based Ment Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/ebmental-2020-300194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33208507/,161

Here, we reflect on the immediate responses of most world powers amid the pandemic chaos: totalitarian surveillance and nationalist isolation. Drawing on published literature, we consider measures such as wildlife-use bans, lockdowns and travel restrictions, along with their reverberations for people, economies and the planet. Our synthesis highlights significant shortfalls of applying command-and-control tactics in emergencies. For one, heavy-handed bans risk enormous unintended consequences and tend to fail if they lack legitimacy or clash with people’s values. Furthermore, reactive and myopic strategies typically view the pandemic as a stand-alone crisis, rather than unravelling the complex interplay of nature-society interactions through which zoonotic diseases originate.

Apart from its cardinal symptoms, like irregular and anovulatory cycles, hyperandrogenemia and a typical ultrasound feature of the ovary, obesity, and insulin resistance are often associated with the disease. Furthermore, PCOS represents a status of chronic inflammation with permanently elevated levels of inflammatory markers including IL-6 and IL-18, TNF-α, and CRP. Inflammation, as discovered only recently, consists of two processes occurring concomitantly: active initiation, involving “classical” mediators including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and active resolution processes based on the action of so-called specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). These novel lipid mediator molecules derive from the essential ω3-poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) DHA and EPA and are synthesized via specific intermediates. The role and benefits of SPMs in chronic inflammatory diseases like obesity, atherosclerosis, and Diabetes mellitus has become a subject of intense research during the last years and since PCOS features several of these pathologies, this review aims at summarizing potential roles of SPMs in this disease and their putative use as novel therapeutics.","Regidor, Pedro-Antonio; Mueller, Anna; Sailer, Manuela; Gonzalez Santos, Fernando; Rizo, Jose Miguel; Moreno Egea, Fernando",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22010384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33396555/,161

The identification of drugs to treat COVID-19 and other coronavirus diseases is an urgent global need, thus different strategies targeting either virus or host cell are still under investigation. Direct-acting agents, targeting protease and polymerase functionalities, represent a milestone in antiviral therapy. The 3C-like (or Main) protease (3CL(pro)) and the nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) are the best characterized SARS-CoV-2 targets and show the highest degree of conservation across coronaviruses fostering the identification of broad-spectrum inhibitors. Coronaviruses also possess a papain-like protease, another essential enzyme, still poorly characterized and not equally conserved, limiting the identification of broad-spectrum agents. Herein, we provide an exhaustive comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 proteases and RdRp with respect to other coronavirus homologues.

Prevention and promotion activities in mental health must address the needs prioritised by local actors. The aim of this study was to identify stressors with the potential to influence emotional wellbeing and distress within the general population of Sierra Leone, in order to contribute to an inter-sectoral public mental health approach to improving mental health within the country. METHODOLOGY: Respondents were a convenience sample of 153 respondents (60 women, 93 men) from five districts of Sierra Leone. Using freelisting methodology, respondents were asked to respond to the open question ‘What kind of problems do women/men have in your community?’. Data analysis involved consolidation of elicited problems into a single list. These were then organised thematically using an adaptation of the socio-ecological model, facilitating exploration of the interactions between problems at individual, family, community and societal levels RESULTS: Overall, respondents located problems predominantly at community and societal levels. Although few respondents identified individual-level issues, they frequently described how problems at other levels contributed to physical health difficulties and emotional distress. Women identified significantly more problems at the family level than men, particularly related to relationships with an intimate partner. Men identified significantly more problems at the societal level than women, primarily related to lack of infrastructure. Men and women were equally focused on problems related to poverty and lack of income generating opportunities. CONCLUSION: Poverty and inability to earn an income underpinned many of the problems described at individual, family and community level. Actions to address livelihoods, together with improving infrastructure and addressing gender norms which are harmful to both men and women, are likely key to improving the wellbeing of the Sierra Leone population.

Understanding the genetic mechanisms of immune response to viral infection provides insight into disease etiology and informs public health interventions. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive study linking germline genetic variation and gene expression with antibody response to 28 antigens for 16 viruses using serological data from 7924 participants in the UK Biobank cohort. Using test results from 2010 UK Biobank subjects, we also investigated genetic determinants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. RESULTS: Signals in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region dominated the landscape of viral antibody response, with 40 independent loci and 14 independent classical alleles, 7 of which exhibited pleiotropic effects across viral families. Genome-wide association analyses discovered 7 novel genetic loci associated with viral antibody response (P<5.0×10(−8)), including FUT2 (19q13.33) for human polyomavirus BK (BKV), STING1 (5q31.2) for Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), as well as CXCR5 (11q23.3) and TBKBP1 (17q21.32) for human herpesvirus 7. Transcriptome-wide association analyses identified 114 genes associated with response to viral infection, 12 outside of the HLA region, including ECSCR: P=5.0×10(−15) (MCV), NTN5: P=1.1×10(−9) (BKV), and P2RY13: P=1.1×10(−8) (Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen). We also demonstrated pleiotropy between viral response genes and complex diseases, such as C4A expression in varicella zoster virus and schizophrenia. Finally, our analyses of SARS-CoV-2 revealed the first genome-wide significant infection susceptibility signal in EHF, an epithelial-specific transcriptional repressor implicated in airway disease. Targeted analyses of expression quantitative trait loci suggest a possible role for tissue-specific ACE2 expression in modifying SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the importance of the HLA region in host response to viral infection and elucidates novel genetic determinants of host-virus interaction. Our results may have implications for complex disease etiology and COVID-19.","Kachuri, Linda; Francis, Stephen S.; Morrison, Maike; Bossé, Yohan; Cavazos, Taylor B.; Rashkin, Sara R.; Ziv, Elad; Witte, John S.",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.20088054v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511533/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088054,161

600336,First wave of COVID-19 in hospital staff members of a tertiary care hospital in the greater Paris area: surveillance and risk factors study,2021-02-16,"SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread uncontrollably worldwide while it remains unknown how vulnerable populations, such as Down syndrome (DS) individuals are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with DS have more risk of infections with respiratory complications and present signs of auto-inflammation. They also present with multiple comorbidities that are associated with poorer COVID-19 prognosis in the general population. All this might place DS individuals at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or poorer clinical outcomes. In order to get insight into the interplay between DS genes and SARS-cov2 infection and pathogenesis we identified the genes associated with the molecular pathways involved in COVID-19 and the host proteins interacting with viral proteins from SARS-CoV-2. We then analyzed the overlaps of these genes with HSA21 genes, HSA21 interactors and other genes consistently differentially expressed in DS (using public transcriptomic datasets) and created a DS-SARS-CoV-2 network. We detected COVID-19 protective and risk factors among HSA21 genes and interactors and/or DS deregulated genes that might affect the susceptibility of individuals with DS both at the infection stage and in the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Our analysis suggests that at the infection stage DS individuals might be more susceptible to infection due to triplication of TMPRSS2, that primes the viral S protein for entry in the host cells. However, as the anti-viral interferon I signaling is also upregulated in DS, this might increase the initial anti-viral response, inhibiting viral genome release, viral replication and viral assembly. In the second pro-inflammatory immunopathogenic phase of the infection, the prognosis for DS patients might worsen due to upregulation of inflammatory genes that might favor the typical cytokine storm of COVID-19. We also detected strong downregulation of the NLRP3 gene, critical for maintenance of homeostasis against pathogenic infections, possibly leading to bacterial infection complications.","De Toma, Ilario; Dierssen, Mara",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33479353/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81451-w,161

This study identifies factors associated with a positive COVID-19 test among PLWH in Oregon, with the goal of promoting health equity. We probabilistically linked COVID-19 laboratory results with laboratory-confirmed HIV cases. Crude and adjusted risk ratios of having a COVID-19 diagnosis were calculated for each covariate. Almost 6% of the 2390 PLWH tested for COVID-19 had a positive COVID-19 result. PLWH with positive results tended to identify as American Indian/Alaska Native or Hispanic/Latinx. Younger (age < 50) immigrant PLWH were more than twice as likely to have a positive COVID-19 result than did older (age ≥ 50) US-born PLWH. The pandemic has magnified disparities among American Indian/Alaska Native, Latinx, and younger immigrant PLWH.

Severe outbreaks of PEDV variants have re-emerged in Asia and North America since 2010, causing tremendous economic losses to the swine industry. The lack of effective therapeutic treatment promotes the research for new antivirals. Lithium chloride (LiCl) has been reported as a potential antiviral drug for certain viruses. In this study, the antiviral effect of LiCl on PEDV in Vero cells was evaluated. Real-time quantitative PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assay indicated that LiCl effectively inhibited the entry and replication of PEDV in Vero cells. The expression of viral RNA and protein of PEDV in Vero cells was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by LiCl. Moreover, addition of LiCl inhibited both early and late cell apoptosis induced by PEDV. Our data implied that LiCl could be a potential antiviral drug against PEDV infection. Further studies are required to explore the antiviral effect of lithium chloride on PEDV infection in vivo.","Li, Hong-jie; Gao, Dong-sheng; Li, Yong-tao; Wang, Yong-sheng; Liu, Hong-ying; Zhao, Jun",Res Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29547727/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.03.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003452881730961X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003452881730961X,161

Objective To determine the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19; to determine the possible relationship between the severity of pulmonary involvement and d-dimer levels; to analyze the location of pulmonary embolisms in patients with COVID-19 and to compare it with the location in patients without COVID-19. Methods This retrospective study analyzed all CT angiograms of the pulmonary arteries done in patients with suspected pulmonary embolisms between March 15 and April 30, 2020 and compared them with studies done in the same period one year earlier. Results We included 492 pulmonary CT angiograms (342 (69.9%) in patients with COVID-19 and 147 (30.1%) in patients without COVID-19). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms was higher in patients with COVID-19 (26% vs. 16.3% in patients without COVID-19, p = 0.0197; relative risk = 1.6). The prevalence of pulmonary embolisms in the same period in 2019 was 13.2%, similar to that of the group of COVID-19-negative patients in 2020 (p = 0.43). There were no significant differences in d-dimer levels or the location of pulmonary embolisms between the two groups. CT showed moderate or severe pulmonary involvement in 78.7% of the patients with COVID-19. Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 have an increased prevalence of pulmonary embolisms (26%), and most (78.7%) have moderate or severe lung involvement on CT studies. The location of pulmonary embolisms and the degree of elevation of d-dimer levels does not differ between patients with COVID-19 and those without.","Martínez Chamorro, E.; Revilla Ostolaza, T.

Studies have shown that viruses modulate the host cellular machinery and hijack its metabolic and immune signalling pathways by miRNA mediated gene silencing. Given the immensity of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic and the strong association of viral encoded miRNAs with their pathogenesis, it is important to study Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) miRNAs. To address this unexplored area, we identified 8 putative novel miRNAs from SARS-CoV-2 genome and explored their possible human gene targets. A significant proportion of these targets populated key immune and metabolic pathways such as MAPK signalling pathway, maturity-onset diabetes, Insulin signalling pathway, endocytosis, RNA transport, TGF-β signalling pathway, to name a few. The data from this work is backed up by recently reported high-throughput transcriptomics datasets obtains from SARS-CoV-2 infected samples. Analysis of these datasets reveal that a significant proportion of the target human genes were down-regulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. The current study brings to light probable host metabolic and immune pathways susceptible to viral miRNA mediated silencing in a SARS-CoV-2 infection, and discusses its effects on the host pathophysiology.","Verma, Sonia; Dwivedy, Abhisek; Kumar, Neeraj; Biswal, Bichitra K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.02.365049,161

Daily growing magnitude of confirmed cases of COVID-19 put the whole world humanity at high risk and it has made a pressure on health professionals to get rid of it as soon as possible. So, it becomes necessary to predict the number of upcoming cases in future for the preparation of future plan-of-action and medical set-ups. The present manuscript proposed a hybrid fuzzy time series model for the prediction of upcoming COVID-19 infected cases and deaths in India by using modified fuzzy C-means clustering technique. Proposed model has two phases. In phase-I, modified fuzzy C-means clustering technique is used to form basic intervals with the help of clusters centroid while in phase-II, these intervals are upgraded to form sub-intervals. The proposed model is tested against available COVID-19 data for the measurement of its performance based on mean square error, root mean square error and average forecasting error rate. The novelty of the proposed model lies in the prediction of COVID-19 infected cases and deaths for next coming 31 days. Beside of this, estimation for the approximate number of isolation beds and ICU required has been carried out.

We conducted an updated meta-analysis of RCTs with trial sequential analysis to investigate whether convalescent plasma is futile in reducing mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We searched six databases from 1(st) December 2019 to 1(st) August 2021 for RCTs comparing the use of CP with standard of care or transfusion of non-CP standard plasma in patients with COVID-19. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 Tool. Random effects (DerSimonian and Laird) meta-analyses were conducted. The primary outcome was the aggregate risk for in-hospital mortality between both arms. We conducted a trial sequential analysis (TSA) based on the pooled relative risks (RRs) for in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the pooled RR for receipt of mechanical ventilation and mean difference in hospital length of stay. We included 18 RCTs (8702 CP, 7906 control). CP was not associated with a significant mortality benefit (RR: 0.95, 95%-CI: 0.86-1.04, p=0.27, high certainty). Subgroup analysis did not find any significant differences (p(interaction)=0.30) between patients who received CP within 8 days of symptom onset (RR: 0.97, 95%-CI: 0.79-1.19, p=0.80), or after 8 days (RR: 0.79, 95%-CI: 0.57-1.10, p=0.16). TSA based on a RR reduction of 10% from a baseline mortality of 20% found that CP was not effective, with the pooled effect within the boundary for futility. CP did not significantly reduce the requirement for mechanical ventilation (RR: 1.00, 95%-CI: 0.91-1.10, p=0.99, moderate certainty) or hospital length of stay (+1.32, 95%-CI: -1.86 to +4.52, p=0.42, low certainty).

The mean concentrations of PM(10), PM(2.5), PM(1.0) and BC measured on transport were 18.8 ± 19.4, 16.6 ± 16.5, 12.2 ± 10.8 and 4.1 ± 6.9 μg/m(3), respectively. It reduced PM levels on subway to apply the full fresh air mode rather than partial recirculation mode. Airplane had the lowest concentrations and the highest decay rates, implying the most efficient ventilation and filtration. PM were higher on intra-city transport than inter-city, and significantly increased on arrival at stations. BC and BC/PM ratios were higher on road transport than rail transport, indicating the contribution of exhaust emissions. The ventilation mode to exchange air with the outside and the positive association between concentrations and decay rates on high-speed train suggested filtration efficiency should be improved simultaneously with enhancing ventilation. Wearing facemasks on transport further protects passengers against PM exposure, which reduced personal exposure concentrations on four modes of transport lower than 10 μg/m(3), the World Health Organization guideline.","Lin, Nan; Du, Wei; Wang, Jinze; Yun, Xiao; Chen, Long",Environ Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121015061?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.112205; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121015061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34653408/,161

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of abrocitinib 200 mg and 100 mg in an integrated analysis of a phase IIb study, four phase III studies, and one long-term extension study. METHODS: Two cohorts were analyzed: a placebo-controlled cohort from 12- to 16-week studies and an all-abrocitinib cohort including patients who received one or more abrocitinib doses. Adverse events (AEs) of interest and laboratory data are reported. RESULTS: Total exposure in the all-abrocitinib cohort (n = 2856) was 1614 patient-years (PY); exposure was ≥ 24 weeks in 1248 patients and ≥ 48 weeks in 606 (maximum 108 weeks).

Accumulative studies suggest that nurses were more likely to develop negative psychiatric outcomes following a public health disaster than other medical staffs, due to their more frequent and closer contact with patients. We examined the psychological status of nurses working in the tertiary women’s and children’s hospitals in Sichuan, China, in order to explore the possible effect of the COVID-19. The cross-sectional survey was conducted at the peak period of COVID-19 among 1971 nurses. Their anxiety, depression and self-efficacy were assessed by the seven-item anxiety scale (GAD-7), the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES), respectively. 1934 valid questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 98.1%. We found that 29.3% and 22.7% of the nurses were identified with anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. The median score of GSES was 30, which was at the upper middle level among all populations. Nurses having longer working years and cold-like symptoms, those who were at work during breakout period and working in pediatric ward were significantly associated with the presence of anxiety and depression. Findings suggest that the epidemic of COVID-19 does not necessarily affect the psychological health of nurses working in women’s and children’s hospitals in Sichuan. The results of this study could serve as valuable suggestions to direct the promotion of psychological well-being among targeted nurses.","He, Qiuyang; Ren, Jianhua; Wang, Guoyu; Zhang, Jinling; Xiang, Jie; He, Dongning",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102188; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420921001540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33754121/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420921001540?v=s5,161

611961,The first Vietnamese case of COVID-19 acquired from China,2020-02-19,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated emotional eating behaviours and perceived stress during COVID-19 partial quarantine according to BMI levels in healthy adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: An online survey including demographic variables, eating attitude-related questions, Emotional Eater Questionnaire (EEQ) and Perceived Stress Scale-14 (PSS-14) was sent via online data collection platform. Self-reported weight, height and weight changes during the quarantine were also collected. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 506 people aged between 20–65 years who were partially quarantined due to COVID-19 participated in this study. RESULTS: BMI was positively correlated with EEQ (r 0 ·205, P = 0·001). However, BMI was negatively linked with PSS-14 during COVID-19 (r -0·125, P = 0·001), indicating that participants with lower BMI had higher perceived stress during COVID-19. Participants gained weight during the lockdown situation (+1·20 ± 1·70 kg in men; +0·91 ± 1·40 kg in women). EEQ and PSS-14 scores of women found to be significantly higher than men (9·39 ± 5·37 in men v. 11·17 ± 5·85 in women for EEQ; 24·67 ± 8·32 in men v. 27·99 ± 7·34 in women for PSS-14). Obese participants consumed sweetened and carbonated drinks two-fold more in those compared with other participants. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that partial quarantine may be closely related to emotional eating and weight gain, and participants with higher BMI showed more emotional eating behaviours. Therefore, certain precautions should be considered beforehand in order not to cause long-term eating disorder problems.","Barcın-Güzeldere, Hatice Kübra; Devrim-Lanpir, Aslı",Public Health Nutr,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980021002974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34261563/,161

Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, encode an envelope (E) protein, which is a small, hydrophobic membrane protein; the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 shares a high level of homology with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In this study, we provide insights into the function of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein channel and the ion and water permeation mechanisms using a combination of in silico methods. Based on our results, the pentameric E protein promotes the penetration of cation ions through the channel. An analysis of the potential mean force (PMF), pore radius and diffusion coefficient reveals that Leu10 and Phe19 are the hydrophobic gates of the channel. In addition, the pore exhibits a clear wetting/dewetting transition with cation selectivity under transmembrane voltage, indicating that it is a hydrophobic voltage-dependent channel. Overall, these results provide structure-based insights and molecular dynamic information that are needed to understand the regulatory mechanisms of ion permeability in the pentameric SARS-CoV-2 E protein channel.","Cao, Yipeng; Yang, Rui; Wang, Wei; Lee, Imshik; Zhang, Ruiping; Zhang, Wenwen; Sun, Jiana; Xu, Bo; Meng, Xiangfei",Front Mol Biosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2020.565797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173781/,161

It is necessary to develop and offer strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the outbreak and promote adaptive coping. OBJECTIVE: This study protocol aims to describe a self-administered web-based intervention (Mental Health COVID-19) based on the principles of positive psychology supported by elements of cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral activation therapy to reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression and increase positive emotions and sleep quality during and after the COVID-19 outbreak through a telepsychology system. METHODS: A randomized controlled clinical superiority trial with two independent groups will be performed, with intrasubject measures at four evaluation periods: pretest, posttest, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: self-administered intervention with assistance via chat or self-administered intervention without assistance via chat. The total required sample size will be 166 participants (83 per group). RESULTS: The clinical trial is ongoing. This protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Free School of Psychology-University of Behavioral Sciences (Escuela libre de Psicología-Universidad de Ciencias del Comportamiento). The aim is to publish the preliminary results in December 2020. A conservative approach will be adopted, and the size effect will be estimated using the Cohen d index with a significance level (α) of .05 (95% reliability) and a conventional 80% power statistic.

To date we have identified thirteen mutations in Spike that are accumulating. Mutations are considered in a broader phylogenetic context, geographically, and over time, to provide an early warning system to reveal mutations that may confer selective advantages in transmission or resistance to interventions. Each one is evaluated for evidence of positive selection, and the implications of the mutation are explored through structural modeling. The mutation Spike D614G is of urgent concern; it began spreading in Europe in early February, and when introduced to new regions it rapidly becomes the dominant form. Also, we present evidence of recombination between locally circulating strains, indicative of multiple strain infections.

(18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]-FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as a longitudinal noninvasive approach can be beneficial in providing biomarkers for host immune response. [(18)F]-FDG uptake is increased in activated immune cells in response to virus entry and can be localized by PET imaging. We used [(18)F]-FDG-PET/CT to investigate the host response developing in nonhuman primates after MERS-CoV exposure and applied kinetic modeling to monitor the influx rate constant (K(i)) in responsive lymphoid tissue. METHODS: Multiple [(18)F]-FDG-PET and CT images were acquired on a PET/CT clinical scanner modified to operate in a biosafety level 4 environment prior to and up to 29 days after MERS-CoV aerosol exposure. Time activity curves of various lymphoid tissues were reconstructed to follow the [(18)F]-FDG uptake for approximately 60 min (3,600 s). Image-derived input function was used to calculate K(i) for lymphoid tissues by Patlak plot. RESULTS: Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance revealed alterations in K(i) that was associated with the time point (p < 0.001) after virus exposure and the location of lymphoid tissue (p = 0.0004). As revealed by a statistically significant interaction (p < 0.0001) between these two factors, the pattern of K(i) changes over time differed between three locations but not between subjects. A distinguished pattern of statistically significant elevation in K(i) was observed in mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) that correlated to K(i) changes in axillary LNs. Changes in LNs K(i) were concurrent with elevations of monocytes in peripheral blood. CONCLUSIONS: [(18)F]-FDG-PET is able to detect subtle changes in host immune response to contain a subclinical virus infection. Full quantitative analysis is the preferred approach rather than semiquantitative analysis using standardized uptake value for detection of the immune response to the virus.

Here we report highly conserved potential G-quadruplex motifs (PGQs) in three essential genes (espK, espB, and cyp51) among 160 strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. Products of these genes are involved in pathways that are responsible for virulence determination of bacteria inside the host cell and its survival by maintaining membrane fluidity. The espK and espB genes are essential players that prevent the formation of mature phagolysosome and antigen presentation by host macrophages. The cyp51 is another PGQ-possessing gene involved in sterol biosynthesis pathway and membrane formation. In the present study, we revealed the formation of stable intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structures by Mycobacterium PGQs using a combination of techniques (NMR, circular dichroism [CD], and gel electrophoresis). Next, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and CD melting analysis demonstrated that a well-known G-quadruplex ligand, TMPyP4, binds to and stabilizes these PGQ motifs. Finally, polymerase inhibition and qRT-PCR assays highlight the biological relevance of PGQ-possessing genes in this pathogen and demonstrate that G-quadruplexes are potential drug targets for the development of effective anti-tuberculosis therapeutics.","Mishra, Subodh Kumar; Shankar, Uma; Jain, Neha; Sikri, Kriti; Tyagi, Jaya Sivaswami; Sharma, Tarun Kumar; Mergny, Jean-Louis; Kumar, Amit",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2162253119300952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128421/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2162253119300952; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2019.04.022,161

It is unclear how much of this excess is due to differences in exposure associated with structural inequalities. Here, we report from the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) national study of over 100,000 people. After adjusting for test characteristics and re-weighting to the population, overall antibody prevalence is 6.0% (95% CI: 5.8-6.1). An estimated 3.4 million people had developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 by mid-July 2020. Prevalence is two- to three-fold higher among health and care workers compared with non-essential workers, and in people of Black or South Asian than white ethnicity, while age- and sex-specific infection fatality ratios are similar across ethnicities. Our results indicate that higher hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19 in minority ethnic groups may reflect higher rates of infection rather than differential experience of disease or care.","Ward, Helen; Atchison, Christina; Whitaker, Matthew; Ainslie, Kylie E.

This study aims to measure the psychological safety of students who are supposed to self-explain their clinical reasoning to conference participants. This crossover study compared the effects of two clinical reasoning case conference methods on medical students’ psychological safety. The study population comprised 4(th)-5(th) year medical students participating in a two-week general medicine clinical clerkship rotation, from September 2019 to February 2020. They participated in both a learner-centered approach teleconference and a traditional, live-style conference. Teleconferences were conducted in a separate room, with only a group of students and one facilitator. Participants in group 1 received a learner-centered teleconference in the first week and a traditional, live-style conference in the second week. Participants assigned to group 2 received a traditional, live-style conference in the first week and a learner-centered approach teleconference in the second week. After each conference, Edmondson’s Psychological Safety Scale was used to assess the students’ psychological safety. We also counted the number of students who self-explained their clinical reasoning processes during each conference. Of the 38 students, 34 completed the study. Six out of the seven psychological safety items were significantly higher in the learner-centered approach teleconferences (p<0.01). Twenty-nine (85.3%) students performed self-explanation in the teleconference compared to ten (29.4%) in the live conference (p<0.01). A learner-centered approach teleconference could improve psychological safety in novice learners and increase the frequency of their self-explanation, helping educators better assess their understanding. Based on these results, a learner-centered teleconference approach has the potential to be a method for teaching clinical reasoning to medical students.","Hoshina, Yoji; Shikino, Kiyoshi; Yamauchi, Yosuke; Yanagita, Yasutaka; Yokokawa, Daiki; Tsukamoto, Tomoko; Noda, Kazutaka; Uehara, Takanori; Ikusaka, Masatomi",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242270/,161

To assess the potential for FGF2 to play a role in remyelination, we examined the expression pattern of FGF2 and FGF receptors (FGFRs) in an experimental demyelinating disease with extensive remyelination. Adult mice were intracranially injected with murine hepatitis virus strain A‐59 (MHV‐A59) to induce focally demyelinated spinal cord lesions that spontaneously remyelinate, with corresponding recovery of motor function. Using kinetic RT‐PCR analysis of spinal cord RNA, we found significantly increased levels of FGF2 mRNA transcripts, which peaked during the initial stage of remyelination. Analysis of tissue sections demonstrated that increased levels of FGF2 mRNA and protein were localized within demyelinated regions of white matter, including high FGF2 expression associated with astrocytes. The expression of corresponding FGF receptors was significantly increased in lesion areas during the initial stage of remyelination. In normal and lesioned white matter, oligodendrocyte lineage cells, including progenitors and mature cells, were found to express multiple FGFR types (FGFR1, FGFR2, and/or FGFR3). In addition, in lesion areas, astrocytes expressed FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3. These findings indicate that, during remyelination, FGF2 may play a role in directly regulating oligodendrocyte lineage cell responses and may also act through paracrine or autocrine effects on astrocytes, which are known to synthesize other growth factors and immunoregulatory molecules that influence oligodendrocyte lineage cells.

METHODS: Using data for households with Black and white respondents in pooled Canadian Community Health Survey cycles from 2005 to 2014, the 18-question Household Food Security Survey Module was analyzed (N = 491,400). Bivariate and multivariate logistic and multinomial regression models were run using respondent’s race, immigration status, and six well-established predictors of household food insecurity in the general population. Additional multivariable logistic regression models were run, with race interacted with each predictor individually to yield predicted probabilities. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of household food insecurity was 10.0% for white respondents and 28.4% for Black respondents. The odds of Black households being food-insecure as compared with white households fell from 3.56 (95% CI: 3.30–3.85) to 1.88 (95% CI: 1.70–2.08) with adjustment for household socio-demographic characteristics. In contrast with white households, there was relative homogeneity of risk of food insecurity among Black subgroups defined by immigration status, household composition, education, and province of residence. Homeownership was associated with lower probabilities of food insecurity for Black and white households, but the probability among Black owners was similar to that for white renters (14.7% vs. 14.3%). Black households had significantly higher predicted probabilities of food insecurity than their white counterparts across all main sources of household income except child benefits and social assistance. CONCLUSION: Being racialized as Black appears to be an overriding factor shaping vulnerability to food insecurity for the Black population in Canada.

METHODS: In this study, we used a mouse CLP model to simulate the clinical scenario of patients with sepsis, neutrophil infiltration, abnormal distribution and dysfunction was analyzed. LPS was used to stimulate neutrophils in vitro to simulate sepsis; single-cell gene sequencing technology was used to explore the immunological typing. To explore the immunological function of immunosuppressive neutrophils, PD-L1 knockout neutrophils were cocultured with lymphocytes from wild-type mice. RESULTS: We found that neutrophils presented variant dysfunction at the late stage of sepsis, including inhibition of apoptosis, seriously damaged chemotaxis and extensive infiltration into the tissues. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that multiple subclusters of neutrophils were differentiated after LPS stimulation. The two-dimensional spatial distribution analysis showed that Foxp3(+) T cells were much closer to Ly-6G than the CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, indicating that infiltrated neutrophils may play immunomodulatory effect on surrounding T-regs. Further observations showed that LPS mediates PD-L1 over expression through p38α-MSK1/-MK2 pathway in neutrophils. The subsets of highly expressed PD-L1 exert immunosuppressive effect under direct contact mode, including inhibition of T cell activation and induction of T cell apoptosis and trans-differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data identify a previously unknown immunosuppressive subset of neutrophils as inhibitory neutrophil in order to more accurately describe the phenotype and characteristics of these cells in sepsis.","Qi, Xinxin; Yu, Yao; Sun, Ran; Huang, Jiamin; Liu, Lu; Yang, Yunxi; Rui, Tao; Sun, Bingwei",Crit Care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-021-03481-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33549126/,161

627763,Taking the right measures to control COVID-19,2020-03-05,"OBJECTIVE: Community responses are important for the management of early-phase outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Perceived susceptibility and severity are considered key elements that motivate people to adopt nonpharmaceutical interventions. This study aimed to (i) explore perceived susceptibility and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) examine the practice of nonpharmaceutical interventions, and (iii) assess the potential association of perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity with the practice of nonpharmaceutical interventions among people living in Afghanistan. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used, using online surveys disseminated from April to May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to recruit the participants of this study. The previously developed scales were used to assess the participants’ demographic information, perceived risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and perceived severity of COVID-19. Multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the potential association of perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity with the practice of nonpharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: The Internet was the main source for obtaining COVID-19 information among participants in this study. While 45.8% of the participants believed it was “very unlikely” for them to get infected with COVID-19, 76.7% perceived COVID-19 as a severe disease. Similarly, 37.5% believed the chance of being cured if infected with COVID-19 is “unlikely/very unlikely.” The majority of participants (95.6%) perceived their health to be in “good” and “very good” status. Overall, 74.2% mentioned that they stopped visiting public places, 49.7% started using gloves, and 70.4% started wearing a mask. Participants who believed they have a low probability of survival if infected with COVID-19 were more likely to wear masks and practice hand washing. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that communities’ psychological and behavioral responses were affected by the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Afghanistan, especially among young Internet users. The findings gained from a timely behavioral assessment of the community might be useful to develop interventions and risk communication strategies in epidemics within and beyond COVID-19.","Mousavi, Sayed Hamid; Delshad, Mohammad Hossein; Acuti Martellucci, Cecilia; Bhandari, Divya; Ozaki, Akihiko; Pourhaji, Fatemeh; Pourhaji, Fahimeh; Reza Hosseini, Sayed Mohammad; Roien, Rohullah; Ramozi, Abass Ali; Wafaee, Marzia; Qaderi, Shohra; Delsoz, Mohammad; Sigdel, Shailendra; Kotera, Yasuhiro; Sawano, Toyoaki; Dhama, Kuldeep; Rodríguez-Morales, Alfonso J.; Wang, Jiwei; Tanimoto, Tetsuya; Yousefi, Ali Ahmad; Sah, Ranjit",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947492/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.135,161

The implications of compassionate ageism that have and continue to occur during the pandemic are discussed using stereotype embodiment theory. Future actions that focus on shifting attention from the intent of ageist actions and beliefs to the outcomes for those experiencing them is needed.

METHODS: A review of selected key reports, papers and publications related to epidemics and pandemics in Irish history was conducted. RESULTS: Viruses, epidemics and pandemics are recurring features of human history. Early Irish sources record a broad array of plagues, pandemics and epidemics including bubonic plague, typhus, cholera, dysentery and smallpox, as well as an alleged epidemic of insanity in the 19th century (that never truly occurred). Like the Spanish flu pandemic (1918–20), COVID-19 (a new coronavirus) presents both the challenge of the illness itself and the problems caused by the anxiety that the virus triggers. Managing this anxiety has always been a challenge, especially with the Spanish flu. People with mental illness had particularly poor outcomes with the Spanish flu, often related to the large, unhygienic mental hospitals in which so many were housed. CONCLUSIONS: Even today, a full century after the Spanish flu pandemic, people with mental illness remain at increased risk of poor physical health, so it is imperative that multi-disciplinary care continues during the current outbreak of COVID-19, despite the manifest difficulties involved. The histories of previous epidemics and pandemics clearly demonstrate that good communication and solidarity matter, now more than ever, especially for people with mental illness.","Kelly, B.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many states relaxed the 1-month dispensing limit restriction in order to align with social distancing recommendations. Yet, some states have not relaxed this limit and have differed substantially regarding the policies that have been implemented. Among states that relaxed the 1-month supply limit, determining which chronic disease drugs qualified for this extension can be challenging for patients and clinicians. As more commercial and Medicare insurance beneficiaries are offered 90-day drug supplies, the 30-day drug supply limit with Medicaid has become a health equity issue, since many individuals insured by Medicaid have already experienced a disproportionate impact from and remain at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease. Thus, we propose policy solutions to ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries have safe and uninterrupted access to chronic disease medications during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

637670,"Monitoring disease transmissibility of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in Zhejiang, China()",2020-05-15,"Urbanization has threatened rural communities’ livelihoods worldwide, changing their agro-food systems from locally produced traditional items to industrialized foodstuffs. The main objective was to investigate the relationship between livelihood conditions and the agro-food transition process in rural communities of the Center-West, Northeast, and Amazon regions of Brazil. We hypothesized that traditional agroecosystems and local food habits changed with greater access to market economies. The study was conducted with semi-structured questionnaire interviews to verify agro-food patterns, subsistence farming, natural resource use, and socioeconomic conditions. Moreover, we used stable isotope ratios from the inhabitants’ fingernails to determine the food source and trophic chain diversity. Data from questionnaires were analyzed using a Bayesian clustering model to characterize the socioeconomic conditions and agro-food patterns among rural and urban communities. The isotopic data were appraised through a nonparametric model to assess food differences among Brazilian regions and different community types. The Bayesian model allowed us to determine the optimal number of groups according to descriptive socioeconomic and agro-food variables sorted by each specific location. We also verified a food change from C(3) (more natural) to C(4) (more processed) with an increase in δ(13)C and a decrease in δ(15)N in the city and town localities. This indicates a livelihood shift from locally produced foods to processed items toward urban areas. Although remote villages showed more maintenance of their agro-food systems, increased access to market economies and the supermarket diet is changing the livelihood conditions of rural communities, which can compromise their traditional farming and food sovereignty.","Jesus Silva, Rodrigo; Nardoto, Gabriela Bielefeld; Schor, Tatiana; da Silva, Marcia Regina Farias; Martinelli, Luiz Antônio",Environ Dev Sustain,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01480-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994843/,161

This study was designed to develop an experimental model of PWD using mcr-1-carrying shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) or enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), for the future evaluation of control measures. Three groups of eight piglets, kept in high biosecurity units, were orally inoculated with mcr-1-positive STEC or ETEC, and one unchallenged group was used as a control. Clinical signs were recorded. Regularly-collected fecal samples and samples obtained from the digestive tract of animals sacrificed one month after inoculation were cultured in selective media and isolates were characterized. Blood samples were used to genotype the polymorphisms of the pigs’ intestinal receptors for F4 and F18 E. coli adhesins. Diarrhea was more frequent and more fecal samples contained the inoculated strain in the group inoculated with the O149-F4 ETEC strain than with the O141-F18 or O139-F18 STEC strains. However, fewer positive samples were obtained from the two pigs with the F4 resistant genotype. The three inoculated strains could be re-isolated up to the end of the experiment. Excretion peaked on the first week after inoculation with the O149-F4 ETEC strain, and later for the other two. An mcr-1 gene transfer to other commensal isolates was observed only for O139-F18 STEC, while the loss of mcr-1 from the inoculated strain occurred in all groups. The O149-F4 ETEC challenge may be used to evaluate alternative solutions to combat PWD caused by colistin-resistant E. coli in pigs.","Le Devendec, Laetitia; Jouy, Eric; Paboeuf, Frederic; de Boisséson, Claire; Lucas, Pierrick; Drider, Djamel; Kempf, Isabelle",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30389047/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518308137; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.10.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518308137,161

To date, more than 1 million deaths and nearly 57 million confirmed cases have been recorded across 220 countries due to COVID-19, which is the greatest threat to global public health in our time. Although SARS-CoV-2 is genetically similar to other coronaviruses, i.e., SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), no confirmed therapeutics are yet available against COVID-19, and governments, scientists, and pharmaceutical companies worldwide are working together in search for effective drugs and vaccines. Repurposing of relevant therapies, developing vaccines, and using bioinformatics to identify potential drug targets are strongly in focus to combat COVID-19. This review deals with the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its clinical symptoms in humans including the most recent updates on candidate drugs and vaccines. Potential drugs (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, dexamethasone) and vaccines [mRNA-1273; measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)] in human clinical trials are discussed with their composition, dosage, mode of action, and possible release dates according to the trial register of US National Library of Medicines (clinicaltrials.gov), European Union (clinicaltrialsregister.eu), and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (chictr.org.cn) website.

Several approaches have been developed to overcome these problems. Here we describe the engineering of CoV full-length cDNA clones using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). In this system the viral RNA is expressed in the cell nucleus under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and further amplified in the cytoplasm by the viral replicase. The BAC-based strategy is an efficient system that allows easy manipulation of CoV genomes to study fundamental viral processes and also to develop genetically defined vaccines.

The current article reviewed various possible decontamination methods for FFR reuse including ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV), microwave-generated steam (MGS), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP), and 70% or higher ethanol solution. HPV decontamination was effective against bacterial spores (6 log(10) reduction of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores) on FFRs and viruses (> 4 log(10) reduction of various types of viruses) on inanimate surfaces, and no degradation of respirator materials and fit has been reported. 70% or higher ethanol decontamination showed high efficacy in inactivation of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces (> 3.9 log(10) reduction) but it was lower on FFRs which filtration efficiency was also decreased. UVGI method had good biocidal efficacy on FFRs (> 3 log(10) reduction of H1N1 virus) combined with inexpensive, readily available equipment; however, it was more time-consuming to ensure sufficient reduction in SARS-CoV-2. MGS treatment also provided good viral decontamination on FFRs (> 4 log(10) reduction of H1N1 virus) along with less time-intensive process and readily available equipment while inconsistent disinfection on the treated surfaces and deterioration of nose cushion of FFRs were observed. HPGP was a good virucidal system (> 6 log(10) reduction of Vesicular stomatitis virus) but filtration efficiency after decontamination was inconsistent. Overall, HPV appeared to be one of the most promising methods based on the high biocidal efficacy on FFRs, preservation of respirator performance after multiple cycles, and no residual chemical toxicity. Nonetheless, equipment cost and time of the HPV process and a suitable operating room need to be considered.","Thaper, Ravinder; Fagen, Brendan; Oh, Jonghwa",Photochem Photobiol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118013/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s43630-021-00064-4,161

METHODS: Records were retrospectively collected from patients admitted to a tertiary care center in Washington, D.C., with confirmed COVID-19 from March 15, 2020 to July 15, 2020. After adjusting for clinical demographics and comorbidities, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The most common presenting symptoms of COVID-19 in patients that were admitted to the hospital were cough (38.4%), shortness of breath (37.5%), and fever (34.3%), followed by GI symptoms in 25.9% of patients. The most common GI symptom was diarrhea (12.8%) followed by nausea or vomiting (10.5%), decreased appetite (9.3%), and abdominal pain (3.8%). Patients with diarrhea were more likely to die (odds ratio [OR] 2.750; p = 0.006; confidence interval [CI] 1.329–5.688), be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (OR 2.242; p = 0.019; CI 1.139–4.413), and be intubated (OR 3.155; p = 0.002; CI 1.535–6.487).

We conducted a systematic review to assess the extent to which health services related to the care and management of acute cardiovascular events have been impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar were searched for observational studies published up to August 12, 2020 for studies that assessed the impact of the pandemic on the care and management of people with acute CVD. RESULTS: In total, 27 articles were included. Of these, 16 examined the impact on acute coronary syndromes (ACS), eight on strokes, one on ACS and strokes, and 2 on other types of CVD. When comparing the COVID-19 period to non-COVID-19 periods, eleven studies observed a decrease in ACS admissions ranging between 40 and 50% and five studies showed a decrease in stroke admissions of between 12 and 40%. Four studies showed a larger reduction in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI) compared to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI). A decrease in the number of reperfusion procedures, a shortening in the lengths of stay at the hospital, and longer symptom-to-door times were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a substantial decrease in the rate of admissions for acute CVD, reductions in the number of procedures, shortened lengths of stay at the hospital and longer delays between the onset of the symptoms and hospital treatment.

These items form the core curriculum and are mostly learned through caring for patients and clinical teaching. Doctors-in-training are evaluated for their knowledge through written tests or assignments, based on which the effectiveness of their training is also assessed; however, this generally produces a negative learning attitude among them. So we introduced the flipped classroom into PGY training program to change PGY students’ learning behavior. Although the flipped classroom is highly valued and has been practiced by teachers in schools of various levels, very few attempts have been made until now to report the learning outcomes achieved through the flipped classroom by means of rigorous research methods. Therefore we tried to employed Ajzen and Fishbein’s (1980) theory of reasoned action and Bandura’s self-efficacy to predict and explain the participants’ behavioral intention when participating in the core curriculum learning of the flipped classroom and to assess the change in students’ learning behavior and learning effectiveness. From August 2013 to July 2014, 39 PGY students from the General Surgery of the Tri-Service General Hospital were selected as the participants of this study.

Despite the growing recognition of the importance of culturally competent health services, systematic cultural competence training in the medical education system is still scarce, especially in the field of emergency. The current study aimed to examine the effectiveness of an online culturally informed intervention for increasing cultural competence in emergencies among nursing students. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was used to test the intervention effectiveness in increasing nursing students’ cultural competence in four domains: attitudes, knowledge, skills, and encounters. The study included 72 undergraduate nursing students recruited from two academic institutes. Participants were randomized (1:1 ratio) to an intervention (n = 34) and control group (n = 38). The study adheres to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT). Data analysis was based on multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measures, followed by post hoc analyses with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Results showed that the intervention was effective in increasing the participants’ culturally competent knowledge. The effect of the intervention on the skills domain approached significance. No group differences were identified in the attitudes and the encounters domains. CONCLUSIONS: An online culturally informed intervention, incorporated in the curriculum, was effective in enhancing the cognitive aspect of cultural competence (especially at the basic knowledge and understanding levels), but not other domains.

METHODS: Sub‐study of a survey of Australian emergency nurses about the impact of COVID‐19 on their work, life and career. This sub‐study focused on future career intentions, especially intentions to remain in or leave emergency nursing. RESULTS: There were 398 eligible responses. 48.2% of respondents reported that they intended to leave emergency nursing within 5 years. Nurses in EDs who received COVID positive patients were more likely to express an intention to leave ED nursing (P = 0.016). Having directly cared for a COVID positive patient was not statistically associated with intention to leave ED nursing (P = 0.17). Excluding nurses aged >60 years, there was no statistical difference in expressed intention to leave ED nursing between age groups (P = 0.32), nurses with/without a higher qualification (P = 0.32) or number of years in ED nursing (P = 0.54). Intention to leave emergency nursing was associated with not feeling more connected to their emergency nursing colleagues (P = 0.03), the broader ED team (P = 0.008) and their organisation (P = 0.03) since the onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that approximately 1 year after the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic in Australia, a high proportion of ED nurses intend to leave ED nursing within 5 years, which will exacerbate pre‐existing shortages.

However, most acute and convalescent sera from infected and all vaccinated individuals neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant, suggesting that protective immunity is retained against COVID-19.","Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Norwood, Carson; Floyd, Katharine; Lai, Lilin; Davis-Gardner, Meredith E.; Hudson, William H.; Mantus, Grace; Nyhoff, Lindsay E.; Adelman, Max W.; Fineman, Rebecca; Patel, Shivan; Byram, Rebecca; Gomes, Dumingu Nipuni; Michael, Garett; Abdullahi, Hayatu; Beydoun, Nour; Panganiban, Bernadine; McNair, Nina; Hellmeister, Kieffer; Pitts, Jamila; Winters, Joy; Kleinhenz, Jennifer; Usher, Jacob; O’Keefe, James B.; Piantadosi, Anne; Waggoner, Jesse J.; Babiker, Ahmed; Stephens, David S.; Anderson, Evan J.; Edupuganti, Srilatha; Rouphael, Nadine; Ahmed, Rafi; Wrammert, Jens; Suthar, Mehul S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.20.432046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655254/,161

648466,Monitoring Transmissibility and Mortality of COVID-19 in Europe,2020-03-28,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has emerged as a global pandemic and public health crisis. Increasing waves of intermittent infectious outbreaks have dramatically influenced care among broad populations. Over the past 2 decades, there has been a rapid increase in cancer survival, with >400 000 new survivors each year. The increasingly common presence of cardiovascular disease in patients during or after cancer treatment led to the rapid growth of the field of cardio‐oncology with a mandate of identifying, treating, and preventing the various forms of cardiovascular disease seen among this population. This review evaluates the implications of the pandemic on the practice and study of cardio‐oncology. The evolving understanding of the relationship between comorbid disease and clinical outcomes among this population is assessed. With the impetus of the pandemic, cardio‐oncology can be deliberate in embracing changes to cardiac screening, monitoring, and intervention during oncology care. Bridging 2 specialties, consideration of the lessons learned in cancer and cardiovascular may pivotally inform ongoing therapeutic efforts. Further, the development of multicenter registries focused on understanding and optimizing outcomes among these patients should be considered. Together, these insights may critically inform strategies for the care of cardio‐oncology patients in future phases of the COVID‐19 pandemic and beyond.","Addison, Daniel; Campbell, Courtney M.; Guha, Avirup; Ghosh, Arjun K.; Dent, Susan F.; Jneid, Hani",J Am Heart Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.120.017787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32713239/,161

One of the most typical treatments for COVID‐19 is social distancing, which includes lockdown; it will help to decrease the number of contacts for undiagnosed individuals. The main aim of this article is to construct and evaluate a fractional‐order COVID‐19 epidemic model with quarantine and social distancing. Laplace homotopy analysis method is used for a system of fractional differential equation (FDEs) with Caputo and Atangana–Baleanu–Caputo (ABC) fractional derivative. By applying the ABC and Caputo derivative, the numerical solution for fractional‐order COVID‐19 epidemic model is achieved. The uniqueness and existence of the solution is checked by Picard–Lindelof's method. The proposed fractional model is demonstrated by numerical simulation which is useful for the government to control the spread of disease in a practical way.","Farman, Muhammad; Aslam, Muhammad; Akgül, Ali; Ahmad, Aqeel",Math Methods Appl Sci,https://doi.org/10.1002/mma.7360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230734/,161

STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant rats were infected intravenously at gestation day 14 with 0 (control), 10(1), 10(3), 10(5), and 10(7) colony forming units of M pulmonis and necropsied at gestational day 18. Quantitative culture of maternal and fetal tissues as well as histopathologic examination of the placenta were performed. RESULTS: We have characterized a rat model of maternal and fetal infection that can be manipulated by alteration of infectious dose. Colonization of Sprague-Dawley rat dam and fetal tissues by M pulmonis occurred in a dose-dependent manner after intravenous inoculation (P < .001). Placental lesion severity increased with infection dose (P = .0001). The minimum threshold dose required to establish infection of the dam and fetus was at least 10(3) colony forming units, with consistent colonization of maternal and fetal tissues achieved only with 10(7) colony forming units. In some instances, rat fetal tissues could be colonized in the absence of concomitant amniotic fluid colonization. Interestingly, there appeared to be a predilection for colonization of the reproductive tissues. CONCLUSIONS: In the Sprague-Dawley rat, the infection rate of both the dam and fetus can be controlled by the inoculum dose. Our data support the concept that hematogenous spread of M pulmonis to the rat fetus can occur without amniotic fluid infection and suggest that the fetus itself can potentially seed the amniotic fluid with microorganisms. Importantly, manipulation of both the route of infection as well as infection dose provide a reproducible way to study both maternal and fetal immune response to infection during pregnancy.","Riggs, Margaret A.; Maunsell, Fiona P.; Reyes, Leticia; Brown, Mary B.",Am J Obstet Gynecol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937807011866; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18068142/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002937807011866,161

651213,COVID-19 and Fulminant Clostridium difficile Colitis Co-Infection.,2021,"Background To constrain propagation and mitigate the burden of COVID-19, most countries initiated and continue to implement several non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including national and regional lockdowns. In the Republic of Ireland, the first national lockdown was decreed on 23rd of March 2020, followed by a succession of restriction increases and decreases (phases) over the the following year. To date, the effects of these interventions remain unclear, and particularly within differing population subsets. The current study sought to assess the impact of individual NPI phases on COVID-19 transmission patterns within delineated population subgroups in the Republic of Ireland. Methods and Findings Confirmed, anonymised COVID-19 cases occurring between the 29th of February 2020 and 30th November 2020 (n= 72,654) were obtained. Segmented modelling via breakpoint regression with multiple turning points was employed to identify structural breaks across sub-populations, including primary/secondary infections, age deciles, urban/commuter/rural areas, patients with underlying health conditions, and socio-demographic profiles. These were subsequently compared with initiation dates of eight overarching NPI phases. Five distinct breakpoints were identified. The first breakpoint, associated with a decrease in the daily COVID-19 incidence, was reported within 14 days of the first set of restrictions in mid-March 2020 for most population sub-groups. Results suggest that moderately strict NCIs were more effective than the strictest Phase 5 (National Lockdown). Divergences were observed across population sub-groups; lagged response times were observed among populations >80 years, residents of rural/ commuter regions, and cases associated with a below-median deprivation score. Conclusions Study findings suggest that many NPIs have been successful in decreasing COVID-19 incidence rates, however the strictest Phase 5 NPI was not. Moreover, NPIs were not equally successful across all sub-populations, with differing response times noted. Mitigation strategies and interventions may need to be increasingly bespoke, based on sub-population profiles and required responses.","Boudou, M.; O'Dwyer, J.; Oh'Aiseadha, C.; Hynds, P.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.12.21255297; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.12.21255297v1?rss=1,161

Objective Given the high prevalence of asthma in the New York City area, our objective was to determine if underlying asthma was associated with poor outcomes among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease compared to patients without asthma. Methods Electronic heath records were reviewed for 1,298 sequential patients age <65 years without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who were admitted to our hospital system with a confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Results The overall prevalence of asthma among all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 12.6%, yet a higher prevalence (23.6%) was observed in the subset 55 patients <21 years of age. There was no significant difference in hospital length of stay, need for intubation, length of intubation, tracheostomy tube placement, hospital readmission or mortality between asthmatic vs. non-asthmatic patients. Observations between asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients were similar when stratified by obesity, other comorbid conditions (i.e. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes), use of controller asthma medication and absolute eosinophil count. Conclusions Among hospitalized patients <65 years with severe COVID-19, asthma diagnosis was not associated with worse outcomes, regardless of age, obesity, or other high-risk comorbidities. Future population based studies are needed to investigate the risk of developing COVID-19 among patients with asthma once universal testing becomes readily available.","Lovinsky-Desir, Stephanie; Deshpande, Deepti R.; De, Aliva; Murray, Laurie; Stingone, Jeanette A.; Chan, Angela; Patel, Neha; Rai, Nooralam; DiMango, Emily; Milner, Joshua; Kattan, Meyer",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32771560/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920311003; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.07.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920311003?v=s5,161

In contrast, the pace is much slower in determining their biological attributes. As a consequence, the gap between sequence-known proteins and attribute-known proteins has become increasingly large. The unbalanced situation, which has critically limited our ability to timely utilize the newly discovered proteins for basic research and drug development, has called for developing computational methods or high-throughput automated tools for fast and reliably identifying various attributes of uncharacterized proteins based on their sequence information alone. Actually, during the last two decades or so, many methods in this regard have been established in hope to bridge such a gap. In the course of developing these methods, the following things were often needed to consider: (1) benchmark dataset construction, (2) protein sample formulation, (3) operating algorithm (or engine), (4) anticipated accuracy, and (5) web-server establishment. In this review, we are to discuss each of the five procedures, with a special focus on the introduction of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), its different modes and applications as well as its recent development, particularly in how to use the general formulation of PseAAC to reflect the core and essential features that are deeply hidden in complicated protein sequences.","Chou, Kuo-Chen",J Theor Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002251931000679X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.12.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21168420/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251931000679X,161

DESIGN AND SAMPLE: Fifteen front‐line nurses caring for COVID‐19 patients were recruited from two hospitals in Wuhan, China from January 26 to February 5, 2020. Data were collected through semi‐structured individual interviews and analyzed using standard qualitative methods. RESULTS: Four theme categories emerged from the data analysis: (a) “Facing tremendous new challenges and danger”; (b) “Strong pressure because of fear of infection, exhaustion by heavy workloads and stress of nursing seriously ill COVID‐19 patients”; (c) “Strong sense of duty and identity as a healthcare provider”; (d) “Rational understanding of the epidemic—the nurses believed that the epidemic would soon be overcome and would like to receive disaster rescue training.” CONCLUSIONS: Although the intensive rescue work drained front‐line nurses, both physically and emotionally, they showed a spirit of dedication and felt a responsibility to overcome this epidemic. Their experiences provide useful insights into implementing a safer public health emergency rescue system in preparation for future outbreaks of infectious diseases. Specifically, psychological support and humanistic care should be provided to front‐line nurses to maintain their well‐being, and nationwide emergency rescue training and disaster education should be implemented.","Liu, Yu‐E; Zhai, Zhong‐Chang; Han, Yan‐Hong; Liu, Yi‐Lan; Liu, Feng‐Ping; Hu, De‐Ying",Public Health Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32677072/; https://doi.org/10.1111/phn.12768,161

656815,COVID-19 in a Young Infant — A Fatal Multisystem Inflammatory Disorder,2021-01-06,"Intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions (IDRs) make up around 30% of the human proteome where they play essential roles in dictating and regulating many core biological processes. While IDRs are often studied as isolated domains, in naturally occurring proteins most IDRs are found adjacent to folded domains, where they exist as either N- or C-terminal tails or as linkers connecting two folded domains. Prior work has shown that charge properties of IDRs can influence their conformational behavior, both in isolation and in the context of folded domains. In contrast, the converse scenario is less well-explored: how do the charge properties of folded domains influence IDR conformational behavior? To answer this question, we combined a large-scale structural bioinformatics analysis with all-atom implicit solvent simulations of both rationally designed and naturally occurring proteins. Our results reveal three key takeaways. Firstly, the relative position and accessibility of charged residues across the surface of a folded domain can dictate IDR conformational behavior, overriding expectations based on net surface charge properties. Secondly, naturally occurring proteins possess multiple charge patches that are physically accessible to local IDRs. Finally, even modest changes in the local electrostatic environment of a folded domain can substantially modulate IDR-folded domain interactions. Taken together, our results suggest that folded domain surfaces can act as local determinants of IDR conformational behavior.","Taneja, Ishan; Holehouse, Alex S.",Curr Res Struct Biol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crstbi.2021.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34557680/,161
659173,Development and Validation of Risk Prediction Models for COVID-19 Positivity in a Hospital Setting,2020-09-15,"Background In mid-December 2020, Israel had started a nationwide mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19. In the first few weeks, medical personnel, elderly citizens and patients with chronic diseases were prioritized. As such, patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies were encouraged to receive the vaccine. While the efficacy of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines was demonstrated in the general population, little is known about their efficacy and safety in patients with Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI). Objectives To evaluate the humoral and cellular immune response to COVID-19 vaccine in a cohort of IEI patients. Methods 26 adult patients were enrolled, and plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected two weeks following the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Humoral response was evaluated by testing anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and anti-Nuclear (N) antibody titers, and evaluation of neutralizing ability by inhibition of RBD:ACE2 binding. Cellular immune response was evaluated by ELISpot, estimating IL2 and IFNγ secretion in response to pooled SARS-CoV-2 S or M peptides. Results Our cohort included 18 patients with predominantly antibody deficiency, 2 with combined immunodeficiency, 3 with immune-dysregulation, and 3 with other genetically defined diagnoses. 22/26 were receiving immunoglobulin replacement therapy. 18/26 developed specific antibody response and 19/26 showed S-peptide specific T-cell response. None of the patients reported significant adverse events. Conclusion Vaccinating IEI patients is safe, and most patients were able to develop vaccine specific antibody response, S-protein specific cellular response or both.","Hagin, David; Freund, Tal; Navon, Michal; Halperin, Tami; Adir, Dikla; Marom, Rotem; Levi, Inbar; Benor, Shira; Alcalay, Yifat; Freund, Natalia T.",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674921008873?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674921008873; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2021.05.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34087242/,161

We conducted a retrospective survey study to assess the impact of nationwide strikes by health workers in 2017 on utilization of maternal and child health services in western Kenya. METHODS: We utilized a parent study to enroll women who were pregnant in 2017 when there were prolonged strikes by health workers (“strike group”) and women who were pregnant in 2018 when there were no major strikes (“control group”). Trained research assistants administered a close-ended survey to retrospectively collect demographic and pregnancy-related health utilization and outcomes data. Data were collected between March and July 2019. The primary outcomes of interest were antenatal care (ANC) visits, delivery location, and early child immunizations. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate risk ratios between the strike and control groups, adjusting for socioeconomic status, health insurance status, and clustering. Adjusted risk ratios (ARR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: Of 1341 women recruited in the parent study in 2017 (strike group), we re-consented 843 women (63%) to participate. Of 924 women recruited in the control arm of the parent study in 2018 (control group), we re-consented 728 women (79%). Women in the strike group were 17% less likely to attend at least four ANC visits during their pregnancy (ARR 0.83, 95%CI 0.74, 0.94) and 16% less likely to deliver in a health facility (ARR 0.84, 95%CI 0.76, 0.92) compared to women in the control group. Whether a child received their first oral polio vaccine did not differ significantly between groups, but children of women in the strike group received their vaccine significantly longer after birth (13 days versus 7 days, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: We found that women who were pregnant during nationwide strikes by health workers in 2017 were less likely to receive WHO-recommended maternal child health services. Strategies to maintain these services during strikes are urgently needed.","Scanlon, Michael L.; Maldonado, Lauren Y.; Ikemeri, Justus E.; Jumah, Anjellah; Anusu, Getrude; Bone, Jeffrey N.; Chelagat, Sheilah; Keter, Joann Chebet; Ruhl, Laura; Songok, Julia; Christoffersen-Deb, Astrid",BMC Health Serv Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06939-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465317/,161

660707,Effect of immunosuppression maintenance in solid organ transplant recipients with COVID‐19: Systematic review and meta‐analysis,2021-03-18,"Changes in people’s behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic can be regarded as the result of two types of effects: the “intervention effect” (changes resulting from government orders for people to change their behavior) and the “information effect” (voluntary changes in people’s behavior based on information about the pandemic). Using age-specific mobile location data, we examine how the intervention and information effects differ across age groups. Our main findings are as follows. First, the age profile of the intervention effect shows that the degree to which people refrained from going out was smaller for older age groups, who are at a higher risk of serious illness and death, than for younger age groups. Second, the age profile of the information effect shows that the degree to which people stayed at home tended to increase with age for weekends and holidays. Thus, while Acemoglu et al. (2020) proposed targeted lockdowns requiring stricter lockdown policies for the oldest group in order to protect those at a high risk of serious illness and death, our findings suggest that Japan’s government intervention had a very different effect in that it primarily reduced outings by the young, and what led to the quarantining of older groups at higher risk instead was people’s voluntary response to information about the pandemic. Third, the information effect has been on a downward trend since the summer of 2020. It is relatively more pronounced among the young, so that the age profile of the information effect remains upward sloping.","Watanabe, Tsutomu; Yabu, Tomoyoshi",Jpn Econ Rev (Oxf),https://doi.org/10.1007/s42973-021-00077-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177343/,161

Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a well-described clinical syndrome leading to vasoconstriction in the intracra- nial vessels, and has been associated with convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage and oc- casionally cervical artery dissection. It is usually reported in the context of a trigger such as medications, recreational drugs, or the postpartum state; however, it has not been described in COVID-19 infection. We report a case of both cervical vertebral ar- tery dissection as well as convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage due to RCVS, in a pa- tient with COVID-19 infection and no other triggers.","Dakay, Katarina; Kaur, Gurmeen; Gulko, Edwin; Santarelli, Justin; Bowers, Christian; Mayer, Stephan A; Gandhi, Chirag D; Al-Mufti, Fawaz",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1052305720304298?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807426/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1052305720304298,161

The use of prophylactic hydrocolloid dressings is one of the strategies that may improve comfort and reduce DRPI. In this study, we investigated the impact of these dressings on N95 respirator fit. METHODS: We performed a repeat quantitative fit testing through the Respiratory Protection Program on 134 healthcare workers (HCWs), who applied hydrocolloid dressings on the bridge of their nose under the N95 FFRs that they passed the initial fit test with, but reported discomfort with the FFR. RESULTS: With the hydrocolloid dressings in place, the fit-test pass rate for the semirigid cup style (3M 1860) was 94% (108 of 115); for the the vertical flat-fold style (BYD), the pass rate was 85% (44 of 52); for the duckbill style (BSN medical ProShield and Halyard Fluidshield), the pass rate was 81% (87 of 108); and for the 3-panel flat-fold style (3M Aura) N95 FFRs, the pass rate was 100% (3 of 3). There was a statistically significant reduction in the overall fit factors for both the vertical flat-fold and duckbill type N95 respirators after the application of hydrocolloid dressings. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrocolloid dressings are likely to disturb the mask seal for nonrigid-style N95 FFRs, particularly the vertical flat-fold style and the duckbill style N95 FFRs. Given the risk of mask seal disturbance of N95 respirators as shown in this study, we advocate that any HCW requiring the use of prophylactic dressings should undergo repeat quantitative fit testing with the dressing in place prior to using the dressing and mask in combination.","Ng, Irene; Kave, Benjamin; Begg, Fiona; Sage, Sarah; Segal, Reny; Williams, Daryl L.",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2021.293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34269165/,161

Little is known about the virus diversity in wild citrus species. Here, we used a metatranscriptomics approach to characterize the virus diversity in a wild citrus habitat within the proposed center of the origin of citrus plants. We discovered a total of 44 virus isolates that could be classified into species Citrus tristeza virus and putative species citrus associated ampelovirus 1, citrus associated ampelovirus 2, and citrus virus B within the family Closteroviridae, providing important information to explore the factors facilitating outbreaks of citrus viruses and the evolutionary history of the family Closteroviridae. We found that frequent horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication, and alteration of expression strategy have shaped the genome complexity and diversification of the family Closteroviridae. Recombination frequently occurred among distinct Closteroviridae members, thereby facilitating the evolution of Closteroviridae. Given the potential emergence of similar wild-citrus-originated novel viruses as pathogens, the need for surveillance of their pathogenic and epidemiological characteristics is of utmost priority for global citrus production.","Liu, Qiyan; Zhang, Song; Mei, Shiqiang; Zhou, Yan; Wang, Jianhua; Han, Guan-Zhu; Chen, Lei; Zhou, Changyong; Cao, Mengji",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34252150/,161

Chromosomal abnormalities and genetic mutations only account for a small portion of the pathogenic mechanisms of CHD, and the etiology of most cases remains unknown. The role of epigenetics in various diseases, including CHD, has attracted increased attention. The contributions of DNA methylation, one of the most important epigenetic modifications, to CHD have not been illuminated. Increasing evidence suggests that aberrant DNA methylation is related to CHD. Here, we briefly introduce DNA methylation and CHD and then review the DNA methylation profiles during cardiac development and in CHD, abnormalities in maternal genome-wide DNA methylation patterns are also described. Whole genome methylation profile and important differentially methylated genes identified in recent years are summarized and clustered according to the sample type and methodologies.

662333,Post-acute conditions of patients with COVID-19 not requiring hospital admission,2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND: There is little information regarding the safety of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) in patients with stroke and COVID-19. METHODS: This multicenter study included consecutive stroke patients with and without COVID-19 treated with IV-tPA between February 18, 2019, to December 31, 2020, at 9 centers participating in the CASCADE initiative. Clinical outcomes included modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at hospital discharge, in-hospital mortality, the rate of hemorrhagic transformation. Using Bayesian multiple regression and after adjusting for variables with significant value in univariable analysis, we reported the posterior adjusted odds ratio (OR, with 95% Credible Intervals [CrI]) of the main outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 545 stroke patients, including 101 patients with COVID-19 were evaluated. Patients with COVID-19 had a more severe stroke at admission. In the study cohort, 85 (15.9%) patients had a hemorrhagic transformation, and 72 (13.1%) died in the hospital. After adjustment for confounding variables, discharge mRS score ≥2 (OR: 0.73, 95% CrI: 0.16, 3.05), in-hospital mortality (OR: 2.06, 95% CrI: 0.76, 5.53), and hemorrhagic transformation (OR: 1.514, 95% CrI: 0.66, 3.31) were similar in COVID-19 and non COVID-19 patients. High-sensitivity C reactive protein level was a predictor of hemorrhagic transformation in all cases (OR:1.01, 95%CI: 1.0026, 1.018), including those with COVID-19 (OR:1.024, 95%CI:1.002, 1.054). CONCLUSION: IV-tPA treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke and COVID-19 was not associated with an increased risk of disability, mortality, and hemorrhagic transformation compared to those without COVID-19. IV-tPA should continue to be considered as the standard of care in patients with hyper acute stroke and COVID-19.","Sasanejad, Payam; Afshar Hezarkhani, Leila; Arsang-Jang, Shahram; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Ghoreishi, Abdoreza; Kristian, Barlinn; Rahmig, Jan; Farhoudi, Mehdi; Sadeghi Hokmabadi, Elyar; Borhani-Haghighi, Afshin; Sariaslani, Payam; Sharifi-Razavi, Athena; Ghandehari, Kavian; Khosravi, Alireza; Smith, Craig; Nilanont, Yongchai; Akbari, Yama; Nguyen, Thanh N.; Bersano, Anna; Yassi, Nawaf; Yoshimoto, Takeshi; Lattanzi, Simona; Gupta, Animesh; Zand, Ramin; Rafie, Shahram; Pourandokht Mousavian, Seyede; Reza Shahsavaripour, Mohammad; Amini, Shahram; Kamenova, Saltanat U.; Kondybayeva, Aida; Zhanuzakov, Murat; Macri, Elizabeth M; Nobleza, Christa O'Hana S.; Ruland, Sean; Cervantes-Arslanian, Anna M.; Desai, Masoom J; Ranta, Annemarei; Moghadam Ahmadi, Amir; Rostamihosseinkhani, Mahtab; Foroughi, Razieh; Hooshmandi, Etrat; Akhoundi, Fahimeh H; Shuaib, Ashfaq; Liebeskind, David S; Siegler, James; Romano, Jose G.; Mayer, Stephan A.; Bavarsad, Reza; Zamani, Babak; Woolsey, Amadene; Fazli, Yasaman; Mojtaba, Khazaei; Isaac, Christian F.; Biller, Jose; Di Napoli, Mario; Azarpazhooh, M.

OBJECTIVE: To rapidly identify areas of need and improve care in people with PD during the COVID-19 pandemic, we deployed a survey to assess COVID-19 symptoms and the pandemic’s effect among those with and without COVID-19. METHODS: People with and without PD participating in the online study Fox Insight (FI) were invited to complete a survey between April 23 and May 23, 2020. Among people reporting COVID-19 diagnoses, we compared symptoms and outcomes in people with and without PD. Among people not reporting COVID-19, we assessed access to healthcare and services and PD symptoms. RESULTS: 7,209/9,762 active FI users responded (approximately 74% response rate), 5,429 people with PD and 1,452 without PD. COVID-19 diagnoses were reported by 51 people with and 26 without PD. Complications were more frequent in people with longer PD duration. People with PD and COVID-19 experienced new or worsening motor (63%) and nonmotor (75%) symptoms. People with PD not diagnosed with COVID-19 reported disrupted medical care (64%), exercise (21%), and social activities (57%), and worsened motor (43%) and non-motor (52%) symptoms. Disruptions were more common for those living alone, with lower income and non-White race. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with wide-ranging effects on people with PD, and certain groups may be at particular risk. FI provides a rapid, patient-centered means to assess these effects and identify needs that can be used to improve the health of people with PD.","Brown, Ethan G.; Chahine, Lana M.; Goldman, Samuel M.; Korell, Monica; Mann, Emerald; Kinel, Daniel R.; Arnedo, Vanessa; Marek, Kenneth L.; Tanner, Caroline M.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32925107/; https://doi.org/10.3233/jpd-202249,161

With the rise in positive cases globally, the need for communication enhancement strategies, including augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), has emerged as a critical need. Many resources exist that describe AAC assessment and intervention processes in the acute care setting; however, AAC service provision in the COVID-19 pandemic is fraught with many unanticipated challenges. Patients, providers, and caregivers have encountered significant communication strain both at the bedside and beyond hospital walls, resulting in a communication crisis induced by many COVID-19 related variables.

However, much of the research evidence to date has been based on small samples with mothers of primary school-aged children. Further research is needed to elucidate the direction and timing of associations for mothers and fathers/partners across different stages of child development. The Child and Parent Emotion Study (CAPES) aims to examine longitudinal associations between parent emotion socialisation, child emotion regulation and socioemotional adjustment at four time points from pregnancy to age 12 years. CAPES will investigate the moderating role of parent gender, child temperament and gender, and family background. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: CAPES recruited 2063 current parents from six English-speaking countries of a child 0–9 years and 273 prospective parents (ie, women/their partners pregnant with their first child) in 2018–2019. Participants will complete a 20–30 min online survey at four time points 12 months apart, to be completed in December 2022. Measures include validated parent-report tools assessing parent emotion socialisation (ie, parent beliefs, the family emotional climate, supportive parenting and parent emotion regulation) and age-sensitive measures of child outcomes (ie, emotion regulation and socioemotional adjustment). Analyses will use mixed-effects regression to simultaneously assess associations over three time-point transitions (ie, T1 to T2; T2 to T3; T3 to T4), with exposure variables lagged to estimate how past factors predict outcomes 12 months later. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was granted by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee and the Deakin University Faculty of Health Human Research Ethics Committee. We will disseminate results through conferences and open access publications. We will invite parent end users to co-develop our dissemination strategy, and discuss the interpretation of key findings prior to publication.

METHODS We conducted a large, global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating a single 90 mg infusion of otilimab (human anti-GM-CSF monoclonal) plus standard of care in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19 respiratory failure and systemic inflammation, stratified by age and clinical status. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure at Day 28; secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality at Day 60. RESULTS Overall, 806 patients were randomized (1:1); 71% of patients receiving otilimab were alive and free of respiratory failure at Day 28 versus 67% receiving placebo, although this did not reach statistical significance (model-adjusted difference 5.3% [95% CI 0.8, 11.4]; p=0.09). However, there was a benefit in the pre-defined [≥]70-year age group (model-adjusted difference 19.1% [95% CI 5.2, 33.1]; nominal p=0.009); these patients also had a reduction of 14.4% (95% CI 0.9, 27.9%; nominal p=0.04) in model-adjusted all-cause mortality at Day 60. Safety findings were comparable between otilimab and placebo, and consistent with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Although not statistically significant in the overall population, otilimab demonstrated a substantial benefit in patients aged [≥]70, possibly reflecting a population that could benefit from therapeutic blocking of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19 where myeloid cell dysregulation is predominant.

The major cause of myocarditis in the paediatric population is viral infection, including coxsackievirus B3, adenovirus, herpesvirus, parvovirus, influenza A and B, and hepatitis. Here, we report the detection of rhinovirus C in a boy with a clinical presentation of myocarditis, suggesting a possible causative role of this virus in this case. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously well 4.5-year-old boy presented with increasing breathlessness for a week prior to admission. He also had upper respiratory tract infection a few days before the event. An echocardiogram revealed severe left ventricle (LV) systolic dysfunction with dilation of the LV. RNA was extracted from serum and two nasal swabs, and tested with conventional PCR at the family level for viruses including enterovirus, dengue, chikungunya, influenza, herpesvirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus. Further characterization of the enterovirus group was carried out using PCR with primers targeting the VP4/VP2 gene, followed by sequencing. Molecular tests showed the presence of rhinovirus C genetic material in both serum and swab samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP4/VP2 region showed 96–97 % similarity with the closest strain isolated in Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia) and Japan in 2012. CONCLUSION: We report the possible association of rhinovirus C and myocarditis in a child presenting with acute onset of dilated cardiomyopathy.","Wiyatno, Ageng; Febrianti, E. S.

To determine if there are disparities associated with socioeconomic stratification, ethnicity, medical services, and geographic region in the progression of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Mexican adults infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHOD. We analyzed data registered by the General Direction of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health of the Federal Government of Mexico regarding the confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analysis was limited to data from adults 20 years and older recorded up to July 10, 2020 (n=234 870). Indicators of severity of COVID-19 were hospitalization, development of pneumonia, requirement for intubation or admission to the intensive care unit, and death. Differences were estimated according to the level of municipal marginalization, belonging to an indigenous group, geographic region, and service sector. Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated using multilevel regression models. RESULTS. People who lived in municipalities with greater marginalization were at greater risk of presenting the four indicators of severe forms of COVID-19 (PR=1.05 or 1.06). Indigenous people were at greater risk of pneumonia (PR=1.22), hospitalization (PR=1.14) and death (PR=1.23). Among the cases treated in the private health sector, the risk of death was lower (PR=0.40), but the use of intubation or admission to the intensive care unit was higher (PR=4.45). CONCLUSIONS.

668997,The CALL score for predicting outcomes in patients with COVID-19,2020-05-31,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has impacted millions of people and the global economy. Tourism has been one the most affected economic sectors because of the mobility restrictions established by governments and uncoordinated actions from origin and destination regions. The coordination of restrictions and reopening policies could help control the spread of virus and enhance economies, but this is not an easy endeavor since touristic companies, citizens, and local governments have conflicting interests. We propose an evolutionary game model that reflects a collective risk dilemma behind these decisions. To this aim, we represent regions as players, organized in groups; and consider the perceived risk as a strict lock-down and null economic activity. The costs for regions when restricting their mobility are heterogeneous, given that the dependence on tourism of each region is diverse. Our analysis shows that, for both large populations and the EU NUTS2 case study, the existence of heterogeneous costs enhances global agreements. Furthermore, the decision on how to group regions to maximize the regions’ agreement of the population is a relevant issue for decision makers to consider. We find out that a layout of groups based on similar costs of cooperation boosts the regions’ agreements and avoid the risk of having a total lock-down and a negligible tourism activity. These findings can guide policy makers to facilitate agreements among regions to maximize the tourism recovery.","Chica, Manuel; Hernández, Juan M.; Bulchand-Gidumal, Jacques",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84604-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658596/,161

670410,Message from the new EULAR President and Steering Group,2021,"Associations between respiratory infections and asthma inception and exacerbations are well established. Infant respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus infections are known to be associated with an increased risk of asthma development, and among children with prevalent asthma, 85% of asthma exacerbations are associated with viral infections. However, the exact nature of this relationship remains unclear. Is the increase in severity of infections an epiphenomenon, meaning respiratory infections just appear more severe in individuals with underlying respiratory disease, or instead a reflection of altered host susceptibility among persons with asthma and atopic disease? The main focus of this review is to summarize the available levels of evidence supporting or refuting the notion that persons with asthma or atopic disease have an altered susceptibility to selected pathogens, as well as discussing the biological mechanism(s) that might explain such associations. Finally, we will outline areas in need of further research, as understanding the relationships between infections and asthma has important implications for both asthma prevention and treatment, including potential new pathways that might target host immune response to select pathogens.","James, Kristina M.; Peebles, R.

671333,A call to caution when hydroxychloroquine is given to elderly COVID-19 patients,2021-04-10,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. An unbalanced immune response, characterized by a weak production of type I interferons (IFN-Is) and an exacerbated release of proinflammatory cytokines, contributes to the severe forms of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused outbreaks in 2003 and 2013, respectively. Although IFN treatment gave some encouraging results against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in animal models, its potential as a therapeutic against COVID-19 awaits validation. Here, we describe our current knowledge of the complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the IFN system, highlighting some of the gaps that need to be filled for a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition to the conserved IFN evasion strategies that are likely shared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, novel counteraction mechanisms are being discovered in SARS-CoV-2–infected cells. Since the last coronavirus epidemic, we have made considerable progress in understanding the IFN-I response, including its spatiotemporal regulation and the prominent role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are the main IFN-I–producing cells. While awaiting the results of the many clinical trials that are evaluating the efficacy of IFN-I alone or in combination with antiviral molecules, we discuss the potential benefits of a well-timed IFN-I treatment and propose strategies to boost pDC-mediated IFN responses during the early stages of viral infection.","Sa Ribero, Margarida; Jouvenet, Nolwenn; Dreux, Marlène; Nisole, Sébastien",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726355/,161

A comment on “IMPact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the moRTAlity of kidney transplant recipients and candidates in a French Nationwide registry sTudy (IMPORTANT)”.,2021-01-11,"Meteorology and long-term trends in air pollutant concentrations may obscure the results from short-term policies implemented to improve air quality. This study presents changes in CO, NO(2), O(3), SO(2), PM(10), and PM(2.5) based on their anomalies during the COVID-19 partial (Phase 2) and total (Phase 3) lockdowns in Mexico City (MCMA). To minimise the impact of the air pollutant long-term trends, pollutant anomalies were calculated using as baseline truncated Fourier series, fitted with data from 2016 to 2019, and then compared with those from the lockdown. Additionally, days with stagnant conditions and heavy rain were excluded to reduce the impact of extreme weather changes. Satellite observations for NO(2) and CO were used to contrast the ground-based derived results. During the lockdown Phase 2, only NO(2) exhibited significant decreases (p < 0.05) of between 10 and 23% due to reductions in motor vehicle emissions. By contrast, O(3) increased (p < 0.05) between 16 and 40% at the same sites where NO(2) decreased. During Phase 3, significant decreases (p < 0.05) were observed for NO(2) (43%), PM(10) (20%), and PM(2.5) (32%) in response to the total lockdown. Although O(3) concentrations were lower in Phase 3 than during Phase 2, those did not decrease (p < 0.05) from the baseline at any site despite the total lockdown. SO(2) decreased only during Phase 3 in a near-road environment. Satellite observations confirmed that NO(2) decreased and CO stabilised during the total lockdown. Air pollutant changes during the lockdown could be overestimated between 2 and 10-fold without accounting for the influences of meteorology and long-term trends in pollutant concentrations. Air quality improved significantly during the lockdown driven by reduced NO(2) and PM(2.5) emissions despite increases in O(3), resulting in health benefits for the MCMA population. A health assessment conducted suggested that around 588 deaths related to air pollution exposure were averted during the lockdown. Our results show that to reduce O(3) within the MCMA, policies must focus on reducing VOCs emissions from non-mobile sources. The measures implemented during the COVID-19 lockdowns provide valuable information to reduce air pollution through a range of abatement strategies for emissions other than from motor vehicles.","Hernández-Paniagua, Iván Y.; Valdez, S.

It is therefore important to collect and to analyze data related to the infection caused by different variants. We have obtained more than 3,700 COVID-19 patients between April 2020 and March 2021 from Tokat, Turkey (roughly 3,100 outpatients and close to 600 inpatients) where about 30% were infected with Alpha variant (B.1.1.7). Descriptive statistics was used to characterize different subgroups. Both logistic regression and cause-specific Cox survival analysis of competing-risk was run on inpatients, to examine the impact of Alpha variant on hospitalization, on mortality and on other factors. We observed that the Alpha variant is over-represented in inpatients than outpatients so infection by Alpha variant increases the chance for hospitalization. The impact of Alpha variant on mortality seems to depend on the patient's age. For patients under age of 70, the case-fatality-rate was 0.84% (5.3%) for patients without (with) Alpha variant (Fisher's test P-value = 2.4 × 10-10). For patients above age of 70, the trend is opposite: the case-fatality-rate is 31.5% (13.6%) for patients without (with) Alpha variant (Fisher's test P-value = 0.0016). The two opposite trends would cancel each other, making other analyses such as cause-specific Cox regression and logistic regression non-significant. The Alpha variant increases the risk for hospitalization, increases the case-fatality-rate for lower age group, and decreases the case-fatality-rate for the upper age group. If the increase of case-fatality-rate in not the most senior group holds true, it should provide useful information for a vaccination planning to counter the impact of Alpha variants.","Cetin, Meryem; Balci, Pervin Ozlem; Sivgin, Hakan; Cetin, Sirin; Ulgen, Ayse; Dörtok Demir, Hatice; Li, Wentian",Acta microbiol. immunol.

674211,"Health‐seeking behaviors of patients with acute respiratory infections during the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China",2020-09-10,"PURPOSE: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is increasingly reported in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Diagnosis and management of COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) are challenging and our aim was to develop practical guidance. METHODS: A group of 28 international experts reviewed current insights in the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of CAPA and developed recommendations using GRADE methodology. RESULTS: The prevalence of CAPA varied between 0 and 33%, which may be partly due to variable case definitions, but likely represents true variation. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) remain the cornerstone of CAPA diagnosis, allowing for diagnosis of invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis and collection of the best validated specimen for Aspergillus diagnostics. Most patients diagnosed with CAPA lack traditional host factors, but pre-existing structural lung disease and immunomodulating therapy may predispose to CAPA risk. Computed tomography seems to be of limited value to rule CAPA in or out, and serum biomarkers are negative in 85% of patients. As the mortality of CAPA is around 50%, antifungal therapy is recommended for BAL positive patients, but the decision to treat depends on the patients’ clinical condition and the institutional incidence of CAPA. We recommend against routinely stopping concomitant corticosteroid or IL-6 blocking therapy in CAPA patients. CONCLUSION: CAPA is a complex disease involving a continuum of respiratory colonization, tissue invasion and angioinvasive disease. Knowledge gaps including true epidemiology, optimal diagnostic work-up, management strategies and role of host-directed therapy require further study.

674797,Pericarditis secondary to COVID-19 infection in a kidney transplant recipient,2021-07-23,"We study gendered employment patterns in unions by focusing on the role of exogamy for non-migrants in Germany. Classical assimilation theory has studied such mixed migrant-non-migrant unions mainly with a focus on the members of ethnic minorities. However, this perspective neglects the question of the social consequences of exogamy for the members of the majority group. We aim to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the association of being in a mixed union and the employment patterns of the couple. Our theoretical considerations and working hypotheses are derived from modernization theories, welfare state and labor market theories, gender studies, and social boundary-crossing frameworks. Drawing on the scientific use file of the German Microcensus of 2013, our sample consists of 44,499 non-migrant men (about 7% of whom are in a mixed union with a migrant) and 43,722 non-migrant women (about 5% of whom are in a mixed union). We estimate multinomial logistic regression models. We conclude that the persistent disadvantage for immigrants on the labor market in Germany shapes the gendered employment patterns of their unions, which, in turn, affect the members of the majority population. For non-migrant men, exogamy is associated with a re-traditionalization of employment patterns, whereby a man is more likely to be the main earner if he is in an exogamous union than if he is in an endogamous union. For non-migrant women, by contrast, we find evidence of a role reversal in exogamous unions, whereby the woman is more likely to be the main earner.","Braack, Mirko K.; Milewski, Nadja; Trappe, Heike",Gender Issues,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127902/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12147-021-09281-8,161

Information on the respiratory system mechanical characteristics of this disease is limited. The aim of this study is to describe the respiratory system mechanical properties of ventilated COVID-19 patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Patients consecutively admitted to the medical intensive care unit at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City, USA, from April 19 to May 1, 2020, were prospectively studied; final date of follow-up was May 1, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: At the time of first patient contact, ventilator information was collected including mode, settings, peak airway pressure, plateau pressure, and total positive end expiratory pressure. Indices of airflow resistance and respiratory system compliance were calculated and analyzed. MAIN RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 58 years. 6 out of 12 (50%) patients were female. Of the 21 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation, 9 patients who were actively breathing on the ventilator were excluded. All the patients included were on volume-control mode. Mean [±standard deviation] ventilator indices were: resistive pressure 19 [±4] cmH(2)O, airway resistance 20 [±4] cmH(2)O/L/s, and respiratory system static compliance 39 [±16] ml/cmH(2)O. These values are consistent with abnormally elevated resistance to airflow and reduced respiratory system compliance.

676898,Is early COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients concerning enough to halt transplantation? A multicenter comparative analysis from India,2021-08-30,"Many highly effective vaccines have been produced against viruses whose virulent infection elicits strong and durable protective immunity. In these cases, characterization of immune effector mechanisms and identification of protective epitopes/immunogens has been informative for the development of successful vaccine programs. Diseases in which the immune system does not rapidly clear the acute infection and/or convalescent immunity does not provide highly effective protection against secondary challenge pose a major hurdle for clinicians and scientists. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) falls primarily into this category, though not entirely. PRRSV causes a prolonged infection, though the host eventually clears the virus. Neutralizing antibodies can provide passive protection when present prior to challenge, though infection can be controlled in the absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies. In addition, primed pigs (through natural exposure or vaccination with a modified-live vaccine) show some protection against secondary challenge. While peripheral PRRSV-specific T cell responses have been examined, their direct contribution to antibody-mediated immunity and viral clearance have not been fully elucidated. The innate immune response following PRRSV infection, particularly the antiviral type I interferon response, is meager, but when provided exogenously, IFN-α enhances PRRSV immunity and viral control. Overall, the quality of immunity induced by natural PRRSV infection is not ideal for informing vaccine development programs. The epitopes necessary for protection may be identified through natural exposure or modified-live vaccines and subsequently applied to vaccine delivery platforms to accelerate induction of protective immunity following vaccination. Collectively, further work to identify protective B and T cell epitopes and mechanisms by which PRRSV eludes innate immunity will enhance our ability to develop more effective methods to control and eliminate PRRS disease.","Loving, Crystal L.; Osorio, Fernando A.; Murtaugh, Michael P.; Zuckermann, Federico A.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26209116/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242715001464; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242715001464; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.07.003,161

681356,Abnormal Adrenal Mass Presents as Proximal Epithelioid Sarcoma,2020-09-22,"Replication of positive-sense RNA viruses is associated with the rearrangement of cellular membranes. Previous work on the infection of tissue culture cell lines with the betacoronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) showed that they generate double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes as part of a reticular membrane network. Here we describe a detailed study of the membrane rearrangements induced by the avian gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in a mammalian cell line but also in primary avian cells and in epithelial cells of ex vivo tracheal organ cultures. In all cell types, structures novel to IBV infection were identified that we have termed zippered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and spherules. Zippered ER lacked luminal space, suggesting zippering of ER cisternae, while spherules appeared as uniform invaginations of zippered ER. Electron tomography showed that IBV-induced spherules are tethered to the zippered ER and that there is a channel connecting the interior of the spherule with the cytoplasm, a feature thought to be necessary for sites of RNA synthesis but not seen previously for membrane rearrangements induced by coronaviruses. We also identified DMVs in IBV-infected cells that were observed as single individual DMVs or were connected to the ER via their outer membrane but not to the zippered ER. Interestingly, IBV-induced spherules strongly resemble confirmed sites of RNA synthesis for alphaviruses, nodaviruses, and bromoviruses, which may indicate similar strategies of IBV and these diverse viruses for the assembly of RNA replication complexes. IMPORTANCE All positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses induce rearranged cellular membranes, providing a platform for viral replication complex assembly and protecting viral RNA from cellular defenses. We have studied the membrane rearrangements induced by an important poultry pathogen, the gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Previous work studying closely related betacoronaviruses identified double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs) derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in infected cells. However, the role of DMVs and CMs in viral RNA synthesis remains unclear because these sealed vesicles lack a means of delivering viral RNA to the cytoplasm. Here, we characterized structures novel to IBV infection: zippered ER and small vesicles tethered to the zippered ER termed spherules. Significantly, spherules contain a channel connecting their interior to the cytoplasm and strongly resemble confirmed sites of RNA synthesis for other positive-sense RNA viruses, making them ideal candidates for the site of IBV RNA synthesis.","Maier, Helena J.; Hawes, Philippa C.; Cottam, Eleanor M.; Mantell, Judith; Verkade, Paul; Monaghan, Paul; Wileman, Tom; Britton, Paul",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00801-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24149513/,161
681876,Down-regulated gene expression spectrum and immune responses changed during the disease progression in COVID-19 patients,2020-04-20,"BACKGROUND: Hospital emergency management plans are essential and must include input from an infection preventionist (IP). Multiple hospital planning documents exist, but many do not address infection prevention issues, combine them with noninfection prevention issues, or are disease/event specific. An all-encompassing emergency management planning guide for IPs is needed. METHODS: A literature review and Internet search were conducted in December 2008. Data from relevant sources were extracted. A spreadsheet was created that delineated hospital emergency management plan components of interest to IPs. RESULTS: Of the sources screened, 49 were deemed relevant. Eleven domains were identified: (1) having a plan; (2) assessing hospital readiness; (3) having infection prevention policies and procedures; (4) having occupational health policies and procedures; (5) conducting surveillance and triage; (6) reporting incidents, having a communication plan, and managing information; (7) having laboratory support; (8) addressing surge capacity issues; (9) having anti-infective therapy and/or vaccines; (10) providing infection prevention education; and (11) managing physical plant issues. CONCLUSION: Infection preventionists should use this article as an assessment tool for evaluating their hospital emergency management plan and for developing policies and procedures that will decrease the risk of infection transmission during a mass casualty event.","Rebmann, Terri",Am J Infect Control,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655309006270; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655309006270; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2009.04.286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19699558/,161

682297,Complication of Hepatitis A Infection: Case Report of Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy,2020-11-25,"BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases of livestock have negative consequences for animal production as well as animal health and welfare and can be transmitted between farms via direct (live animal movements) as well as indirect (via physical vectors such as, people, transport vehicles and fomites) contacts. The objective of the study was to examine the travel patterns of professionals visiting Swedish farms (veterinarians, milk tanker drivers, artificial inseminators, maintenance technicians and livestock hauliers). This was done by obtaining records of the farms visited by a sample of professionals in the above categories in one week in January, one week in April, one week in July and one week in October in the Swedish counties Västerbotten, Södermanland, Västergötland and Skåne. RESULTS: There were twelve participating organisations, and data was provided for one to three individuals/vehicles/veterinary practices per professional category and per geographic region (except for dairy service technicians and livestock hauliers who did not provide data from all regions). There was a trend towards larger areas covered and smaller number of farms visited per week in the north, but exceptions occurred and there were regional variations. Generally, the greatest areas were travelled by milk tankers and livestock hauliers, and the profession travelling over the smallest areas tended to be the veterinarians. Milk tankers visited most farms per week, one milk tanker could visit between 23 and 90 farms per week and travel over areas between 717 km(2) and 23,512 km(2) per week. CONCLUSIONS: Valuable insight into the travel patterns of Swedish professionals has emerged although the implications of the study largely concern highly infectious diseases. Movement of live animals pose the greatest risk for the spread of infectious animal diseases; however indirect contacts are important for many diseases. The results of this study indicate that in Sweden a highly contagious disease might spread over a large area in the time span of one incubation period, which ought to be kept in mind in case of an outbreak and in outbreak investigations. The difficulties in contacting some professionals visiting farms could be a problem in an outbreak situation.","Olofsson, Emelie; Nöremark, Maria; Lewerin, Susanna Sternberg",Acta Vet Scand,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-014-0070-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25366065/,161
682589,A case report of delayed manifestation of new-onset focal seizures presenting after COVID infection,2021-03-31,"Objective: To assess the predictive value of symptoms, sociodemographic characteristics, and SARS-CoV-2 exposure in household, school, and community setting for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in Swiss schoolchildren at two time points in 2020. Design: Serological testing of children in primary and secondary schools (aged 6–13 and 12–16 years, respectively) took place in June–July (T1) and October–November (T2) 2020, as part of the longitudinal, school-based study Ciao Corona in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Information on sociodemographic characteristics and clinical history was collected with questionnaires to parents; information on school-level SARS-CoV-2 infections was collected with questionnaires to school principals. Community-level cumulative incidence was obtained from official statistics. We used logistic regression to identify individual predictors of seropositivity and assessed the predictive performance of symptom- and exposure-based prediction models. Results: A total of 2,496 children (74 seropositive) at T1 and 2,152 children (109 seropositive) at T2 were included. Except for anosmia (odds ratio 15.4, 95% confidence interval [3.4–70.7]) and headache (2.0 [1.03–3.9]) at T2, none of the individual symptoms were significantly predictive of seropositivity at either time point. Of all the exposure variables, a reported SARS-CoV-2 case in the household was the strongest predictor for seropositivity at T1 (12.4 [5.8–26.7]) and T2 (10.8 [4.5–25.8]). At both time points, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was greater for exposure-based (T1, 0.69; T2, 0.64) than symptom-based prediction models (T1, 0.59; T2, 0.57). Conclusions: In children, retrospective identification of past SARS-CoV-2 infections based on symptoms is imprecise. SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity is better predicted by factors of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, especially reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in the household. Predicting SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in children in general is challenging, as few reliable predictors could be identified. For an accurate retrospective identification of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children, serological tests are likely indispensable.

683114,Indirect HIV morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19,2021-02-13,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC) and the striatum. Nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) is a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in limiting mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and inflammation in the central nervous system and protecting dopaminergic neurons and a promising therapeutic target for PD. Cicadidae Periostracum (CP), the cast-off skin of Cryptotympana pustulata Fabricius, has been used in traditional medicine for its many clinical pharmacological effects, including the treatment of psychological symptoms in PD. However, scientific evidence for the use of CP in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, is lacking. Here, we investigated the protective effects of CP on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine- (MPTP-) induced PD in mice and explored the underlying mechanisms of action, focusing on Nurr1. CP increased the expression levels of Nurr1, tyrosine hydroxylase, DOPA decarboxylase, dopamine transporter, and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 via extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in differentiated PC12 cells and the mouse SNPC. In MPTP-induced PD, CP promoted recovery from movement impairments. CP prevented dopamine depletion and protected against dopaminergic neuronal degradation via mitochondria-mediated apoptotic proteins such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 by inhibiting MPTP-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2, and glial/microglial activation. Moreover, CP inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines and response levels and glial/microglial activation in BV2 microglia and the mouse brain. Our findings suggest that CP might contribute to neuroprotective signaling by regulating neurotrophic factors primarily via Nurr1 signaling, neuroinflammation, and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.","Lim, Hye-Sun; Kim, Joong-Sun; Moon, Byeong Cheol; Choi, Goya; Ryu, Seung Mok; Lee, Jun; Ang, Mary Jasmin; Jeon, Mijin; Moon, Changjong; Park, Gunhyuk",Oxid Med Cell Longev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31772707/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/5797512,161

The prevalence of in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19 was very high which ranged from 1 to 52% of hospital admission. The prevalence of mortality among intensive care patients with COVID-19 was very high which ranged from 6% to 86% of admitted patients. METHODS: A three-stage search strategy was conducted on PubMed/Medline; Science direct Cochrane Library. The Heterogeneity among the included studies was checked with forest plot, χ2 test, I2 test, and the p-values. Publication bias was checked with a funnel plot and the objective diagnostic test was conducted with Egger's correlation, Begg's regression tests. RESULT: The Meta-Analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of in-hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease was 15% (95% CI: 13 to 17). Prevalence of in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 was strongly related to different factors. Patients with Acute respiratory distress syndrome were eight times more likely to die as compared to those who didn't have, RR = 7.99(95% CI: 4.9 to 13).

684467,Association of low serum TGF-β level in hantavirus infected patients with severe disease,2015-04-14,"The goal of a successful immune response is to clear the pathogen while sparing host tissues from damage associated with pathogen replication and active immunity. Regulatory T cells (Treg) have been implicated in maintaining this balance as they contribute both to the organization of immune responses as well as restriction of inflammation and immune activation to limit immunopathology. To determine if Treg abundance prior to pathogen encounter can be used to predict the success of an antiviral immune response, we used genetically diverse mice from the collaborative cross infected with West Nile virus (WNV). We identified collaborative cross lines with extreme Treg abundance at steady state, either high or low, and used mice with these extreme phenotypes to demonstrate that baseline Treg quantity predicted the magnitude of the CD8 T cell response to WNV infection, although higher numbers of baseline Tregs were associated with reduced CD8 T cell functionality in terms of TNF and granzyme B expression. Finally, we found that abundance of CD44(+) Tregs in the spleen at steady state was correlated with an increased early viral load within the spleen without an association with clinical disease. Thus, we propose that Tregs participate in disease tolerance in the context of WNV infection by tuning an appropriately focused and balanced immune response to control the virus while at the same time minimizing immunopathology and clinical disease. We hypothesize that Tregs limit the antiviral CD8 T cell function to curb immunopathology at the expense of early viral control as an overall host survival strategy.","Graham, Jessica B.; Swarts, Jessica L.; Edwards, Kristina R.; Voss, Kathleen M.; Green, Richard; Jeng, Sophia; Miller, Darla R.; Mooney, Michael A.; McWeeney, Shannon K.; Ferris, Martin T.; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando; Gale, Michael; Lund, Jennifer M.",Immunohorizons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33893179/; https://doi.org/10.4049/immunohorizons.2100009,161

These increases are more likely to occur in those with chronic cardiovascular conditions and in those with severe COVID-19 presentations. The increased inflammatory, prothrombotic, and procoagulant responses following severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increase the risk for acute nonischemic myocardial injury and acute myocardial infarction, particularly type 2 myocardial infarction, because of respiratory failure with hypoxia and hemodynamic instability in critically ill patients. Myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, acute heart failure, and direct injury from SARS-CoV-2 are important etiologies, but primary noncardiac conditions, such as pulmonary embolism, critical illness, and sepsis, probably cause more of the myocardial injury.

This is especially true in certain geographic locations due to the uneven distribution of genetic counselors throughout the US. To assess these disparities, access to genetic counselors of all specialties is explored by geography, cancer type, and social determinants of health. Geospatial technology was used to combine and analyze genetic counselor locations and cancer incidence at the county level across the US, with a particular focus on tumors associated with BRCA mutations including ovarian, pancreatic, prostate and breast. Access distributions were quantified, and associations with region, cancer type, and socioeconomic variables were investigated using correlational tests. Nationally, in 2020, there were 4,813 genetic counselors, or 1.49 genetic counselors per 100,000 people, varying between 0.17 to 5.7 per 100,000 at the state level. Seventy-one percent of U.S. residents live within a 30-minute drive-time to a genetic counselor. Drive-times, however, are not equally distributed across the country – while 82% of people in metropolitan areas are 30 minutes from a genetic counselor, only 6% of people in nonmetro areas live within 30 minutes’ drive time. There are statistically significant differences in access across geographical regions, socioeconomics and cancer types. Access to genetic counselors for cancer patients differs across groups, including regional, socioeconomic, and cancer type. These findings highlight areas of the country that may benefit from increased genetic counseling provider supply, by increasing the number of genetic counselors in a region or by expanding the use of telegenetics a term used to describe virtual genetic counseling consults that occur via videoconference. Policy intervention to allow genetic counselors to bill for their services may be an effective route for increasing availability of genetic counselors’ services However, genetic counselors in direct patient care settings also face other challenges such as salary, job satisfaction, job recognition, overwork/burnout, and appropriate administrative/clinical support, and addressing these issues should also be considered along with policy support. These results could support targeted policy reform and alternative service models to increase access to identified pockets of unmet need, such as telemedicine.

In the light of one workshop being entirely unsuccessful, we discuss the ways in which our empirical and methodological thinking has nevertheless been enriched by this experience. We situate the challenges we faced in relation to negotiating the tensions presented by debates on decolonising research from our positions within the neoliberal academy, exploring the questions raised by indigenous women activists' research ‘refusal’, and critically reflect upon the emotional responses this situation elicited in each of us. We argue for the importance of embracing such apparent fieldwork ‘failures’ and, recognising the resulting emotional swirl of panic, anxiety and inadequacy that they produce, emphasise these experiences as illustrative of the inherent tensions around decolonising research, as well as an often inevitable element of conducting research with marginalised communities involved in socio-environmental conflicts.","Jenkins, Katy; Romero Toledo, Hugo; Videla Oyarzo, Angélica",Emot Space Soc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755458620300682; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755458620300682; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.emospa.2020.100721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901206/,161

688797,Prophylactic anticoagulation: comment on the American College of Rheumatology Guidance for Management of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children.,2021-02-14,"During pregnancy, the maternal immune response changes dramatically over the course of gestation. This has implications for generation of lactogenic immunity and subsequent protection in suckling neonates against enteric viral infections. For example, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an alphacoronavirus that causes acute diarrhea in neonatal piglets. Due to the high virulence of PEDV and the naïve, immature immune system of neonatal suckling piglets, passive lactogenic immunity to PEDV induced during pregnancy, via the gut-mammary gland (MG)-secretory IgA (sIgA) axis, is critical for piglet protection. However, the anti-PEDV immune response during pregnancy and stage of gestation required to optimally stimulate the gut-MG-sIgA axis is undefined. We hypothesize that there is a gestational window in which non-lethal PEDV infection of pregnant gilts influences maximum lymphocyte mucosal trafficking to the MG, resulting in optimal passive lactogenic protection in suckling piglets. To understand how the stages of gestation affect maternal immune responses to PEDV, three groups of gilts were orally infected with PEDV in the first, second or third trimester. Control (mock) gilts were inoculated with medium in the third trimester. To determine if lactogenic immunity correlated with protection, all piglets were PEDV-challenged at 3–5 days postpartum. PEDV infection of gilts at different stages of gestation significantly affected multiple maternal systemic immune parameters prepartum, including cytokines, B cells, PEDV antibodies (Abs), and PEDV antibody secreting cells (ASCs). Pregnant second trimester gilts had significantly higher levels of circulating PEDV IgA and IgG Abs and ASCs and PEDV virus neutralizing (VN) Abs post PEDV infection. Coinciding with the significantly higher PEDV Ab responses in second trimester gilts, the survival rate of their PEDV-challenged piglets was 100%, compared with 87.2, 55.9, and 5.7% for first, third, and mock litters, respectively. Additionally, piglet survival positively correlated with PEDV IgA Abs and ASCs and VN Abs in milk and PEDV IgA and IgG Abs in piglet serum. Our findings have implications for gestational timing of oral attenuated PEDV maternal vaccines, whereby PEDV intestinal infection in the second trimester optimally stimulated the gut-MG-sIgA axis resulting in 100% lactogenic immune protection in suckling piglets.","Langel, Stephanie N.; Paim, Francine C.; Alhamo, Moyasar A.; Buckley, Alexandra; Van Geelen, Albert; Lager, Kelly M.; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Saif, Linda J.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00727; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068924/,161

Results: Overall, the 28-day mortality of patients with comorbid CVD was 3.25 times of that of patients without comorbid CVD (40.63% vs 12.50%, P=0.011). Clinic symptoms on admission were similar for the two groups.

From drug administration to therapeutic activity, nanocarriers must evade the host's immune system, specifically and efficiently target and enter the cell, and release their payload into the cell cytoplasm by endosomal escape. These processes constitute the early infection stage of viruses. Viruses are a powerful natural nanomaterial for the efficient delivery of genetic information by sophisticated mechanisms. Over the past two decades, many virus-inspired nanocarriers have been generated to permit successful drug and gene delivery. In this review, we summarize the early infection machineries of viruses, of which the part has so far been utilized for delivery systems.
