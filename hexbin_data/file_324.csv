1884,1884,1884,Application of Behavioral Theories to Disaster and Emergency Health Preparedness: A Systematic Review,19.860315,5.5590925,2015-07-01,"Background: Preparedness for disasters and emergencies at individual, community and organizational levels could be more effective tools in mitigating (the growing incidence) of disaster risk and ameliorating their impacts. That is, to play more significant roles in disaster risk reduction (DRR). Preparedness efforts focus on changing human behaviors in ways that reduce people’s risk and increase their ability to cope with hazard consequences. While preparedness initiatives have used behavioral theories to facilitate DRR, many theories have been used and little is known about which behavioral theories are more commonly used, where they have been used, and why they have been preferred over alternative behavioral theories. Given that theories differ with respect to the variables used and the relationship between them, a systematic analysis is an essential first step to answering questions about the relative utility of theories and providing a more robust evidence base for preparedness components of DRR strategies. The goal of this systematic review was to search and summarize evidence by assessing the application of behavioral theories to disaster and emergency health preparedness across the world. Methods: The protocol was prepared in which the study objectives, questions, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and sensitive search strategies were developed and pilot-tested at the beginning of the study. Using selected keywords, articles were searched mainly in PubMed, Scopus, Mosby’s Index (Nursing Index) and Safetylit databases. Articles were assessed based on their titles, abstracts, and their full texts. The data were extracted from selected articles and results were presented using qualitative and quantitative methods. Results: In total, 2040 titles, 450 abstracts and 62 full texts of articles were assessed for eligibility criteria, whilst five articles were archived from other sources, and then finally, 33 articles were selected. The Health Belief Model (HBM), Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Social Cognitive Theories were most commonly applied to influenza (H1N1 and H5N1), floods, and earthquake hazards. Studies were predominantly conducted in USA (13 studies). In Asia, where the annual number of disasters and victims exceeds those in other continents, only three studies were identified. Overall, the main constructs of HBM (perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers), EPPM (higher threat and higher efficacy), TPB (attitude and subjective norm), and the majority of the constructs utilized in Social Cognitive Theories were associated with preparedness for diverse hazards. However, while all the theories described above describe the relationships between constituent variables, with the exception of research on Social Cognitive Theories, few studies of other theories and models used path analysis to identify the interdependence relationships between the constructs described in the respective theories/models. Similarly, few identified how other mediating variables could influence disaster and emergency preparedness. Conclusions: The existing evidence on the application of behavioral theories and models to disaster and emergency preparedness is chiefly from developed countries. This raises issues regarding their utility in countries, particularly in Asisa and the Middle East, where cultural characteristics are very different to those prevailing in the Western countries in which theories have been developed and tested. The theories and models discussed here have been applied predominantly to disease outbreaks and natural hazards, and information on their utility as guides to preparedness for man-made hazards is lacking. Hence, future studies related to behavioral theories and models addressing preparedness need to target developing countries where disaster risk and the consequent need for preparedness is high. A need for additional work on demonstrating the relationships of variables and constructs, including more clearly articulating roles for mediating effects was also identified in this analysis.","Ejeta, Luche Tadesse; Ardalan, Ali; Paton, Douglas",PLoS Curr,324,27

The frameshift involves a phenylalanyl-tRNA shifting into the + 1 frame at the sequence UUU-U/C. The shift does not occur if the in-frame phenylalanine codon UUU is replaced by UUC. The level of frameshifting is higher in dense cultures and is not dependent on phenylalanine starvation. In the wild-type argI gene this frameshifting event would be an error, leading to a truncated, non-functional protein. Therefore, it is unlike the numerous examples of required frameshifting events that have been described in other genes.","Fu, Changwei; Parker, Jack",Mol Gen Genet,324,11

To explore this topic, five focus groups were conducted with 40 TSPs in a contracted mental and behavioral health agency and data were analyzed following an inductive thematic process. Eleven primary challenges were identified, including the difficulty of navigating numerous involved parties, an overwhelmed work environment, legal intersections common to child welfare cases, unrealistic agency expectations, and heighten case complexity when working with child welfare populations. Findings are organized across system, agency, and client levels and add to the understanding of TSP perspectives working with child welfare. Targeted interventions are discussed, such as efforts to promote realistic expectations and training strategies, as well as directions for future research to improve the intersection between child welfare and mental and behavioral health.","Colvin, Marianna L.; Thompson, Heather M.",J Behav Health Serv Res,324,1

Prior receipt of a trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV) can affect hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody responses to pandemic influenza vaccines. We investigated the effect of TIV priming on humoral responses to AS03-adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines, the role of AS03 on cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses, and vaccine safety. Methods. Healthy adults (aged 19–40 years) were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive TIV or saline followed 4 months later by 2 doses, 3 weeks apart, of adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine and followed up to study end (day 507). Pre- and postvaccination responses of HI and neutralizing antibody, CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells, memory B cells, and plasmablasts were assessed. Results. Ninety-nine of the 133 participants enrolled completed the study. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were recorded. In TIV-primed participants, A(H1N1)pdm09-specific antibody and CD4(+) T-cell and memory B-cell responses to the pandemic vaccine tended to be diminished. Vaccine adjuvantation led to increased responses of vaccine-homologous and -heterologous HI and neutralizing antibodies and CD4(+) T cells, homologous memory B cells, and plasmablasts. Conclusions. In healthy adults, prior TIV administration decreased humoral and CMI responses to A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine. Adjuvantation of A(H1N1)pdm09 antigen helped to overcome immune interference between the influenza vaccines. No safety concerns were observed. Registration.

With an increasing ageing population and life-style changes including tobacco use, harmful alcohol consumption, unhealthy diets, and insufficient physical activity, the proportion of total deaths from NCDs will continue to increase. An analysis of current diseases pattern and projections of the trends informs planning of health interventions. This analysis aims to project the mortality and risk factor of disease until 2040, based on past trends. METHODS: This study uses secondary data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study which analyses historic data from 1990 to 2016 to predict key variables such as, the mortality rates, life expectancy and Years of Life Lost for different causes of death from 2017 to 2040. ‘GBD Foresight Visualization’, a visualisation tool publicly available in the webpage of Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation was the source of data for this analysis. GBD forecasting uses three-component modelling process: the first component captures variations due to risk factors and interventions, the second takes into consideration the variation due to measures of development quantified as social development index and the third uses an autoregressive integrated moving average model to capture the unexplained component correlated over time. We extracted Nepal specific data from it and reported number of deaths, mortality rates (per 100,000 population) as well as causes of death for the period 1990 to 2040. RESULTS: In 1990, CMNN diseases were responsible for approximately two-thirds (63.6%) of total deaths in Nepal. The proportion of the deaths from the CMNN diseases has reduced to 26.8% in 2015 and is estimated to be about a fifth of the 1990 figure (12.47%) in 2040. Conversely, deaths from NCDs reflect an upward trend. NCDs claimed a third of total deaths (29.91%) in the country in 1990, while in 2015, were responsible for about two-thirds of the total deaths (63.31%). In 2040, it is predicted that NCDs will contribute to over two-thirds (78.64%) of total deaths in the country. Less than a tenth (6.49%) of the total deaths in Nepal in 1990 were associated with injuries which increased to 13.04% in 2015 but is projected to decrease to 8.89% in 2040. In 1990, metabolic risk factors including high systolic blood pressure, high total cholesterol, high fasting plasma glucose, high body mass index and impaired kidney functions collectively contributed to a tenth of the total deaths (10.38%) in Nepal, whereas, in 2040 more than a third (37.31%) of the total deaths in the country could be attributed to it. CONCLUSION: A reverse of the situation in 1990, NCDs are predicted to be the leading cause of deaths and metabolic risk factors are predicted to contribute to the highest proportion of deaths in 2040. NCDs could demand a major share of resources within the health sector requiring extensive multi-sectoral prevention measures, re-allocation of resources and re-organisation of the health system to cater for long-term care.","Pandey, Achyut Raj; Chalise, Binaya; Shrestha, Niraj; Ojha, Biwesh; Maskey, Jasmine; Sharma, Dikshya; Godwin, Peter; Aryal, Krishna Kumar",PLoS One,324,22

The therapeutic potential of β-glucans is evidenced by the fact that two glucan isolates were licensed as drugs in Japan as immune-adjuvant therapy for cancer in 1980. Significant challenges exist to further clinical testing and translation of β-glucans. The diverse range of conditions for which β-glucans are in clinical testing underlines the incomplete understanding of the diverse mechanisms of action of β-glucans, a key knowledge gap. Furthermore, important differences appear to exist in the effects of apparently similar β-glucan preparations, which may be due to differences in sources and extraction procedures, another poorly understood issue. This review will describe the biology, potential mechanisms of action and key therapeutic targets being investigated in clinical trials of β-glucans and identify and discuss the key challenges to successful translation of this intriguing potential therapeutic.","Murphy, Emma J.; Rezoagli, Emanuele; Major, Ian; Rowan, Neil J.; Laffey, John G.",J Fungi (Basel),324,12

Despite the traumatic nature of witnessing gun violence, we have little knowledge of whether exposure to local gun violence is associated with higher risks of depression among mothers, whose symptoms of depression are likely to have spillover effects for kin. We examined the association between exposure to gun violence in mothers’ neighborhoods and their experiences of depression using longitudinal Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study data (n = 4587) in tandem with lagged outcome and fixed effect models. We find that mothers who witness at least one shooting in their neighborhoods or local communities exhibit more symptoms of depression and are 32–60% more likely to meet criteria for depression than mothers who do not witness a shooting. We also find that witnessing a shooting is associated with increases in parental aggravation, which is partially mediated by maternal depression. Given this and other previously documented spillover effects of mothers’ mental health on children and family members, these findings have important implications for mothers’ wellbeing and their kin. Further, we observe substantial racial and socioeconomic disparities in exposure to gun violence, suggesting that gun violence may heighten health disparities and drawing attention to the importance of providing mental health resources in communities that are most affected by gun violence.","Leibbrand, Christine; Rivara, Frederick; Rowhani-Rahbar, Ali",Prev Sci,324,5

In this study, we applied salmon host transcriptional biomarkers to identify and select fish in a viral disease state, but only those that were negative for known viruses based on RT-PCR screening. These fish were selected for metatranscriptomic sequencing to discover potential viral pathogens of dead and dying farmed Atlantic (Salmo salar) and Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) salmon in British Columbia (BC). We found that the application of the biomarker panel increased the probability of discovering viruses in aquaculture populations. We discovered two viruses that have not previously been characterised in Atlantic salmon farms in BC (Atlantic salmon calicivirus and Cutthroat trout virus-2), as well as partially sequenced three putative novel viruses. To determine the epidemiology of the newly discovered or emerging viruses, we conducted high-throughput reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and screened over 9,000 farmed and wild salmon sampled over one decade. Atlantic salmon calicivirus and Cutthroat trout virus-2 were in more than half of the farmed Atlantic salmon we tested. Importantly we detected some of the viruses we first discovered in farmed Atlantic salmon in Chinook salmon, suggesting a broad host range. Finally, we applied in situ hybridisation to determine infection and found differing cell tropism for each virus tested. Our study demonstrates that continual discovery and surveillance of emerging viruses in these ecologically important salmon will be vital for management of both aquaculture and wild resources in the future.","Mordecai, Gideon J; Di Cicco, Emiliano; Günther, Oliver P; Schulze, Angela D; Kaukinen, Karia H; Li, Shaorong; Tabata, Amy; Ming, Tobi J; Ferguson, Hugh W; Suttle, Curtis A; Miller, Kristina M",Virus Evol,324,12

There have been some technical approaches to overcome language barriers in medical care but not yet in the prehospital emergency care setting. The use of digital technologies in health care is expanding rapidly. Involving end users at all stages of the development process may help to ensure such technologies are usable and can be implemented. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a digital communication tool that addresses paramedic needs in the specific circumstances of prehospital emergency care and helps paramedics to overcome language barriers when providing care to foreign-language patients. METHODS: We actively engaged paramedics and software designers in an action-oriented, participatory, iterative development process, which included field observations, workshops, background conversations, questionnaires on rescue missions, studying the literature, and preliminary testing in the field. RESULTS: With input from paramedics, we created an app with 600 fixed phrases supporting 18 languages. The app includes medical history–taking questions, phrases asking for consent, and phrases providing specific additional information. Children as patients, as well as their carers and other third parties, can be addressed with appropriate wording. All phrases can be played back audibly or displayed as text. The comprehensive content is grouped into categories and adapted to diverse scenarios, which makes the tool rapidly usable. The app includes a function to document patient responses and the conversation history. For evaluation in a clinical study, the app is run on a smartphone with extra speakers to be of use in noisy environments. The use of prototypes proved valuable to verify that the content, structure, and functions discussed in theory were of value and genuinely needed in practice and that the various device control elements were intuitive. CONCLUSIONS: The nature of the paramedic work environment places specific demands on the communication options used and need for such devices. The active involvement of paramedics in the development process allowed us to understand and subsequently consider their experience-based knowledge. Software designers could understand the paramedics’ work environment and consider respective needs in the menu navigation and design principles of the app. We argue that the development of any medical software product should actively involve both end users and developers in all phases of the development process. Providing the users with the opportunity to influence technology development ensures that the result is closer to their needs, which can be seen as crucial for successful implementation and sustainable use.

We conducted a cross-sectional design study through a questionnaire survey with 443 respondents aged between 12 and 81 years. The questionnaire was concerned with previous health problem occurrences associated with thermal discomfort experiences, indoor environments, economic conditions, and basic anthropometric factors. Logistic regression with the odds ratio (OR) was applied to evaluate the tendency of different respondent groups to suffer from certain health problems, when compared to reference groups. Furthermore, structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to incorporate certain factors (economic conditions, thermal discomfort experiences, and perceived indoor environments) into a single model to understand their direct and indirect effects on health conditions. The results indicate that economic conditions are the most significantly associated with health problems. Furthermore, we found that the low-income group was the most vulnerable to health problems, including coughing, puking, diarrhoea, odynophagia, headaches, fatigue, rheumatism, fidgeting, skin rashes, muscle cramps, and insomnia (OR: 1.94–6.04, p <0.05). Additionally, the SEM suggested that the respondents’ economic conditions and thermal discomfort experiences had significant direct effects on their health problems with standardized estimates of -0.29 and 0.55, respectively. Additionally, perceived indoor environment quality, which is possible to cause thermal discomfort experience, indirectly affect health problems.

The study comprised five steps. The first to third steps used an exploratory qualitative research design. The Delphi technique with FGD was applied to collect qualitative data. During the study, seven experts participated in ten FGDs. Feasibility testing was conducted as a one group pre- and post-test design that included ten children with drug-naïve ADHD without other mental or physical disorders. Feasibility data were collected before and after 20 training sessions with the Indonesian computer-based game prototype. The framework analysis was performed for qualitative data. Quantitative data were analyzed using the paired t-test, Pearson's correlation and Spearman's rank-order correlation. Outputs of the exploratory qualitative study were the Indonesian computer-based game prototype constructs and general agreements of the prototype,. The Indonesian computer-based game prototype construct comprised six components: reward-related processing, control inhibition, improved sustained attention, specific timing, increased arousal, and improved emotional regulation.

N-acetylcysteine ordering more than doubled; however, total doses of P100PD remained unchanged after the intervention. The use of 3% sodium chloride increased significantly from 0.28 to 4.15 new starts and 4.37 to 38.84 total doses P100PD. Mechanical ventilation days P100PD decreased, suggesting there were no measured adverse effects of pathway implementation. The reduction in dornase-alfa utilization resulted in a cumulative and sustained 59% mucolytic cost reduction ($2183.08–$885.77 P100PD). CONCLUSION: A clinical pathway prioritizing pharmacoeconomics when evidence for use is lacking can improve health care value without adversely affecting patient outcomes.","Gillis, Holly Catherine; Dolan, Kevin; Sargel, Cheryl L.; Thompson, R.

DESIGN: The BIOmarkers TO diagnose PnEumonia study was a prospective cohort study conducted from March to June 2016. SETTING: Primary care in Northern Malawi. PATIENTS: 494 children aged 2 –59 months with WHO defined pneumonia. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): Number of children with bacterial infection identified and the sensitivity/specificity of WHO markers of severity for need for hospitalisation. RESULTS: 13 (2.6%) children had a bacterium consistent with pneumonia identified. A virus consistent with pneumonia was identified in in 448 (90.7%) of children. 56 children were admitted to hospital and two children died within 30 days. 442 (89.5%) received antibiotic therapy. Eleven children (2.6%) had HIV. WHO severity markers at baseline demonstrated poor sensitivity for the need for hospitalisation with a sensitivity of 0.303 (95% CI 0.188 to 0.441) and a specificity 0.9 (95% CI 0.868 to 0.926). A prediction rule to indicate the need for hospitalisation was developed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The low rate of bacterial infection and high use of antibiotics in the setting of high immunisation rates highlights the changing profile of childhood pneumonia. Similarly, the markers of need for hospitalisation may have changed in the setting of extended immunisation. Further studies are required to examine this.","Gallagher, Joe; Chisale, Master; Das, Sudipto; Drew, Richard J; Gleseva, Nadezhda; Wildes, Dermot Michael; De Gascun, Cillian; Wu, Tsung-Shu Joseph; Ledwidge, Mark T; Watson, Chris",BMJ Open,324,22

Methods: The evaluated outcomes included combined major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), myocardial infarction (MI), all-cause mortality, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. A random effects meta-analysis, stratified by study design, was performed and heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. Results: In total, 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (6930 patients) and 16 observational studies (183,546 patients) were included. Analysis of RCTs showed that there were no significant differences in the incidences of MACEs (risk ratio [RR] = 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75–1.05]), MI (RR = 0.93 [95% CI = 0.76–1.15]), and all-cause mortality (RR = 0.79 [95% CI = 0.50–1.23]) in the PPI groups vs. the non-PPI groups. Pooled data from observational studies revealed an inconsistent association between the use of each PPI subtype and the increased risks of MACEs during clopidogrel treatment. There was no increased risk of MACEs or all-cause mortality associated with the use of PPIs (as a class) and other P2Y(12) inhibitors. Both the RCTs and observational studies revealed that the use of PPIs significantly reduced the risks of GI bleeding. Conclusion: The use of PPIs was associated with a reduced risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with DAPT after percutaneous coronary intervention or acute coronary syndrome. There was no clear evidence of an association between the use of PPIs and adverse cardiovascular events.

Global outbreaks have occurred in health care facilities, particularly, long-term care hospitals and nursing homes. Skin is the primary site of colonization for C. auris. To accelerate research studies, we developed microbiome sequencing protocols, including amplicon and metagenomic sequencing, directly from patient samples at health care facilities with ongoing C. auris outbreaks. We characterized the skin mycobiome with a database optimized to classify Candida species and C. auris to the clade level. While Malassezia species were the predominant skin-associated fungi, nursing home residents also harbored Candida species, including C. albicans, and C. parapsilosis. Amplicon sequencing was concordant with culturing studies to identify C. auris-colonized patients and provided further resolution that distinct clades of C. auris are colonizing facilities in New York and Illinois. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing from a clinical sample with a high fungal bioburden generated a skin-associated profile of the C. auris genome. Future larger scale clinical studies are warranted to more systematically investigate the effects of commensal microbes and patient risk factors on the colonization and transmission of C. auris. IMPORTANCECandida auris is a human pathogen of high concern due to its extensive antifungal drug resistance and high mortality rates associated with invasive infections. Candida auris skin colonization and persistence on environmental surfaces make this pathogen difficult to control once it enters a health care facility. Residents in long-term care hospitals and nursing homes are especially vulnerable. In this study, we developed microbiome sequencing protocols directly from surveillance samples, including amplicon and metagenomic sequencing, demonstrating concordance between sequencing results and culturing.","Huang, Xin; Welsh, Rory M.; Deming, Clay; Proctor, Diana M.; Thomas, Pamela J.; Gussin, Gabrielle M.; Huang, Susan S.; Kong, Heidi H.; Bentz, Meghan L.; Vallabhaneni, Snigdha; Chiller, Tom; Jackson, Brendan R.; Forsberg, Kaitlin; Conlan, Sean; Litvintseva, Anastasia P.; Segre, Julia A.",,324,1

In this study, we examined the role of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) for interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), proliferation, and migration of HPMCs. Methods: The role of HDAC6 in IL-6-elicited EMT of HPMCs was tested by morphological observation of light microscope, immunoblotting, and immune-fluorescence assay; and the function of HDAC6 in proliferation and migration of HPMCs was examined by CCK-8 assay, wound healing experiment, and immunoblotting. Results: IL-6 stimulation significantly increased the expression of HDAC6. Treatment with tubastatin A (TA), a highly selective HDAC6 inhibitor, or silencing of HDAC6 with siRNA decreased the expression of HDAC6. Moreover, TA or HDAC6 siRNA suppressed IL-6-induced EMT, as evidenced by decreased expressions of α-SMA, Fibronectin, and collagen I and the preserved expression of E-cadherin in cultured HPMCs. Mechanistically, HDAC6 inhibition suppressed the expression of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) receptor I (TGFβRI), phosphorylation of Smad3, secretion of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and transcription factor Snail. On the other hand, the pharmacological inhibition or genetic target of HDAC6 suppressed HPMCs proliferation, as evidenced by the decreased optical density of CCK-8 and the expressions of PCNA and Cyclin E. The migratory rate of HPMCs also decreased. Mechanistically, HDAC6 inhibition blocked the activation of JAK2 and STAT3. Conclusion: Our study illustrated that IL-6-induced HDAC6 not only regulated IL-6 itself downstream JAK2/STAT3 signaling but also co-activated the TGF-β/Smad3 signaling, leading to the change of the phenotype and mobility of HPMCs. HDAC6 could be a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of peritoneal fibrosis.","Shi, Yingfeng; Tao, Min; Ni, Jun; Tang, Lunxian; Liu, Feng; Chen, Hui; Ma, Xiaoyan; Hu, Yan; Zhou, Xun; Qiu, Andong; Zhuang, Shougang; Liu, Na",Front Pharmacol,324,1

The taxonomy of R. sanguineus s.s., has been particularly intensely debated, due to its wide geographic distribution, morphological variants, parasite-host associations, and its capacity and vectorial competence for the transmission of several pathogens. By sequencing mitochondrial markers, it was possible to identify the existence of multiple lineages, among which the Tropical and the Temperate lineages stand out, particularly in America. However, the northern limit between these lineages is not clear due to the lack of extensive sampling across Mexico. For this reason, the aim of the present study was to determine the genetic diversity and structure of the R. sanguineus group in Mexico and to compare it with the populations reported in the Americas, in order to propose the northern limit of the R. sanguineus Tropical lineage and the potential regions of sympatry with R. sanguineus s.s. The findings of this study now confirm the presence of R. sanguineus s.s. in Mexico, showing a subtle genetic structure and high genetic diversity throughout its distribution in the Americas. In contrast, the Tropical lineage seems to be genetically less diverse in its overall distribution in the Americas. The genetic diversity of these two independent lineages could have important epidemiological implications in the transmission of tick pathogens.","Sánchez-Montes, Sokani; Salceda-Sánchez, Beatriz; Bermúdez, Sergio E.; Aguilar-Tipacamú, Gabriela; Ballados-González, Gerardo G.; Huerta, Herón; Aguilar-Domínguez, Mariel; la Mora, Jesús Delgado-de; Licona-Enríquez, Jesús D.; la Mora, David Delgado-de; López-Pérez, Andrés M.; Torres-Castro, Marco A.; Alcántara-Rodríguez, Virginia; Becker, Ingeborg; Colunga-Salas, Pablo",Pathogens,324,17

We demonstrate the feasibility and utility of MRI and dynamic (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET imaging for monitoring tumor progression and assessing chemotherapy response in an orthotopic organoid-based patient-derived xenograft (O-PDX) mouse model of EC. METHODS: 18 O-PDX mice (grade 3 endometrioid EC, stage IIIC1), selectively underwent weekly T2-weighted MRI (total scans = 32), diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) (total scans = 9) and dynamic (18)F-FDG-PET (total scans = 26) during tumor progression. MRI tumor volumes (vMRI), tumor apparent diffusion coefficient values (ADC(mean)) and metabolic tumor parameters from (18)F-FDG-PET including maximum and mean standard uptake values (SUV(max)/SUV(mean)), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and metabolic rate of (18)F-FDG (MR(FDG)) were calculated. Further, nine mice were included in a chemotherapy treatment study (treatment; n = 5, controls; n = 4) and tumor ADC(mean)-values were compared to changes in vMRI and cellular density from histology at endpoint. A Mann–Whitney test was used to evaluate differences between groups. RESULTS: Tumors with large tumor volumes (vMRI) had higher metabolic activity (MTV and TLG) in a clear linear relationship (r(2) = 0.92 and 0.89, respectively). Non-invasive calculation of MR(FDG) from dynamic (18)F-FDG-PET (mean MR(FDG) = 0.39 μmol/min) was feasible using an image-derived input function. Treated mice had higher tumor ADC(mean) (p = 0.03), lower vMRI (p = 0.03) and tumor cellular density (p = 0.02) than non-treated mice, all indicating treatment response. CONCLUSION: Preclinical imaging mirroring clinical imaging methods in EC is highly feasible for monitoring tumor progression and treatment response in the present orthotopic organoid mouse model.

However, BT is rarely accessible due to limited availability of trained therapists and long travel distances to specialist clinics. Internet-delivered BT has the potential of overcoming these barriers through remote delivery of treatment with minimal therapist support. In the current protocol, we outline the design and methods of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating an internet-delivered BT programme referred to as BIP TIC. The trial’s primary objective is to determine the clinical efficacy of BIP TIC for reducing tic severity in young people with TS/CTD, compared with an active control intervention. Secondary objectives are to investigate the 12-month durability of the treatment effects and to perform a health economic evaluation of the intervention. METHODS: In this single-blind superiority RCT, 220 participants (9–17 years) with TS/CTD throughout Sweden will be randomised to 10–12 weeks of either therapist-supported internet-delivered BT based on exposure with response prevention (BIP TIC) or therapist-supported internet-delivered education. Data will be collected at baseline, 3 and 5 weeks into the treatment, at post-treatment, and 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. The primary endpoint is the 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome is tic severity as measured by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale – Total Tic Severity Score. Treatment response is operationalised as scores of “Very much improved” or “Much improved” on the Clinical Global Impression – Improvement scale, administered at the primary endpoint. Outcome assessors will be blind to treatment condition at all assessment points. A health economic evaluation of BIP TIC will be performed, both in the short term (primary endpoint) and the long term (12-month follow-up). There are no planned interim analyses. DISCUSSION: Participant recruitment started on 26 April 2019 and finished on 9 April 2021. The total number of included participants was 221. The final participant is expected to reach the primary endpoint in September 2021 and the 12-month follow-up in June 2022.

Expansion of this model to other states is currently being considered; therefore, it is important to evaluate whether Maryland’s all-payer model is achieving the desired goals among surgical patients, who are an at-risk population for most potentially preventable complications. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the implementation of Maryland’s all-payer model and the incidence of avoidable complications and resource use among adult surgical patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study used hospital discharge records from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project state inpatient databases to conduct a difference-in-differences analysis comparing the incidence of avoidable complications and the intensity of health resource use before and after implementation of the all-payer model in Maryland. The analytical sample included 2 983 411 adult patients who received coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), carotid endarterectomy (CEA), spinal fusion, hip or knee arthroplasty, hysterectomy, or cesarean delivery between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2016, at acute care hospitals in Maryland (intervention state) and New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island (control states). Data analysis was conducted from July 2019 to July 2021. EXPOSURES: All-payer model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Complications (infectious, cardiovascular, respiratory, kidney, coagulation, and wound) and health resource use (ie, hospital charges). RESULTS: Of 2 983 411 total patients in the analytical sample, 525 262 patients were from Maryland and 2 458 149 were from control states. Across Maryland and the control states, there were statistically significant but not clinically relevant differences in the preintervention period with regard to patient age (mean [SD], 49.7 [19.0] years vs 48.9 [19.3] years, respectively; P < .001), sex (22.7% male vs 21.4% male; P < .001), and race (0.3% vs 0.4% American Indian, 2.8% vs 4.5% Asian or Pacific Islander, 25.9% vs 12.7% Black, 4.7% vs 11.9% Hispanic, and 63.5% vs 63.4% White; P < .001). After implementation of the all-payer model in Maryland, significantly lower rates of avoidable complications were found among patients who underwent CABG (−11.3%; 95% CI, −13.8% to −8.7%; P < .001), CEA (−1.6%; 95% CI, −2.9% to −0.3%; P = .02), hip arthroplasty (−0.8%; 95% CI, −1.0% to −0.5%; P < .001), knee arthroplasty (−0.4%; 95% CI, −0.7% to −0.1%; P = .01), and cesarean delivery (−1.0%; 95% CI, −1.3% to −0.7%; P < .001). In addition, there were significantly lower increases in index hospital costs in Maryland among patients who underwent CABG (−$6236; 95% CI, −$7320 to −$5151; P < .001), CEA (−$730; 95% CI, −$1367 to −$94; P = .03), spinal fusion (−$3253; 95% CI, −$3879 to −$2627; P < .001), hip arthroplasty (−$328; 95% CI, −$634 to −$21; P = .04), knee arthroplasty (−$415; 95% CI, −$643 to −$187; P < .001), cesarean delivery (−$300; 95% CI, −$380 to −$220; P < .001), and hysterectomy (−$745; 95% CI, −$974 to −$517; P < .001). Significant changes in patient mix consistent with a younger population (eg, a shift toward private/commercial insurance for orthopedic procedures, such as spinal fusion [4.3%; 95% CI, 3.4%-5.2%; P < .001] and knee arthroplasty [1.6%; 95% CI, 1.0%-2.3%; P < .001]) and a lower comorbidity burden across surgical procedures (eg, CABG: −0.7% [95% CI, −0.1% to −0.5%; P < .001]; hip arthroplasty: −3.0% [95% CI, −3.6% to −2.3%; P < .001]) were also observed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, patients who underwent common surgical procedures had significantly fewer avoidable complications and lower hospital costs, as measured against the rate of increase throughout the study, after implementation of the all-payer model in Maryland. These findings may be associated with changes in the patient mix.","Aliu, Oluseyi; Lee, Andrew W. P.; Efron, Jonathan E.; Higgins, Robert S.

METHODS: Phase-2a, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled biomarker-guided trial with a single infusion of adrecizumab (2 or 4 mg/kg b.w.) compared to placebo. Patients with adrenomedullin above 70 pg/mL, < 12 h of vasopressor start for septic shock were eligible. Randomization was 1:1:2. Primary safety (90-day mortality, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE)) and tolerability (drug interruption, hemodynamics) endpoints were recorded. Efficacy endpoints included the Sepsis Support Index (SSI, reflecting ventilator- and shock-free days alive), change in Sequential-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and 28-day mortality. RESULTS: 301 patients were enrolled (median time of 8.5 h after vasopressor start). Adrecizumab was well tolerated (one interruption, no hemodynamic alteration) with no differences in frequency and severity in TEAEs between treatment arms (TEAE of grade 3 or higher: 70.5% in the adrecizumab group and 71.1% in the placebo group) nor in 90-day mortality. Difference in change in SSI between adrecizumab and placebo was 0.72 (CI −1.93–0.49, p = 0.24). Among various secondary endpoints, delta SOFA score (defined as maximum versus minimum SOFA) was more pronounced in the adrecizumab combined group compared to placebo [difference at 0.76 (95% CI 0.18–1.35); p = 0.007]. 28-day mortality in the adrecizumab group was 23.9% and 27.7% in placebo with a hazard ratio of 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.53–1.31, log-rank p = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we successfully completed a randomized trial evaluating selecting patients for enrolment who had a disease-related biomarker. There were no overt signals of harm with using two doses of the adrenomedullin antibody adrecizumab; however, further randomized controlled trials are required to confirm efficacy and safety of this agent in septic shock patients.

Nurses should have adequate knowledge and skills to perform endotracheal suctioning based on the best evidence. Little is known about intensive care nurses’ knowledge and practice of evidence-based endotracheal suctioning in Chinese hospitals. The purpose of this study was to investigate intensive care nurses’ knowledge and practice of evidence-based recommendations regarding endotracheal suctioning. Specifically, the study aimed to examine (1) intensive care nurses’ awareness of and adherence to endotracheal suctioning guidelines and (2) factors influencing their level of awareness and adherence. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 310 staff nurses working in intensive care units was carried out at Changsha, China. Data on participants’ characteristics, awareness of, and adherence to the endotracheal suctioning guidelines were collected through online questionnaires. Following univariate descriptive statistics, the Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis H test were performed using Software Package Statistical Analysis Version 23.0. RESULTS: A total of 281 nurses completed and returned the survey (response rate = 90.6 %). One-half to three-quarters of the nurses knew 21 of the 26 evidence-based practices and believed their practices followed the guidelines. Over half of them were unaware of the difference between open and close suctions and the pros and cons of using hyperinflation. Almost 50 % of nurses believed some of their clinical practices did not follow the evidence-based recommendations, such as not routinely using normal saline and using 80–120 mmHg suction pressure during endotracheal suctioning. Nurses with endotracheal suctioning training demonstrated significantly higher awareness of endotracheal suctioning recommendations and higher adherence levels than untrained nurses. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings revealed that Chinese intensive care nurses lacked awareness of several essential evidence-based endotracheal suctioning practices, and there were gaps between their current practice and the guideline recommendations. Further research should emphasize revealing barriers and facilitators of implementing evidence-based endotracheal suctioning practices as well as developing context-suitable interventions for guideline implementation.","Chen, Wenjun; Hu, Shuang; Liu, Xiaoli; Wang, Nina; Zhao, Junqiang; Liu, Peng; Chen, Kaixia; Hu, Jiale",BMC Nurs,324,1

Computer simulations have shown that the reconstruction method presented here outperforms standard FDK methods with regard to the image quality obtained and can be competitive in terms of time of calculation.","Cierniak, Robert; Pluta, Piotr",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,324,16

In this paper, we present a recent extension of the SPARK language and toolset to support pointers. This extension is based on an ownership policy inspired by Rust to enforce non-aliasing through a move semantics of assignment. In particular, we consider pointer-based recursive data structures, and discuss how they are supported in SPARK. We explain how iteration over these structures can be handled using a restricted form of aliasing called local borrowing. To avoid introducing a memory model and to stay in the first-order logic background of SPARK, the relation between the iterator and the underlying structure is encoded as a predicate which is maintained throughout the program control flow. Special first-order contracts, called pledges, can be used to describe this relation. Finally, we give examples of programs that can be verified using this framework.","Dross, Claire; Kanig, Johannes",Computer Aided Verification,324,22

To ensure the call for fair competition, German football associations implemented special insolvency policies. However, past research has discussed partial contradiction of these association regulations to the official insolvency law. The criticism of competitor clubs against the sanctioning practice is also increasing. Due to the lack of economic and legal scientific discussion, this article discusses economic peculiarities, disincentives and potential reform approaches of association norms associated with insolvency proceedings of football clubs in Germany. The disadvantages of a fixed point penalty are highlighted and alternatives are discussed. Furthermore, the following are also discussed: the transfer of league rights to successor clubs should be prevented and the preinsolvency proceedings should be taken into account. Since there have been no insolvency proceedings in the first Bundesliga and only two in the second Bundesliga since 1995, the results are particularly relevant for the professional and semiprofessional leagues (third to fifth Liga).","Weimar, Daniel",Ger J Exerc Sport Res,324,5

Detailed export data from Turkey, disaggregated by financing terms, show another striking pattern. Flows using bank intermediation which eliminates or reduces the risk of non-payment or non-arrival of prepaid goods, such as letters of credit or documentary collection, appear to have been much more resilient to the current downturn relative to flows using other financing terms.

Here we report baseline characteristics associated with clinical improvement at day (d) 14. METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, oxygen saturation >94% on room air, and radiological evidence of pneumonia. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive 5d or 10d of intravenous RDV once daily plus standard of care (SoC), or SoC only. For this analysis, patients were followed through discharge, d14, or death. Baseline demographic and disease characteristics associated with clinical improvement in oxygen support (≥2-point improvement on a 7-category ordinal scale ranging from discharge to death) were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression methods. RESULTS: 584 patients were randomized and treated (5/10d RDV, n=384; SoC: n=200). 159 (27%) were ≥65y, 227 (39%) female, 328 (61%) white, 102 (19%) Asian, and 99 (19%) Black. 252 participants (43%) were enrolled in Europe, 260 (45%) North America (NA), and 72 (12%) in Asia. Most patients (483 [83%]) were not on supplemental oxygen but required medical care at baseline. In a multivariable model, 5/10d RDV was significantly positively associated with clinical improvement (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.69, 95% CI: 1.08, 2.65; p=0.0226). Significant covariables positively associated with clinical improvement included age < 65y (p< 0.0001) and region of treatment (Europe and NA vs Asia, p< 0.0001 each; Table); other examined factors were not significantly associated with clinical improvement, including gender, race, ethnicity, baseline oxygen support, duration of symptoms and hospitalization, obesity, and baseline transaminase levels. Table 1. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: In moderate COVID-19 patients, after adjusting for treatment arm, age < 65y and region (NA vs Asia; Europe vs Asia) were associated with higher rates of clinical improvement. These observations recapitulate younger age as positive prognostic factor, and highlight the differences in the impact of the pandemic globally.

We define ‘governance’ as the process through which, in the case of a given entity or polity, resources are allocated, decisions made and policies implemented, with a view to ensuring the effectiveness of its operations in the face of risks in its environment. Core to this, we argue, is the organisation of knowledge through public institutions, including the legal system. Covid-19 poses a particular type of ‘Anthropogenic’ risk, which arises when organised human activity triggers feedback effects from the natural environment. As such it requires the concerted mobilisation of knowledge and a directed response from governments and international agencies. In this context, neoliberal theories and practices, which emphasise the self-adjusting properties of systems of governance in response to external shocks, are going to be put to the test. In states’ varied responses to Covid-19 to date, it is already possible to observe some trends. One of them is the widespread mischaracterisation of the measures taken to address the epidemic at the point of its emergence in the Chinese city of Wuhan in January and February 2020. Public health measures of this kind, rather than constituting a ‘state of exception’ in which legality is set aside, are informed by practices which originated in the welfare or social states of industrialised countries, and which were successful in achieving a ‘mortality revolution’ in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Relearning this history would seem to be essential for the future control of pandemics and other Anthropogenic risks.","Deakin, Simon; Meng, Gaofeng",,324,1

Available studies used different designs and different criteria to define CV complications. We assessed the cumulative incidence of acute of CV complications during hospitalisation for CAP in Internal Medicine Units (IMUs). METHODS: This was a prospective study carried out in 26 IMUs, enrolling patients consecutively hospitalised for CAP. Defined CV complications were: newly diagnosed heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, new onset of supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias, new onset hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Outcome measures were: in-hospital and 30-day mortality, length of hospital stay and rate of 30-day re-hospitalisation. RESULTS: A total of 1266 patients were enrolled, of these 23.8% experienced at least a CV event, the majority (15.5%) represented by newly diagnosed decompensated heart failure, and 75% occurring within 3 days. Female gender, a history of CV disease, and more severe pneumonia were predictors of CV events. In-hospital (12.2% vs 4.7%, p < 0.0001) and 30-day (16.3% vs 8.9%, p = 0.0001) mortality was higher in patients with CV events, as well as the re-hospitalisation rate (13.3% vs 9.3%, p = 0.002), and mean hospital stay was 11.4 ± 6.9 vs 9.5 ± 5.6 days (p < 0.0001). The occurrence of CV events during hospitalisation significantly increased the risk of 30-day mortality (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.14–2.51; p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular events are frequent in CAP, and their occurrence adversely affects outcome. A strict monitoring might be useful to intercept in-hospital CV complications for those patients with higher risk profile.

This case discusses an asymptomatic patient with two new malignancies-breast cancer and pheochromocytoma- who had positive outcomes despite delayed resection of pheochromocytoma due to COVID-19, but with a persistence of postoperative hypertension. Clinical Case: A 60 year old woman with newly diagnosed breast cancer presented for workup of an adrenal mass found on PET scan. An abdominal contrast CT-scan demonstrated a left 3.2 cm indeterminant adrenal mass. Initial laboratory testing demonstrated positive 24 hour urine metanephrines (metanephrine 951 mcg/24hr, n < 400 mcg/24hr for HTN and normetanephrine 1302 mcg/24hr, n < 900 mcg/24h for HTN) and plasma metanephrines (normetanephrine 826 pg/mL, n < 145 pg/mL and metanephrine 391 pg/mL, n < 62 pgmL), suggestive of pheochromocytoma. An MIBG scintigraphy showed tracer uptake in the left adrenal gland, suspicious for pheochromocytoma. The patient was started on alpha then beta blockade with plan for removal, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, surgery was delayed. In the interim, breast cancer therapy was adjusted to avoid complications or symptoms from the possible pheochromocytoma. The patient had always been asymptomatic, even during the physical and emotional stress of cancer and chemotherapy. She only had a diagnosis of uncontrolled hypertension for four years prior to presentation, treated with Valsartan-Hydrochlorothiazide, with average systolic BP of 140–180, and diastolic BP of 80–100. With the addition of Doxazosin and Metoprolol, the patient’s BP improved, with all readings < 120/90. A left adrenalectomy was performed nearly six months after initial presentation, with final pathology report demonstrating moderately differentiated pheochromocytoma, with clean surgical margins. The patient remained hypertensive for months after the procedure, with initial systolic (SBP) readings of 150–160, and diastolic (DBP) readings of 90–100. However, follow up plasma metanephrine levels were normal (normetanephrine 165 pg/mL n < 191.8 pg/mL and metanephrine 22.1 pg/mL n < 88 pg/mL). The patient was then started on Amlodipine and Valsartan, with most recent SBP readings in the 130s. Conclusion: This case demonstrated a clinically asymptomatic patient with persistent postoperative hypertension and normal plasma metanephrines, which has been demonstrated only in a minority of patients. Additionally, pheochromocytoma needs to be promptly removed if possible; this case demonstrated successful resection and clinical course despite the delay for this urgent surgery due to COVID-19.","Menon, Trisha; Sinha, Avani G",J Endocr Soc,324,26

INTRODUCTION: Controversy remains about the best strategy for STEMI reperfusion during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are no uniform criteria in this setting and it has been proposed that fibrinolysis may be the strategy of choice during lockdown. The aim is to present our experience and safety in maintaining the guidelines based STEMI reperfusion strategy. METHODS AND PURPOSE: Retrospective study comparing patients treated for STEMI during the period of lockdown in Spain (03/15/2020 to 05/31/2020) and patients with STEMI treated in the same period of the previous year (2019). RESULT: We included 73 patients from the pre-COVID period versus 67 patients from the lockdown. Baseline characteristics are showed in table 1. There were no significant differences neither in the choice of reperfusion strategy (fibrinolysis or primary percutaneous coronary intervention) nor in the occurrence of complications. Independently of the reperfusion strategy, there was not a significant increase on reperfusion times (table 1). There were no significant differences in complications during admission. In our experience, PPCI achieved similar in-hospital and 30-day mortality, as compared with fibrinolysis during the COVID-19 lockdown (Image 1). There was not any case of SARS-CoV2 infection among cath lab staff. CONCLUSIONS: To use conventional guidelines based reperfusion strategy of STEMI patients is a safe and effective strategy during the COVID-19 lockdown.","Jimenez Melo, O; Meseguer Gonzalez, D; Linares Vicente, JA; Lukic Otanovic, A; Rio Sanchez, S; Simo Sanchez, B; Gallardo Gallardo, P; Ruiz Fernandez, A; Ruiz Arroyo, JR",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,324,10

Anthocyanins offer nutritional and pharmacological effects, but their stability is poor. Interaction of malvid anthocyanins with caffeic acid through ultrahigh pressure technology produces stable anthocyanin derivatives. This study aims to identify the structure of stable mallow-like anthocyanins and to determine the effect of these stable anthocyanins on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative damage and the signaling pathway involved. The products of malvid anthocyanins and caffeic acid bonding were identified and analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Orbitrap MS/MS). The bonding products were malvidin-3-O-guaiacol (Mv3C), malvidin-3-O-(6″-O-caffeoyl)-glucoside (Mv3CG), and malvidin-3-O-(6″-O-caffeoyl)-5-diglucoside (Mv3C5G). An oxidative stress injury model in HUVECs was established using H(2)O(2) and treated with Mv, Mv3G, Mv35 G, Mv3C, Mv3CG, and Mv3C5G at different concentrations (10, 50, and 100 μmol/L). Results showed that the above compound concentrations can significantly increase cell proliferation rate and reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species at 100 μmol/L. The effects of the most active products Mv and Mv3C on the AMP-activated protein (AMPK)/silencing information regulator-1 (SIRT1) pathway were analyzed. Results showed that Mv and Mv3C significantly increased SOD activity in the cells and significantly upregulated the expression of SIRT1 mRNA, SIRT1, and p-AMPK protein. However, they did not significantly change the expression of AMPK protein. After the silent intervention of siRNA in SIRT1 gene expression, the upregulation of SIRT1 and p-AMPK protein by Mv and Mv3C was significantly inhibited. These results indicate that stabilization malvid anthocyanins exerts an antioxidant activity via the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway.","Zheng, Fei; Xue, Hai; Wang, Bi-Xiang; Wu, Man-Yu; Chen, Dong-Xia; Yue, Hao; Wen, Lian-Kui; He, Yang",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,324,5

Business as usual projections suggest that the intended target will be achieved no sooner than 2029. The lower lifetime of polycrystalline PV modules combined with their lower efficiency is found to severely downgrade their environmental performance vis-à-vis monocrystalline PV modules. The end-of-life treatment of the projected 6,576 tonnes of solar PV waste, expected to be accumulated between 2034-59, indicates a recovery rate of 90.7% entailing electricity consumption, GHG emissions, and monetary cost of 678.6 MWh, 648 tonnes of CO2 eq., and USD 11.8 billion, respectively. Simultaneously, the recovery of aluminum and glass alone leads to a direct saving of 70.3 GWh of energy by eliminating raw material extraction and processing. Further, the economic value of the recovered material at USD 11.74 billion is found to have the potential to generate additional solar capacity worth 19 GW. However, making the end-of-life treatment of PV waste financially feasible would require government subsidization. A minimum amount that would equate the costs to the benefits is USD 690/MW. The study, therefore, intends to inform potential stakeholders about the environmental burden as well as the economic potential of the impending PV waste and concludes with important policy prescriptions for enabling a sustainable energy transition through the circular economy approach.","Prabhu, Vishnu S; Shrivastava, Shraddha; Mukhopadhyay, Kakali",Circ.Econ.Sust.,324,4

The hostile measures, which have included detentions, pushbacks and other refugee deterrence actions not only appeared to shake the refugee system, but they increased the vulnerability of asylum seekers and refugees who continued to be exposed to torture, drownings at sea, trafficking and sexual violence. This development, which included a fine-tuning of some measures that had been hatched before the emergence of COVID-19, appeared to set back efforts to nurture the bonds of global human solidarity and expand moral and ethical boundaries beyond state borders. However, the international refugee regime continues and is supported by many states and other international actors that seek to emphasise cosmopolitan and other-regarding policies.

STUDY DESIGN Continuous hemodynamic data, including heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (MBP), cardiac output by electrical velocimetry (COEV), arterial oxygen saturation, and renal (RrSO2) and cerebral (CrSO2) regional tissue oxygen saturation, were collected from 4 hours before the start of rewarming to 1 hour after the completion of rewarming. Serial echocardiography and transcranial Doppler were performed at 3 hours and 1 hour before the start of rewarming (T-3 and T-1; ""baseline"") and at 2, 4, and 7 hours after the start of rewarming (T+2, T+4, and T+7; ""rewarming"") to determine Cardiac output by echocardiography (COecho), stroke volume, fractional shortening, and middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow velocity indices. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Twenty infants with HIE were enrolled (mean gestational age, 38.8 ± 2 weeks; mean birth weight, 3346 ± 695 g). During rewarming, HR, COecho, and COEV increased from baseline to T+7, and MBP decreased. Despite an increase in fractional shortening, stroke volume remained unchanged. RrSO2 increased, and renal fractional oxygen extraction (FOE) decreased. MCA peak systolic flow velocity increased. There were no changes in CrSO2 or cerebral FOE. CONCLUSIONS In neonates with HIE, CO significantly increases throughout rewarming. This is due to an increase in HR rather than stroke volume and is associated with an increase in renal blood flow. The lack of change in cerebral tissue oxygen saturation and extraction, in conjunction with an increase in MCA peak systolic velocity, suggests that cerebral flow metabolism coupling remained intact during rewarming.","Wu, Tai-Wei; Tamrazi, Benita; Soleymani, Sadaf; Seri, Istvan; Noori, Shahab",The Journal of pediatrics,324,1

We present and discuss the adverse effects observed in an acute psychiatric clinic that has admitted COVID-19 patients during the first three months of the pandemic in Turkey. METHODS The COVID-19 treatment schemes were formed in accordance with the national and regional guidelines at the time of admittance, which were mainly based on the use of hydroxychloroquine and other drugs. The sample consisted exclusively of inpatients, and all patients were enrolled in the study regardless of their specific diagnosis or treatment schemes. RESULTS 4 out of 23 patients (17.4%) had experienced adverse effects, two of which had mild hepatic enzyme elevation and one had mild sinus bradycardia. Of note is that we haven't encountered any serious complications or life-threatening events during inpatient treatment. The most emphasised adverse effect in the literature, namely QTc prolongation and ECG changes, were not observed in our sample. The adverse effects were not found to be significantly associated with patient-related factors nor dose of antipsychotic medication. CONCLUSIONS From our point of view, non-cardiac adverse effects should not be overlooked while treating comorbid psychiatric and COVID-19 patients. KEY POINTS Acute inpatient psychiatric treatment of patients who have comorbid COVID-19 is a complex situation requiring multidisciplinary action. Adverse drug reactions, which may or not result from the interaction of psychiatric and COVID-19 treatment, should be of concern for this patient group. While there is controversy over the benefits of some of the off-label COVID-19 medications, there should also be discussion over safety and concomitant medication use. In order to be adequately prepared for future escalations of COVID-19 pandemic, psychiatric services should thoroughly evaluate their initial experience with COVID-19, including from the point of drug effectiveness and safety.","Sönmez Güngör, Ekin; Yalçın, Murat; Yerebakan Tüzer, Melike; Beşikçi Keleş, Didem; Öcek Baş, Tuba; Ergelen, Mine; Bülbül, Alper; Kırşavoğlu, Betül; Güneş, Mustafa",International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice,324,1

While there is growing interest in using cheaters as antiviral therapeutics, the mechanisms underlying cheating have been rarely explored. During experimental evolution of MS2 phage, we observed the parallel emergence of two independent cheater mutants. The first, a point deletion mutant, lacked polymerase activity but was advantageous in viral packaging. The second synonymous mutant cheater displayed a completely different cheating mechanism, involving an altered RNA structure. Continued evolution revealed the demise of the deletion cheater and rise of the synonymous cheater. A mathematical model inferred that while a single cheater is expected to reach an equilibrium with the wild type, cheater demise arises from antagonistic interactions between coinfecting cheaters. These findings highlight layers of parasitism: viruses parasitizing cells, cheaters parasitizing intact viruses, and cheaters may parasitize other cheaters.","Meir, Moran; Harel, Noam; Miller, Danielle; Gelbart, Maoz; Eldar, Avigdor; Gophna, Uri; Stern, Adi",Science advances,324,33

METHODS Parents of 213 Australian children (5-17 years) with ADHD completed a survey in May 2020 when COVID-19 restrictions were in place (i.e., requiring citizens to stay at home except for essential reasons). RESULTS Compared to pre-pandemic, children had less exercise (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.4; 95% CI 0.3-0.6), less outdoor time (OR = 0.4; 95% 0.3-0.6), and less enjoyment in activities (OR = 6.5; 95% CI 4.0-10.4), while television (OR = 4.0; 95% CI 2.5-6.5), social media (OR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.3-4.5), gaming (OR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.3-3.0), sad/depressed mood (OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.2-2.8), and loneliness (OR = 3.6; 95% CI 2.3-5.5) were increased. Child stress about COVID-19 restrictions was associated with poorer functioning across most domains. Most parents (64%) reported positive changes for their child including more family time.

An imbalance of vasculogenic/angiogenic mechanisms has been proposed as one possible disease aspect. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (cEPCs) have been hypothesized to contribute to vascular remodeling of MA, but it remains unclear whether they might be considered a disease effect or have a role in disease pathogenesis. The aim of the present study was to provide a morphological, phenotypical, and functional characterization of the cEPCs from MA patients to uncover their role in the disease pathophysiology. cEPCs were identified from whole blood as CD45dimCD34+CD133+ mononuclear cells. Morphological, biochemical, and functional assays were performed to characterize cEPCs. A significant reduced level of cEPCs was found in blood samples collected from a homogeneous group of adult (mean age 46.86 ± 11.7; 86.36% females), Caucasian, non-operated MA patients with respect to healthy donors (HD; p = 0.032). Since no difference in cEPC characteristics and functionality was observed between MA patients and HD, a defective recruitment mechanism could be involved in the disease pathophysiology. Collectively, our results suggest that cEPC level more than endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) functionality seems to be a potential marker of MA. The validation of our results on a larger population and the correlation with clinical data as well as the use of more complex cellular model could help our understanding of EPC role in MA pathophysiology.","Tinelli, Francesca; Nava, Sara; Arioli, Francesco; Bedini, Gloria; Scelzo, Emma; Lisini, Daniela; Faragò, Giuseppe; Gioppo, Andrea; Ciceri, Elisa F; Acerbi, Francesco; Ferroli, Paolo; Vetrano, Ignazio G; Esposito, Silvia; Saletti, Veronica; Pantaleoni, Chiara; Zibordi, Federica; Nardocci, Nardo; Zedde, Maria Luisa; Pezzini, Alessandro; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo; Capone, Fioravante; Dell'Acqua, Maria Luisa; Vajkoczy, Peter; Tournier-Lasserve, Elisabeth; Parati, Eugenio A; Bersano, Anna; Gatti, Laura",International journal of molecular sciences,324,8

Kids Helpline, Australia's national youth helpline, provides children and young people with free 24/7 information and counseling through telephone, WebChat, and e-mail. We aimed to examine the use of Kids Helpline during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We analyzed monthly and weekly time trends of demand for and response by the Kids Helpline. The frequency of counseling contacts by common concern types, age, and gender were also examined. We used Joinpoint regression. RESULTS Analyses of weekly demand for Kids Helpline showed an increase when the pandemic was declared, followed by a gradual decline. A second rise from 12 July 2020 when parts of Australia experienced a second wave of infections, followed by another decline, occurred more recently. Increased demand was almost entirely in the WebChat modality. Most answered counseling contacts were from girls and those aged 13-18 years. The number of contacts about mental health, suicide/self-harm, and family relationships increased, with mental health contacts also increasing as a proportion of total contacts. COVID-19-related concerns were the most common reason for contact in April 2020. CONCLUSIONS In Australia, the COVID-19 pandemic saw a rapid increase in demand for Kids Helpline, mainly by WebChat, with the virus itself, mental health, suicide/self-harm, and relationships common reasons for contact. Responding to rapid changes in demand for particular modalities is challenging and understanding of the use and effectiveness of different modalities is needed.","Batchelor, Samantha; Stoyanov, Stoyan; Pirkis, Jane; Kõlves, Kairi",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,324,20

METHODS Ninety-one volunteer employees from our center who participated in the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccination campaign were prospectively recruited. A total of three axillary ultrasound evaluations of the ipsilateral vaccinated arm were performed: before vaccination, the week after the first dose and the week after the second dose. The following findings were recorded: the total number of visible nodes, the maximum measurements of the diameter and cortex, Bedi's classification, and color Doppler evaluation. The collected data were compared using paired-sample Student's t-test for quantitative continuous variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for ordinal variables. Additional analyses were performed after classifying patients according to the previous history of COVID-19 disease. Differences among both groups were evaluated with the Mann-Whitney U test. Variables with a p value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS Comparative analyses between the three US examinations showed a statistically significant augmentation of total visible nodes, maximum diameter, cortical thickness, grade of Bedi's classification, and Doppler signal (p < 0.001). Analyses between patients with and without previous COVID-19 infection showed a higher lymph node response in naïve patients compared to those who were previously infected. CONCLUSIONS According to our results, both doses of COVID-19 vaccine induced an increase of all axillary lymph node parameters with statistically significant differences, especially in coronavirus-naïve patients.

However, a case has been made for the involvement of the noradrenergic system, which modulates cognitive processes, such as arousal, working memory, and response inhibition, all of which are typically affected in ADHD. Furthermore, the norepinephrine transporter (NET) is an important target for frequently prescribed medication in ADHD. Therefore, the NET is suggested to play a critical role in ADHD. OBJECTIVE To explore the differences in NET nondisplaceable binding potential (NET BPND) using positron emission tomography and the highly selective radioligand (S,S)-[18F]FMeNER-D2 [(S,S)-2-(α-(2-[18F]fluoro[2H2]methoxyphenoxy)benzyl)morpholine] between adults with ADHD and healthy volunteers serving as controls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twenty-two medication-free patients with ADHD (mean [SD] age, 30.7 [10.4] years; 15 [68%] men) without psychiatric comorbidities and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (30.9 [10.6] years; 15 [68%] men) underwent positron emission tomography once. A linear mixed model was used to compare NET BPND between groups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The NET BPND in selected regions of interest relevant for ADHD, including the hippocampus, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, midbrain with pons (comprising a region of interest that includes the locus coeruleus), and cerebellum. In addition, the NET BPND was evaluated in thalamic subnuclei (13 atlas-based regions of interest). RESULTS We found no significant differences in NET availability or regional distribution between patients with ADHD and healthy controls in all investigated brain regions (F1,41<0.01; P=.96). Furthermore, we identified no significant association between ADHD symptom severity and regional NET availability. Neither sex nor smoking status influenced NET availability. We determined a significant negative correlation between age and NET availability in the thalamus (R2=0.29; P<.01 corrected) and midbrain with pons, including the locus coeruleus (R2=0.18; P<.01 corrected), which corroborates prior findings of a decrease in NET availability with aging in the human brain. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results do not indicate involvement of changes in brain NET availability or distribution in the pathogenesis of ADHD. However, the noradrenergic transmitter system may be affected on a different level, such as in cortical regions, which cannot be reliably quantified with this positron emission tomography ligand. Alternatively, different key proteins of noradrenergic neurotransmission might be affected.","Vanicek, Thomas; Spies, Marie; Rami-Mark, Christina; Savli, Markus; Höflich, Anna; Kranz, Georg S; Hahn, Andreas; Kutzelnigg, Alexandra; Traub-Weidinger, Tatjana; Mitterhauser, Markus; Wadsak, Wolfgang; Hacker, Marcus; Volkow, Nora D; Kasper, Siegfried; Lanzenberger, Rupert",JAMA psychiatry,324,5

The larger the lateral trocar, the greater the risk of pain, complications and delayed recovery. Here, we assumed that adnexal mass removal through a 10-mm umbilical port together with 5-mm side trocars would decrease the postoperative need of analgesics when compared with removal through a 10-mm lateral abdominal port. STUDY DESIGN Women scheduled for laparoscopic surgery of a benign adnexal mass were invited to participate. The participants were randomized into two groups: removal via the transumbilical (TU) (n=21) or lateral transabdominal (TA) (n=21) route. General anesthesia and use of local anesthetics were standardized. The amount of postoperative opioid (oxycodone) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain were the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures were nausea/vomiting (VAS evaluation), time to discharge, peri- and postoperative complications, surgeons' opinions of the alternative methods and patients' satisfaction, evaluated via a questionnaire sent six months postoperatively. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the use of opioids or median pain-VAS scores between the groups during the first 24h postoperatively. However, in the TU group the amount of women with very low pain-VAS scores (0-1) during the whole 12-h follow-up time was significantly greater than in the TA group (4 vs. 0 women p=0.04). The amounts of nausea and vomiting, and median times to discharge were similar in both groups. There were no major complications. CONCLUSIONS Both transumbilical and transabdominal routes of abdominal mass removal during laparoscopy were feasible and safe. However, the transumbilical route resulted in more women with very low pain-VAS scores.","Kilpiö, Olga; Härkki, Päivi S M; Mentula, Maarit J; Jokela, Ritva M; Pakarinen, Päivi I","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",324,19

As well as respiratory failure, the SARS-CoV-2 may cause central nervous system (CNS) involvement, including delirium occurring in critically ill patients (ICU delirium). Due attention must be paid to this subject in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Delirium, the detection of which takes less than two minutes, is frequently underestimated during daily routine ICU care, but it may be a prodromal symptom of infection or hypoxia associated with severe respiratory failure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, systematic delirium monitoring using validated tests (CAM-ICU or ICDSC) may be sacrificed. This is likely to be due to the fact that the main emphasis is placed on organisational issues, i.e. the lack of ventilators, setting priorities for limited mechanical ventilation options, and a shortage of personal protective equipment. Early identification of patients with delirium is critical in patients with COVID-19 because the occurrence of delirium may be an early symptom of worsening respiratory failure or of infectious spread to the CNS mediated by potential neuroinvasive mechanisms of the coronavirus. The purpose of this review is to identify problems related to the development of delirium during the COVID-19 epidemic, which are presented in three areas: i) factors contributing to delirium in COVID-19, ii) potential pathophysiological factors of delirium in COVID-19, and iii) long-term consequences of delirium in COVID-19.

In Canada, it is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy to reduce mortality for heart failure patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II systolic chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. It is also used as adjunctive therapy for patients with heart failure following myocardial infarction. Additionally, it is indicated for the treatment of mild and moderate essential hypertension for patients who cannot be treated adequately with other agents. It is important to determine the clinical impact of all antihypertensive medications, including aldosterone antagonists, to support their continued use in essential hypertension. No previous systematic reviews have evaluated the effect of eplerenone on cardiovascular morbidity, mortality, and magnitude of blood pressure lowering in patients with hypertension. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of eplerenone monotherapy versus placebo for primary hypertension in adults. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular events (fatal or non fatal strokes), adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 3 March 2016. We handsearched references from retrieved studies to identify any studies missed in the initial search. We also searched for unpublished data by contacting the corresponding authors of the included studies and pharmaceutical companies involved in conducting studies on eplerenone monotherapy in primary hypertension. The search had no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA We selected randomized placebo-controlled trials studying adult patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies in people with secondary or gestational hypertension and studies where participants were receiving multiple antihypertensives. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Three review authors independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standardized data extraction form. A fourth independent review author resolved discrepancies or disagreements. We performed data extraction and synthesis using a standardized format on Covidence. We conducted data analysis using Review Manager 5. MAIN RESULTS A total of 1437 adult patients participated in the five randomized parallel group studies, with treatment durations ranging from 8 to 16 weeks. The daily doses of eplerenone ranged from 25 mg to 400 mg daily. Meta-analysis of these studies showed a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 9.21 mmHg (95% CI -11.08 to -7.34; I2 = 58%) and a reduction of diastolic pressure of 4.18 mmHg (95% CI -5.03 to -3.33; I2 = 0%) (moderate quality evidence).There may be a dose response effect for eplerenone in the reduction in systolic blood pressure at doses of 400 mg/day. However, this finding is uncertain, as it is based on a single included study with low quality evidence. Overall there does not appear to be a clinically important dose response in lowering systolic or diastolic blood pressure at eplerenone doses of 50 mg to 400 mg daily. There did not appear to be any differences in the number of patients who withdrew due to adverse events or the number of patients with at least one adverse event in the eplerenone group compared to placebo. However, only three of the five included studies reported adverse events. Most of the included studies were of moderate quality, as we judged multiple domains as being at unclear risk in the 'Risk of bias' assessment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Eplerenone 50 to 200 mg/day lowers blood pressure in people with primary hypertension by 9.21 mmHg systolic and 4.18 mmHg diastolic compared to placebo, with no difference of effect between doses of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. A dose of 25 mg/day did not produce a statistically significant reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure and there is insufficient evidence for doses above 200 mg/day. There is currently no available evidence to determine the effect of eplerenone on clinically meaningful outcomes such as mortality or morbidity in hypertensive patients. The evidence available on side effects is insufficient and of low quality, which makes it impossible to draw conclusions about potential harm associated with eplerenone treatment in hypertensive patients.","Tam, Tina Sc; Wu, May Hy; Masson, Sarah C; Tsang, Matthew P; Stabler, Sarah N; Kinkade, Angus; Tung, Anthony; Tejani, Aaron M",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,324,12

Treatment is typically directed towards reducing acid reflux despite the surgical removal of parietal cell mass. In contrast, laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) has been known to reduce or resolve preoperative reflux symptoms. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of preoperative and postoperative reflux of LSG and LRYGB patients, and review reflux treatment type and response. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed for patients undergoing either LSG or LRYGB between January 2010 and December 2012 as part of the Weight Wise program, Royal Alexandra Hospital, Edmonton, Canada. RESULTS A total of 387 cases were included in our review. We observed a significant reduction in BMI postoperatively for both LSG and LRYGB groups (p < 0.001). Between surgical groups, preoperative proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use was not significantly different; however, at 1 month (p < 0.05) to 1-2 years (p < 0.001), there was significantly increased PPI use in patients after LSG in comparison to LRYGB. Of the LSG patients that continued their PPI treatment after surgery, 58% increased, 42% continued the same, and 0% decreased their dose 1 year after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Reflux symptoms are significantly increased after LSG in comparison to LRYGB patients. In addition, LSG patients more frequently require initiation of reflux treatment after surgery than that of LRYGB patients.

By mimicking a natural mechanism of complement regulation, the small peptide compstatin has proven to be a very promising complement inhibitor. Over the years, several compstatin analogs have been created, with improved inhibitory potency. A recent analog is being developed as a candidate drug against several pathological conditions, including COVID-19. However, the reasons behind its higher potency and increased binding affinity to complement proteins are not fully clear. This computational study highlights the mechanistic properties of several compstatin analogs, thus complementing previous experimental studies. We perform molecular dynamics simulations involving six analogs alone in solution and two complexes with compstatin bound to complement component 3. These simulations reveal that all the analogs we consider, except the original compstatin, naturally adopt a pre-bound conformation in solution. Interestingly, this set of analogs adopting a pre-bound conformation includes analogs that were not known to benefit from this behavior. We also show that the most recent compstatin analog (among those we consider) forms a stronger hydrogen bond network with its complement receptor than an earlier analog.","Devaurs, Didier; Antunes, Dinler A; Kavraki, Lydia E",Journal of molecular modeling,324,8

The continued preponderance of neuromyths among educators is of concern, especially in lower- and middle-income countries. METHOD Using an adapted questionnaire, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among teachers in a small island developing state in the Caribbean. RESULTS Two-thirds of the sample were unable to recognise at least 50% of the myths. Regression analysis demonstrated that higher scores in brain knowledge and exposure to prior teacher-training increased belief in neuromyths. On the other hand, specific in-service training pertaining to educational neuroscience improved scores. CONCLUSION Neuromyths are prevalent among teachers and appear to inform their teaching practice. Further research needs to be conducted to explore not just the prevalence of these myths but in what ways they may be impacting teaching and learning outcomes in the classroom.","Bissessar, Satyavi; Youssef, Farid F",Trends in neuroscience and education,324,1

STUDY DESIGN Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Department of Radiology, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong, China, from January to April, 2020. METHODOLOGY CT scan images were analysed retrospectively. The main CT findings, including pulmonary opacities, airway wall visibility, wall thickening, luminal changes, and the formation of mucus plugs were evaluated. Airway segments were classified into three types based on the spatial relationship between conducting airways and pulmonary opacities. RESULTS A total of 275 lesions were detected in 52 patients. Of these, 170 (61.82%) lesions were associated with 243 airway segments, including segments enclosed within lesions (type I, 152, 62.55%), crossing the lesions (type II, 51, 20.99%), and abutting the lesions (type III, 40, 16.46%). The bronchial walls of 154 (63.37%) segments were ill-defined; whereas, the walls of 89 (36.63%) segments were well-defined; in the latter group, 62 (69.66%) showed mild thickening. The bronchial lumen of 183 (75.31%) segments presented mild bronchiectasis and 60 (24.69%) segments appeared normal. Mucus plug was detected in one segment (0.41%). There were no cases of bronchial stenosis, and all bronchial segments located in normal lung regions appeared normal. The appearance of 196 (80.66%) affected bronchi was completely restored before hospital discharge. CONCLUSION Typical airway changes in adult COVID-19 pneumonia include bronchial wall thickening without significant stenosis of the airway lumen and the absence of bronchial mucus plugs. Moreover, bronchi located in unaffected lung regions have a normal appearance. These characteristics have potential value in differential diagnosis.

Community pharmacy and public health agencies can establish memoranda of understanding (MOUs) for dispensing and administering medical countermeasures and providing related services to affected population(s) during a public health incident. OBJECTIVE The objective of this facilitated discussion exercise was to identify the strengths and opportunities associated with the activation of a statewide pharmacy-public health agencies MOU with community pharmacists on the basis of a simulated pandemic influenza event. METHODS A facilitated discussion exercise was held in the Puget Sound region of the State of Washington in May 2017. The participants included pharmacists from 2 community pharmacy organizations, emergency preparedness officials from 2 local health departments and the state health department, staff of the state pharmacy association, and faculty from a school of pharmacy. The evaluators recorded the discussions and observations, augmented by a postexercise telephone call with participants from each of the participating community pharmacy organizations. Key themes from the exercise are reported. RESULTS Five themes were identified during the facilitated discussion exercise. Two themes described the strengths of the MOU and its operational plan: (1) collaboration strengthens preparedness and response planning, and (2) an MOU provides a framework for effective collaboration. Three themes acknowledged the opportunities to optimize activation of the existing MOU: (1) early and active engagement between health department personnel and community pharmacists, (2) establishing pharmacy policies and procedures to support readiness and response, and (3) addressing the training or other educational needs of community pharmacists. CONCLUSION This exercise provided community pharmacists and public health agency personnel an opportunity to better plan for responding to a pandemic. The open dialogue in this facilitated discussion allowed the exercise participants to identify the strengths, priorities, and perspectives as well as the gaps in the MOU operational plan. The lessons learned in this exercise can inform the community pharmacy and public health response to the coronavirus disease pandemic.","Bacci, Jennifer L; Odegard, Peggy; Arnold, Jenny; Stergachis, Andy",Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA,324,9

However, it is still unclear if the elderly patients with malignant liver tumors would also benefit from that approach as the younger patients. So, the aim of the study was to compare the clinical outcomes of laparoscopic versus open liver resection for malignant liver tumors in elderly patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between March 2009 and July 2016, all elderly patients (≥70 years old) who underwent laparoscopic (n = 40) and open (n = 202) liver resection for malignant liver tumors were included. A one to one propensity score matching analysis was performed, based on 6 covariates, to decrease the selection bias. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the laparoscopic and open liver resection groups regarding the patient characteristics and tumor features. The operative time was comparable between both groups (Laparoscopic group 259 min vs Open group 308 min, p = .86), while patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection had lower intraoperative blood loss (30 ml vs 517 ml, p < .0001), shorter hospital stays (10 days vs 23 days, p < .0001), and less overall morbidity (15% vs 38%, p = .04). The one-, three-, and five-year survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was comparable between both groups (Laparoscopic group 96%, 74%, 47%, vs Open group 94%, 71%, 48%, p = .82), whereas The one-, three-, and five-year recurrence-free survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was significantly higher in the laparoscopic group (88%, 60%, 60% vs 54%, 25%, 19%, p = .019). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic approach for minor liver resection in elderly patients is safe and feasible with less blood loss, a shorter hospital stay, less postoperative complications and a better oncological outcome.","Badawy, Amr; Seo, Satoru; Toda, Rei; Fuji, Hiroaki; Fukumitsu, Ken; Ishii, Takamichi; Taura, Kojiro; Kaido, Toshimi; Uemoto, Shinji",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,324,1

Time-based capnography, which is our focus, is a point-of-care, noninvasive, effort-independent and widely available clinical monitoring modality. The generated waveform, or capnogram, reflects the ventilation-perfusion dynamics of the lung, and thus has value in the diagnosis of respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Effective discrimination between normal respiration and obstructive lung disease can be performed using capnogram-derived estimates of respiratory parameters in a simple mechanistic model of CO2 exhalation. We propose an enhanced mechanistic model that can capture specific capnogram characteristics in congestive heart failure (CHF) by incorporating a representation of the inertance associated with fluid in the lungs. The 4 associated parameters are estimated on a breath-by-breath basis by fitting the model output to the exhalations in the measured capnogram. Estimated parameters from 40 exhalations of 7 CHF and 7 COPD patients were used as a training set to design a quadratic discriminator in the parameter space, aimed at distinguishing between CHF and COPD patients. The area under the ROC curve for the training set was 0.94, and the corresponding equal-error-rate value of approximately 0.1 suggests classification accuracies of the order of 90% are attainable. Applying this discriminator without modification to 40 exhalations from each CHF and COPD patient in a fresh test set, and deciding on a simple majority basis whether the patient has CHF or COPD, results in correctly labeling all 8 out of the 8 CHF patients and 6 out of the 8 COPD patients in the test set, corresponding to a classification accuracy of 87.5%.","Karasan, Ekin; Abid, Abubakar; Mieloszyk, Rebecca J; Krauss, Baruch S; Heldt, Thomas; Verghese, George C",Conference proceedings : ...

Separation often involves manual subdivision of these two similarly radio-opaque compartments, which can be time-consuming and subjective. We have developed an objective, semi-automated protocol which reduces user bias and enables straightforward, user-friendly segmentation of trabecular from the cortical bone without requiring sophisticated programming expertise. This method can conveniently be used as a 'recipe' in commercial programmes (Avizo herein) and applied to a variety of datasets. Here, we characterize and share this recipe, and demonstrate its application to a range of murine and human bone types, including normal and osteoarthritic specimens, and bones with distinct embryonic origins and spanning a range of ages. We validate the method by testing inter-user bias during the scan preparation steps and confirm utility in the architecturally challenging analysis of growing murine epiphyses. We also report details of the recipe, so that other groups can readily re-create a similar method in open access programmes. Our aim is that this method will be adopted widely to create a reproducible and time-efficient method of segmenting trabecular and cortical bone.","Herbst, Eva C; Felder, Alessandro A; Evans, Lucinda A E; Ajami, Sara; Javaheri, Behzad; Pitsillides, Andrew A",Royal Society open science,324,1

In this context, the interplay between platelets and innate immune cells has been intensively investigated. The ATP-gated P2X1 ion channel, expressed on both platelets and neutrophils is of particular interest. On platelets, this ion channel contributes to platelet activation and thrombosis, especially under high shear stress conditions of small arteries, whereas on neutrophils, it is involved in chemotaxis and in mitigating the activation of circulating cells. In vitro studies indicate that it may also be implicated in platelet-dependent immune responses during bacterial infection. More recently, in a mouse model of intestinal epithelial barrier disruption causing systemic inflammation, it has been reported that neutrophil P2X1 ion channel could play a protective role against exaggerated inflammation-associated thrombosis. This review will focus on this unique role of the ATP-gated P2X1 ion channel in thromboinflammation, highlighting possible implications and pointing to the need for further investigation of the role of P2X1 ion channels in the interplay between platelets and neutrophils during thrombus formation under various sterile or infectious inflammatory settings and in distinct vascular beds.","Oury, Cécile; Wéra, Odile",Platelets,324,1

The terrain is, on the one hand, vast and diverse. On the other hand, under the banner of universal health coverage (UHC) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a streamlined version of 'community health' is increasingly being consolidated in global health and donor communities. With the view to informing debate and practice, this paper seeks to synthesise approaches to the CHS into a set of 'lenses,' drawing on the collective and multi-disciplinary knowledge (both formal and experiential) of the authors, a collaborative network of 23 researchers from seven institutions across six countries (spanning low, middle and high income). With a common view of the CHS as a complex adaptive system, we propose four key lenses, referred to as programmatic, relational, collective action and critical lenses. The lenses represent different positionalities in community health, encompassing macro-level policy-maker, front-line and community vantage points, and purposes ranging from social justice to instrumental goals. We define and describe the main elements of each lens and their implications for thinking about policy, practice and research. Distilling a set of key lenses offers a way to make sense of a complex terrain, but also counters what may emerge as a dominant, single narrative on the CHS in global health. By making explicit and bringing together different lenses on the CHS, the limits and possibilities of each may be better appreciated, while promoting integrative, systems thinking in policy, practice and research.","Schneider, Helen; Olivier, Jill; Orgill, Marsha; Brady, Leanne; Whyle, Eleanor; Zulu, Joseph; Sebastian, Miguel San; George, Asha",International journal of health policy and management,324,1

We aim to present our results of video-endoscopic tension-free repair of groin hernias via the total extraperitoneal (TEP) approach. Methods Between September 2016 and December 2018, 124 patients with groin hernias underwent tension-free repair using prolene mesh by video-endoscopic surgery via the TEP approach. This is a retrospective analysis of 110 (88.7%) male and 14 (11.3%) female patients with a mean age of 48.1 years. Groin hernia types, locations of hernias, intraoperative and postoperative complications, results of the mean 24-month follow-up, and recurrence rate were reported. Results A total of 134 hernias were repaired in 124 patients who had 53 (42.7%) right, 61 (49.2%) left, and 10 (8.1%) bilateral groin hernias. The most common hernia type was an indirect inguinal hernia in 83/134 (62%) groin hernias. A total of 119 (88.8%) and 15 (11.2%) hernias were primary and recurrent, respectively. Seroma was detected in two (1.6%) patients in the early postoperative period. The mean duration of hospital stay was 1.4 (1-3) days. During the follow-up period, hernia recurrence was determined in three (2.4%) patients. Hernia recurrence was detected among patients who were operated on during the first half of the study. Conclusion Tension-free repair of groin hernias by video-endoscopic technique via the TEP approach can be performed with very low complication and recurrence rates. The success of the TEP approach increases parallel to increasing surgical experience. The results of hernia repair via the TEP approach are highly satisfactory and encouraging, especially when attention is paid to proper patient selection during the learning curve period.","Dogan, Sami; Gurleyik, Emin",Cureus,324,1

Exposure therapy is the gold-standard treatment for PTSD, and fear extinction learning is a key concept underlying successful exposure. METHODS This study examined the role of genetic endocannabinoid polymorphisms in a fear extinction paradigm with PTSD compared to healthy participants (N = 220). Participants provided saliva for genotyping, completed a fear conditioning and extinction task, with blood samples taken before and after the task (n = 57). Skin conductance was the outcome and was analyzed using mixed models. RESULTS Results for cannabinoid receptor type 1 polymorphisms suggested that minor alleles of rs2180619 and rs1049353 were associated with poorer extinction learning in PTSD participants. The minor allele of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) polymorphism rs324420 was associated with worse extinction in PTSD participants. Subanalysis of healthy participants (n = 57) showed the FAAH rs324420 genotype effect was dependent on plasma arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA) level, but not oleoylethanolamide or 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. Specifically, higher but not lower AEA levels in conjunction with the minor allele of FAAH rs324420 were associated with better extinction learning. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide translational evidence that cannabinoid receptor 1 and AEA are involved in extinction learning in humans. FAAH rs324420's effect on fear extinction is moderated by AEA plasma level in healthy controls. These findings imply that FAAH inhibitors may be effective for targeting anxiety in PTSD, but this effect needs to be explored further in clinical populations.","Ney, Luke J; Matthews, Allison; Hsu, Chia-Ming Ken; Zuj, Daniel V; Nicholson, Emma; Steward, Trevor; Nichols, David; Graham, Bronwyn; Harrison, Ben; Bruno, Raimondo; Felmingham, Kim",Depression and anxiety,324,15

In this scenario, evidence now suggests that epigenetics shapes endocrine functions, linking genetics and environment. During fertilization, spermatozoa share with the oocyte their epigenome, along with their haploid genome, in order to orchestrate embryo development. The epigenetic signature of spermatozoa is the result of a dynamic modulation of the epigenetic marks occurring, firstly, in the testis-during germ cell progression-then, along the epididymis, where spermatozoa still receive molecules, conveyed by epididymosomes. Paternal lifestyle, including nutrition and exposure to hazardous substances, alters the phenotype of the next generations, through the remodeling of a sperm epigenetic blueprint that dynamically reacts to a wide range of environmental and lifestyle stressors. With that in mind, this review will summarize and discuss insights into germline epigenetic plasticity caused by environmental stimuli and diet and how spermatozoa may be carriers of induced epimutations across generations through a mechanism known as paternal transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.","Cescon, Matilde; Chianese, Rosanna; Tavares, Renata S",Journal of clinical medicine,324,20

In this study, we aimed to develop a column that effectively adsorbs high-mobility-group box chromosomal protein 1 by altering the pore size of the fiber. MATERIALS AND METHODS First, we produced three types of porous polymethylmethacrylate fiber by altering the concentration of polymethylmethacrylate dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. We then selected a fiber based on the results of an in vitro incubation test of high-mobility-group box chromosomal protein 1 adsorption. Using the selected fiber, we constructed a new column and tested its high-mobility-group box chromosomal protein 1 adsorption capacity during 4-h extracorporeal hemoperfusion in a swine acute liver failure model. RESULTS Electron microscope observation showed that the three types of fibers had different pore sizes on the surface and in cross section, which were dependent on the concentration of polymethylmethacrylate. In the in vitro incubation test, fiber with moderate-sized pores demonstrated the highest adsorption capacity. In the in vivo hemoperfusion study, the ratio of the high-mobility-group box chromosomal protein 1 concentration at the outlet versus the inlet of the column was significantly lower with the new column than with the control column during 4-h extracorporeal hemoperfusion. The normalized plasma level of high-mobility-group box chromosomal protein 1 at 12 h after the completion of hemoperfusion was significantly lower with the new column than with the control column.

Since containment measures have disrupted many data collection and research efforts, studies have had to rely on existing data or design new approaches to gathering relevant information. OBJECTIVE This article reviews the literature that has been produced on children's exposure to violence during the pandemic to understand emerging patterns and critically appraise methodologies to help inform the design of future studies. The article concludes with recommendations for future research. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING The study entailed a search of working papers, technical reports, and journal articles. METHODS The search used a combination of search terms to identify relevant articles and reports published between March 1 and December 31, 2020. The sources were assessed according to scope and study design. RESULTS The review identified 48 recent working papers, technical reports, and journal articles on the impact of COVID-19 on violence against children. In terms of scope and methods, the review led to three main findings: 1) Studies have focused on physical or psychological violence at home and less attention has been paid to other forms of violence against children, 2) most studies have relied on administrative records, while other data sources, such as surveys or big data, were less commonly employed, and 3) different definitions and study designs were used to gather data directly, resulting in findings that are hardly generalizable. With respect to children's experience of violence, the review led to four main findings: 1) Studies found a decrease in police reports and referrals to child protective services, 2) mixed results were found with respect to the number of calls to police or domestic violence helplines, 3) articles showed an increase in child abuse-related injuries treated in hospitals, and 4) surveys reported an increase in family violence. CONCLUSIONS This review underscores the persistent challenges affecting the availability and quality of data on violence against children, including the absence of standards for measuring this sensitive issue as well as the limited availability of baseline data. Future research on COVID-19 and violence against children should address some of the gaps identified in this review.","Cappa, Claudia; Jijon, Isabel",Child abuse & neglect,324,1

To assess the safety and efficacy of PegIFNalfa-2a in combination with an adjusted (ADJ) RBV dose based on early pharmacokinetics versus a fixed standard (STD) dose of RBV in chronic HCV genotype (GT) 4-naive patients in a randomized trial. One hundred eighty-one patients were randomized. The baseline variables were similar in both arms and females were 50.3% of the patients, 76.5% had minimal-moderate fibrosis (F0-2). Sustained virologic response (SVR) was achieved in 99 (54.7%) subjects. SVR was seen in 50/90 (55.6%) of ADJ dose of RBV and 49/91 (53.9%) of STD dose subjects. Prematurely withdrawal or discontinuation of treatment prematurely in the ADJ RBV arm occurred in 11/90 patients (12.2%) compared with 6/91 subjects (6.6%) in the STD arm (P = 0.214). Similarly, virologic relapse was seen in 14/90 (15.6%) patients of the ADJ arm and 12/91 (13.2%) of the STD arm. Anemia grade 3-4 was seen in 36.7% in ADJ versus 17.6% in STD arm (P = 0.003). Occurrence of rapid virologic response and absences of F4 fibrosis predicted SVR in a univariate analysis. However, age, gender, weight, presence of diabetes, baseline alanine aminotransferase, and vitamin D levels were not significantly different in patients achieving SVR. ADJ higher doses of RBV based on its early pharmacokinetics-based RBV do not improve SVR rates in HCV GT4 treated in combination with peg-IFN alpha-2-a versus STD therapy. Patients on ADJ higher doses of RBV experienced higher rates of anemia and require more erythropoietin without increasing SVR.","Altraif, Ibrahim H; Sanai, Faisal; Babatin, Mohammed A; Alalwan, Abduljaleel A; Abdo, Ayman A; Alhamoudi, Waleed; Peedikayil, Musthafa; Alghamdi, Hamdan; Alsohaibani, Fahad; Alswat, Khalid A; Murtaza, Shazia; Alghamdi, Abdullah; Altraif, Sara; Aljumah, Abdulrahman; Handoo, Fayaz A; AlBekairy, Abdulkareem M; Al-Ashgar, Hamad I; Alquaiz, Mohammed; Alblawi, Mohammed A; AlTamimi, Waleed; Loustaud-Ratti, Véronique; Marquett, Pierre",Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,324,4

Germany relies largely on migrant caregivers from Poland. Yet the pandemic-related mobility restrictions reveal the deficiencies of this transnational elder care system. This article asks if this system is resilient. In order to answer this question, the research team conducted interviews with 10 experts and randomly selected representatives of brokering and sending agencies in Germany and Poland. We interviewed 13 agencies in Germany and 15 in Poland on the agencies' characteristics, recruitment strategies, challenges of the pandemic, and impact of legal regulations in the sector. The analysis shows that the system could mobilize adaptive capacities and continue to deliver services, but its absorptive capacity is limited. To enhance resilience, policies working toward formalization and legalization of care services across national borders are required.","Nowicka, Magdalena; Bartig, Susanne; Schwass, Theresa; Matuszczyk, Kamil",Journal of aging & social policy,324,19

To date, there has been limited research conducted to assess the prevalence and impact of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in gastrointestinal cohorts. The aim of this systematic review is to review the evidence for the prevalence of PTSD in gastrointestinal cohorts versus comparator groups (healthy controls and chronic illness groups), predictive factors associated with the development and management of PTSD and the impact on patient outcomes. Adult studies were identified through systematic searches of eight databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, PsycINFO, Ovid Nursing, CINAHL, Informit Health Collection, and Cochrane Library) in February 2020. The overall pooled prevalence rate of PTSD in GI cohorts was 36%; however, the prevalence rate in non-veteran-specific gastrointestinal cohorts of 18% across all GI classification groups is likely to be the more representative rate. The non-gastrointestinal chronic illness cohort PTSD prevalence rate was 11%. Predictors identified in the development of post-traumatic stress in gastrointestinal cohorts include: female gender, poor social support, life adversity, subjective pain, and dietary choices. Post-traumatic stress was found to exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms in a Crohn's Disease sample, whereby disease exacerbation was four times in those who met the criteria for probable PTSD. Post-traumatic stress symptoms affect around one in five individuals (non-veteran status) with a gastrointestinal condition. Further research is needed to understand the psychological and biological mechanisms by which PTSD increases the risk of developing and exacerbating gastrointestinal symptoms.","Glynn, Heidi; Möller, Stephan P; Wilding, Helen; Apputhurai, Pragalathan; Moore, Gregory; Knowles, Simon R",Digestive diseases and sciences,324,7

In this context, the number of hospital beds, the number of doctors, life expectancy at 60, universal health service and the share of health expenditures in GDP were used as health indicators. In the study, firstly 2020 data was estimated by using the Artificial Neural Networks simulation method and this year was used in the analysis. The model, with the data of 124 countries, was estimated using the cross-sectional OLS regression method. The estimation results show that the number of hospital beds, number of doctors and life expectancy at the age of 60 have statistically significant and positive effects on the ratio of Covid-19 recovered/cases. Universal health service and share of health expenditures in GDP are not significant statistically on the cases and recovered.

Exogenous IFN-β restores antiviral activity. OBJECTIVES To compare the efficacy and safety of inhaled IFN-β with placebo administered to people with asthma after onset of cold symptoms to prevent or attenuate asthma symptoms caused by respiratory viruses. METHODS A total of 147 people with asthma on inhaled corticosteroids (British Thoracic Society Steps 2-5), with a history of virus-associated exacerbations, were randomized to 14-day treatment with inhaled IFN-β (n = 72) or placebo (n = 75) within 24 hours of developing cold symptoms and were assessed clinically, with relevant samples collected to assess virus infection and antiviral responses. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 91% of randomized patients developed a defined cold. In this modified intention-to-treat population, asthma symptoms did not get clinically significantly worse (mean change in six-item Asthma Control Questionnaire <0.5) and IFN-β treatment had no significant effect on this primary endpoint, although it enhanced morning peak expiratory flow recovery (P = 0.033), reduced the need for additional treatment, and boosted innate immunity as assessed by blood and sputum biomarkers. In an exploratory analysis of the subset of more difficult-to-treat, Step 4-5 people with asthma (n = 27 IFN-β; n = 31 placebo), Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 increased significantly on placebo; this was prevented by IFN-β (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS Although the trial did not meet its primary endpoint, it suggests that inhaled IFN-β is a potential treatment for virus-induced deteriorations of asthma in difficult-to-treat people with asthma and supports the need for further, adequately powered, trials in this population.

Thoracotomy has been proposed as mainstay of treatment; however, minimally invasive resection through lateral or prone position thoracoscopy has been described. METHODS The technical aspects of the novel semi-prone minimally invasive thoracoscopy (spVATS) in the management of large (> 5 cm) infracarinal traction diverticula are described. Operative outcomes, pre- and postoperative symptoms (Eckardt score) and quality of life (Short-Form 36) are analyzed. RESULTS Four symptomatic patients underwent spVATS for traction midesophageal diverticula. The median age was 59 years and 75% were males. The median diverticulum size was 7.0 cm (range 5.5-8). The median preoperative Eckardt score was 8.4 (range 5-10), and the overall incidence of respiratory symptoms was 50%. Esophageal manometry was performed in three patients with no evidence of underlying motility disorders. The median operative time was 149 min (range 125-175). No intraoperative complications or open conversions occurred. Postoperative morbidity and mortality were 25% and 0%, respectively. The median hospital length of stay was 7.5 days (range 6-10). The median postoperative follow-up was 22 months (range 5-35). At the last follow-up, there was a significant improvement of patients' symptoms (p = 0.024) and quality of life (p < 0.05) with complete resolution of respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION In summary, spVATS seems a valuable approach to treat large midesophageal traction diverticula in centers experienced with minimally invasive esophageal surgery. Further studies are needed to validate the advantages and promising outcomes of the spVATS providing more robust evidence on the treatment of this rare clinical entity.","Aiolfi, Alberto; Micheletto, Giancarlo; Tringali, Domenico; Jonghi-Lavarini, Eugenio; Bonitta, Gianluca; Campanelli, Giampiero; Bona, Davide",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,324,28

Despite the action plans for prevention and control of surface water pollution in the basin, the desired results have not been achieved. However, the implementation of a nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 might probably lead to an improvement in the surface water quality. We evaluated the impact of the lockdown on water quality by measuring the levels of physico-chemical variables and metal(loid)s in water samples taken from 25 sampling stations in the basin. BOD, COD, EC, turbidity, TSS and Mn levels did not show significant differences between the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods due to the ongoing domestic wastewater discharges and agricultural activities in the basin during the lockdown period. However, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, As, Pb and Cd concentrations decreased considerably during the lockdown. Similarly, heavy metal pollution index and heavy metal evaluation index values showed a significant improvement in water quality of almost all stations during the lockdown period. Also, total hazard index values for children and adults reduced by 67% and 69%, respectively during the lockdown period, while total carcinogenic risk values for As and Cr reduced by 60% and 94%, respectively. The limited operational status of most industrial facilities in the basin during the lockdown reduced the amount of industrial effluents, leading to significant improvement in surface water quality for metal(loid)s. The lockdown has shown that the solution for preservation and sustainability of natural water resources lies in our hands, and the efficient management of pollution sources can prevent surface water pollution at a very rapid pace. Finally, we suggest that water management policy needs to be improved and implemented.","Tokatlı, Cem; Varol, Memet",Environmental research,324,24

Progesterone is considered to be protective; recent studies indicate no effect or enhanced OC risk. Knowledge of progesterone receptor (PR) signaling during altered physiology that typifies OC development is limited. This study defines PR-driven oncogenic signaling mechanisms in p53-mutant human fallopian tube epithelia (hFTE), a precursor of the most aggressive OC subtype. METHODS PR expression in clinical samples of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) lesions and high grade serous OC (HGSC) tumors was analyzed. Novel PR-A and PR-B isoform-expressing hFTE models were characterized for gene expression and cell cycle progression, emboli formation, and invasion. PR regulation of the DREAM quiescence complex and DYRK1 kinases was established. RESULTS STICs and HGSC express abundant activated phospho-PR. Progestin promoted reversible hFTE cell cycle arrest, spheroid formation and invasion. RNAseq/biochemical studies revealed potent ligand-independent/-dependent PR actions, progestin induced regulation of the DREAM quiescence complex and cell-cycle target genes through enhanced complex formation and chromatin recruitment. Disruption of DREAM/DYRK1s by pharmacological inhibition, HPV E6/E7 expression or DYRK1A/B depletion blocked progestin-induced cell arrest and attenuated PR-driven gene expression and associated OC phenotypes. CONCLUSION Activated PRs support quiescence and pro-survival/pro-dissemination cell behaviors that may contribute to early HGSC progression. Our data support an alternative perspective on the tenant that progesterone always confers protection against OC. STICs can reside undetected for decades prior to invasive disease; our studies reveal clinical opportunities to prevent the ultimate development of HGSC by targeting PRs, DREAM, and/or DYRKs.","Mauro, Laura J; Seibel, Megan I; Diep, Caroline H; Spartz, Angela; Perez Kerkvliet, Carlos; Singhal, Hari; Swisher, Elizabeth M; Schwartz, Lauren E; Drapkin, Ronny; Saini, Siddharth; Sesay, Fatmata; Litovchick, Larisa; Lange, Carol A",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,324,8

ICIs work through the blockage of immune inhibitory signals, while increasing the T-cell specific immune antitumoral response. However, due to the fact that ICIs' mechanism of action is not tissue antigen-specific and not limited to the tumor microenvironment, the use of cancer immunotherapy can produce a broad range of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Neurological immune-related adverse events (NirAEs) are rare (the overall incidence varies between 1% to 6%), and these adverse events mainly concern the peripheral nervous system, rather than the central nervous system. Due to their potential severity, which could cause interruptions to cancer treatment, NirAEs are of particular clinical importance. Currently, the pathogenesis of these complications is not completely understood, although T-cells seem to play a principal role. Nevertheless, the development of NirAEs is likely to be a multifactorial and complex process. This conclusion can be extracted from the wide range of neurological auto-inflammatory and autoimmune disorders triggered or exacerbated by ICIs, and the extensive variability of the limited histological findings reported.

MEASUREMENTS Participants reported sociodemographic/economic information, the impact of the pandemic on major life domains, insomnia and depressive symptoms, and changes in sleep midpoint, time-in-bed, total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and nightmare and nap frequency from prior to during the pandemic. Sleep pattern changes were subjected to latent profile analysis. The identified profiles were compared to one another on all aforementioned factors using probit regression analyses. RESULTS The sample of 991 participants (ages: 18-80 years; 72.5% women; 60.3% residing outside of the United States) reported significantly delayed sleep midpoint, reductions in TST and SE, and increases in nightmares and naps. Over half reported significant insomnia symptoms, and almost two-thirds reported significant depressive symptoms. Latent profile analysis revealed 4 sleep pattern change profiles that were significantly differentiated by pre-pandemic sleep patterns, gender, and various COVID-19-related impacts on daily living such as severity of change in routines, and family stress and discord.

METHODS 100 male patients with non-recurrent inguinal hernia (62 unilateral and 38 bilateral) were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to either the mesh fixation group (n = 50) or the mesh non-fixation group (n = 50). The operative and follow-up data of the two groups were analyzed and compared in terms of recurrence rates, postoperative pain, length of hospital stay, and postoperative changes in testicular arterial blood flow. RESULTS Pain scores were significantly higher in the mesh fixation group prior to discharge and at the 1st postoperative month (p = 0.034 and 0.001, respectively). Necessity to use narcotic analgesics was higher in the fixation group prior to discharge (p = 0.025). Urinary retention was significantly more frequent in the fixation group than in the non-fixation group. (p = 0.007). The mean operative time and length of hospital stay were similar in both groups. Preoperative and postoperative measurements of testicular arterial blood flow showed a substantial but not statistically significant difference for the frequency of impairment (14.2% in the fixation group and 5.8% in the non-fixation group) (p = 0.176). At long-term follow-up, no recurrence and no nerve injury were determined. CONCLUSION Fixation of the mesh to the abdominal wall has been associated with various postoperative complications for no additional benefit in lowering recurrence rates.

Improving medication self-management is important; however, most medication management frameworks focus on adherence and limit the integration of the core components of self-management. Therefore, the objective of this scoping review was to identify what is reported in the literature on medication management frameworks or models within the context of self-management. Methods Electronic databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library) and grey literature (healthcare and government organization websites) were searched for articles that described a framework or model developed or adapted for medication management, included components of self-management and was published from January 2000 to January 2020. During the screening of titles and abstracts, 5668 articles were reviewed, 5242 were excluded and 426 were then assessed at the full-text level. Thirty-nine articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Results About half of the frameworks were newly developed (n=20), while the other half were adapted from, or applied, a previous model or framework (n=19). The majority of frameworks focused on medication adherence and most of the self-management domains were categorized as medical management, followed by emotional and role management. Conclusion Medication self-management is a complex process and often impacts multiple areas of an individual's life. It is important for future frameworks to incorporate a comprehensive, holistic conceptualization of self-management that is inclusive of the three self-management domains - medical, emotional and role management.","Cadel, Lauren; Cimino, Stephanie R; Rolf von den Baumen, Teagan; James, Kadesha A; McCarthy, Lisa; Guilcher, Sara J T",Patient preference and adherence,324,1

Therefore, better surgical outcomes have been expected with RARP than with other surgical modalities. However, even in the RARP era, post-prostatectomy incontinence has a relatively high incidence as a bothersome complication. To overcome post-prostatectomy incontinence, it goes without saying that meticulous surgical procedures and creative surgical procedures, i.e., ""Preservation"", ""Reconstruction"", and ""Reinforcement"" of the anatomical structures of the pelvis, are most important. In addition, medication and appropriate pad usage might sometimes be helpful for patients with post-prostatectomy incontinence. However, patients who have 1) BMI > 26 kg/m2, 2) prostate volume > 70 mL, 3) eGFR < 60 mL/min, or a 4) Charlson comorbidity index > 2 have a tendency to develop post-prostatectomy incontinence despite undergoing the same surgical procedures. It is important for patients who have a high risk for post-prostatectomy incontinence to be given information about delayed recovery of post-prostatectomy incontinence. Thus, not only the surgical procedures, but also a comprehensive approach, as mentioned above, are important for post-prostatectomy incontinence.","Haga, Nobuhiro; Takinami, Ruriko; Tanji, Ryo; Onagi, Akifumi; Matsuoka, Kanako; Koguchi, Tomoyuki; Akaihata, Hidenori; Hata, Junya; Ogawa, Soichiro; Kataoka, Masao; Sato, Yuichi; Ishibashi, Kei; Aikawa, Ken; Kojima, Yoshiyuki",Fukushima journal of medical science,324,1

This relationship may be mediated by a lack of supportive relationships in adulthood. That is, early life adversity may inhibit the formation of supportive social ties, and weak social support is itself often linked to dysregulated stress responses. Here, we use prospective, longitudinal data from wild baboons in Kenya to test the links between early adversity, adult social bonds, and adult fecal glucocorticoid hormone concentrations (a measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis activation and the stress response). Using a causal inference framework, we found that experiencing one or more sources of early adversity led to a 9 to 14% increase in females' glucocorticoid concentrations across adulthood. However, these effects were not mediated by weak social bonds: The direct effects of early adversity on adult glucocorticoid concentrations were 11 times stronger than the effects mediated by social bonds. This pattern occurred, in part, because the effect of social bonds on glucocorticoids was weak compared to the powerful effects of early adversity on glucocorticoid levels in adulthood. Hence, in female baboons, weak social bonds in adulthood are not enough to explain the effects of early adversity on glucocorticoid concentrations. Together, our results support the well-established notions that early adversity and weak social bonds both predict poor adult health. However, the magnitudes of these two effects differ considerably, and they may act independently of one another.","Rosenbaum, Stacy; Zeng, Shuxi; Campos, Fernando A; Gesquiere, Laurence R; Altmann, Jeanne; Alberts, Susan C; Li, Fan; Archie, Elizabeth A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,324,17

The authors examined the effects of anesthesia and hypercapnia on swallowing-breathing coordination. METHODS In a randomized controlled crossover study, general anesthesia with propofol or sevoflurane was titrated using an up-down method to identify the threshold for suppression of the motor response to electrical stimulation of the forearm. Additional measurements included bispectral index, genioglossus electromyogram, ventilation (pneumotachometer), and hypopharyngeal pressure. During wakefulness and at each level of anesthesia, carbon dioxide was added to increase the end-tidal pressure by 4 and 8 mmHg. A swallow was defined as increased genioglossus activity with deglutition apnea and an increase in hypopharyngeal pressure. Spontaneous swallows were categorized as physiological (during expiration or followed by expiration) or pathological (during inspiration or followed by an inspiration). RESULTS A total of 224 swallows were analyzed. Anesthesia increased the proportion of pathological swallows (25.9% vs. 4.9%) and decreased the number of swallows per hour (1.7±3.3 vs. 28.0±22.3) compared to wakefulness. During anesthesia, hypercapnia decreased hypopharyngeal pressure during inspiration (-14.1±3.7 vs. -8.7±2 mmHg) and increased minute ventilation, the proportion of pathological swallows (19.1% vs. 12.3%), and the number of swallows per hour (5.5±17.0. vs. 1.3±5.5). CONCLUSIONS Anesthesia impaired the coordination between swallowing and respiration. Mild hypercapnia increased the frequency of swallowing during anesthesia and the likelihood of pathological swallowing. During anesthesia, the risk for aspiration may be further increased when ventilatory drive is stimulated.","D'Angelo, Olivia M; Diaz-Gil, Daniel; Nunn, Danuza; Simons, Jeroen C P; Gianatasio, Chloe; Mueller, Noomi; Meyer, Matthew J; Pierce, Eric; Rosow, Carl; Eikermann, Matthias",Anesthesiology,324,33

This study aimed to investigate the connection between PBD and discrete dimensions of the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality. METHODS Youth diagnosed with PBD I, II, or NOS, at high risk for the disorder (BD-HR) and healthy controls were recruited from the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine. Researchers administered a personality inventory and evaluated current mood state. RESULTS BD and BD-HR youth scored lower in Emotional Regulation than did HC youth (F (3, 70) = 10.75, p < .001). Within the BD and BD-HR groups, youth with high depression scores scored lower on Extraversion (F (3, 70) = 8.62, p < .001) and Conscientiousness (F (3, 70) = 4.53, p < .01). LIMITATIONS A major limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design, precluding analysis of whether certain traits or clusters of traits predict PBD or other mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS Low Emotional Regulation, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness were associated with PBD; this personality profile clinically corresponds with youth diagnosed with PBD who present with difficulty regulating their emotions, vulnerability to stress, and emotional reactivity. Future research examining personality characteristics in PBD may elucidate further a specific profile to aid clinicians in developing psychosocial interventions for youth with and at high risk of developing PBD.","Kelman, Jake; Thacher, Abigail; Hossepian, Kristene; Pearlstein, Jennifer; Geraghty, Shauna; Cosgrove, Victoria E",Journal of affective disorders,324,29

The objective of this study was to demonstrate that better patient selection, when converting a failed LAGB to a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a one-stage revision procedure, is safe, feasible and improves the complication rate. Patients and Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who underwent a one-stage conversion of failed gastric banding to a LSG. Collected data included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), intraoperative complications, length of stay and post-operative complications. The results were compared to a previous study of 90 cases of LSG as a revision procedure for failed LAGB. Results There were 75 patients in the current study, 61 women and 14 men, aged 25-67 (average: 46), with a mean BMI of 45 kg/m2 (32-66). Seventy patients (93.3%) were operated for insufficient weight loss and 5 patients (6.7%) for intolerance to the band. In our previous study, 35 patients (39%) were operated for slippage, erosion or obstruction and 14 (15.6%) had post-operative complications as opposed to only 4 patients (5.3%) in this series (P = 0.0359). Gastric leak also improved to 1.3% compared to 5.5% previously. Average hospitalisation time was 2.5 days (1-40).

Women with atrial fibrillation are at a higher overall risk for stroke compared to men with atrial fibrillation. The aim of this study was to evaluate for sex differences in patients with acute stroke and atrial fibrillation, regarding risk factors, treatments received and outcomes. Methods Data were analyzed from the ""Recurrence and Cerebral Bleeding in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke and Atrial Fibrillation"" (RAF-study), a prospective, multicenter, international study including only patients with acute stroke and atrial fibrillation. Patients were followed up for 90 days. Disability was measured by the modified Rankin Scale (0-2 favorable outcome, 3-6 unfavorable outcome). Results Of the 1029 patients enrolled, 561 were women (54.5%) (p < 0.001) and younger (p < 0.001) compared to men. In patients with known atrial fibrillation, women were less likely to receive oral anticoagulants before index stroke (p = 0.026) and were less likely to receive anticoagulants after stroke (71.3% versus 78.4%, p = 0.01). There was no observed sex difference regarding the time of starting anticoagulant therapy between the two groups (6.4 ± 11.7 days for men versus 6.5 ± 12.4 days for women, p = 0.902). Men presented with more severe strokes at onset (mean NIHSS 9.2 ± 6.9 versus 8.1 ± 7.5, p < 0.001). Within 90 days, 46 (8.2%) recurrent ischemic events (stroke/TIA/systemic embolism) and 19 (3.4%) symptomatic cerebral bleedings were found in women compared to 30 (6.4%) and 18 (3.8%) in men (p = 0.28 and p = 0.74). At 90 days, 57.7% of women were disabled or deceased, compared to 41.1% of the men (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis did not confirm this significance. Conclusions Women with atrial fibrillation were less likely to receive oral anticoagulants prior to and after stroke compared to men with atrial fibrillation, and when stroke occurred, regardless of the fact that in our study women were younger and with less severe stroke, outcomes did not differ between the sexes.","Antonenko, Kateryna; Paciaroni, Maurizio; Agnelli, Giancarlo; Falocci, Nicola; Becattini, Cecilia; Marcheselli, Simona; Rueckert, Christina; Pezzini, Alessandro; Poli, Loris; Padovani, Alessandro; Csiba, Laszló; Szabó, Lilla; Sohn, Sung-Il; Tassinari, Tiziana; Abdul-Rahim, Azmil H; Michel, Patrik; Cordier, Maria; Vanacker, Peter; Remillard, Suzette; Alberti, Andrea; Venti, Michele; Acciarresi, Monica; D'Amore, Cataldo; Scoditti, Umberto; Denti, Licia; Orlandi, Giovanni; Chiti, Alberto; Gialdini, Gino; Bovi, Paolo; Carletti, Monica; Rigatelli, Alberto; Putaala, Jukka; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Masotti, Luca; Lorenzini, Gianni; Tassi, Rossana; Guideri, Francesca; Martini, Giuseppe; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Vadikolias, Kostantinos; Papageorgiou, Sokratis G; Corea, Francesco; Sette, Massimo Del; Ageno, Walter; Lodovici, Maria Luisa De; Bono, Giorgio; Baldi, Antonio; D'Anna, Sebastiano; Sacco, Simona; Carolei, Antonio; Tiseo, Cindy; Imberti, Davide; Zabzuni, Dorjan; Doronin, Boris; Volodina, Vera; Consoli, Domenico; Galati, Franco; Pieroni, Alessio; Toni, Danilo; Monaco, Serena; Baronello, Mario M; Barlinn, Kristian; Pallesen, Lars-Peder; Kepplinger, Jessica; Bodechtel, Ulf; Gerber, Johannes; Deleu, Dirk; Melikyan, Gayane; Ibrahim, Faisal; Akhtar, Naveed; Mosconi, Maria G; Lees, Kennedy R; Caso, Valeria",European stroke journal,324,1

These studies were mainly based on serologic diagnosis, which showed patients with community-acquired pneumonia have more antibodies to Mimivirus than healthy controls. Serologic evidence of Mimivirus pneumonia was also found in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. In a matched-cohort study in which ICU patients with serologic evidence of Mimivirus pneumonia were matched to ICU patients remaining seronegative for Mimivirus, positive serology was associated with an increased duration of both mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Identification by PCR techniques remains difficult, probably because of the high level of polymorphism of nucleotide sequences of giant viruses.

However, there must be main pivots for diverse types of depression. From recent therapeutic observations, both the serotonin (5-HT) and kynurenine pathways of tryptophan metabolism may be of particular importance to improved understanding of depression. Here, I propose an etiological classification of depression, based on key peripheral and central enzymes of tryptophan metabolism. DISCUSSION Endogenous depression is caused by a larger genetic component than reactive depression. Besides enterochromaffin and mast cells, tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, is also found in 5-hydroxytryptophan-producing cells (5-HTP cells) in normal intestinal enterocytes, which are thought to essentially shunt 5-HT production in 5-HT-producing cells. Genetic studies have reported an association between TPH1 and depression, or the responsiveness of depression to antidepressive medication. Therefore, it is possible that hypofunctional 5-HTP cells (reflecting TPH1 dysfunction) in the periphery lead to deficient brain 5-HT levels. Additionally,it has been reported that higher TPH2 expression in depressed suicides may reflect a homeostatic response to deficient 5-HT levels. Subsequently, endogenous depression may be caused by TPH1 dysfunction combined with compensatory TPH2 activation. Reactive depression results from life stresses and involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with resulting cortisol production inducing tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) activation. In secondary depression, caused by inflammation, infection, or oxidative stress, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is activated. In both reactive and secondary depression, the balance between 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and kynurenic acid may shift towards 3-HK production via kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) activation. By shifting the equilibrium position of key enzymes of tryptophan metabolism, the classical classification of depression can be reorganized, as below. Peripheral classification of depression by key enzymes: TPH1 dysfunction, TDO activation, IDO activation. Central classification: TPH2 activation, KMO activation. SUMMARY Etiological classification of depression expressed by peripheral (TPH1, TDO, IDO) and central (TPH2, KMO)enzymes of tryptophan metabolism may enable depression to be viewed as a clear box, with the inner components available for inspection and treatment.","Fukuda, Katsuhiko",BMC psychiatry,324,33

As such, detailed characterization of antibody-antigen binding provides important information to guide development. Due to the time and expense required, high-resolution structural characterization techniques are typically used sparingly and late in a development process. Here, we show that antibody-antigen binding can be characterized early in a process for whole panels of antibodies by combining experimental and computational analyses of competition between monoclonal antibodies for binding to an antigen. Experimental ""epitope binning"" of monoclonal antibodies uses high-throughput surface plasmon resonance to reveal which antibodies compete, while a new complementary computational analysis that we call ""dock binning"" evaluates antibody-antigen docking models to identify why and where they might compete, in terms of possible binding sites on the antigen. Experimental and computational characterization of the identified antigenic hotspots then enables the refinement of the competitors and their associated epitope binding regions on the antigen. While not performed at atomic resolution, this approach allows for the group-level identification of functionally related monoclonal antibodies (i.e., communities) and identification of their general binding regions on the antigen. By leveraging extensive epitope characterization data that can be readily generated both experimentally and computationally, researchers can gain broad insights into the basis for antibody-antigen recognition in wide-ranging vaccine and immunotherapy discovery and development programs.","Brooks, Benjamin D; Closmore, Adam; Yang, Juechen; Holland, Michael; Cairns, Tina; Cohen, Gary H; Bailey-Kellogg, Chris",Molecules,324,16

METHODS Ten participants performed two sessions of repeated-sprints (one session: 10×10-s sprints, 30-s recovery) separated by 24 h (R24-S1 and R24-S2) and two sessions separated by 48 h (R48-S1 and R48-S2). The recovery condition (i.e. 24 h or 48 h) was randomized and separated by one week. All sessions were performed on a recumbent bike, allowing minimal delay between sprints termination and neuromuscular measurements. Neuromuscular function of knee extensors (NMA) was assessed prior to sessions (Pre-session), after 5 sprint (Mid-session), and immediately after (Post-session). Prior to sessions, baseline NMA were also carried out on an isometric chair. The NMA (bike and chair) were composed of maximal isometric voluntary contraction of knee extension (MVC) and peripheral neuromuscular stimulation during the MVC and on relaxed muscle. RESULTS The sprints performance were not significantly different between sessions and did not presented significant interaction between recovery conditions. MVC was significantly lower at R24-S2 compared to R24-S1 (-6.5±8.8%; P=.038) and R48-S2 (-5.6±8.2%; P=.048), while resting potentiated high-frequency doublet (Db100) was lower at R24-S2 compared to R24-S1 (-10.4±8.3; P=.01) (NMA on chair). There were significant reductions in MVC (>30%; P<.001) and Db100 (>38%; P<.001) from Pre- to Post-session in all sessions, without significant interactions between recovery conditions (NMA on bike). CONCLUSION Cycling repeated-sprints induce significant fatigue, particularly at the peripheral level, which is fully restored after 48 h, but not 24 h, of recovery. One vs. two days of recovery does not affect neuromuscular fatigue appearance during cycling repeated-sprint sessions.","Milioni, Fabio; Azevedo, Rafael A; Zagatto, Alessandro M; Millet, Guillaume Y",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,324,4

We compared continuous Normothermic Ex Vivo Kidney Perfusion (NEVKP) with hypothermic anoxic machine perfusion (HAMP) and static cold storage (SCS) in a porcine kidney autotransplantation model. METHODS Porcine kidneys were exposed to 30min of warm ischemia and then reimplanted following either 16hr of either SCS, HAMP (LifePort 1.0) or NEVKP prior to autotransplantation (n=5 per group). The contralateral kidney was removed. Animals were followed for 8 days. RESULTS Grafts preserved by NEVKP demonstrated improved function with more rapid recovery compared to HAMP and SCS (mean peak serum creatinine: 3.66+/-1.33mg/dl (postoperative day 1; POD1), 8.82+/-3.17mg/dl (POD2), and 12.90+/-2.19mg/dl (POD3), respectively). The NEVKP group demonstrated significantly increased creatinine clearance calculated on POD3 (63.6+/-19.0ml/min) compared to HAMP (13.5+/-10.3ml/min, p=0.001) and SCS (4.0+/-2.6ml/min,p=0.001). Histopathologic injury scores on POD8 were lower in both perfused groups (NEVKP and HAMP, score: 1-1.5) compared to SCS (score: 1-3, p=0.3), without reaching statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS NEVKP storage significantly improved early kidney function compared to both cold preservation strategies, although HAMP also demonstrates improvement over SCS. NEVKP may represent a novel, superior preservation option for DCD renal grafts compared to conventional hypothermic methods.","Urbanellis, Peter; Hamar, Matyas; Kaths, J Moritz; Kollmann, Dagmar; Linares, Ivan; Mazilescu, Laura; Ganesh, Sujani; Wiebe, Aryn; Yip, Paul M; John, Rohan; Konvalinka, Ana; Mucsi, Istvan; Ghanekar, Anand; Bagli, Darius J; Robinson, Lisa A; Selzner, Markus",Transplantation,324,16

Purpose: To assess differences in the force and motor recruitment patterns of shoulder muscles between age groups to understand functional disorders. A cross-sectional study comparing 30 adults (20-64) and 30 older adults (>65). Surface electromyography (sEMG) of the middle deltoid, upper and lower trapezius, infraspinatus, and serratus anterior muscles was recorded. Maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC) was determined at 45° glenohumeral abduction. For the sEMG signal registration, concentric and eccentric contraction with and without 1 kg and isometric contraction were requested. Participants abducted the arm from 0° up to an abduction angle of 135° for concentric and eccentric contraction, and from 0° to 45°, and remained there at 80% of the MIVC level while isometrically pushing against a handheld dynamometer. Differences in sEMG amplitudes (root mean square, RMS) of all contractions, but also onset latencies during concentric contraction of each muscle between age groups, were analyzed. Statistical differences in strength (Adults > Older adults; 0.05) existed between groups. No significant differences in RMS values of dynamic contractions were detected, except for the serratus anterior, but there were for isometric contractions of all muscles analyzed (Adults > Older adults; 0.05). The recruitment order varied between age groups, showing a general tendency towards delayed onset times in older adults, except for the upper trapezius muscle. Age differences in muscle recruitment patterns were found, which underscores the importance of developing musculoskeletal data to prevent and guide geriatric shoulder pathologies.","Lirio-Romero, Cristina; Palomo-Carrión, Rocío; Romay-Barrero, Helena; Ferri-Morales, Asunción; Prieto-Gómez, Virginia; Torres-Lacomba, María",Journal of clinical medicine,324,1

Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with an intracorporeal anastomosis (IA) is less invasive than laparoscopic assisted hemicolectomy, possibly leading to further decrease in post-operative morbidity and faster recovery. The current standard technique includes an extracorporeal anastomosis with mobilization of the colon, mesenteric traction and a extraction wound located in the mid/upper abdomen with relative more post-operative morbidity compared to extraction wounds located in the lower abdomen. METHODS A systematic review of PubMed and Embase databases was performed on studies comparing the intracorporeal versus the extracorporeal performed anastomosis in laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. Primary outcomes were mortality, short-term morbidity and length of stay. For quality assessment, the MINORS checklist was used. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, and a subgroup analysis was performed for data regarding short-term morbidity and length of stay in studies published in 2012≥. RESULTS A total of 2692 papers were identified, 12 non-randomized comparative studies were included in the analysis with a total number of 1492 patients. No significant change in mortality was found (OR 0.36, 95 % CI 0.09-1.46; I 2 = 0 %). Short-term morbidity decreased significantly in favour of IA (OR 0.68, 95 % CI 0.49-0.93; I 2 = 20 %). Length of stay was decreased, but with serious risk of heterogeneity (MD -0.77 days, 95 % CI -1.46 to -0.07; I 2 = 81 %). Subgroup analysis for papers published in 2012≥ resulted in an even larger decrease in short-term morbidity (OR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.50-0.85; I 2 = 0 %) and a significant decrease in length of stay with low risk of heterogeneity (MD -0.77 days, 95 % CI -1.17 to -0.37; I 2 = 4 %). CONCLUSION Intracorporeal anastomosis in laparoscopic right hemicolectomy is associated with reduced short-term morbidity and decreased length of hospital stay suggesting faster recovery as shown in this meta-analysis.","van Oostendorp, Stefan; Elfrink, Arthur; Borstlap, Wernard; Schoonmade, Linda; Sietses, Colin; Meijerink, Jeroen; Tuynman, Jurriaan",Surgical endoscopy,324,27

Patients with underlying conditions such as cancer are at substantial risk of acquiring and dying from this novel coronavirus. Numerous reports have shown that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes depletion of B- and T-lymphocytes, including CD4 and CD8 T-cells, and is associated with severe illness and death and that patients with higher lymphocyte levels may have better outcomes. Dexamethasone, a widely prescribed antiemetic for acute and delayed nausea and vomiting from a variety of cancer drugs, causes B and T cell depletion, which may augment immunosuppression. Since it seems that lymphocytes are vital in the immune response to novel coronavirus, oncologists should reconsider the routine use of prophylactic dexamethasone in uninfected patients, to avoid inducing lymphopenia, which may increase risk of infection or lead to inferior outcomes if a cancer patient subsequently becomes infected. Since many cancer drugs and malignant diseases inherently cause lymphopenia, further reduction of lymphocytes with dexamethasone should be avoided if possible and if safe and effective alternative antiemetics are available during the COVID-19 crisis.","Marinella, Mark A",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,324,9

This study examined outcomes after colorectal resection in emergency general surgery patients. METHODS This was an EAST-sponsored prospective observational multicenter study of patients undergoing urgent/emergent colorectal resection. Twenty-one centers enrolled patients over 11-months. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were recorded. Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U-test, and multivariable logistic regression models were used to describe outcomes and risk factors for surgical complication/mortality. RESULTS 439 patients were enrolled (184 ANST, 255 STM). Median (IQR) age was 62 (53-71) years and median Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 4 (1-6). The most common indication for surgery was diverticulitis (28%). STM group was older (64 vs. 58 years, p<0.001), had a higher CCI, and were more likely to be immunosuppressed. Preoperatively STM patients were more likely to be intubated (57 vs. 15, p<0.001), on vasopressors (61 vs. 13, p<0.001), have pneumoperitoneum (131 vs. 41, p<0.001) or fecal contamination (114 vs. 33, p<0.001), and had a higher incidence of elevated lactate (149 vs. 67, p<0.001). Overall mortality was 13%, which was higher in STM patients (18 vs. 8%, p=0.02). Surgical complications were more common in STM patients (35 vs. 25%, p=0.02). On multivariable analysis, management with an open abdomen, intraoperative blood transfusion and larger hospital size were associated with development of a surgical complication while CCI, preoperative vasopressor use, steroid use, open abdomen and intraoperative blood transfusion were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights a tendency to perform fecal diversion in patients that are acutely ill at presentation. There is a higher morbidity and mortality rate in STM patients. Independent predictors of mortality include CCI, preoperative vasopressor use, steroid use, open abdomen, and intraoperative blood transfusion. Following adjustment by clinical factors, method of colon management was not associated with surgical complications or mortality.

No study on comprehensively evaluated direct medical costs, hygiene product costs, and productivity loss in axillary hyperhidrosis patients has been published in Japan. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost of illness for axillary hyperhidrosis in Japan by conducting a nationwide insurance claims database analysis and a cross-sectional Web-based survey. Among patients diagnosed with primary axillary hyperhidrosis at least once between November 2012 and October 2019, health insurance receipt data of 1447 patients were analyzed. A cross-sectional Web-based survey was conducted on 321 patients aged 16-59 years with axillary hyperhidrosis to calculate hygiene product costs and productivity loss using a Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire. Furthermore, nationwide estimation was performed for the hygiene product costs and productivity loss based on the number of patients estimated from the prevalence. The annual direct medical costs per axillary hyperhidrosis patient were ¥91 491 in 2016, ¥93 155 in 2017, and ¥75 036 in 2018. In all of these years, botulinum toxin type A injection accounted for approximately 90% of the total costs. The annual total cost of hygiene products per axillary hyperhidrosis patient was ¥9325. The overall work impairment (%) of working patients with axillary hyperhidrosis was 30.52%, and its monthly productivity loss was ¥120 593/patient. The activity impairment (%) of full-time housewives with axillary hyperhidrosis was 49.05% and its monthly productivity loss was ¥176 368/patient. The annual hygiene product cost based on the nationwide estimation was ¥24.5 billion and the monthly productivity loss was ¥312 billion. The significant cost associated with axillary hyperhidrosis was clarified. If out-of-pocket expenses for treatments not covered by health insurance are included in the estimation, the cost will further increase.","Murota, Hiroyuki; Fujimoto, Tomoko; Oshima, Yuichiro; Tamada, Yasuhiko; Yanagishita, Takeshi; Murayama, Naoya; Inoue, Sachie; Okatsu, Hiromichi; Miyama, Hiroshi; Yokozeki, Hiroo",The Journal of dermatology,324,1

This study aimed to evaluate the ability of co-administration of the probiotics L. rhamnosus GG ATCC53103 and L. plantarum JL01 to stimulate immune responses and improve gut health during the critical weaning period in piglets. Forty-eight weaned piglets were randomly divided into four groups, and fed daily for 28 days either without, or with the two probiotics independently, or in combination. On day 28, we analyzed the cytokine and bacterial changes in intestinal mucosa and the hepatic portal vein blood metabolites of the weaned piglets. Our results showed that combined L. rhamnosus GG ATCC53103 and L. plantarum JL01 significantly increased (p < 0.05) the growth performance and expression of IL-10 and TGF-β1 mRNAs. In contrast, this treatment significantly decreased (p < 0.05) IL-1β mRNA level in the jejunum, ileum, and cecum. Furthermore, the secretion of IL-6 in the cecum, IL-1β in the jejunum, ileum, and cecum, and TNF-α in the jejunum and ileum was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Prevotella_9 and Enterococcus in ileum and cecum was significantly increased (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Ruminococcus_1 and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 in cecum was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Prevotella_9 and Enterococcus may increase the accumulation of (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TCDA) in portal vein blood, while Ruminococcus_1 and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 may decrease the accumulation of succinic and palmitic acids. These results indicate that L. rhamnosus GG ATCC53103 and L. plantarum JL01 may regulate cytokine levels by reducing the accumulation of succinic and palmitic acids and increasing the accumulation of TCDA and DHA, thereby enhancing the immunity of weaned piglets.","Geng, Tingting; He, Feng; Su, Shuai; Sun, Kecheng; Zhao, Lei; Zhao, Yuan; Bao, Nan; Pan, Li; Sun, Hui",Research in veterinary science,324,15

It is widely used to find out the feature metric hidden in the sequence. Otherwise, the graphical representation of biologic sequence is an important tool for sequencing analysis. This study is undertaken to find out a new graphical representation of biosequences. MATERIALS AND METHODS The transition probability is used to describe amino acid combinations of protein sequences. The combinations are composed of amino acids directly adjacent to each other or separated by multiple amino acids. The transition probability graph is built up by the transition probabilities of amino acid combinations. Next, a map is defined as a representation from transition probability graph to transition probability vector by k-order transition probability graph. Transition entropy vectors are developed by the transition probability vector and information entropy. Finally, the proposed method is applied to two separate applications, 499 HA genes of H1N1, and 95 coronaviruses. RESULTS By constructing a phylogenetic tree, we find that the results of each application are consistent with other studies. CONCLUSION the graphical representation proposed in this article is a practical and correct method.","Qi, Zhaohui; Wen, Xinlong",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,324,24

In this study, we reported the identification of the sheep KRTAP6-5 homologue on goat chromosome 1 and PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis in 300 Longdong cashmere goats revealed the existence of twelve variant sequences. Both coding region and 3'UTR of the putative caprine KRTAP6-5 displayed a biggest sequence similarity to ovine KRTAP6-5 gene. This suggested that the gene represents caprine KRTAP6-5 sequences, and these sequences composed twenty three genotypes which was the most polymorphism gene in KRTAPs that have been studied. Among these sequences, fifteen nucleotide substitutions and a 24-bp insertion/detection were identified.

These nodes may be separated by a few microns or on planetary scale distances, but transmission losses due to absorption and/or scattering in the channel are the major source of error for most distributed quantum information tasks. Of course, quantum error correction (QEC) and detection techniques can be used to mitigate such effects, but error detection approaches have severe performance limitations due to the signaling constraints between nodes, and so error correction approaches are preferable-assuming one has sufficient high quality local operations. Typically, performance comparisons between loss-mitigating codes assume one encoded qubit per photon. However, single photons can carry more than one qubit of information and so our focus in this Letter is to explore whether loss-based QEC codes utilizing quantum multiplexed photons are viable and advantageous, especially as photon loss results in more than one qubit of information being lost. We show that quantum multiplexing enables significant resource reduction, in terms of the number of single-photon sources, while at the same time maintaining (or even lowering) the number of 2-qubit gates required. Further, our multiplexing approach requires only conventional optical gates already necessary for the implementation of these codes.","Lo Piparo, Nicolò; Hanks, Michael; Gravel, Claude; Nemoto, Kae; Munro, William J",Physical review letters,324,16

Because acetaminophen is so widely available as a single agent and is increasingly being formulated in fixed-ratio combination analgesic products for the potential additive or synergistic analgesic effect and/or reduced adverse effects, accidental cumulative overdose is an emergent concern. This has rekindled interest in the sites, processes, and pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen oral absorption and the clinical factors that can influence these. The absorption of oral acetaminophen occurs primarily along the small intestine by passive diffusion. Therefore, the rate-limiting step is the rate of gastric emptying into the intestines. Several clinical factors can affect absorption per se or the rate of gastric emptying, such as diet, concomitant medication, surgery, pregnancy, and others. Although acetaminophen does not have the abuse potential of opioids or the gastrointestinal bleeding or organ adverse effects of NSAIDs, excess amounts can produce serious hepatic injury. Thus, an understanding of the sites and features of acetaminophen absorption--and how they might be influenced by factors encountered in clinical practice--is important for pain management using this agent. It can also provide insight for design of formulations that would be less susceptible to clinical variables.","Raffa, Robert B; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Taylor, Robert; Decker, John F; Patrick, Jeffrey T",Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,324,1

Previous studies in healthy subjects showed that these vasopressors also affected the frontal lobe cerebral tissue oxygenation (rSO2) with a decrease after administration of phenylephrine. This decrease is unwarranted in patients with jeopardized cerebral perfusion, like CEA patients. The study aimed to evaluate the impact of both phenylephrine and ephedrine on the rSO2 during CEA. METHODS In this double-blinded randomized controlled trial, 29 patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis underwent CEA under volatile general anesthesia in a tertiary referral medical center. Patients were preoperative allocated randomly (1:1) for receiving either phenylephrine (50 µg; n = 14) or ephedrine (5 mg; n = 15) in case intraoperative hypotension occurred, defined as a decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 20% compared to (awake) baseline. Intraoperative MAP was measured by an intra-arterial cannula placed in the radial artery. After administration, the MAP, cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR), stroke volume, and rSO2 both ipsilateral and contralateral were measured. The timeframe for data analysis was 120 s before, until 600 s after administration. RESULTS Both phenylephrine (70 ± 9 to 101 ± 22 mmHg; p < 0.001; mean ± SD) and ephedrine (75 ± 11 mmHg to 122 ± 22 mmHg; p < 0.001) adequately restored MAP. After administration, HR did not change significantly over time, and CO increased 19% for both phenylephrine and ephedrine. rSO2 ipsilateral and contralateral did not change significantly after administration at 300 and 600 s for either phenylephrine or ephedrine (phenylephrine 73%, 73%, 73% and 73%, 73%, 74%; ephedrine 72%, 73%, 73% and 75%, 74%, 74%). CONCLUSIONS Within this randomized prospective study, MAP correction by either phenylephrine or ephedrine showed to be equally effective in maintaining rSO2 in patients who underwent CEA.

Unfortunately, this technique necessitates the sacrifice of animals. Alternatively, (99m)technetium-macroaggregated albumin ((99m)Tc-MAA) has been used; however, planar scintigraphy imaging techniques are not quantitatively accurate and adequate spatial information is not attained. Here, we describe a reliable, minimally invasive and rapid in vivo imaging technique, using three-dimensional single photon emission computed tomography (3D SPECT) modus, that allows more accurate quantification, serial measurements and spatial discrimination. METHODOLOGY Partial portal vein ligation, common bile duct ligation and sham were induced in male mice. A mixture of (51)Cr microspheres and (99m)Tc-macroaggregated albumin particles was injected into the splenic pulpa. All mice were scanned in vivo with microSPECT (1 mm spatial resolution) and, when mandatory for localisation, a microSPECT-CT was acquired. A relative quantitative analysis was performed based on the 3D reconstructed datasets. Additionally, (51)Cr was measured in the same animals to calculate the correlation coefficient between the (99m)Tc detection and the gold standard (51)Cr. In each measuring modality, the PSS fraction was calculated using the formula: [(lung counts)/(lung counts+liver counts)] x 100. RESULTS A significant correlation between the (99m)Tc detection and (51)Cr was demonstrated in partial portal vein ligation, common bile duct ligation and sham mice and there was a good agreement between the two modalities. MicroSPECT scanning delivers high spatial resolution and 3D image reconstructions. CONCLUSION We have demonstrated that quantitative high-resolution microSPECT imaging with (99m)Tc-MAA is useful for detecting the extent of PSS in a non-sacrificing set-up. This technology permits serial measurements and high-throughput screening to detect baseline PSS, which is especially important in pharmacological studies.","Van Steenkiste, Christophe; Staelens, Steven; Deleye, Steven; De Vos, Filip; Vandenberghe, Stefaan; Geerts, Anja; Van de Wiele, Christophe; De Vos, Martine; Van Vlierberghe, Hans; Colle, Isabelle",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,324,1

We aimed to describe the spectrum, histology, management and outcomes of renal IrAE in patients with metastatic melanoma undergoing ICI therapy. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of 23 patients with a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma treated with ICI between January 2017 and April 2019 who developed a renal IrAE. Baseline demographic data, biochemical and histopathological results, management and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS The majority of patients who developed renal irAE were male and received combination immunotherapy. The median time of onset from initiation of ICI therapy to renal IrAE was 4 months. 52% of the treated renal IrAE had histopathologically confirmed renal IrAE. The most common histological pattern of injury was acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis (92%). One patient developed anti-GBM disease with non-dialysis dependent stage 5 CKD. In tubulointerstitial injury, there was no association between peak creatinine, renal recovery and histologically reported inflammation or fibrosis. Patients with renal IrAE demonstrated persisting renal dysfunction at 3, 6 and 12 months with a mean baseline, 3 and 12 month creatinine of 90.0 μmol/L, 127.0 μmol/L and 107.5 μmol/L respectively. CONCLUSION Renal IrAE is most commonly attributable to steroid responsive acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. The outcome of rarer pathologies such as anti-GBM disease may be adversely affected by a delayed diagnosis. There is persisting renal dysfunction following an episode of renal IrAE that may have impact on future renal and overall survival outcomes.","Hultin, Sebastian; Nahar, Kazi; Menzies, Alexander M; Long, Georgina V; Fernando, Suran L; Atkinson, Victoria; Cebon, Jonathan; Wong, Muh Geot",BMC nephrology,324,1

We investigated the effect of maintaining a sufentanil infusion during emergence from anesthesia by evaluating the incidence of cough and recovery profiles at extubation. METHODS In total, eighty-four patients undergoing an elective laparoscopic hysterectomy were randomly divided into two sufentanil groups and a control group. During emergence, sufentanil was administered in the sufentanil groups at a rate of 0.2 µg/kg/hr (Group S1) or 0.3 µg/kg/hr (Group S2), and saline was administered to the control group. Cough score, hemodynamic changes, and recovery profiles, such as duration from skin closure to a bispectral index of 80, to eye opening at verbal command, to tracheal extubation and the total duration of study solution infusion, were recorded. The pain score, the total volume of administered patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and the postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) score were evaluated 1, 6, and 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS Groups S1 and S2 showed significantly lower cough scores and smaller hemodynamic changes on extubation compared to Group C. Recovery profiles showed no significant differences among the three groups. Pain score, PONV at 1 hour postoperatively, and the total volume of PCA administered at all evaluation times were significantly lower in Groups S1 and S2 than in the control group. However, pain score, and PONV at 6 hours and 24 hours postoperatively showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS A sufentanil infusion (0.2-0.3 µg/kg/hr) during emergence from desflurane anesthesia may suppress coughing on extubation in patients with body mass indexes (BMI) of 21-26 without delaying extubation time. It may also reduce the postoperative analgesic requirement without increasing PONV.","Lee, Jea Yeun; Lim, Byung Gun; Park, Hye Yoon; Kim, Nan Sook",Korean journal of anesthesiology,324,1

Daily virus incidence data from public hospitals in Hong Kong's New Territory East Cluster, together with Hong Kong climate data were obtained for 2000-2007. Statistical time-series analysis using monthly time windows showed that influenza A and RSV incidence increased with higher environmental relative humidity, whereas influenza B incidence decreased with higher environmental temperatures.

However, the drivers of DC expansion and intratumoral accumulation are ill-defined. We found that interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulated DC formation through innate and adaptive lymphoid cells in mice and humans, and this increase in DCs improved anticancer immunity. Administration of IL-2 to humans within a clinical trial and of IL-2 receptor (IL-2R)-biased IL-2 to mice resulted in pronounced expansion of type 1 DCs, including migratory and cross-presenting subsets, and type 2 DCs, although neither DC precursors nor mature DCs had functional IL-2Rs. In mechanistic studies, IL-2 signals stimulated innate lymphoid cells, natural killer cells, and T cells to synthesize the cytokines FLT3L, CSF-2, and TNF. These cytokines redundantly caused DC expansion and activation, which resulted in improved antigen processing and correlated with favorable anticancer responses in mice and patients. Thus, IL-2 immunotherapy-mediated stimulation of DCs contributes to anticancer immunity by rendering tumors more immunogenic.","Raeber, Miro E; Rosalia, Rodney A; Schmid, Dominic; Karakus, Ufuk; Boyman, Onur",Science translational medicine,324,29

METHODS We assessed sociodemographics and comorbidities of consecutive patients at our institution undergoing LAAO between 2015 - 2020, then in adjusted analyses, compared procedural wait time, procedural complications, and post-procedure oral anticoagulation (OAC) use in whites versus non-whites. RESULTS Among 109 patients undergoing LAAO (45% white), whites had lower CHA2DS2 VASc scores, on average, than non-whites (4.0 vs. 4.8, p = 0.006). There was no difference in median time from index event or initial outpatient cardiology encounter to LAAO procedure (whites 10.5 vs. non-whites 13.7 months, p = 0.9; 1.9 vs 1.8 months, p = 0.6, respectively), and there was no difference in procedural complications (whites 4% vs. non-whites 5%, p = 0.33). After adjusting for CHA2DS2VASc score, OAC use at discharge tended to be higher in whites (OR 2.4, 95% CI [0.9-6.0], p = 0.07). When restricting the analysis to those with prior gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, adjusting for CHA2DS2VASc score and GI bleed severity, whites had a nearly five-fold odds of being discharged on OAC (OR 4.6, 95% CI [1-21.8], p = 0.05). The association between race and discharge OAC was not mediated through income category (total mediation effect 19% 95% CI [-.04-0.11], p = 0.38). CONCLUSION Despite an increased prevalence of comorbidities amongst non-whites, wait time for LAAO and procedural complications were similar in whites versus non-whites. Among those with prior GI bleed, whites were nearly five-fold more likely to be discharged on OAC than non-whites, independent of income. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the OER performance is still low, and especially, the overpotential is larger than 200 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 . Herein, an Ir@IrNiO sample is prepared with single-atom (SA) Ir4+ doping and surface metallic Ir nanoparticles loaded onto the NiO. Owing to the bonding of the loaded Ir with surface-exposed Ni2+ , the nearby Ni atoms exist in the +3 valence state, that is, the surface-loaded Ir particles behave like a stabilizer for the Ni3+ sites. Under the synergistic effect of SA Ir4+ and high-valance-state Ni3+ , the Ir@IrNiO nanostructure effectively reduces the overpotential to 195 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 . Moreover, it gives an Ir-content-normalized current density of 0.0457 A mgIr -1 , 72.1 times higher than that of the best commercialized IrO2 (6.33 × 10-4 A mgIr -1 ), under the condition of 1.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Operando Raman and X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) measurements reveal that there are more surface-active species of Ni3+ , which adsorb and activate water molecules to form Ni3+ -*OH at low voltage, the intermediate of Ni4+ -•O is then formed at a relatively high bias voltage, and then the •O is transferred to the SA Ir4+ sites to generate Ir4+ -O-O with OH at increased voltage. This work can help design more SA-based highly active OER materials.","Liu, Meng; Ji, Yujin; Li, Youyong; An, Pengfei; Zhang, Jing; Yan, Junqing; Liu, Shengzhong Frank",Small,324,1

After the simulation, appropriate methods of obtaining travel histories were discussed. Participants completed surveys regarding their previous education and comfort with obtaining travel histories. If and how a travel history was obtained was derived from simulation observation. RESULTS From June 2016 to July 2017, 145 medical trainees participated in 24 simulation sessions; 45% reported no prior training in obtaining travel histories. Participants asked for a travel history in all but 2 simulations; however, in 9 of 24 simulations (38%), they required prompting by either a simulation confederate or laboratory results.

This paper investigated the mechanisms of fluorination modulated surface charge behaviors of epoxy resin through quantum chemical calculation (QCC) analysis of the molecular structure. The results show that after fluorination, the surface charge dissipation process of the epoxy sample is accelerated by the introduced shallow trap sites, which is further clarified by the carrier mobility model. The electron distribution probability of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) under positive charging and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) under negative charging shows distinctive patterns. It is illustrated that electrons are likely to aggregate locally around benzenes for the positively charged molecular structure, while electrons tend to distribute all along the epoxy chain under negatively charging. The calculated results verify that fluorination can modulate surface charge behaviors of epoxy resin through redesigning its molecular structure, trap distribution and charging patterns.","Li, Jin; Wang, Yufan; Ran, Zhaoyu; Yao, Hang; Du, Boxue; Takada, Tatsuo",Molecules,324,1

Numerous studies support a modulatory role of serotonin in Tourette syndrome (TS). Objectives To determine whether or not pimavanserin affects TS symptoms. Methods In this open-label study of TS adult patients, pimavanserin was titrated to 34 mg/day over 1 week and continued for an additional 7 weeks followed by a 2-week washout. Tic severity, the primary outcome measure, was assessed by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale Total Tic Severity score (YGTSS-TTS). Secondary outcome measures included changes in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), the Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression of Change (TS-CGIC), the Tourette Syndrome-Patient Global Impression of Impact (TS-PGII), and the Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome - Quality of Life scale (GTS-QOL). Results We enrolled 12 patients, but 2 dropped out after week 2 due to non-serious side effects. In the 10 patients, mean (standard deviation (SD)) age 34 (12.9) who completed the study the mean (SD) baseline YGTSS-TTS was 34 (9.3). This decreased by 3.6 (4.9) points at week 8, a 12% reduction in tic severity (P = 0.03). This improvement is small and may not be clinically important.

SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (August 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 8) in the Cochrane Library (August 2016), MEDLINE Ovid (November 2016), Embase Ovid (August 2016), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) in Ebsco (August 2016), PsycINFO Ovid (August 2016), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) Ovid (August 2016), Occupational Therapy Systematic Evaluation of Evidence (OTseeker) (August 2016), the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) (October 2016), and ICHUSHI Web (October 2016). We also searched five ongoing trial registries, screened reference lists, and contacted experts in the field. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted to assess the therapeutic effect of rPMS for people after stroke. Comparisons eligible for inclusion were (1) active rPMS only compared with 'sham' rPMS (a very weak form of stimulation or a sound only); (2) active rPMS only compared with no intervention; (3) active rPMS plus rehabilitation compared with sham rPMS plus rehabilitation; and (4) active rPMS plus rehabilitation compared with rehabilitation only. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. The same review authors assessed methods and risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors to ask for unpublished information if necessary. We resolved all disagreements through discussion. MAIN RESULTS We included three trials (two RCTs and one cross-over trial) involving 121 participants. Blinding of participants and physicians was well reported in all trials, and overall risk of bias was low. We found no clear effect of rPMS on activities of daily living at the end of treatment (mean difference (MD) -3.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -16.35 to 10.35; low-quality evidence) and at the end of follow-up (MD -2.00, 95% CI -14.86 to 10.86; low-quality evidence). Investigators in one study with 63 participants observed no statistical difference in improvement of upper limb function at the end of treatment (MD 2.00, 95% CI -4.91 to 8.91) and at the end of follow-up (MD 4.00, 95% CI -2.92 to 10.92). One trial with 18 participants showed that rPMS treatment was not associated with improved muscle strength at the end of treatment (MD 3.00, 95% CI -2.44 to 8.44). Another study reported a significant decrease in spasticity of the elbow at the end of follow-up (MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.03). No studies provided information on lower limb function and death. Based on the GRADE approach, we judged the certainty of evidence related to the primary outcome as low owing to the small sample size of one study. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Available trials provided inadequate evidence to permit any conclusions about routine use of rPMS for people after stroke. Additional trials with large sample sizes are needed to determine an appropriate rPMS protocol as well as long-term effects. We identified three ongoing trials and will include these trials in the next review update.","Momosaki, Ryo; Yamada, Naoki; Ota, Erika; Abo, Masahiro",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,324,1

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this virus belongs to the genus Respirovirus and is most closely related to murine respirovirus. Notably, animal infection experiments indicated that the pangolin virus is highly pathogenic and transmissible in mice, with inoculated mice having variable clinical symptoms and a fatality rate of 70.37 %. The virus was found to replicate in most tissues with the exception of muscle and heart. Contact transmission of the virus was 100 % efficient, although the mice in the contact group displayed milder symptoms, with the virus mainly being detected in the trachea and lungs.

METHODS Retrospective cohort in a single academic institution between 2012 and 2019. Women who delivered during this period were classified according to the Robson classification. Women with normal body mass index (N = 11,797) and with obesity (N = 2991) were compared. The contribution of each Robson group to the overall caesarean rate were compared. RESULTS The overall cesarean rate was higher for women with (28.1%) than without (14.2%, p < 0.001) obesity. This result came mainly from Robson group 5a (history of one cesarean). After adjustment for medical factors within this group, the association between maternal obesity and cesarean during labor was significant. CONCLUSIONS The higher cesarean rate in women with obesity is explained by Robson group 5a in which obesity is an independent risk factor of in labor cesarean delivery.","Crequit, Simon; Korb, Diane; Morin, Cécile; Schmitz, Thomas; Sibony, Olivier",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,324,12

Relative changes to the fat composition of EBM subjected to handling processes were calculated based on the data provided in the included studies, and the results were synthesized narratively. The total fat content and total fatty acid composition of EBM was not generally influenced by storage and handling process, with most changes less than 10%, which is likely a result of methodological variation.

This study aimed to investigate changes in weaning parameters measured before and after tracheostomy, and to explore whether the data measured after tracheostomy were associated with weaning outcomes in difficult-to-wean patients. METHODS In a two-year study period, we enrolled orotracheally intubated patients who were prepared for tracheostomy due to difficult weaning. Weaning parameters were measured before and after the conversion to tracheostomy and compared, and the post-tracheostomy data were tested for associations with weaning outcomes. RESULTS A total of 86 patients were included. After tracheostomy, maximum inspiratory pressure (mean difference (Δ) = 4.4, 95% CI, 2.7 to 6.1, P<0.001), maximum expiratory pressure (Δ = 5.4, 95% CI, 2.9 to 8.0, P<0.001) and tidal volume (Δ = 33.7, 95% CI, 9.0 to 58.5, P<0.008) significantly increased, and rapid shallow breathing index (Δ = -14.6, 95% CI, -25.4 to -3.7, P<0.009) and airway resistance (Δ = -4.9, 95% CI, -5.8 to -4.0, P<0.001) significantly decreased. The patients who were successfully weaned within 90 days of the initiation of mechanical ventilation had greater increments in maximum inspiratory pressure (5.9 vs. 2.4, P = 0.04) and maximum expiratory pressure (8.0 vs. 2.0, P = 0.02) after tracheostomy than those who were unsuccessfully weaned. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the conversion from endotracheal tube to tracheostomy significantly improved the measured values of weaning parameters in difficult-to-wean patients who subsequently weaned successfully from the mechanical ventilator. The change was significant only for airway resistance in patients who failed weaning.

This disease frequently features cardiac amyloid fibril deposits that originate from dissociation of the tetrameric protein, transthyretin (TTR). Unlike hereditary TTR (ATTRm) amyloidosis, where amino acid replacements destabilize the native protein, in ATTRwt amyloidosis, amyloid-forming TTR lacks protein sequence alterations. The initiating cause of fibril formation in ATTRwt amyloidosis is unclear, and thus, it seems plausible that other factors are involved in TTR misfolding and unregulated accumulation of wild-type TTR fibrils. We believe that clusterin (CLU, UniProtKB P10909), a plasma circulating glycoprotein, plays a role in the pathobiology of ATTRwt amyloidosis. Previously, we have suggested a role for CLU in ATTRwt amyloidosis based on our studies showing that (1) CLU codeposits with non-native TTR in amyloid fibrils from ATTRwt cardiac tissue, (2) CLU interacts only with non-native (monomeric and aggregated) forms of TTR, and (3) CLU serum levels in patients with ATTRwt are significantly lower compared to healthy controls. In the present study, we provide comprehensive detail of compositional findings from mass spectrometry analyses of amino acid and glycan content of CLU purified from ATTRwt and control sera. The characterization of oligosaccharide content in serum CLU derived from patients with ATTRwt amyloidosis is novel data. Moreover, results comparing CLU oligosaccharide variations between patient and healthy controls are original and provide further evidence for the role of CLU in ATTRwt pathobiology, possibly linked to disease-specific structural features that limit the chaperoning capacity of CLU.","Torres-Arancivia, Celia M; Chang, Deborah; Hackett, William E; Zaia, Joseph; Connors, Lawreen H",Biochemistry,324,1

GBM cells and microenvironment secrete angiogenic factors and also express chemoattractant G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to their advantage. We investigated the role of the vasoactive peptide urotensin II (UII) and its receptor UT on GBM angiogenesis and tested potential ligand/therapeutic options based on this system. On glioma patient samples, the expression of UII and UT increased with the grade with marked expression in the vascular and peri-necrotic mesenchymal hypoxic areas being correlated with vascular density. In vitro human UII stimulated human endothelial HUV-EC-C and hCMEC/D3 cell motility and tubulogenesis. In mouse-transplanted Matrigel sponges, mouse (mUII) and human UII markedly stimulated invasion by macrophages, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells. In U87 GBM xenografts expressing UII and UT in the glial and vascular compartments, UII accelerated tumor development, favored hypoxia and necrosis associated with increased proliferation (Ki67), and induced metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expression in Nude mice. UII also promoted a ""tortuous"" vascular collagen-IV expressing network and integrin expression mainly in the vascular compartment. GBM angiogenesis and integrin αvβ3 were confirmed by in vivo 99mTc-RGD tracer imaging and tumoral capture in the non-necrotic area of U87 xenografts in Nude mice. Peptide analogs of UII and UT antagonist were also tested as potential tumor repressor. Urotensin II-related peptide URP inhibited angiogenesis in vitro and failed to attract vascular and inflammatory components in Matrigel in vivo. Interestingly, the UT antagonist/biased ligand urantide and the non-peptide UT antagonist palosuran prevented UII-induced tubulogenesis in vitro and significantly delayed tumor growth in vivo. Urantide drastically prevented endogenous and UII-induced GBM angiogenesis, MMP, and integrin activations, associated with GBM tumoral growth. These findings show that UII induces GBM aggressiveness with necrosis and angiogenesis through integrin activation, a mesenchymal behavior that can be targeted by UT biased ligands/antagonists.","Le Joncour, Vadim; Guichet, Pierre-Olivier; Dembélé, Kleouforo-Paul; Mutel, Alexandre; Campisi, Daniele; Perzo, Nicolas; Desrues, Laurence; Modzelewski, Romain; Couraud, Pierre-Olivier; Honnorat, Jérôme; Ferracci, François-Xavier; Marguet, Florent; Laquerrière, Annie; Vera, Pierre; Bohn, Pierre; Langlois, Olivier; Morin, Fabrice; Gandolfo, Pierrick; Castel, Hélène",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,324,22

While the fungus penetrates the cuticle of fungus-susceptible tick, Rhipicephalus annulatus females, it is unable to penetrate the cuticle of fungus-resistant tick, and even perishes on its surface. This is probably due to high concentration of antifungal fatty acids and probably also due to a hypersensitive-like response of the tick. To understand the metabolic pathways occurring in the fungal hyphae upon encountering the cuticles, we compared the response of the fungus to cuticle from susceptible and resistant tick cuticles by 2D-gels. The intracellular proteomes of M. brunneum Mb7 exposed to cuticle of the fungus-susceptible tick, R. annulatus, and to the fungus-resistant tick, H. excavatum engorged females were compared after exposure to either cuticles. By means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry we identified in both proteomes common proteins involved in biological processes as well as unique proteins identified only in the proteome of fungus exposed to fungus-resistant tick cuticle. These proteins were identified in high probability as heat shock proteins, four key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, and proteins associated with hypoxia, and exposure to antifungal drugs. These findings are discussed within the M. brunneum-tick pathosystem in relation to tick resistance and host resistance in general.","Ment, Dana; Gindin, Galina; Samish, Michael; Glazer, Itamar",Archives of insect biochemistry and physiology,324,17

We undertook a systematic review of studies describing delirium in adult medical patients in secondary care. We investigated if changes in healthcare complexity were associated with trends in reported delirium over the last four decades. METHODS We used identical criteria to a previous systematic review, only including studies using internationally accepted diagnostic criteria for delirium (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases). Estimates were pooled across studies using random effects meta-analysis, and we estimated temporal changes using meta-regression. We investigated publication bias with funnel plots. RESULTS We identified 15 further studies to add to 18 studies from the original review. Overall delirium occurrence was 23% (95% CI 19-26%) (33 studies) though this varied according to diagnostic criteria used (highest in DSM-IV, lowest in DSM-5). There was no change from 1980 to 2019, nor was case-mix (average age of sample, proportion with dementia) different. Overall, risk of bias was moderate or low, though there was evidence of increasing publication bias over time. DISCUSSION The incidence and prevalence of delirium in hospitals appears to be stable, though publication bias may have masked true changes. Nonetheless, delirium remains a challenging and urgent priority for clinical diagnosis and care pathways.","Gibb, Kate; Seeley, Anna; Quinn, Terry; Siddiqi, Najma; Shenkin, Susan; Rockwood, Kenneth; Davis, Daniel",Age and ageing,324,1

METHODS Endovenous ablation was performed on symptomatic patients with incompetent SSVs following a minimum of 3 months of compression therapy. Demographic data, risk factors, CEAP classification, procedure details, and follow-up data were recorded. A four-tier classification system and treatment algorithm was developed, based on EHIT proximity to the popliteal vein. RESULTS Eighty limbs (in 76 patients) were treated with RFA of the SSV between January 2008 and August 2012. Duplex ultrasound was performed between 24 and 72 hours postprocedure in all patients. Ablation was successful in 98.7% (79/80) of procedures. Sixty-eight (85%) patients had level A closures (≥ 1 mm caudal to popliteal vein) and 10 patients (13%) had level B closures (flush with popliteal vein) and were observed. Two limbs (3%) had EHIT extending into the popliteal vein (level C) and were treated with outpatient low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulation. Thrombus retracted to the level of the saphenopopliteal junction in both patients following a short course of anticoagulation. No patient developed an occlusive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (level D). Mean follow-up period was 6.2 months; no patient had small saphenous recanalization, occlusive DVT, or pulmonary embolus. The presence or absence of the Giacomini vein was not predictive of level B and C closure. CONCLUSIONS RFA of the SSV in symptomatic patients has a high success rate with a low risk of DVT. A classification system and treatment protocol based on the level of EHIT in relation to the saphenopopliteal junction is useful in managing patients. The approach to patients with thrombus flush with the popliteal vein or bulging has not been previously defined; our outcomes were excellent, using our treatment algorithm.","Harlander-Locke, Michael; Jimenez, Juan Carlos; Lawrence, Peter F; Derubertis, Brian G; Rigberg, David A; Gelabert, Hugh A; Farley, Steven M",Journal of vascular surgery,324,1

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown caused changes in musculoskeletal pain (MSP), physical activity (PA), workplace properties, and their in-between relationships among office workers. METHODS A total of 161 office workers (64.6%female) with a mean age of 38.2±9.5 years participated. The study was conducted as an online form. Baecke Physical Activity Questionnaire, NORDIC Questionnaire, and questions about the work environment were used. The participants were asked to describe the current situation and retrospectively the situation 3 months before. RESULTS We found no significant differences in the prevalence of MSP or between the mean number of body regions suffering from MSP before and during the lockdown. During the lockdown, a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in total PA and sport-related PA and a significant (p < 0.001) increase in work-related PA was noted. A significant drop in both workplace comfort rating (p < 0.05) and workplace ergonomics rating (p < 0.001) was suggested during the lockdown. Our data also suggested several individual factors influencing the MSP among office workers during the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS Maintaining habitual physical activity level and preparing a more comfortable and ergonomic workspace can play a role in a healthier transition to working from home.","Argus, Martin; Pääsuke, Mati",Work,324,1

From a primary infected individual (patient zero), the coronavirus rapidly infects new victims, creating large populations of infected people who will either die or spread infection. Relevant terms such as reinfection probability, super-spreading rate, social distancing measures, or traveling rate are introduced into the model to simulate the coronavirus activity as accurately as possible. The infected population initially grows exponentially over time, but taking into consideration social isolation measures, the mortality rate, and number of recoveries, the infected population gradually decreases. The coronavirus optimization algorithm has two major advantages when compared with other similar strategies. First, the input parameters are already set according to the disease statistics, preventing researchers from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the ability to end after several iterations, without setting this value either. Furthermore, a parallel multivirus version is proposed, where several coronavirus strains evolve over time and explore wider search space areas in less iterations. Finally, the metaheuristic has been combined with deep learning models, to find optimal hyperparameters during the training phase. As application case, the problem of electricity load time series forecasting has been addressed, showing quite remarkable performance.","Martínez-Álvarez, F; Asencio-Cortés, G; Torres, J F; Gutiérrez-Avilés, D; Melgar-García, L; Pérez-Chacón, R; Rubio-Escudero, C; Riquelme, J C; Troncoso, A",Big data,324,23

METHODS Retrospective analysis of patients treated of OSCC adjacent to DI at A.C. Camargo Cancer Center between 2009 and 2020. RESULTS 31 patients were identified, being women the majority (58.1%). The mean age of the patients was 68.8 years. Never smoker corresponds to 46.9% and never alcohol consumer to 54.9% of the sample. OPMD was reported in 45.2% of patients, affecting mainly women (78.5%). Leukoplakia (63.7%) followed by oral lichen planus (36.3%) were the most common OPMD found in women. OSCC adjacent to DI occurred in the inferior gingiva/alveolar mucosa in 48.3% of cases, and ulceration was the most common clinical appearance (87%). Peri-implantitis (PI) was initial clinical diagnosis in 16.1% of cases. CONCLUSIONS OSCC adjacent to DI were more common in women over 70 years old, non-smokers and non-drinker, and the majority had oral leukoplakia before the diagnosis of OSCC. OSCC may present clinical and radiographic features that resemble PI which can delay the diagnosis and impair the prognosis.","Ramos, Joab Cabral; Alves, Fábio Abreu; Kowalski, Luiz Paulo; Dos Santos-Silva, Alan Roger; Vargas, Pablo Agustin; Lopes, Márcio Ajudarte",Oral diseases,324,1

Faced with a new pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, it is highly desirable to be able to forecast the case fatality rate (CFR) and overall disease burden into the future. Considerable effort has been invested towards the development of a mathematical framework for predicting virulence evolution. Although many approaches accurately recapitulate complex outcomes, most rely on an assumed trade-off between CFR and infection rate. It is often impractical to empirically validate this constraint for human pathogens. Methods: A compartment model with parameters tuning the degree to which symptomatic individuals are isolated and the duration of immunity is constructed and evaluated at both short timescales and at equilibrium (when it exists). Results: We reveal kinetic constraints where the variation of multiple parameters in concert leads to decreased CFR and increased pathogen fitness, whereas independent variation of the parameters decreases pathogen fitness. Smallpox, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza are analyzed as diverse representatives of human respiratory viruses. We show that highly virulent viruses, such as smallpox, are likely often constrained by host behavior, whereas moderately virulent viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, appear to be typically constrained by the relationship between the duration of immunity and CFR. Conclusions: Evolution of human respiratory epidemics appears to be often kinetically constrained and a reduction in CFR should not be assumed. Our findings imply that, without continued public health intervention, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to continue presenting a substantial disease burden. The existence of a parameter regime admitting endemic equilibrium suggests that herd immunity is unachievable. However, we demonstrate that even partial isolation of symptomatic individuals can have a major effect not only by reducing the number of fatalities in the short term but also by potentially changing the evolutionary trajectory of the virus towards reduced CFR.","Rochman, Nash; Wolf, Yuri; V Koonin, Eugene",F1000Research,324,16

These flies have undergone a variety of specializations during their evolution including an exclusive diet consisting solely of vertebrate blood for both sexes as well as an obligate viviparous reproductive biology. Alongside these adaptations, Glossina species have developed intricate relationships with specific microbes ranging from mutualistic to parasitic. These relationships provide fundamental support required to sustain the specializations associated with tsetse's biology. This chapter provides an overview on the knowledge to date regarding the biology behind these relationships and focuses primarily on four bacterial species that are consistently associated with Glossina species. Here their interactions with the host are reviewed at the morphological, biochemical and genetic levels. This includes: the obligate symbiont Wigglesworthia, which is found in all tsetse species and is essential for nutritional supplementation to the blood-specific diet, immune system maturation and facilitation of viviparous reproduction; the commensal symbiont Sodalis, which is a frequently associated symbiont optimized for survival within the fly via nutritional adaptation, vertical transmission through mating and may alter vectorial capacity of Glossina for trypanosomes; the parasitic symbiont Wolbachia, which can manipulate Glossina via cytoplasmic incompatibility and shows unique interactions at the genetic level via horizontal transmission of its genetic material into the genome in two Glossina species; finally, knowledge on recently observed relations between Spiroplasma and Glossina is explored and potential interactions are discussed based on knowledge of interactions between this bacterial Genera and other insect species. These flies have a simple microbiome relative to that of other insects. However, these relationships are deep, well-studied and provide a window into the complexity and function of host/symbiont interactions in an important disease vector.","Attardo, Geoffrey M; Scolari, Francesca; Malacrida, Anna",Results and problems in cell differentiation,324,14

However, the cellular remodeling mechanisms involved in, and caused by, intestinal obstructions are poorly understood. Several animal models of intestinal obstructions have been developed, but the mouse model is the most cost/time effective. The mouse model uses the surgical implantation of an intestinal partial obstruction (PO) that has a high mortality rate if it is not performed correctly. In addition, mice receiving PO surgery fail to develop hypertrophy if an appropriate blockade is not used or not properly placed. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for PO surgery which produces reliable and reproducible intestinal obstructions with a very low mortality rate. This protocol utilizes a surgically placed silicone ring that surrounds the ileum which partially blocks digestive movement in the small intestine. The partial blockage makes the intestine become dilated due to the halt of digestive movement. The dilation of the intestine induces smooth muscle hypertrophy on the oral side of the ring that progressively develops over 2 weeks until it causes death. The surgical PO mouse model offers an in vivo model of hypertrophic intestinal tissue useful for studying pathological changes of intestinal cells including smooth muscle cells (SMC), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), PDGFRα+, and neuronal cells during the development of intestinal obstruction.","Ha, Se Eun; Wei, Lai; Jorgensen, Brian G; Lee, Moon Young; Park, Paul J; Poudrier, Sandra M; Ro, Seungil",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,324,12

Despite new hope, most melanoma patients still relapse with drug-resistant tumors or experience intrinsic resistance to the therapy. Therefore, novel treatment modalities beneficial for subgroups of patients are needed. TRAIL receptor agonists have been suggested as promising candidates for use in cancer treatment as they preferentially induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Unfortunately, the first generation of TRAIL receptor agonists showed poor clinical efficacy. hvTRA is a second-generation TRAIL receptor agonist with improved composition giving increased potency, and in the present study, we showed hvTRA-induced activation of apoptosis leading to an efficient and sustained reduction in melanoma cell growth in cell lines and xenograft models. Furthermore, the potential of hvTRA in a clinical setting was demonstrated by showing efficacy on tumor cells harvested from melanoma patients with lymph node metastasis in an ex vivo drug sensitivity assay. Inhibition of mutated BRAF has been shown to regulate proteins in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, making the cells more susceptible for apoptosis induction. In an attempt to increase the efficacy of hvTRA, combination treatment with the mutated BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib was investigated. A synergistic effect by the combination was observed for several cell lines in vitro, and an initial cytotoxic effect was observed in vivo. Unfortunately, the initial increased reduction in tumor growth compared with hvTRA mono treatment was not sustained, and this was related to downregulation of the DR5 level by vemurafenib. Altogether, the presented data imply that hvTRA efficiently induce apoptosis and growth delay in melanoma models and patient material, and the potential of this TRAIL receptor agonist should be further evaluated for treatment of subgroups of melanoma patients.","Fleten, Karianne G; Flørenes, Vivi Ann; Prasmickaite, Lina; Hill, Oliver; Sykora, Jaromir; Mælandsmo, Gunhild M; Engesæter, Birgit",Cell death discovery,324,12

There is comprehensive evidence that document the allegations, prevalence, and severity of grade inflation in higher education in universities around the world for the past 10 years. METHODS This study analyzes the change in the ratio of graduates with a ""very good (>2.99)"" degree in medical education in Turkey within a 15-year-long period in terms of the grade inflation (when all other factors are constant), and factors that affect the overall achievement grades. The analyses were carried out using the grade point average (GPA) of 9,618 students who graduated from the medical schools of 25 Turkish universities, and grades of 288,540 students for 7,597 courses. In doing so, the ""real"" university random effects estimator modelling considering the differences in universities with correlation, ANOVA, t-test and ANCOVA analyses were carried out. RESULTS The results revealed that there was a marginal increase in grades in medical training before graduation. Twenty-nine percent grade inflation was detected in line with the relevant findings in literature and this figure is one of the highest that has been reported so far. It was also detected that the ratio of graduates with a ""very good (>2.99)"" degree was 17% in 2005 and it increased to 46% in 2020. Additionally, the class size, academic rank of the instructors, grades, course contents, types of the universities (public & non-profit private), accreditation of the program, and the age of the medical schools were considered as important determinants of the difference in course grades. CONCLUSION These results show that both the uncontrolled expansion of medical schools in Turkey and the decrease in quality cause a significant increase in grades. Moreover, an important finding is that accreditation slows down the grade inflation. Both the course grades following the accreditation process and the inflation in the graduation grades (grade inflation) slowed down significantly in the accredited medical schools. This finding is an important example for the necessity of accreditation for universities, which is referred to as the ""gold standard"" to improve the quality of medical education.","Karadag, Engin",BMC medical education,324,24

GBM is characterized, in particular, by significant intratumor cell variability, high growth rates, and widespread invasiveness within the surrounding normal brain parenchyma. The present study aimed to examine the impact of the natural product Zerumbone, a promising sesquiterpenoid phytochemical from Zingiber zerumbet, on U-87 MG GBM cells and its underlying molecular mechanisms. At sub-lethal doses, Zerumbone exerted a concentration- and time-dependent suppression of cell migration ability utilizing scratch wound closure assay; it also inhibited GBM cells' invasion using Transwell invasion assay in a concentration-dependent fashion. The enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/-9 and their protein expression has also been reduced by administration of Zerumbone. Furthermore, Zerumbone was revealed to downregulate the mRNA expression level of IL-1β and MCP-1, two genes contributing to MMPs expression. We also found that Zerumbone exerted an inhibitory effect on the expression of Akt and total p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/Erk2) against U-87 MG cells. These findings collectively provide further proof for the possible molecular signaling basis of the antimetastatic effects of Zerumbone as a promising phytochemical, indicating a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of GBM through repression of migration, invasion, and metastasis.","Jalili-Nik, Mohammad; Afshari, Amir R; Sabri, Hamed; Bibak, Bahram; Mollazadeh, Hamid; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",BioFactors,324,0

DESIGN Prospective multicentre national audit over 12 weeks from 6th April 2020. SETTING UK secondary care ENT departments. PARTICIPANTS Adult patients with acute epistaxis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Re-presentation within 10 days for patients discharged from the ED. RESULTS 83 centres from all four UK nations submitted 2,631 valid cases. The majority of cases were ED referrals (89.7%, n=2,358/2,631). 54.6% were discharged from the ED following ENT review (n=1,267/2,322), of whom 19.5% re-presented within 10 days (n=245/1,259) and 6.8% were ultimately admitted (n=86/1,259). 46.7% of patients had a non-dissolvable pack inserted by ED prior to referral to ENT (n=1,099/2,355). The discharge rates for ED patients and their subsequent re-presentation rates were as follows: non-dissolvable packs, 29.5% discharged (n=332/1125), 18.2% re-presented (n=60/330); dissolvable products, 71.1% discharged (n=488/686), 21.8% re-presented (n=106/486); cautery only, 89.2% discharged (n=247/277), 20.0% re-presented (n=49/245); and no intranasal intervention, 85.5% discharged (n=200/234), 15.2% re-presented (n=30/198). Univariable logistic regression showed that not being packed by ED, antiplatelet medications, failed cautery and recent epistaxis treatment were significant predictors of re-presentation within 10 days. CONCLUSIONS Management of acute epistaxis was notably affected during the initial peak of the pandemic, with a shift towards reduced admissions. This national audit highlights that many patients who may previously have been admitted to hospital may be safely discharged from the ED following acute epistaxis.","Hardman, John C",Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,324,7

However, no long-term studies exist. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of isolated ACLR versus ACL+ALLR at long-term follow-up. The hypothesis was that patients who underwent combined procedures would experience significantly lower rates of graft rupture. STUDY DESIGN Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS Patients undergoing primary ACL+ALLR between January 2011 and March 2012 were propensity matched in a 1:1 ratio to patients who underwent isolated ACLR during the same period. A combination of face-to-face and telemedicine postoperative follow-up was undertaken. At the end of the study period (March 2020), medical notes and a final telemedicine interview were used to determine whether patients had experienced any complications or reoperations. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score were collected for all patients. Graft survivorship was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Logistic regression was performed to account for the potential effect of activity level on graft rupture rates. RESULTS A total of 86 matched pairs were included in the study. The mean ± SD age was 32.2 ± 8.8 years (range, 22-67 years) in the ACL+ALLR group and 34.7 ± 8.5 years (range, 21-61 years) in the isolated ACLR group. The mean duration of follow-up was 104.33 ± 3.74 months (range, 97-111 months). Patients who underwent combined ACL+ALLR versus isolated ACLR experienced significantly better ACL graft survivorship (96.5% vs 82.6%, respectively; P = .0027), lower overall rates of reoperation (15.3% vs 32.6%; P < .05), and lower rates of revision ACLR (3.5% vs 17.4%; P < .05). Patients undergoing isolated ACLR were at >5-fold greater risk of graft rupture (odds ratio, 5.549; 95% CI, 1.431-21.511; P = .0132), regardless of their preinjury activity level. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to other complications or any clinically important differences in patient-reported outcome measures. CONCLUSION Patients who underwent combined ACL+ALLR experienced significantly better long-term ACL graft survivorship, lower overall rates of reoperation, and no increase in complications compared with patients who underwent isolated ACLR. Further, patients who underwent isolated ACLR had a >5-fold increased risk of undergoing revision surgery at a mean follow-up of 104.3 months.","Sonnery-Cottet, Bertrand; Haidar, Ibrahim; Rayes, Johnny; Fradin, Thomas; Ngbilo, Cedric; Vieira, Thais Dutra; Freychet, Benjamin; Ouanezar, Herve; Saithna, Adnan",The American journal of sports medicine,324,1

METHODS Patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the hospital received CP, RDV, or combination of both. Mortality, discharge disposition, hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, and total ventilation days were compared between each treatment group and stratified by ABO blood group. An exploratory analysis identified risk factors for mortality. Adverse effects were also evaluated. RESULTS RDV monotherapy showed an increased chance of survival compared to combination therapy or CP monotherapy (p = 0.052). There were 15, 3, and 6 deaths in the CP, RDV, and combination therapy groups, respectively. The combination therapy group had the longest median ICU LOS (8, IQR 4.5-15.5, p = 0.220) and hospital LOS (11, IQR 7-15.5, p = 0.175). Age (p = 0.036), initial SOFA score (p = 0.013), and intubation (p = 0.005) were statistically significant predictors of mortality. Patients with type O blood had decreased ventilation days, ICU LOS, and total LOS. Thirteen treatment-related adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION No significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed between patients treated with RDV, CP, or combination therapy. Elderly patients, those with a high initial SOFA score, and those who require intubation are at increased risk of mortality associated with COVID-19. Blood type did not affect clinical outcomes.","Padilla, Regine; Arquiette, Jered; Mai, Yvonne; Singh, Gurinder; Galang, Kristine; Liang, Edward","Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques",324,1

A survey was used to gauge if students learned interprofessionally and about interprofessional collaborative practice (IPCP). A COVID-19 discussion board was used to assess learner knowledge of their own and other health professions and value for IPCP. Survey results indicated students perceived the online session as effective as it would have been in person. The COVID-19 discussion board presented evidence that students met all Interprofessional Education Collaborative core competencies for IPCP, shared knowledge of their and other health professions, and expressed the value and essentiality of IPCP.

Antithrombin III (AT-III) reduces the hypercoagulability of TBI. AT-III and heparinoids such as enoxaparin (ENX) demonstrate potent anti-inflammatory activity, reducing organ injury and modulating leukocyte (LEU) activation, independent of their anticoagulant effect. It is unknown what impact AT-III exerts on cerebral LEU activation and BBB permeability after TBI. We hypothesized that AT-III reduces live microcirculatory LEU-endothelial (EC) interactions and leakage at the BBB following TBI. METHODS CD1 mice (n=71) underwent either severe TBI (controlled cortical impact; CCI: 6 m/sec velocity, 1 mm depth and 4 mm diameter) or sham craniotomy (SHAM) and then received either AT-III (250 IU/kg), ENX (1.5mg/kg) or VEH (saline) every 24h. 48 hours post-TBI, cerebral intravital microscopy visualized in-vivo, penumbral microvascular EC-LEU interactions and microvascular leakage to assess BBB inflammation/permeability. Body weight (bw) loss and the Garcia Neurological Test (GNT: motor, sensory, reflex, balance) served as surrogates of clinical recovery. RESULTS Both AT-III and ENX similarly reduced in vivo penumbral LEU rolling and adhesion (p<0.05). AT-III also reduced live BBB leakage (p<0.05). AT-III animals demonstrated the least 48-hour bw loss (8.4 ±1%) vs CCI +VEH (11.4 ± 0.5%, p<0.01). GNT scores were similar among groups. CONCLUSIONS AT-III reduces post-TBI penumbral EC-LEU interactions in the BBB leading to reduced neuro-microvascular permeability. AT-III further reduced body weight loss compared to heparinoid or no therapy. Further study is needed to determine if these AT-III effects on neuroinflammation affect longer term neurocognitive recovery after TBI.

Twenty-three studies were ultimately selected for inclusion which included a total of 480 cases of CS treated with a range of both s- and bDMARDs. In all included studies, sDMARDs and bDMARDs were studied in combination with steroids or as second or higher-line treatments after therapeutic failure or intolerance to corticosteroid use. Methotrexate (MTX) and infliximab (IFX) were the most common synthetic and biologic DMARDs studied respectively, reported in about 35% of the studies reviewed. The use of steroid-sparing agents was associated with a reduction in the maintenance steroid dose used. In conclusion, steroids will remain as the cornerstone of anti-inflammatory management in patients with CS until trials on the use and safety profile of other immunosuppressive agents are completed and published.","Gallegos, Cesia; Oikonomou, Evangelos K; Grimshaw, Alyssa; Gulati, Mridu; Young, Bryan D; Miller, Edward J",International journal of cardiology.

This systematic review aims to examine the methodologies used in recent research and evaluate the effectiveness of MLD for those at-risk of or living with lymphedema. METHODS The electronic databases Embase, PubMed, CINAHL Complete and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched using relevant terms. Studies comparing MLD with another intervention or control in patients at-risk of or with lymphedema were included. Studies were critically appraised with the PEDro scale. RESULTS Seventeen studies with a total of 867 female and two male participants were included. Only studies examining breast cancer-related lymphedema were identified. Some studies reported positive effects of MLD on volume reduction, quality of life and symptom-related outcomes compared with other treatments, while other studies reported no additional benefit of MLD as a component of complex decongestive therapy. In patients at-risk, MLD was reported to reduce incidence of lymphedema in some studies, while others reported no such benefits. CONCLUSIONS The reviewed articles reported conflicting findings and were often limited by methodological issues. This review highlights the need for further experimental studies on the effectiveness of MLD in lymphedema. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS There is some evidence that MLD in early stages following breast cancer surgery may help prevent progression to clinical lymphedema. MLD may also provide additional benefits in volume reduction for mild lymphedema. However, in moderate to severe lymphedema, MLD may not provide additional benefit when combined with complex decongestive therapy.","Thompson, Belinda; Gaitatzis, Katrina; Janse de Jonge, Xanne; Blackwell, Robbie; Koelmeyer, Louise A",Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,324,1

The virus overlays existing health disparities among farmworkers, but the population is not homogenous. One group of workers that may be even more vulnerable to the transmission of COVID-19 is the H-2A temporary worker population, because they have less control over their physical environments than domestic farmworkers, who may obtain their own housing and transportation. The H-2A program was recently altered at the federal level to ensure a steady flow of essential workers that can protect the nation's food supply during a crisis. Yet, in spite of increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases in states with significant H-2A worker populations, the federal rule that temporarily expanded the H-2A program did not address needs to protect workers' health. Although the CDC has developed recommendations for the agricultural industry to safeguard against COVID-19, most health and safety regulation for farmworkers are left to state and local agencies that may lack knowledge or resources to effectively address the needs of a specialized growing workforce such as H-2A workers. More research is needed on the disparate health and safety needs of H-2A workers to assess how policy can be tailored to reduce the transmission of the COVID-19 virus among the population.","Flocks, Joan",Journal of agromedicine,324,5

Attended by over 500 colleagues from five continents, this webinar focused on the impact of the virus across the continuum of education and training. Short formal presentations on teaching and learning, assessment, selection and postgraduate training generated wide-ranging questions via the Chatbox. A thematic analysis of the Chatbox thread indicated the most pressing concerns and challenges educators were experiencing in having to adapt programmes and learning across the continuum of medical education and training. The main areas of concern were: campus-based teaching and learning; clinical teaching; selection and assessment, and educator needs. While there is clearly no one simple solution to the unprecedented issues medical education and training face currently, there were two over-arching messages. First, this is a time for colleagues across the globe to help and support each other. Second, many local responses and innovations could have the potential to change the shape of medical education and training in the future.","Cleland, Jennifer; McKimm, Judy; Fuller, Richard; Taylor, David; Janczukowicz, Janusz; Gibbs, Trevor",Medical teacher,324,16

The aim of this study was to identify the pathogens that could have caused the recent diarrhea outbreak among the alpacas in Silli, Cusco, located in the southern Peruvian highland. METHODOLOGY Spleen, kidney, and intestine tissue along with fecal and intestinal lavage samples were obtained from 50 one- to five-week-old alpacas and analyzed for the presence of parasites, bacteria, and viruses. RESULTS Laboratory testing of the 50 crias included in this study revealed that 80% were infected with Eimeria spp., 40% with coronavirus, 34% with E. coli, 32% with rotavirus, 22% with Clostridium spp., and 20% with Cryptosporidium spp. Of these 50 alpaca crias, 20 presented with a single infection (19 positive for Eimeria spp. and 1 positive for rotavirus). Co-infections with up to four pathogens occurred in 60% of the samples. The significance of such infections is not clear, but it is noteworthy that the animals suffering from necrotic and/or hemorrhagic enteritis presented with quadruple infections. It is likely that co-infections increase the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS These data show that multiple pathogens circulate among young alpaca crias and could be associated with diarrheal disease in these animals. The findings from this study warrant the provision of subsidies for future assessment of the potential economic impact of these infections on the productivity of the Peruvian alpaca industry.","Rojas, Miguel; Manchego, Alberto; Rocha, Camila B; Fornells, Luz Alba; Silva, Raquel C; Mendes, Gabriella S; Dias, Helver G; Sandoval, Nieves; Pezo, Danilo; Santos, Norma",Journal of infection in developing countries,324,9

There are major differences between LSG and LRYGB during postoperative period. Optimization of the postoperative care may be achieved by using enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol, which allows earlier functional recovery. PURPOSE The aim was to assess differences in the course of postoperative care conducted in accordance with ERAS protocol among patients after LSG and LRYGB. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data concerning patients treated for morbid obesity were prospectively gathered in one academic center. Patients were divided into two groups: LSG (n = 364, 63.41%) and LRYGB (n = 210, 36.59%). Multiple factors were used as endpoints to determine the influence of the type of bariatric procedure on postoperative course. RESULTS The rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting and incidence of intravenous fluid administration during the operation was higher in LSG group. LRYGB patients were able to tolerate higher oral fluid intake volumes during the first and the second postoperative day. Mean diuresis during the second and the third postoperative day was significantly higher in LRYGB group. Administration of diuretics and painkillers was comparable between groups, while the risk of fever after the operation was higher in LRYGB group. Mean length of stay was higher in LSG group (LRYGB vs. LSG, 3.46 days ± 1.58 vs. 3.64 days ± 4.41, p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS In our opinion, postoperative treatment after LSG requires more supervision and longer time until functional recovery is achieved.","Major, Piotr; Stefura, Tomasz; Małczak, Piotr; Wysocki, Michał; Witowski, Jan; Kulawik, Jan; Wierdak, Mateusz; Pisarska, Magdalena; Pędziwiatr, Michał; Budzyński, Andrzej",Obesity surgery,324,1

RESULTS Twelve patients were treated in 13 ablation interventions. In 4 patients, real-time feedback from the monitoring neurologist was used to adjust applicator placement and ablation settings. IONM was technically feasible in all procedures and there were no complications related to monitoring or ablation. All nerves at risk remained intact and of the 11 patients who could be followed, none developed new nerve deficit up to a minimum of 2 months after ablation. CONCLUSION IONM is safe and feasible for use during image-guided thermal ablation of tumors in the vicinity of nerves.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) provides an emerging state-of-the-art technique for molecular imaging of biological tissue. The aim of this study is the registration of MALDI MSI data sets and data acquired from different histological stainings to create a 3D model of biopsies and whole organs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN The registration of the image modalities is achieved by using a variant of our global, deformable Schatten-q-Norm registration approach. Utilizing a connected-component segmentation for background removal followed by a principal-axis based linear pre-registration, the images are adjusted into a homogeneous alignment. This registration approach is accompanied by the 3D reconstruction of histological and MALDI MSI data. RESULTS With this, a system of automatic registration for cross-process evaluation, as well as for creating 3D models, is developed and established. The registration of MALDI MSI data with different histological image data is evaluated by using the established global image registration system. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In conclusion, this multimodal image approach offers the possibility of molecular analyses of tissue specimens in clinical research and diagnosis. STATEMENT OF CLINICAL RELEVANCE Biopsies are used for diagnostics of histopathological, molecular biological, proteomic and/or imaging data. Registration of multimodal imaging modalities described in this study enables both the histological and the molecular analysis of such tissue samples. The visualization of several tissue slides facilitates the analysis of the tissue samples for both diagnosis and research. With the algorithm developed and established in this study, the user is able to zoom into parts of the tissue sample as well as to select the specific view angle direction into the tissue resulting in a detailed analysis at specific regions of the tissue sample. The opportunity to select the superposition variants of the image enables to focus on tissue data of interest. This mass-spectrometric-based algorithm will contribute to the translation of histological analyses to a molecular level. This article is protected by copyright.

Endovascular treatment by mechanical thrombectomy will be increasingly chosen as an adjunctive or alternative to intravenous thrombolysis. To apply this form of stroke treatment is associated with the challenge of optimal periinterventional treatment. The patient has to be identified, counselled, prepared, monitored, cardiovascularly stabilized, possibly sedated and ventilated, and postprocedurally treated in the optimal way. However, most aspects of periinterventional treatment have as yet not been clarified and require prospective research. Among these, the question of general anesthesia vs conscious sedation has received most attention and may be the most crucial one. Based on a great amount of retrospective data, it appears reasonable to start the intervention under conscious sedation of the non-intubated patient with standby measures for emergent intubation, until prospective randomized trials have clarified that issue. Periinterventional management will significantly affect the success of recanalization.","Bösel, Julian",Current treatment options in neurology,324,16

OBJECTIVES The objectives pf the study were to analyze the performance of a chest computed tomography (CT) AI quantitative algorithm for determining the risk of mortality/mechanical ventilation (MV) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and explore a prognostic multivariate model in a tertiary-care center in Mexico City. METHODS Chest CT images of 166 COVID-19 patients hospitalized from April 1 to 20, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed using AI algorithm software. Data were collected from their medical records. We analyzed the diagnostic yield of the relevant CT variables using the area under the ROC curve (area under the curve [AUC]). Optimal thresholds were obtained using the Youden index. We proposed a predictive logistic model for each outcome based on CT AI measures and predetermined laboratory and clinical characteristics. RESULTS The highest diagnostic yield of the assessed CT variables for mortality was the percentage of total opacity (threshold >51%; AUC = 0.88, sensitivity = 74%, and specificity = 91%). The AUC of the CT severity score (threshold > 12.5) was 0.88 for MV (sensitivity = 65% and specificity = 92%). The proposed prognostic models include the percentage of opacity and lactate dehydrogenase level for mortality and troponin I and CT severity score for MV requirement. CONCLUSION The AI-calculated CT severity score and total opacity percentage showed good diagnostic accuracy for mortality and met MV criteria. The proposed prognostic models using biochemical variables and imaging data measured by AI on chest CT showed good risk classification in our population of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Kimura-Sandoval, Yukiyoshi; Arévalo-Molina, Mary E; Cristancho-Rojas, César N; Kimura-Sandoval, Yumi; Rebollo-Hurtado, Victoria; Licano-Zubiate, Mariana; Chapa-Ibargüengoitia, Mónica; Muñoz-López, Gisela",Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,324,27

The main treatments were subsoiling (SS) and rotary tillage (RT), with secondary treatments of three irrigation regimes: no irrigation during the whole growth period (W0), irrigation at jointing stage (W1), and irrigation at both jointing and anthesis stages (W2). In combination with a soil column experiment, the contribution of the root system in different soil layers to yield was clarified. The results indicated that both tillage and irrigation significantly influenced the spatiotemporal distributions of the root systems and yield components, while tillage produced the strongest effect. Compared with RT, SS significantly promoted the root penetration and delayed root senescence in deep soil layers. With increasing soil depth, each root configuration parameter (dry root weight density, DRWD; root length density, RLD; root surface area per unit area, RSA; root volume per unit area, RV) gradually decreased, and the peak appearance times of each root parameter in RT and three parameters (RLD, RSA and RV) in SS were postponed from heading to anthesis and from anthesis to filling stage, respectively. The average post-peak attenuation values at soil layers from 60 to 100 cm in W1 were less than those in W0 and W2. SSW1 generated the highest grain yields, with an average increase of 31.88% compared with the yield in RTW0. Root systems at three soil layers (0-40 cm, 40-80 cm and below 80 cm) differentially contributed to grain yields with 78.32%, 12.09% and 9.59%, respectively. The growth peak of the deep root system in SSW1 was postponed to the filling stage, and the post-peak attenuation declining rates were also slowed. Therefore, SSW1 is an effective cultivation method improving grain yields and water use efficiency in lime concretion black soil.","Wang, Jinfeng; Wang, Zhuangzhuang; Gu, Fengxu; Liu, Huan; Kang, Guozhang; Feng, Wei; Wang, Yonghua; Guo, Tiancai",Scientific reports,324,24

It also provides an overview of the new antibiotics targeting CAP that have recently received approval by the regulatory agencies, and those antibiotics that are in the development pipeline. RECENT FINDINGS CAP is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization and carries a significant morbidity and risk of mortality. Increasing antibiotic resistance amongst the common bacterial pathogens associated with CAP, especially staphylococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae, has made the empiric treatment of this infection increasingly problematic. Moreover, failure of initial empiric therapy to cover the causative agents associated with CAP can be associated with worse clinical outcomes. There have been several antibiotics newly approved or in development for the treatment of CAP. These agents include delafloxacin, omadacycline, lefamulin, solithromycin, nemonoxacin, and ceftaroline. Their major advantages include activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and macrolide-resistant Strep. pneumoniae. SUMMARY CAP continues to be an important infection because of its impact on patient outcomes especially in the elderly and immunocompromised hosts. The availability of new antibiotics offers an opportunity for enhanced empiric treatment of the antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens associated with CAP.","Kollef, Marin H; Betthauser, Kevin D",Current opinion in infectious diseases,324,31

We developed a genome-editing approach to target a dominantly inherited form of genetic deafness. Here we show that cationic lipid-mediated in vivo delivery of Cas9-guide RNA complexes can ameliorate hearing loss in a mouse model of human genetic deafness. We designed and validated, both in vitro and in primary fibroblasts, genome editing agents that preferentially disrupt the dominant deafness-associated allele in the Tmc1 (transmembrane channel-like gene family 1) Beethoven (Bth) mouse model, even though the mutant Tmc1Bth allele differs from the wild-type allele at only a single base pair. Injection of Cas9-guide RNA-lipid complexes targeting the Tmc1Bth allele into the cochlea of neonatal Tmc1Bth/+ mice substantially reduced progressive hearing loss. We observed higher hair cell survival rates and lower auditory brainstem response thresholds in injected ears than in uninjected ears or ears injected with control complexes that targeted an unrelated gene. Enhanced acoustic startle responses were observed among injected compared to uninjected Tmc1Bth/+ mice. These findings suggest that protein-RNA complex delivery of target gene-disrupting agents in vivo is a potential strategy for the treatment of some types of autosomal-dominant hearing loss.","Gao, Xue; Tao, Yong; Lamas, Veronica; Huang, Mingqian; Yeh, Wei-Hsi; Pan, Bifeng; Hu, Yu-Juan; Hu, Johnny H; Thompson, David B; Shu, Yilai; Li, Yamin; Wang, Hongyang; Yang, Shiming; Xu, Qiaobing; Polley, Daniel B; Liberman, M Charles; Kong, Wei-Jia; Holt, Jeffrey R; Chen, Zheng-Yi; Liu, David R",Nature,324,1

The role that apoD may play in regulating AD pathology has not been addressed. Here, we crossed both apoD-null mice and Thy-1 human apoD transgenic mice with APP-PS1 amyloidogenic AD mice. Loss of apoD resulted in a nearly 2-fold increase in hippocampal amyloid plaque load, as assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Conversely, transgenic expression of neuronal apoD reduced hippocampal plaque load by approximately 35%.

Journalists are a main source of reliable public health information during crises and, until recently, journalists have been reluctant to cover preprints because of the associated scientific uncertainty. Yet, uploads of COVID-19 preprints and their uptake by online media have outstripped that of preprints about any other topic. Using an innovative approach combining altmetrics methods with content analysis, we identified a diversity of outlets covering COVID-19-related preprints during the early months of the pandemic, including specialist medical news outlets, traditional news media outlets, and aggregators. We found a ubiquity of hyperlinks as citations and a multiplicity of framing devices for highlighting the scientific uncertainty associated with COVID-19 preprints. These devices were rarely used consistently (e.g., mentioning that the study was a preprint, unreviewed, preliminary, and/or in need of verification). Less than half of the stories we analyzed contained framing devices emphasizing uncertainty. Outlets in our sample were much less likely to identify the research they mentioned as preprint research, compared to identifying it as simply ""research."" This work has significant implications for public health communication within the changing media landscape. While current best practices in public health risk communication promote identifying and promoting trustworthy sources of information, the uptake of preprint research by online media presents new challenges. At the same time, it provides new opportunities for fostering greater awareness of the scientific uncertainty associated with health research findings.","Fleerackers, Alice; Riedlinger, Michelle; Moorhead, Laura; Ahmed, Rukhsana; Alperin, Juan Pablo",Health communication,324,31

They can be determined using respiratory variation in aortic flow peak velocity (▵Vpeak), arterial pulse pressure [▵PP and pulse pressure variation (PPV)], or plethysmographic waveform amplitude [▵POP and pleth variability index (PVI)]. These indices have not been validated in children. We studied the ability of these variables to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated children. METHODS All results are expressed as median [median absolute deviation (MAD)]. Thirty mechanically ventilated children were studied after undergoing general anaesthesia. Mechanical ventilation was maintained with a tidal volume of 10 ml kg(-1) of body weight. ▵PP, PPV, ▵POP, PVI, ▵Vpeak, and aortic velocity-time integral were recorded before and after volume expansion (VE). Patients were considered to be responders to VE when the aortic velocity-time integral increased more than 15% after VE. RESULTS VE induced significant changes in ▵PP [13 (MAD 4) to 9 (5)%], PPV [15 (5) to 9 (5)%], ▵POP [15 (10) to 10 (6)%], PVI [13 (6) to 8 (5)%], and ▵Vpeak [16 (9) to 8 (3)%] (P<0.05 for all). Differences in ▵PP, ▵POP, PPV, and PVI did not reach statistical significance. Only ▵Vpeak was significantly different between responders (R) and non-responders (NR) to VE [22 (3) vs 7 (1)%, respectively; P<0.001]. The threshold ▵Vpeak value of 10% allowed discrimination between R and NR. CONCLUSIONS In this study, ▵Vpeak was the most appropriate variable to predict fluid responsiveness.","Pereira de Souza Neto, E; Grousson, S; Duflo, F; Ducreux, C; Joly, H; Convert, J; Mottolese, C; Dailler, F; Cannesson, M",British journal of anaesthesia,324,27

The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of postoperative complications on recovery of functional status after elective abdominal surgery in elderly patients. METHODS Elderly patients (70 years and older) undergoing elective abdominal surgery, with a planned length of stay >1 day, were prospectively enrolled between July 2012 and December 2014. The primary outcome was time to recovery to the preoperative functional status measured by the short physical performance battery (SPPB) preoperatively and at 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery. The comprehensive complication index was calculated to grade the severity and number of postoperative complications. A Weibull survival model with interval censoring was performed, controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities (Charlson comorbidity index-CCI), frailty, presence of cancer, nutritional status, wound class, preoperative functional status, and surgical approach. RESULTS Hundred and forty-nine patients (79 men and 70 women) were included in the analysis. Mean age was 77.7 ± 4.9 years, mean BMI was 27.2 ± 5.5 kg/m(2), and the median CCI was 3 (IQR 2-6). The mean preoperative SPPB score was 9.62 ± 2.33. A total of 52 patients (34.9 %) experienced one or more postoperative complications, including four mortalities, and a total of 72 complications. The mean comprehensive complication index score for these patients was 25.7 ± 23.8. In the presence of all other variables included in the model, a higher comprehensive complication index score was found to significantly decrease the hazard of recovery (HR 0.96, CI 0.94-0.98, p value = 0.0004) and hence increase the time to recovery. CONCLUSION Following elective abdominal surgery, elderly patients who experience a greater number and more severe postoperative complications take longer to return to their preoperative functional status.","Tahiri, Mehdi; Sikder, Tarifin; Maimon, Geva; Teasdale, Debby; Hamadani, Fadi; Sourial, Nadia; Feldman, Liane S; Guralnick, Jack; Fraser, Shanon A; Demyttenaere, Sebastian; Bergman, Simon",Surgical endoscopy,324,20

Methods: Monthly TH utilization at a single large NCI-designated institute from 3/1/2020-11/30/2020 was reviewed. Utilization was calculated as chargeable TH visits (new video, established video, phone) as a proportion of all consult/follow up visits. Patient satisfaction surveys for oncology TH visits for MD/PA/NP providers were reviewed from 4/1/2020- 11/30/2020. Surveys were sent after every TH visit, unless the patient had a prior visit in the past 3 months. Percent (%) top box score (TBS) was defined as proportion of responses in the highest possible response category (i.e. very good). % TBS was reported for 14 survey items in 4 domains: technology, access, care provider (CP), and overall assessment. Satisfaction was assessed over time and according to patient factors: generation, gender, insurance type, employment status, and clinic site. The Cochrane-Armitage trend test was used to compare proportions of TBS responses across monthly time points. Results: TH comprised 21% (22,055/103,461) of all encounters in the study period. TH use increased from 9% in 3/2020 to a peak of 47% in 4/2020. In 11/2020, TH use was 18%. 28.0% (2,286/8,173) of TH patient surveys were returned. Multiple patient satisfaction metrics were improved over time (Table). Patients had higher satisfaction with phone compared to video visits with regards to technology (86% vs 76%) and access (80% vs 72%). Millennials (born 1981-1995) had higher satisfaction with access to TH (87%) compared to Gen X (1965-1980) (77%), Baby Boomer (1946- 1964) (74%), and Silent Generation (1928-1945) (72%), however all generations had similar levels of satisfaction with technology (range 77- 80%). Disabled patients had higher overall satisfaction of TH (82%) versus those working full time or retired (71%). Patients with commercial insurance had worse overall satisfaction of TH compared to other insurance types (65% vs 72%). Patients with encounters in genitourinary, thoracic, and endocrine oncology clinics had the highest levels of overall satisfaction (75%) compared to other clinics (69%). There were no observed differences in TH satisfaction according to gender. Conclusions: TH cancer patient satisfaction is high and has improved over time, however satisfaction differs by patient demographics. Further data are needed to best select patients appropriate for TH.","Natesan, D.; Niedzwiecki, D.; Oyekunle, T.; Emmons, A.; Zafar, Y.; Blitzblau, R.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,324,29

Older people and others with pre-existing medical conditions (including diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable to severe illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Approximately 25% of Saudis suffer from diabetes;these 4 million patients require 5.5 million consultations and follow-up visits each year to manage their disease. Furthermore, with the increasing number of patients with diabetes and their need for professional care, it is difficult and time consuming to share patient-care information among caregivers in a traditional way;this increases the financial and psychological burden of home caregivers. Although the pandemic has also triggered a global demand for digital health technology adoption worldwide to achieve higher standards of health, recent developments in advanced technologies and mobile health (mHealth) applications have failed to equip the caregivers with the right ecosystem for patient-centered information sharing to allow for informed care decisions. Therefore, there is a gap in the literature as the current solutions fall short of facilitating an effective communication channel among caregivers and between them and their patients, supporting diverse caregiving groups with multiple languages, distributing tasks between caregivers to alleviate the burden on one caregiver, providing a treatment plan by a specialized care team to be viewed and followed by caregivers and patients, and alerting everyone in case of an emergency. Based on the need for empowering home caregivers to cope with the pressure, we propose eHomeCaregiving, an mHealth solution that can build a transparent blockchain-based patient-centered family caregiving ecosystem. eHomeCaregiving facilitates care continuity in patients with type 2 diabetes in Saudi Arabia by integrating care, saving time and efforts of all caregivers, and improving the patient's quality of life and outcomes, particularly in terms of facing emerging challenges amid the pandemic.","Alsalamah, H.

The risk of supply chain disruption has become the primary risk of the supply chain. However, some risk inducement of supply chain interruption is complex and diverse, so it is very difficult to grasp and screen the risk data needed for research from the supply chain operation data. To improve the robustness of supply chain for boosting the domestic and international circulation of China's manufacturing, in this paper, according to the characteristics of China's manufacturing supply chain and its risk incentives, the data needed for risk prediction modeling has been sorted out through questionnaire survey, and a regression model of risk prediction for manufacturing supply chain by using empirical method would be put forward. Then, C4.5 decision tree method is used to train and evaluation the risk prediction model. The conclusion shows that the customer satisfaction has great diagnostic value for risk, and the model has a strong sensitivity to market information risk and market order risk. The conclusion is more consistent with general cognition, and the model fits well, indicating that the model proposed in this paper has a certain theoretical significance, and its practical application value is worthy of further testing. © 2021, North Atlantic University Union NAUN.

There were clearly positive tendencies in the spread of COVID-19 to February - first half of March 2021. However, in April-May 2021 there was a significant deterioration in the epidemiological situation. From June to August 2021, the epidemiological situation with Covid-19 in Georgia became very difficult. In this work results of the next statistical analysis of the daily data associated with New Coronavirus COVID-19 infection of confirmed (C), recovered (R), deaths (D) and infection rate (I) cases of the population of Georgia in the period from June 01, 2021 to August 31, 2021 are presented. It also presents the results of the analysis of two-week forecasting of the values of C, D and I. As earlier, the information was regularly sent to the National Center for Disease Control & Public Health of Georgia and posted on the Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/Avtandil1948/. The analysis of data is carried out with the use of the standard statistical analysis methods of random events and methods of mathematical statistics for the non-accidental time-series of observations. In particular, the following results were obtained. Georgia's ranking in the world for Covid-19 monthly mean values of infection and deaths cases in summer 2021 (per 1 million population) was determined. Among 159 countries with population [≥] 1 million inhabitants in August 2021 Georgia was in the 1 place on new infection cases and on Death. A comparison between the daily mortality from Covid-19 in Georgia in summer 2021 with the average daily mortality rate in 2015-2019 shows, that the largest share value of D from mean death in 2015-2019 was 66.0 % (26.08.2021 and 31.08.2021), the smallest 6.0 % (09.07.2021). The statistical analysis of the daily and decade data associated with coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic of confirmed, recovered, deaths cases and infection rate of the population of Georgia are carried out. Maximum daily values of investigation parameters are following: C = 6208 (17.08.2021), R = 6177 (29.08.2021), D = 79 (26.08.2021 and 31.08.2021), I = 13.0 % (17.08.2021). Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: C = 5019 (2 Decade of August 2021), R = 4822 (3 Decade of August 2021), D = 69 (3 Decade of August 2021), I = 10.88 % (2 Decade of August 2021). It was found that as with September 2020 to February 2021 and in spring 2021 [7,8], from June to August 2021 the regression equations for the time variability of the daily values of C, R and D have the form of a tenth order polynomial. Mean values of speed of change of confirmed -V(C), recovered - V(R), deaths - V(D) and infection rate V(I) coronavirus-related cases in different decades of months in the summer 2021 were determined. Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: V(C) = +134 cases/day (1 Decade of August 2021), V(R) = +134 cases/day (2 Decade of August 2021), V(D) = +2.4 cases/day (3 Decade of August 2021), V(I) = + 0.25 %/ day (1 decades of August 2021). Cross-correlations analysis between confirmed COVID-19 cases with recovered and deaths cases shows, that the maximum effect of recovery is observed 19 days after infection (RC=0.95), and deaths - after 16 and 18 days (RC=0.94). In Georgia in the summer 2021, the duration of the impact of the delta variant of the coronavirus on people (recovery, mortality) could be up to two months. Comparison of real and calculated predictions data of C, D and I in Georgia are carried out. It was found that in summer 2021 two-week daily and mean two-week real values of C, D and I practically fall into the 67% - 99.99% confidence interval of these predicted values. With September 1, 2021, it is started monthly forecasting of C, D and I values. As earlier, the comparison of data about C and D in Georgia (GEO) with similar data in Armenia (ARM), Azerbaijan (AZE), Russia (RUS), Turkey (TUR) and in the World (WRL) is also carried out.","Amiranashvili, A.

Our goal was to describe the epidemiological profile and the factors related to mortality and survival of patients with stage 5 (CKD) on chronic dialysis hospitalized for Covid-19 in a public hospital. Methods: Retrospective case series. Patients with stage 5 CKD, older than 18 years, hospitalized for Covid-19 infection were included. The primary data source was medical records. The clinical and epidemiological profile of the study sample and the factors related to mortality and survival are described. Results: 105 medical records of patients with CKD 5 were evaluated. 57 (54,29%) were male, with a mean age of 58,59 +/- 14,3 years. 84 (80%) patients survived and 21 (20%) died. The main cause of admission to hospitalization was respiratory failure in (80) 76,2%. The hospital stay was 11,76 +/- 7,8 days.

ZIKV requires the neural RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 to replicate. TH represses MSI1. Being a suspected TH disruptor, we hypothesized that co-exposure to the main metabolite of PPF, 4’-OH-PPF, would exacerbate ZIKV effects through increased MSI1 expression. This was tested using in vitro mouse neurospheres and an in vivo TH signaling reporter model, Xenopus laevis. TH signaling was decreased by 4’-OH-PPF in both models. In mouse-derived neurospheres the metabolite reduced neuroprogenitor proliferation as well as markers of neuronal differentiation. The results demonstrated that 4’-OH-PPF significantly induced MSI1 at both the mRNA and protein level, as well as Fasn mRNA. Other TH target genes were also significantly modified. Importantly, several key genes implicated in neuroprogenitor fate and commitment were not dysregulated by 4’-OH-PPF alone, but were in combination with ZIKV infection. These included the neuroprogenitor markers Nestin, Egfr, Gfap, Dlx2 and Dcx. Unexpectedly, 4’-OH-PPF decreased ZIKV replication, although only at the fourth and last day of incubation, and RNA copy numbers stayed within the same order of magnitude. However, intracellular RNA content of neuroprogenitors was significantly decreased in the combined presence of the PPF metabolite and ZIKV. We conclude that 4’-OH-PPF interferes with TH action in vivo and in vitro, inhibiting neuroprogenitor proliferation. In the presence of ZIKV, TH signaling pathways crucial for cortical development are significantly impacted. This provides another example of viral effects that are exacerbated by drug or pesticide use. Significance statement In 2015, an increase in children born with unusually small heads (microcephaly) in North-Eastern Brazil was linked to infection with the ZIKA virus. An insecticide with thyroid hormone disruptive properties was used in the same areas. We investigated whether simultaneous exposure to the insecticide could increase viral susceptibility. The main metabolite 4’-OH-PPF dysregulated thyroid hormone signaling pathways crucial for brain development in both models used. Neural stem cells proliferated less and contained more Musashi-1, a protein the virus needs to replicate. Infecting stem cells pre-exposed to the endocrine disruptor did not amplify viral replication, but aggravated expression of genes implicated in brain development. Our results suggest the insecticide is particularly deleterious to brain development in areas with ZIKA virus prevalence.","Spirhanzlova, Petra; Sébillot, Anthony; Vancamp, Pieter; Gothié, Jean-David; Mével, Sébastien Le; Leemans, Michelle; Wejaphikul, Karn; Meima, Marcel; Mughal, Bilal B.; Butruille, Lucile; Roques, Pierre; Remaud, Sylvie; Fini, Jean-Baptiste; Demeneix, Barbara A.",bioRxiv,324,1

The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics and prognosis of IHCA in patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic review using the PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv databases from December 1, 2019 to October 1, 2020. Two independent investigators reviewed studies reporting information on IHCA in COVID-19 patients. Results: Twelve studies and case reports met our inclusion criteria, including a total of 7,134 COVID-19 patients from six countries. IHCA occurred in 956 patients, and of these, CPR documentation was available in 634. The number of males were almost double that of females (65.9% vs. 34.1%), and the mean age ranged from 42 to 69. The initial cardiac rhythm at the time of CPR in descending order of frequency was pulseless electrical activity (43.2%), asystole (37.1%), ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (9.9%), and other/unknown (9.8%). Common comorbidities included hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, and chronic kidney disease. Rate of survival to discharge was 8.8% (56/634), and lower rates were associated with increasing age. Among those who survived, 44.2% (23/52) had moderate to severe neurologicaldysfunction, defined by cerebral performance category score of 3 or 4. Conclusions: IHCA in COVID-19 patients carry a poor prognosis. Risks are higher in those with comorbidities and the probability of survival is lower in older adults. Even after successfulresuscitation, the risk of neurological complications is high. Further studies are needed to stratifyrisks and optimally manage IHCA in patients with COVID-19.","Moon, J.; Moon, H.",Circulation,324,10

We examined whether testing and hospitalization data could help quantify the anticipated burden on the health system given shelter-in-place (SIP) order. We find a marked slowdown in the hospitalization rate within ten days of SIP even as cases continued to rise. We also find a shift towards younger patients in the age distribution of those testing positive for COVID-19 over the four weeks of SIP. The impact of this shift is a divergence between increasing positive case confirmations and slowing new hospitalizations, both of which affects the demand on health systems. Without using local hospitalization rates and the age distribution of positive patients, current models are likely to overestimate the resource burden of COVID-19. It is imperative that health systems start using these data to quantify effects of SIP and aid reopening planning.","Kashyap, Sehj; Gombar, Saurabh; Yadlowsky, Steve; Callahan, Alison; Fries, Jason; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Shah, Nigam",,324,16

Then, the correlations between the detected parameters were examined and the differences were analyzed by gender. Patients were compared according to the ALT and ALP upper values of the reference interval. Alpha value was accepted as <0.05. Results: In all patients, ALT and ALP were detected well above normal reference ranges (p=0.000). The R-value ratio was significantly associated with ALT and ALP (p<0.001). R-groups were statistically significant and inversely proportional to age (p=0.049). It was detected that the R-ratio of >= 5 was higher in women than in men. Conclusion: According to our findings, ALT and ALP measurements in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were much higher than normal. Another interesting result of our research was that the R-ratio was found to be <= 2 in the majority of our patients. The R <= 2 finding, which is accepted as an indicator of acute liver injury, suggested that tracking of this value for COVID-19 could be an important indicator.","Kayacan, Y.; Yazar, H.; Ozdin, M.",Journal of Istanbul Faculty of Medicine-Istanbul Tip Fakultesi Dergisi,324,20

Healthcare service provision and utilisation have been affected by socio-economic factors, reduced mobility, and reprioritisation as well as interruption of services. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on STI services is unclear.MethodsIn this non-randomised study, we used the male urethritis syndrome (MUS) quarterly data from the clinical surveillance sites in the Eastern Cape (EC) province of South Africa. MUS is the main proxy measure of STI services in South Africa. MUS data were compared for a 12-month period before COVID-19 (April 2019-March 2020) and a 9-month period during the COVID-19 epidemic (April-December 2020) in each of the 8 districts. MUS data were related to the magnitude of the COVID-19 epidemic at the end of December 2020 as defined by the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases over the population size.ResultsThe quarterly number of MUS cases dropped by 30% overall in the EC province, from 13072 before COVID-19 to 9142 cases during the COVID-19 epidemic (p&lt;0.001). The reduction in quarterly MUS cases varied between districts, with 11% for the smallest and 45% for the largest reduction. The COVID-19 burden ranged from 0.72% to 4.19% between districts. There was a clear positive association of reduction in reported MUS cases and the burden of COVID-19, with districts with the largest COVID-19 burden showing the largest reductions in MUS cases (R-square 0.83, F 30.057, p=0.002).ConclusionThese data demonstrate a clear reduction in STI services resulting from the COVID-19 epidemic in the rural Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Although underreporting may have occurred, taking reports of higher population vulnerability and increased rates of unprotected sex into account, the reduction in reported MUS cases suggest that COVID-19 may have increased the burden of untreated STIs in our community.","Maithufi, R.; Pinini, Z.; Chidarikire, T.; Stamper, N.; Dorrell, P.; Peters, R.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,324,1

Although mandatory quarantines, lockdowns, and vaccinations help curb viral transmission, safe and effective preventative measures remain urgently needed. Here, we present a generic strategy for containing SARS-CoV-2 by cellulose materials. Specifically, we developed a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of a cellulose-binding domain and a nanobody (Nb) targeting the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. The immobilization of the fusion proteins on cellulose substrates enhanced the capture efficiency of Nbs against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses of the wildtype and the D614G variant, the latter of which has been shown to confer higher infectivity. Furthermore, the fusion protein was integrated into a customizable chromatography with highly porous cellulose for neutralizing virus from contaminated fluids in a continuous and cost-effective fashion. Taken together, our work leverages low-cost cellulose materials and recently developed Nbs to provide a complementary approach to addressing the pandemic. IMPORTANCE The ongoing efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic center around the development of point-of-care diagnostics, preventative measures, and therapeutic strategies against COVID-19. In contrast to existing work, we have provided a complementary approach to target and contain SARS-CoV-2 from contaminated fluids and surfaces. Specifically, we present a generic strategy for the capture and containing of SARS-CoV-2 by cellulose-based substrates. This was archived by developing a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of both a cellulose-binding domain and a nanobody specific for the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. As a proof-of-concept, our fusion protein-coated cellulose substrates exhibited enhanced capture efficiency against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus of both wildtype and the D614G mutant variants, the latter of which has been shown to confer higher infectivity. Furthermore, the fusion protein was integrated into a customizable chromatography with highly porous cellulose for neutralizing the virus from contaminated fluids in a highly continuous and cost-effective fashion.","Sun, Xin; Yang, Shaobo; Al-Dossary, Amal A.; Broitman, Shana; Ni, Yun; Yang, Mengdi; Li, Jiahe",bioRxiv,324,20

When COVID struck in March 2020, the NHS immediately obtained a licence to a secure platform for video consultations;many appointments took place by phone and the number of face‐to‐face clinics declined dramatically.Whether people with diabetes prefer face‐to‐face, telephone or video consultations depends on whom you ask. We summarise the findings of two published online surveys and report the results of our own paper survey, distributed through the Diabetes Research & Wellness Foundation monthly newsletter, Diabetes Wellness News. Respondents to the online surveys were positive about the benefits of virtual consultations, although there were concerns about confidentiality, safeguarding and identification of emotional issues. In contrast, the paper survey (n=301) found that 91% of respondents preferred a face‐to‐face consultation. Although 36% of respondents had access to video technology, only 7.2% had been offered a video consultation (24% with type 1 diabetes and 3.8% with type 2) and 87% of remote consultations had been by phone. While two‐thirds of respondents were at least fairly satisfied with their remote consultations, most people preferred to return to face to face when possible, the most common reason being that communication was easier.In conclusion, remote consultations will remain an important option in the future, but individual preferences must be taken into account;a combination of remote and face to face may be the most effective approach.

Interstitial pneumonia is the landmark feature of this condition. Severe acute respiratory symptoms requiring intensive care support arises for about one out of twenty symptomatic cases. Aminochinolone, antiviral, antibiotic, corticoid, anticoagulant and immunobiological drugs are used, mostly to treat symptoms. Only remdesivir exhibiting weak antiviral activity is approved for COVID-19. Psychotropic medications may interact with medical treatments for COVID-19. The aim of this presentation is to highlight pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions to be expected for medical treatments of COVID-19. Remdesivir and favipiravir exhibit hepatotoxic properties which may be enhanced under combinations with tricyclic antidepressants or agomelatine. Favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir have QT interval prolongation potential and must be considered for combinations with antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs. For hydroxychloroquine, hypoglycemic activity may give rise to endocrine disturbances. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions can be expected for lopinavir/ritonavir which inhibit cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4 and induce CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Combinations with psychotropic drugs that are substrates of these enzymes (victim drugs) will affect drug concentrations in blood and lead to supra- or subtherapeutic levels. Moreover, it must be assumed that the COVID-19 infection is associated with an enhanced production of cytokines which has a known impact on CYP enzyme activities. Though studies on interactions between psychotropic medications and medical treatments for COVID-19 are lacking, multiple drug interactions can be predicted and expected considering the side effect profiles and CYP inhibitory, inducing and substrate properties of combined drugs.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Hiemke, C.",European Psychiatry,324,13

School closures made it challenging for special education teachers to support their children with special needs and families. This research aimed to identify the support provided by Spanish teachers in special education schools to children with intellectual and developmental disabilities who exhibit challenging behaviour and the support given to their families. Data were collected from 22 teachers from seven special education schools by using focus group interviews. Thematic analysis was used to identify, analyse, and report patterns within the data. The results show that teachers deployed many different interventions to provide adequate support to their students and families, such as delivering materials to families, communicating in diverse ways, providing academic or functional tasks, and working with other services. Despite these efforts, teachers also reported difficulties when providing support to students and families. Therefore, future research needs to continue exploring experiences during COVID-19 to inform more accurate educational practices, especially considering children with special needs.

Students are brought together into close proximity from all across the world and interact with one another in their accommodation, through lectures and small group teaching and in social settings. The COVID-19 global pandemic has highlighted the need for sufficient data to help determine which of these factors are important for infectious disease transmission in universities and hence control university morbidity as well as community spillover. We describe the data from a previously unpublished self-reported university survey of coughs, colds and flu-like symptoms collected in Cambridge, UK, during winter 2007-2008. The online survey collected information on symptoms and socio-demographic, academic and lifestyle factors. There were 1076 responses, 97% from University of Cambridge students (5.7% of the total university student population), 3% from staff and <1% from other participants, reporting onset of symptoms between September 2007 and March 2008. Undergraduates are seen to report symptoms earlier in the term than postgraduates; differences in reported date of symptoms are also seen between subjects and accommodation types, although these descriptive results could be confounded by survey biases. Despite the historic and exploratory nature of the study, this is one of few recent detailed datasets of flu-like infection in a university context and is especially valuable to share now to improve understanding of potential transmission dynamics in universities during the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Eames, K.

The research approach used is descriptive qualitative, with data collection techniques through interviews and observations. The research subjects were English teachers and deputy principals of SMA Muhammadiyah 3 Yogyakarta. The results of the study are as follows. First, English education planning is prepared based on subjects, competency standards, basic competencies, learning objectives, teaching modules, procedures, time allocation, learning activities, learning resources/equipment, and evaluation of distance education students' learning outcomes during the COVID-19. Second, the implementation of education that the teacher is trying has been guided by the latest updated syllabus and online learning implementation plan. English teachers have practiced innovative education during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as Google Classroom, Zoom, WhatsApp, and many more. Distance learning that the teacher applies is to open lessons, deliver modules or teaching materials two days before learning activities occur, and discuss learning with students where learning is student-centered. The educational process places more emphasis on the cognitive and psychomotor domains. Third, learning assessment uses pre-test and post-test when online education takes place. The evaluation method used in learning applies direct observation, carries out tests/exercises at the end of the lesson so that the teacher knows the weaknesses and measurements of each student.

This has put an enormous demand on medical professionals. Increased wait times in the ED increases the risk of infection transmission. In this work we present an open-source, low cost, off-body system to assist in the automatic triage of patients in the ED based on widely available hardware. The system initially focuses on two symptoms of the infection - fever and cyanosis. The use of visible and far-infrared cameras allows for rapid assessment at a 1m distance, thus reducing the load on medical staff and lowering the risk of spreading the infection within hospitals. Its utility can be extended to a general clinical setting in non-emergency times as well to reduce wait time, channel the time and effort of healthcare professionals to more critical tasks and also prioritize severe cases. Our system consists of a Raspberry Pi 4, a Google Coral USB accelerator, a Raspberry Pi Camera v2 and a FLIR Lepton 3.5 Radiometry Long-Wave Infrared Camera with an associated IO module. Algorithms running in real-time detect the presence and body parts of individual(s) in view, and segments out the forehead and lip regions using PoseNet. The temperature of the forehead-eye area is estimated from the infrared camera image and cyanosis is assessed from the image of the lips in the visible spectrum. In our preliminary experiments, an accuracy of 97% was achieved for detecting fever and 77% for the detection of cyanosis, with a sensitivity of 91% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91. Although preliminary results are promising, we note that the entire system needs to be optimized before use and assessed for efficacy. The use of low-cost instrumentation will not produce temperature readings and identification of cyanosis that is acceptable in many situations. For this reason, we are releasing the full code stack and system design to allow others to rapidly iterate and improve the system. This may be of particular benefit in low-resource settings, and low-to-middle income countries in particular, which are just beginning to be affected by COVID-19.","Hegde, C.; Suresha, P.

Cardiac damage is attributed mostly to a bystander effect: the aberrant host response to acute respiratory infection. However, direct infection of cardiac tissue by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also occurs. We examined here the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) that beat spontaneously. These cardiomyocytes express the angiotensin I converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and a subset of the proteases that mediate spike protein cleavage in the lungs, but not transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection was productive: viral transcripts accounted for about 88% of total mRNA. In the cytoplasm of infected hiPSC-CM, smooth walled exocytic vesicles contained numerous 65-90 nm particles with typical ribonucleocapsid structures, and virus-like particles with knob-like spikes covered the cell surface. To better understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spread in hiPSC-CM we engineered an expression vector coding for the spike protein with a monomeric emerald-green fluorescent protein fused to its cytoplasmic tail (S-mEm). Proteolytic processing of S-mEm and the parental spike were equivalent. Live cell imaging tracked spread of S-mEm signal from cell to cell and documented formation of syncytia. A cell-permeable, peptide-based molecule that blocks the catalytic site of furin abolished cell fusion. A spike mutant with the single amino acid change R682S that inactivates the furin cleavage site was fusion inactive. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in hiPSC-CM and furin activation of its spike protein is required for fusion-based cytopathology. This hiPSC-CM platform provides an opportunity for target-based drug discovery in cardiac COVID-19. Author Summary It is unclear whether the cardiac complications frequently observed in COVID-19 patients are due exclusively to systemic inflammation and thrombosis. Viral replication has occasionally been confirmed in cardiac tissue, but rigorous analyses are restricted to rare autopsy materials. Moreover, there are few animal models to study cardiovascular complications of coronavirus infections. To overcome these limitations, we developed an in vitro model of SARS-CoV-2 spread in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. In these cells, infection is highly productive: viral transcription levels exceed those documented in permissive transformed cell lines. To better understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spread we expressed a fluorescent version of its spike protein that allowed to characterize a fusion-based cytopathic effect. A mutant of the spike protein with a single amino acid mutation in the furin cleavage site lost cytopathic function. The spike protein of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus drove cardiomyocyte fusion with slow kinetics, whereas the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and the respiratory coronavirus 229E were inactive. These fusion activities correlated with the level of cardiovascular complications observed in infections with the respective viruses. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to cause cardiac damage by fusing cardiomyocytes.","Navaratnarajah, Chanakha K.; Pease, David R.; Halfmann, Peter; Taye, Biruhalem; Barkhymer, Alison; Howell, Kyle G.; Charlesworth, Jon E.; Christensen, Trace A.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Cattaneo, Roberto; Schneider, Jay W.",bioRxiv,324,1

We conducted a comprehensive global study investigating the number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published on different health conditions, and how this compares with the global disease burden that they impose. Methods We use machine learning to monitor PubMed daily, and find and analyse RCT reports. We assessed RCTs investigating the leading causes of morbidity and mortality from the Global Burden of Disease study. Using regression models, we compared numbers of actual RCTs in different health conditions to numbers predicted from their global disease burden (Disability-Adjusted Life Years [DALYs]). We investigated whether RCT numbers differed for conditions disproportionately affecting countries with lower socio-economic development. Results We estimate 463,000 articles describing RCTs (95% prediction interval 439,000-485,000) were published from 1990 to July 2020. RCTs recruited a median of 72 participants (interquartile range 32-195). 82% of RCTs were conducted by researchers in the top fifth of countries by socio-economic development. As DALYs increased for a particular health condition by 10%, the number of RCTs in the same year increased by 5% (3.2%-6.9%), but the association was weak (adjusted R2=0.13). Conditions disproportionately affecting countries with lower socio-economic development, including respiratory infections and tuberculosis (7 thousand RCTs below predicted) and enteric infections (10 thousand RCTs below predicted), appear relatively under-researched for their disease burden. Each 10% shift in DALYs towards countries with low and middle socio-economic development was associated with a 4% reduction in RCTs (3.7%-4.9%). These disparities have not changed substantially over time. Conclusion Research priorities are not well optimized to reduce the global burden of disease. Most RCTs are produced by highly developed countries, and the health needs of these countries have been, on average, favoured.","Marshall, I.

However, it is not known whether the same is true for patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD) who are on immunosuppressants. Methods: We identified 30 patients with AIRD who took a single dose of the ChAdOx1 vaccine post-COVID-19 infection. Age, sex and disease similar patients were enrolled in to three groups of 30 each who had (1) past infection with COVID-19 but no vaccine, (2) a single dose of ChAdOx1 and (3) double doses of ChAdOx1. Sera were collected from each patient approximately 30 days after last vaccine dose or since the onset of COVID19 symptoms (in the unvaccinated group). Antibodies to spike protein were estimated and virus neutralization potential of sera was tested. Results: Baseline characteristics including drug usage was similar betweenthe groups. Seroconversion occurred in 25(83%), 23(77%), 27(90%), and 30(100%) in natural infection, single-dose vaccine, double dose vaccine, and infection and single dose vaccine groups respectively. Mean antibody titres (10076.8 SD 8998) in the last group were at least 6-100x higher than in the other 3 groups. Also, the infection +vaccine group had the highest neutralization potential of 83.37 % as compared to 45.4% in the fully vaccinated group. Conclusion: The hybrid immunity with a single dose of the vector-based vaccine post-infection seems to be superior to double dosage of the vaccine in patients with AIRD. A universal vaccination strategy involving a single dose of vaccine for all individuals with previous COVID-19 infection seems to be effective in these patients also.","Shenoy, P.; Ahmed, S.; Paul, A.; Cherian, S.; Umesh, R.; Shenoy, V.; Vijayan, A.; Babu, S.; S, N.; Thambi, A.",,324,24

Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment, known as chemobrain has been addressed recently. Therefore, cognitive function as one of the determinants of QoL should be considered while prescribing chemotherapeutics. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of two common chemotherapy regimens on BC survivors cognition. Methods: The participants comprised 35 BC patients who underwent two common chemotherapy regimens, AC-T and TAC, and 24 matched healthy volunteers. The participants were assessed regarding anxiety, depression, general health status, and cognitive function including aspects of concentration, verbal ability, reasoning, memory, and visuospatial skill through Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination (ACE-P) and Cambridge Brain Science (CBS) tests. Results: Regarding depression and anxiety, there were no significant differences between the three groups. However, BC patients significantly complained of chronic fatigue compared to healthy volunteers (P-value = 0.027). Besides, ACE-P revealed the language domain to be affected in the AC-T group in comparison with the TAC-treated cases (P-value = 0.036). Moreover, the patients receiving the AC-T regimen had worse performance in visuospatial working memory and attention domains compared to the TAC group considering CBS tests (P-value = 0.031 and 0.008, respectively). Conclusion: The results represent the AC-T regimen to be more toxic than the TAC in domains of language, concentration, and visuospatial working memory. Implications for cancer survivors: The AC-T regimen should be prescribed with caution in BC patients suffering from baseline cognitive impairments to improve post-chemotherapy QoL.","Owrangi, M.; Gholamzadeh, M.

It takes insight and courage to question traditional approaches and paradigms: why are psychiatric training programs done the way that they are? Reverse engineering involves taking something apart and analysing its workings to figure out how it does what it does and how it can be improved. In education, reverse engineering implies one determines learning outcomes upfront and then works back from them. Applied to postgraduate psychiatric training, it requires us to determine the basic principles or core concepts resulting in the successful formation of a well-rounded psychiatrist. In times of crisis there usually is more leeway to challenge the status-quo – hence the saying “never waste a good crisis”. Indeed, if the COVID-19 crisis has taught us anything, it is that education should be meeting learners where their attention is at, and that any healthcare organisation can be transformed within weeks when given the right incentives. In this workshop, Dr. De Picker will reflect on how post-COVID European psychiatric training can reinvent itself to address long-standing concerns and unmet needs. Innovative approaches will be needed to start shaping the psychiatrists of the future.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","De Picker, L.",European Psychiatry,324,1

To address unequal care received by Black communities, a shift to community-based programs that deliver culturally tailored programs to meet the needs of the communities they serve, including Black adults who tend to have reduced access to postacute services, may give an alternative to a healthcare model which reinforces health inequities. However, community-based culturally tailored programs (CBCT) are relatively understudied but show promise to improve the delivery of services to marginalized communities. The objectives of this review are to: (i) determine key program characteristics and outcomes of CBCT programs that are designed to improve health outcomes in Black adults with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, or stroke and (ii) identify which of the five categories of culturally appropriate programs from Kreuter and colleagues have been used to implement CBCT programs. Methods: This is a protocol for a systematic review that will search MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases to identify community-based culturally tailored programs for Black adults with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, or stroke. Discussion: Health inequities have disproportionately impacted Black communities and will continue to persist if adjustments are not prioritized within healthcare to provide services, care, and programs meant to address the specific barriers to better health experienced. Many interventions, meant to improve the health outcomes of marginalized groups, are created with little input from target communities leading to interventions that may not address the specific barriers contributing to poor health outcomes and are designed and implemented from an outsider's perspective. The inclusion of community members allows for a deeper understanding of the issues facing the community and provides an opportunity to incorporate cultural values to potentially increase the efficacy, tailoring the intervention to distinct communities. An alternative to current healthcare interventions must be explored to reduce the health gap experienced by Black adults.","Fulton, J. H.; Singh, H.; Pakkal, O.; Uleryk, E. M.; Nelson, M. L.",,324,27

Many existing studies focus on querying trajectories that are similar to each other in their entirety. We observe that trajectories partially similar to each other contain useful information about users' travel patterns which should not be ignored. Such partially similar trajectories are critical in applications such as epidemic contact tracing. We thus propose to query trajectories that are within a given distance range from each other for a given period of time. We formulate this problem as a sub-trajectory similarity join query named as the STS-Join. We further propose a distributed index structure and a query algorithm for STS-Join, where users retain their raw location data and only send obfuscated trajectories to a server for query processing. This helps preserve user location privacy which is vital when dealing with such data. Theoretical analysis and experiments on real data confirm the effectiveness and the efficiency of our proposed index structure and query algorithm.","Chang, Yanchuan; Qi, Jianzhong; Tanin, Egemen; Ma, Xingjun; Samet, Hanan",,324,20

In this study, we address this core limitation by presenting a multi-stage stochastic programming compartmental model, which integrates the uncertain disease progression and resource allocation to control an infectious disease outbreak. The proposed multi-stage stochastic program involves various disease growth scenarios and optimizes the distribution of treatment centers and resources while minimizing the total expected number of new infections and funerals. We define two new equity metrics, namely infection and capacity equity, and explicitly consider equity for allocating treatment funds and facilities over multiple time stages. We also study the multi-stage value of the stochastic solution (VSS), which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed stochastic programming model over its deterministic counterpart. We apply the proposed formulation to control the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia of West Africa to determine the optimal and fair resource-allocation strategies. Our model balances the proportion of infections over all regions, even without including the infection equity or prevalence equity constraints. Model results also show that allocating treatment resources proportional to population is sub-optimal, and enforcing such a resource allocation policy might adversely impact the total number of infections and deaths, and thus resulting in a high cost that we have to pay for the fairness. Our multi-stage stochastic epidemic-logistics model is practical and can be adapted to control other infectious diseases in meta-populations and dynamically evolving situations.","Yin, X.; Buyuktahtakin, E.",,324,4

Previously, we have shown that induction of PCA by MHV-3 correlated with resistance/susceptibility to infection in different mouse strains. In this study, all BALB/cJ mice that were infected with 10(3) plaque-forming units of MHV-3 developed severe liver disease and died within 96-120 h. Examination of the livers of these animals showed marked hepatic necrosis, deposition of fibrin, and cellular expression of PCA by direct immunofluorescence staining in areas of necrosis as well as in hepatic sinusoids. Splenic mononuclear cells recovered from these mice expressed high concentrations of PCA with time after infection. Infusion into mice of a high-titered monoclonal antibody that neutralized PCA (3D4.3) attenuated the development of hepatic necrosis and enhanced survival in a dose- dependent manner. All of the animals receiving 100 micrograms, and 44% and 22% of the animals that received 50 and 25 micrograms per day, respectively, survived for 10 d and made a full recovery. Administration of the antibody resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in fibrin deposition, PCA expression as detected by direct immunofluorescence staining and by a functional assay. In animals treated with high concentrations of antibody, titers of antibody to PCA fell from 87 +/- 15 micrograms/ml to 100 +/- 7 ng/ml during the active phase of the disease, consistent with sequestration due to binding of the immunoglobulin to cells expressing PCA. Surviving animals, when rechallenged with MHV-3, had a 40% mortality, consistent with the known rates of metabolism of immunoglobulin. This further suggested that protection was by a passive mechanism. The results reported here demonstrate that a neutralizing antibody to PCA protects animals from fulminant hepatitis and death associated with MHV-3 infection, and supports the notion that PCA is a potent inflammatory mediator that plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of liver injury resulting from MHV-3 infection.",,J Exp Med,324,1

DESIGN Prospective study. SETTING Well Women Clinics in regional Hong Kong hospitals. PARTICIPANTS Women attending the Well Women Clinics of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals for breast cancer screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All screening-detected breast cancers. RESULTS After 46 637 screening mammograms and excluding palpable masses detected by the patients themselves, 232 women were detected with cancers, yielding a crude detection rate of 5.0 per 1000. Age range for cancer detection was 35 to 72 (median, 49) years. Clinic staff detected palpable lumps in 83 patients, constituting 36% of the detected cancers, of which 15 (6.5% of all detected cancers) were not identified by mammography. The cancer detection rate was 5.9 per 1000 in the age-group 40-49 years and 3.7 per 1000 in those 50 years or older. The cancer detection rate was 58.5 per 1000 in the high-risk group (aged <40 years with positive family history). The minimal cancer detection rate was 2.2 per 1000, representing 45% of all cancers whose pathology was available to us. Ductal carcinoma in situ comprised 28% of all such cancers. Our recall rates were 4.6% for additional views only, 3.3% for ultrasound only, and 2.3% for both. Positive predictive values for abnormal mammograms and biopsies were 4.9% and 26.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION Mammographic screening has been reported to reduce mortality up to 35% in western countries. However, data concerning Asian Chinese populations are meagre. Our Well Women Clinics pioneered large-scale self-referred breast screening in Hong Kong. Despite the lower incidence of breast cancers than in Occidental populations, our screening programme performed comparably to those in the West, and has improved over time. Our screening service for self-referred women detected breast cancers even at an early stage, which facilitated a better prognosis and more treatment options, whilst appearing to be highly acceptable to our community. Besides, it could provide training and expertise in breast radiology and mammography, which are essential prerequisites for establishing population screening.","Lui, C Y; Lam, H S; Chan, L K; Tam, K F; Chan, C M; Leung, T Y; Mak, K L",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,324,17

A/J- mice experimentally hyperimmunized with inactivated MHV3 (A/Ji) became resistant to challenge with this virus. BALB/c mice free of (BALB/c-) or naturally infected with (BALB/c+) coronavirus, or hyperimmunized with inactivated MHV3 (BALB/ci), were always fully susceptible. All susceptible mice developed an acute hepatitis with a high virus titre in the tissues. Resistance mice developed a mild disease in which the low virus titres detected in the tissues were cleared. After infection, interferon (IFN)-gamma synthesis in A/J- mice was lower than that in A/J+ and A/J mice; IFN-gamma synthesis was very high in BALB/c+ and BALB/ci mice, but low in BALB/c- mice. Studies of the anti-MHV3 effect induced in macrophages in vitro showed that only IFN-gamma-activated A/J mouse macrophages were able to restrict partially the growth of MHV3, regardless of whether the animals had been immunized. The effect occurred only when the cells were activated with IFN-gamma before virus infection. The results indicate that the resistance of A/J mice to our strain of MHV3 is not natural but is acquired after immunization, and that the mechanism involved is dependent on T cell activity, IFN-gamma production and the sensitivity of macrophages to IFN-gamma.","Lucchiari, M A; Martin, J P; Modolell, M; Pereira, C A",The Journal of general virology,324,28

Its incidence has increased in recent years. Epidemiologic analyses have provided insights into the possible etiology, but European data are scarce. METHODS We analyzed linked English-wide hospital admission data for Kawasaki disease in people younger than 18 years of age, during a 5-year period (1998-2003), relating incidence to geographic location, urbanization, deprivation, ethnicity, and to laboratory reports of respiratory infection. RESULTS There were 2432 admissions with Kawasaki disease in the study period for 1704 individuals. One thousand twenty-eight (60%) of the 1704 were male and 1228 (72%) were younger than 5 years of age. The annual age-specific incidence rate in those younger than 5 years was 8.39/100,000. Incidence rates in different areas of residence were significantly and independently related to both the degree of deprivation of the area and the proportion of the population in each area who were Chinese. After adjusting for the winter peaks in both the incidence of Kawasaki disease and respiratory virus infections, there was no correlation between Kawasaki disease and specific viruses. INTERPRETATION The previously reported increase in Kawasaki disease incidence in England has reached a plateau.

We investigated the remifentanil effect-site concentration in 50% (EC50) of the elderly patients undergoing nasal surgery for smooth emergence without cough and compared it with that of adult patients. METHODS Twenty-two elderly (aged 65-80 years) and 25 adult patients (aged 20-60 years) with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I/II undergoing nasal surgery were enrolled. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. Remifentanil EC50 and EC95 for preventing cough were determined using the modified Dixon's up-and-down method and isotonic regression with bootstrapping approach. Recovery profiles were also recorded. RESULTS With Dixon's up-and-down method, the EC50 of remifentanil in elderly patients (2.40±0.25 ng/mL) was not significantly different from that of adults (2.33±0.30 ng/mL) (P=0.687). With isotonic regression, the EC95 of remifentanil in elderly patients (3.32 [95% confidence interval: 3.06-3.38] ng/mL) was not significantly different from that of adults (3.30 [95% confidence interval: 2.96-3.37] ng/mL). However, eye opening time (14.1±3.8 vs 12.0±2.9 seconds), extubation time (17.2±4.1 vs 14.0±3.0 seconds), and postanesthesia care unit duration (44.5±7.6 vs 38.7±3.4 minutes) in elderly patients were significantly longer than those in adults (P<0.05). CONCLUSION Remifentanil EC50 for preventing cough after nasal surgery with sevoflurane anesthesia did not differ between elderly and adult patients. However, delayed awakening and respiratory adverse events may warrant attention in elderly patients.","Yoo, Ji Young; Kim, Jong Yeop; Kwak, Hyun Jeong; Lee, Dong Chul; Kim, Go Wun; Lee, Sook Young; Chae, Yun Jeong",Clinical interventions in aging,324,1

One of these, DIssF, is 3.6 kb in size and exhibits efficient packaging, whereas the other, DIssE, which is 2.3 kb, does not. For more precise mapping, a series of mutant DIssF RNAs with deletions within this 1,480-nucleotide region were constructed. After transfection of in vitro-synthesized mutant DI RNA in MHV-infected cells, the virus product was passaged several times. The efficiency of DI RNA packaging into MHV virions was then estimated by viral homologous interference activity and by analysis of intracellular virus-specific RNAs and virion RNA. The results indicated that an area of 190 nucleotides was necessary for packaging. A computer-generated secondary structural analysis of the A59 and JHM strains of MHV demonstrated that within this 190-nucleotide region a stable stem-loop of 69 nucleotides was common between the two viruses. A DIssE-derived DI DNA which had these 69 nucleotides inserted into the DIssE sequence demonstrated efficient DI RNA packaging. Site-directed mutagenic analysis showed that of these 69 nucleotides, the minimum sequence of the packaging signal was 61 nucleotides and that destruction of the secondary structure abolished packaging ability. These studies demonstrated that an MHV packaging signal was present within the 61 nucleotides, which are located on MHV genomic RNA 1,381 to 1,441 nucleotides upstream of the 3' end of gene 1.","Fosmire, J A; Hwang, K; Makino, S",Journal of virology,324,4

The results detected in 64 normal subjects and 50 patients with AIDS served as controls. RESULTS The numbers of CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), and CD(8)(+) lymphocytes all significantly decreased in acute phase of SARS patients compared with those in normal persons. Their findings was different from what we observed in patients with AIDS who had decreased CD(4)(+), but increased CD(8)(+) counts. The counts of CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), and CD(8)(+) lymphocytes decreased more apparently in patients with critical SARS. All the five patients who died had CD(4)(+) counts less than 200/microl. As the patients' conditions improved, the counts of CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), and CD(8)(+) gradually returned to normal.

DESIGN Prospective study. SAMPLE POPULATION CSF and serum samples from 67 cats. PROCEDURES CSF and serum samples were allocated into 4 groups: cats with FIP involving the CNS (n = 10), cats with FIP not involving the CNS (13), cats with CNS disorders caused by diseases other than FIP (29), and cats with diseases other than FIP and not involving the CNS (15). Cerebrospinal fluid was evaluated for concentrations of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and total protein. Anti-coronavirus IgG was measured in CSF and serum by indirect immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS CSF IgG (range of titers, 1:32 to 1:4,096) was detected in 12 cats, including 6 cats with neurologic manifestation of FIP, 4 cats with FIP not involving the CNS, and 2 cats with brain tumors. Cerebrospinal fluid IgG was detected only in cats with correspondingly high serum IgG titers (range, 1:4,096 to 1:16,384) and was positively correlated with serum IgG titers (r = 0.652; P < 0.01), but not with any other CSF parameter. Blood contamination of CSF resulted in < or = 333 erythrocytes/microL in cats with CSF IgG. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The correlation between serum and CSF IgG and the fact that CSF IgG was detected only in strongly seropositive cats suggested that CSF anti-coronavirus IgG was derived from blood. Measurement of anti-coronavirus IgG in CSF was of equivocal clinical use.","Boettcher, Irene C; Steinberg, Tanja; Matiasek, Kaspar; Greene, Craig E; Hartmann, Katrin; Fischer, Andrea",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,324,29

MethodsA prospective cohort of 332 COVID-19 patients was followed beyond one year. Plasma neutralizing activity was evaluated using HIV-based reporter pseudoviruses expressing different SARS-CoV-2 spikes and was longitudinally analyzed using mixed-effects models. FindingsLong-term neutralizing activity was stable beyond one year after infection in mild/asymptomatic and hospitalized participants. However, longitudinal models suggest that hospitalized individuals generate both short- and long-lived memory B cells, while outpatient responses were dominated by long-lived B cells. In both groups, vaccination boosted responses to natural infection, although viral variants, mainly B.1.351, reduced the efficacy of neutralization. Importantly, despite showing higher neutralization titers, hospitalized patients showed lower cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variant compared to outpatients. Multivariate analysis identified severity of primary infection as the factor that independently determines both the magnitude and the inferior cross-neutralization activity of long-term neutralizing responses. ConclusionsNeutralizing response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is heterogeneous in magnitude but stable beyond one year after infection. Vaccination boosts these long-lasting natural neutralizing responses, counteracting the significant resistance to neutralization of new viral variants. Severity of primary infection determines higher magnitude but poorer quality of long-term neutralizing responses.","Pradenas, Edwards; Trinité, Benjamin; Urrea, Víctor; Marfil, Silvia; Tarrés-Freixas, Ferran; Ortiz, Raquel; Rovirosa, Carla; Rodon, Jordi; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Segalés, Joaquim; Guallar, Victor; Valencia, Alfonso; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria; Noguera-Julian, Marc; Carrillo, Jorge; Paredes, Roger; Mateu, Lourdes; Chamorro, Anna; Toledo, Ruth; Massanella, Marta; Clotet, Bonaventura; Blanco, Julià",,324,31

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) refers to the property of certain atomic nuclei to absorb the energy of radio waves under a corresponding magnetic field. NMR forms the basis for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and, in a low-intensity form, for NMR therapy (tNMR). Since the circadian clock is bi-directionally intertwined with hypoxic signaling in vertebrates and mammals, we hypothesized that low intensity electromagnetic fields, such as tNMR, might not only affect circadian clocks but also Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;). As master regulator of the hypoxic signaling pathway, HIF-1&#945; is known to dampen the circadian amplitude under reduced oxygen availability, while the hypoxic response of cells and organisms, itself, is tightly clock controlled. In a first experiment, we investigated if tNMR is able to act as Zeitgeber for the core clock mechanism of unsynchronized zebrafish and mouse fibroblast cells, using direct light irradiation and treatment with the glucocorticoid Dexamethasone as references. tNMR significantly affected the cell autonomous clocks of unsynchronized mouse fibroblast cells NIH3-T3, but did not act as a Zeitgeber. Similar to light irradiation and in contrast to treatment with Dexamethasone, tNMR did not synchronize expression profiles of murine clock genes. However, irradiation with tNMR as well as light significantly altered mRNA and protein expression levels of Cryptochrome1, Cryptochrome2 and Clock1 for more than 24 h. Changes in mRNA and protein after different treatment durations, namely 6 and 12 h, appeared to be nonlinear. A nonlinear dose-response relationship is known as hallmark of electromagnetic field induced effects on biological systems. The most prominent alterations were detected in murine HIF-1&#945; protein, again in a nonlinear dose-response. In contrast to murine cells, zebrafish fibroblasts did not respond to tNMR at all. Light, a potent Zeitgeber for the peripheral clocks of fish, led to the expected synchronized clock gene oscillations of high amplitude, as did Dexamethasone. Hence, we conclude, mammalian peripheral clocks are more susceptible to tNMR than the direct light entrainable fish fibroblasts. Although light and tNMR did not act as Zeitgebers for the circadian clocks of unsynchronized murine cells, the significant observed effects might indicate downstream cell-physiological ramifications, which are worth future investigation. However, beside the effects tNMR exerts on the core clock mechanism of mammalian cells, the technology might be the first non-pharmacological approach to modify HIF-1&#945; protein in cells and tissues. HIF-1&#945; and the associated circadian clock play key roles in diseases with underlying ischemic background, such as infarct, stroke, and cancer and, also infectious diseases, such as Covid-19. Hence, low intensity magnetic fields such as tNMR might be of significant medical interest.","Thöni, Viktoria; Oliva, Regina; Mauracher, David; Egg, Margit",Chronobiol Int,324,24

This mirrors the well-studied exponential decline of both thymus volume and T-cell production, which halve every 16 years. COVID-19 can therefore be added to the list of other diseases with this property, including those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MERS-CoV, West Nile virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and certain cancers, such as chronic myeloid leukaemia and brain cancers. In addition, the incidence of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19 are both higher in men, consistent with the degree to which thymic involution (and the decrease in T-cell production with age) is more severe in men compared to women. Since these properties are shared with some non-contagious diseases, we hypothesized that the age dependence does not come from social-mixing patterns, i.e. that the probability of hospitalization given infection rises exponentially, doubling every 16 years. A Bayesian analysis of daily hospitalizations, incorporating contact matrices, found that this relationship holds for every age group except for the under 20s. While older adults have fewer contacts than young adults, our analysis suggests that there is an approximate cancellation between the effects of fewer contacts for the elderly and higher infectiousness due to a higher probability of developing severe disease. Our model fitting suggests under 20s have 49-75% additional immune protection beyond that predicted by strong thymus function alone, consistent with increased juvenile cross-immunity from other viruses. We found no evidence for differences between age groups in susceptibility to infection or infectiousness to others (given disease state), i.e. the only important factor in the age dependence of hospitalization rates is the probability of hospitalization given infection. These findings suggest the existence of a T-cell exhaustion threshold, proportional to thymic output and that clonal expansion of peripheral T-cells does not affect disease risk. The strikingly simple inverse relationship between risk and thymic T-cell output adds to the evidence that thymic involution is an important factor in the decline of the immune system with age and may also be an important clue in understanding disease progression, not just for COVID-19 but other diseases as well.","Palmer, Sam; Cunniffe, Nik; Donnelly, Ruairí",J R Soc Interface,324,1

It is based on (1) unsupervised representation learning of a Convolutional Neural Network and (2) the Gaussian Process method. The unsupervised representation learning employs self-supervision that does not require class labels, and the learned features are proven to achieve label-efficient classification. GP is a kernel-based Bayesian approach that also leads to data-efficient predictions with the added benefit of estimating each decision's uncertainty. Our novel framework combines these two elements in sequence to achieve highly data and label efficient classifications. Moreover, both elements are less sensitive to the prevalent and challenging class imbalance issue, thanks to the (1) feature learned without labels and (2) the Bayesian nature of GP. The GP-provided uncertainty estimates enable active learning by ranking samples based on the uncertainty and selectively labeling samples showing higher uncertainty. We apply this novel combination to the data-deficient and severely imbalanced case of COVID-19 chest X-ray classification. We demonstrate that only $\sim 10\%$ of the labeled data is needed to reach the accuracy from training all available labels. Its application to the COVID-19 data in a fully supervised classification scenario shows that our model, with a generic ResNet backbone, outperforms (COVID-19 case by 4\%) the state-of-the-art model with a highly tuned architecture.

Computational simulations have played an important role to predict the development of the current pandemic. Such simulations enable early indications on the future projections of the pandemic and is useful to estimate the efficiency of control action in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SEIR model is a well-known method used in computational simulations of infectious viral diseases and it has been widely used to model other epidemics such as Ebola, SARS, MERS, and influenza A. This paper presents a modified SEIRS model with additional exit conditions in the form of death rates and resusceptibility, where we can tune the exit conditions in the model to extend prediction on the current projections of the pandemic into three possible outcomes; death, recovery, and recovery with a possibility of resusceptibility. The model also considers specific information such as ageing factor of the population, time delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures, as well as resusceptibility with temporal immune response. Owing to huge variations in clinical symptoms exhibited by COVID-19, the proposed model aims to reflect better on the current scenario and case data reported, such that the spread of the disease and the efficiency of the control action taken can be better understood. The model is verified using two case studies based on the real-world data in South Korea and Northern Ireland.","Ng, Kok Yew; Gui, Meei Mei",Phys D Nonlinear Phenom,324,22

Recently, various deep learning (DL) researches based on the EEG signals have been proposed to detect fatigue conditions. The research presented in this paper proposes an EEG classification system for DD based on DL networks. However, the proposed DD system is mainly realized into two procedures; (i) data acquisition and (ii) model analysis. For the data acquisition procedure, two key steps are considered, which are the signal collection using a wearable Emotiv EPOC+ headset to record 14 channels of EEG, and the signal annotation. Furthermore, a data augmentation (DA) step has been added to the proposed system to overcome the problem of over-fitting and to improve accuracy. As regards the model analysis, a comparative study is also introduced in this paper to argue the choice of DL architecture and frameworks used in our DD system. In this sense, The proposed DD protocol makes use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture implemented using the Keras library. The results showed a high accuracy value (90.42%) in drowsy/awake discrimination and revealed the efficiency of the proposed DD system compared to other research works.","Chaabene, Siwar; Bouaziz, Bassem; Boudaya, Amal; Hökelmann, Anita; Ammar, Achraf; Chaari, Lotfi",Sensors (Basel),324,1

Infected children may be asymptomatic or present fever, dry cough, fatigue or gastrointestinal symptoms. The CDC recommends that clinicians should decide to test patients based on the presence of signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 42 children (the majority < 5 years of age) were referred, to our Pediatric Department, as possible cases of COVID-19 infection. Blood analysis, chest X-ray, and naso-oropharyngeal swab specimens for viral identification of COVID-19 were requested. RESULTS: None of the screened children resulted positive for COVID-19 infection. At first presentation, the most frequent signs and symptoms were: fever (71.4%), fatigue (35.7%) and cough (30.9%). An high C-reactive protein value and abnormalities of chest X-ray (bronchial wall thickening) were detected in 26.2% and 19% of patients, respectively. Almost half of patients (45.2%) required hospitalization in our Pediatric Unit and one patient in Intensive Care Unit. CONCLUSIONS: Testing people who meet the COVID-19 suspected case definition criteria is essential for clinical management and outbreak control. Children of all ages can get COVID-19, although they appear to be affected less frequently than adults, as reported in our preliminary survey. Further studies are needed to confirm our observations.","Nicoletti, Angela; Talarico, Valentina; Sabetta, Lucilla; Minchella, Pasquale; Colosimo, Manuela; Fortugno, Carmelo; Galati, Maria Concetta; Raiola, Giuseppe",Acta Biomed,324,20

The authors conducted a survey among health care workers (HCWs) and non-HCW populations in Khon Kaen, Thailand. RESULTS: A total of 805 participants participated. The prevalence of hand eczema in the study population was 20.87%. There were several risk factors, including working as a HCW, having a history of previous hand eczema, having underlying atopic dermatitis, wearing gloves in everyday life, and washing hands frequently (more than 10 times/day). Hand hygiene with alcohol-based products was shown to be a risk factor for hand eczema, (OR (95% CI) 1.86 (1.03-3.35), P = .04). CONCLUSION: In terms of hand eczema prevention, we suggest that the use of alcohol-based products should be discontinued if other handwashing methods are available. The following factors increase the risk of hand eczema: being a HCW, having previous hand eczema, and having underlying atopic dermatitis. Proper strategies in terms of hand eczema prevention should be addressed, especially in this group, since we need to continue performing hand hygiene during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Techasatian, Leelawadee; Thaowandee, Wilairat; Chaiyarit, Jitjira; Uppala, Rattapon; Sitthikarnkha, Phanthila; Paibool, Watuhatai; Charoenwat, Busara; Wongmast, Piyathida; Laoaroon, Napat; Suphakunpinyo, Chanyut; Kiatchoosakun, Pakaphan; Kosalaraksa, Pope",J Prim Care Community Health,324,24

This commentary introduces and discusses ‘curating' as a socio-material practice mediating between science and decision-making. It reflects on the current Covid-19 pandemic and compares ‘curational' aspects here to the field of natural catastrophe risk finance. As both areas address and try manage disasters, especially the space between scientific knowledge and economic and/or political decision-making becomes a neuralgic point. With a particular focus on catastrophe simulation modelling, some issues of the natural catastrophe field might be addressed for epidemic crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The commentary suggests putting a deeper emphasis on, and encourages a research focus towards, the ‘curation’ between science and politics to improve decision-making for socio-material disasters.","Kob, Julius",J.

Immune regulation plays a key role in anti-tumour therapy. The present study explored the anti-tumour effect of ESPs released by Angiostrongylus cantonensis. In Hepa1-6 mouse tumour models, ESPs significantly reduced tumour growth. Tumour-bearing mice treated with ESPs had significantly higher CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell counts than those treated with Freund's adjuvant. In vitro, human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells, human lung cancer A549 cells, and normal human liver HL-7702 cells were co-incubated with ESPs for 24 h and 48 h. ESPs significantly accelerated HepG2 apoptosis but had no inhibitory effect on the proliferation of A549 and HL-7702 cells. Apoptotic HepG2 cells displayed condensed nuclei, apoptotic bodies, and swollen endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related factors activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) in HepG2 cells increased with increasing ESP concentration and treatment time. Calreticulin (CRT) is a key effector protein of ESPs, and recombinant calreticulin (rCRT) was produced in BL21 Escherichia coli (E. coli). In contrast to ESPs, rCRT markedly reduced the proliferation of HepG2 cells. The expression levels of ATF6 and CHOP in HepG2 cells treated with 30 µg/mL rCRT significantly increased at 48 h. Notably, these findings synergistically suggest that ESPs and rCRT are promising candidates for anti-tumour immunotherapy.","Lu, Yajun; Yang, Yuxiao; Yang, Siqi; Xia, Qianfeng",,324,16

In comparison to the period not affected by COVID-19 measures, mean concentrations of pollutants were increased during the first lockdown period; when the number of COVID-19 patients increased sharply compared to the other periods, the mean surface concentrations of NO2, SO2, and CO were decreased and concentrations of other pollutants (i.e., O3, PM10, and PM2.5) were increased during the second lockdown period compared to the corresponding period in 2019. In the third period, the mean concentrations were decreased compared to the corresponding period in 2019. For the full period, decreases in mean concentrations of O3, NO2, SO2, CO, and PM10 and increases in PM2.5 were observed during the COVID-19 crisis, compared to 2019. Overall, the strongest reductions, 12% and 6%, respectively, were observed for CO and NO2, pointing to reduced emissions from traffic as a result of lockdown measures. The concentrations of other pollutants changed little, suggesting that the lockdown measures did not result in strong changes in the emissions from stationary sources.","Borhani, Faezeh; Shafiepour Motlagh, Majid; Stohl, Andreas; Rashidi, Yousef; Ehsani, Amir Houshang",Environ Monit Assess,324,16

For the software, to move towards a full automation, we propose a novel deep learning framework -- semi-ResNeXt-Unet for semi-supervised vein segmentation from ultrasound images. From which, the depth information of vein is calculated and used to enable automated navigation for the puncturing unit. VeniBot is validated on 40 volunteers, where ultrasound images can be collected successfully. For the vein segmentation validation, the proposed semi-ResNeXt-Unet improves the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) by 5.36%, decreases the centroid error by 1.38 pixels and decreases the failure rate by 5.60%, compared to fully-supervised ResNeXt-Unet.","Chen, Yu; Wang, Yuxuan; Lai, Bolin; Chen, Zijie; Cao, Xu; Ye, Nanyang; Ren, Zhongyuan; Zhao, Junbo; Zhou, Xiao-Yun; Qi, Peng",,324,20

METHODS: The study used a quantitative, cross-sectional approach. Data was collected online using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18); the Coronavirus Awareness Scale-6 (CAS-6) and a questionnaire that included psychological and sociodemographic questions. The total sample size consisted of 1559 respondents from Honduras (34%), Chile (29%), Costa Rica (17%), Mexico (11%), and Spain (9%). RESULTS: The most common stress domains correspond to family (22.97%), financial (22.53%), academic (16.47%), leisure time constraints (14.23%), health (12.48%), peer group (7.63%), and religious concerns (3.69%). These domains are significantly associated with the respondent's country, sex, employment status, and being or not a health worker. Respondents who reported confinement stress also reported higher scores in anxiety, depression, and somatization. The Global Severity Index was significantly predicted by confinement stress, health, academic, and leisure time-related stress, sex, age, being a health worker, COVID-19 Personal Concern, and Perceived Seriousness. Non-significant predictors were employment status, the number of people at home, presence of older adults and children at home, financial, peer group, family, and religious concerns; the regression model had an R2 of 0.26. Similar analyses were conducted for somatization, depression, and anxiety subscales. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on the mental health of the general population, particularly regarding anxiety, depression, and somatization. Specific populations, such as women and healthcare workers, are at particular risk of suffering a deterioration in mental wellbeing. The implications of the study for public policy are discussed.","Landa-Blanco, Miguel; Mejía, Claudio J; Landa-Blanco, Ana Lucía; Martínez-Martínez, Carlos A; Vásquez, Daniela; Vásquez, Gabriela; Moraga-Vargas, Paulo; Echenique, Yaraní; Del Cid, Glenda M; Montoya, Brayan D",Soc Sci Med,324,7

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. METHODS: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number (Rt) in Wuhan declined from 2·35 (95% CI 1·15-4·77) 1 week before travel restrictions were introduced on Jan 23, 2020, to 1·05 (0·41-2·39) 1 week after. Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.

To that end, more reliable and easy-to-use diagnostic tests are necessary. Young children are still not eligible to vaccination and it is important to find a way to easily test this key population regularly. With that in mind, we evaluated a new innovative easy two-step self-test named COVID-VIRO ALL IN(R) developed by AAZ that uses a sampling nasal sponge instead of a classic nasal swab. Mirroring the previous study conducted on the first generation of COVID-VIRO(R) antigenic self-test, we first performed a multicentre, prospective study on 124 adults and children, in a point-of-care setting. Sensitivity, specificity and overall acceptance of the COVID-VIRO ALL IN(R) antigen self-test compared to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples were evaluated at 93.02%, 100% and 97,5%, respectively. We then performed a multicentre, prospective, usability study to evaluate the ease of use of COVID-VIRO ALL IN(R) in real life on 68 laypersons, all adults. Globally, 99% of them considered the instructions material good, 98% executed the procedure well, and all of them interpreted the results correctly. The usability was then specifically investigated on 40 children and teenagers participants, comparing both COVID-VIRO(R) first generation and the new COVID-VIRO ALL IN(R). All of them found COVID-VIRO ALL IN(R) much easier to use and much more comfortable. For young children, the COVID-VIRO ALL IN(R) self-test appears to be safer (less risk of trauma compare to nasal swabs and no liquid exposure) easier to use than classic COVID self-tests and giving immediate result which is not the case for RT-PCR done on saliva samples (currently done in routine for kids in French schools). It could be an adapted tool for future mass screening campaigns in schools or at home under adult supervision for kids from the age of 3.","prazuck, thierry; Gravier, Anne; Pires-Roteira, Daniela; Theillay, Aurelie; Pallay, Sandra; Colin, Mathilda; Serreau, Raphael; Hocqueloux, Laurent; Cassuto, Nino Guy",,324,20

It is found that the 2020 winter weather in the region of Wuhan (Hubei, Central China)-where the virus first broke out in December and spread widely from January to February 2020-was strikingly similar to that of the Northern Italian provinces of Milan, Brescia and Bergamo, where the pandemic broke out from February to March. The statistical analysis was extended to cover the United States of America, which overtook Italy and China as the country with the highest number of confirmed COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) cases, and then to the entire world. The found correlation patterns suggest that the COVID-19 lethality significantly worsens (4 times on average) under weather temperatures between 4 &#8728; C and 12 &#8728; C and relative humidity between 60% and 80%. Possible co-factors such as median population age and air pollution were also investigated suggesting an important influence of the former but not of the latter, at least, on a synoptic scale. Based on these results, specific isotherm world maps were generated to locate, month by month, the world regions that share similar temperature ranges. From February to March, the 4-12 &#8728; C isotherm zone extended mostly from Central China toward Iran, Turkey, West-Mediterranean Europe (Italy, Spain and France) up to the United State of America, optimally coinciding with the geographic regions most affected by the pandemic from February to March. It is predicted that in the spring, as the weather gets warm, the pandemic will likely worsen in northern regions (United Kingdom, Germany, East Europe, Russia and North America) while the situation will likely improve in the southern regions (Italy and Spain). However, in autumn, the pandemic could come back and affect the same regions again. The Tropical Zone and the entire Southern Hemisphere, but in restricted colder southern regions, could avoid a strong pandemic because of the sufficiently warm weather during the entire year and because of the lower median age of their population.

However, existing studies have not shown an expected prevalence of asthmatic individuals among COVID-19 patients. Certain aspects of type 2 immune response, including type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, etc.) and accumulation of eosinophils, might provide potential protective effects against COVID-19. Furthermore, conventional therapeutics for asthma, including inhaled corticosteroids, allergen immunotherapy (AIT), and anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, might also reduce the risks of asthmatics suffering infection of the virus through alleviating inflammation or enhancing antiviral defense.

Patients with Parkinson's disease were divided into 24 RBD-negative (PDRBD-) and 13 RBD-positive cases (PDRBD+) and a comparator group of 22 iRBD patients. We used 11C-donepezil PET/CT to assess cholinergic (parasympathetic) innervation, 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy to measure cardiac sympathetic innervation, neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to measure the integrity of locus coeruleus pigmented neurons, and 18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (FDOPA) PET to assess putaminal dopamine storage capacity. Colon volume and transit times were assessed with CT scans and radiopaque markers. Imaging data from the three groups were interrogated with ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests corrected for multiple comparisons. The PDRBD- and PDRBD+ groups showed similar marked reductions in putaminal FDOPA-specific uptake, whereas two-thirds of iRBD patients had normal scans (P < 10-13, ANOVA). When compared to the PDRBD- patients, the PDRBD+ and iRBD patients showed reduced mean MIBG heart:mediastinum ratios (P < 10-5, ANOVA) and colon 11C-donepezil standard uptake values (P = 0.008, ANOVA). The PDRBD+ group trended towards a reduced mean MRI locus coeruleus: pons ratio compared to PDRBD- (P = 0.07, t-test). In comparison to the other groups, the PDRBD+ group also had enlarged colon volumes (P < 0.001, ANOVA) and delayed colonic transit times (P = 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis). The combined iRBD and PDRBD+ patient data were compatible with a body-first trajectory, characterized by initial loss of cardiac MIBG signal and 11C-colonic donepezil signal followed by loss of putaminal FDOPA uptake. In contrast, the PDRBD- data were compatible with a brain-first trajectory, characterized by primary loss of putaminal FDOPA uptake followed by a secondary loss of cardiac MIBG signal and 11C-donepezil signal. These findings support the existence of brain-first and body-first subtypes of Parkinson's disease.","Horsager, Jacob; Andersen, Katrine B; Knudsen, Karoline; Skjærbæk, Casper; Fedorova, Tatyana D; Okkels, Niels; Schaeffer, Eva; Bonkat, Sarah K; Geday, Jacob; Otto, Marit; Sommerauer, Michael; Danielsen, Erik H; Bech, Einar; Kraft, Jonas; Munk, Ole L; Hansen, Sandra D; Pavese, Nicola; Göder, Robert; Brooks, David J; Berg, Daniela; Borghammer, Per",Brain,324,1

METHODS: Single-centre, single-surgeon retrospective chart review of consecutive patients with high myopic FTMH who underwent surgery with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Patients were divided in group 1 (naïve) and group 2 (persistent). Quantitative and qualitative variables were analysed, compared among groups and correlated with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). RESULTS: Postoperatively, FTMH resolved in 28/31 eyes in group 1 (90%) and in 10/11 eyes in group 2 (91%), without significant differences (p = 0.954). None of the preoperative anatomical variables analysed showed significant association with preoperative BCVA. Intraoperatively, no significant complications were registered. Postoperatively, BCVA improved significantly in the studied population (p < 0.001). Preoperative factors associated with better postoperative BCVA were the presence of intraretinal cystoid spaces (p = 0.028) and elevated FTMH borders (p = 0.005). Preoperative dome-shaped macula was associated with significantly worse postoperative BCVA (p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: The use of PRGF as adjuvant to vitrectomy showed to be reproducible, straightforward and efficient, with primary anatomical success rate comparable to other surgical approaches and lower risk of complications.","Figueroa, Marta S; Mora Cantallops, Arnau; Virgili, Gianni; Govetto, Andrea",Eur J Ophthalmol,324,16

In this paper, the SEIR model is used to fit the number of confirmed cases in each province in China, and the reduction rate of the basic reproduction number is used to measure the actual score of the control effect of COVID-19. The potential capacity of prevention and control of epidemics, in theory, is constructed, and we use the difference between theoretical ability and actual score to measure the ability of governance of public health. We found that there were significant differences between actual effect and theoretical ability in various regions, and governance capabilities were an important reason leading to this difference, which was not consistent with the level of economic development. The balance of multiple objectives, the guiding ideology of emphasizing medical treatment over prevention, the fragmentation of the public health system, and the insufficiency of prevention and control ability in primary public health systems seriously affected the government's ability to respond to public health emergencies.","Fang, Yingfeng; Zhang, Fen; Zhou, Chenyu; Chen, Ming",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),324,30

AIMS: To assess length of treatment persistence of first anti-TNF therapy and influencing factors used in the standard care of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. METHODS: Single-centre, retrospective study from a register including patients who received anti-TNF therapy in the last 20 years at the study centre. Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test was used to describe treatment persistence. With multivariable Cox regression analysis, risk factors for treatment failure were investigated. RESULTS: Five hundred thirty-eight patients (CD, Crohn's disease: 367, UC, ulcerative colitis: 147, inflammatory bowel disease unclassified: 24) with a median follow-up of 8.1 years were included. Median (95% confidence interval) treatment persistence in the total cohort was 2.3 years (28 [22, 38] months), and nearly half of patients withdrew from treatment within 2 years. Male patients were treated longer than females (male: 37 [25, 48] months, female: 23 [14, 33] months, P = 0.002). Treatment persistence was longer in CD compared to UC (CD: 39 [30, 50] months, UC: 13 [9, 19] months, P < 0.001), and patients with CD remained longer on adalimumab than on infliximab treatment (adalimumab: 67 [55, 95] months, infliximab: 19 [14, 31] months, P < 0.001). Treatment failure (52%) and side effects (25%) were the most common reasons for withdrawal from therapy; 14% withdrew due to remission. Female sex was identified as independent predictor for treatment failure in UC (hazard ratio [CI]: 1.73 [1.02-2.92], P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment persistence of first anti-TNF therapy was limited in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily due to treatment failure and side effects.","Blesl, Andreas; Binder, Lukas; Högenauer, Christoph; Wenzl, Heimo; Borenich, Andrea; Pregartner, Gudrun; Berghold, Andrea; Mestel, Sigrid; Kump, Patrizia; Baumann-Durchschein, Franziska; Petritsch, Wolfgang",Aliment. pharmacol. ther,324,16

To address the underlying etiology, we examined post mortem thoracic lymph nodes and spleens in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed the absence of germinal centers and a striking reduction in Bcl-6+ germinal center B cells but preservation of AID+ B cells. Absence of germinal centers correlated with an early specific block in Bcl-6+ TFH cell differentiation together with an increase in T-bet+ TH1 cells and aberrant extra-follicular TNF-&#945; accumulation. Parallel peripheral blood studies revealed loss of transitional and follicular B cells in severe disease and accumulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific ""disease-related"" B cell populations. These data identify defective Bcl-6+ TFH cell generation and dysregulated humoral immune induction early in COVID-19 disease, providing a mechanistic explanation for the limited durability of antibody responses in coronavirus infections, and suggest that achieving herd immunity through natural infection may be difficult.","Kaneko, Naoki; Kuo, Hsiao-Hsuan; Boucau, Julie; Farmer, Jocelyn R; Allard-Chamard, Hugues; Mahajan, Vinay S; Piechocka-Trocha, Alicja; Lefteri, Kristina; Osborn, Matthew; Bals, Julia; Bartsch, Yannic C; Bonheur, Nathalie; Caradonna, Timothy M; Chevalier, Josh; Chowdhury, Fatema; Diefenbach, Thomas J; Einkauf, Kevin; Fallon, Jon; Feldman, Jared; Finn, Kelsey K; Garcia-Broncano, Pilar; Hartana, Ciputra Adijaya; Hauser, Blake M; Jiang, Chenyang; Kaplonek, Paulina; Karpell, Marshall; Koscher, Eric C; Lian, Xiaodong; Liu, Hang; Liu, Jinqing; Ly, Ngoc L; Michell, Ashlin R; Rassadkina, Yelizaveta; Seiger, Kyra; Sessa, Libera; Shin, Sally; Singh, Nishant; Sun, Weiwei; Sun, Xiaoming; Ticheli, Hannah J; Waring, Michael T; Zhu, Alex L; Alter, Galit; Li, Jonathan Z; Lingwood, Daniel; Schmidt, Aaron G; Lichterfeld, Mathias; Walker, Bruce D; Yu, Xu G; Padera, Robert F",Cell,324,20

The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the number of emergency room patients at the time of the pandemic in order to draw conclusions about the influence of the COVID 19 pandemic on the number of patients in an emergency department. Materials and methods: With this descriptive epidemiologic study we collected and analyzed anonymized patient-related data of 19,357 cases presenting to the emergency department of the Klinikum rechts der Isar (Munich) from 01 February 2019 to 30 April 2019 and from 01 February 2020 to 30 April 2020. Results: Despite an increase in the number of patients from 2019 to 2020, there was a significant drop in the number of emergencies from February to March 2020 and proceeding in April to a level below that of 2019. This was particularly observed in the field of trauma surgery, with a 40% decrease in the number of patients. With regard to the individual complaint patterns in March 2020, it was found that an increased incidence of malaise (+47%) and breathing problems (+36%) was recorded, whereas back pain (-41%), wounds (-29%), thoracic (-24%) and abdominal pain (-23%) were significantly less common than in the previous year. In terms of the severity of the complaints, the decline was mainly due to complaints with a low degree of urgency. Conclusion: In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic we observed a significant decline in the number of patients in one of the largest emergency rooms in Munich. This has to be avoided with existing hospital capacities, in order to prevent potential damage to health caused by postponed or missing emergency presentations.","Tschaikowsky, T; Becker von Rose, A; Consalvo, S; Pflüger, P; Barthel, P; Spinner, C D; Knier, B; Kanz, K-G; Dommasch, M",Notf Rett Med,324,16

The phenomenon depends crucially on the `hairs', as well as on the nature of the compact object. It turns out that the presence of extra dimension affects both these properties, by incorporating an extra tidal charge for braneworld black holes and also by introducing quantum effects, leading to the possible existence of exotic compact objects. It turns out that the phasing information from tidal heating in the gravitational wave waveform can constrain the tidal charge inherited from extra dimension to a value $\sim 10^{-6}$, the most stringent constraint, to date. Moreover, second-order effects in tidal heating for exotic compact objects, also reveal an oscillatory behavior with respect to spin, which has unique signatures.","Chakraborty, Sumanta; Datta, Sayak; Sau, Subhadip",,324,25

This study identifies comorbidities that predict death among a large sample of COVID-19 patients from Nigeria. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of medical records for 2184 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Lagos, southwest Nigeria. Extracted data included age, sex, severity of condition at presentation and self-reported comorbidities. The outcomes of interest were death or discharge from facility. RESULTS: Most of the cases were male (65.8%) and the median age was 43 years (IQR: 33-55). Four hundred and ninety-two patients (22.5%) had at least one comorbidity and the most common amongst them were hypertension (74.2%) and diabetes (30.3%). The mortality rate was 3.3% and a significantly higher proportion of patients with comorbidities died compared to those with none. The comorbidities that predicted death were hypertension (OR: 2.21, 95%CI: 1.22-4.01), diabetes (OR: 3.69, 95% CI: 1.99-6.85), renal disease (OR: 12.53, 95%CI: 1.97-79.56), cancer (OR: 14.12, 95% CI: 2.03-98.19) and HIV (OR: 1.77-84.15].

The impact of national social distancing on the spread of common respiratory virus infections has rarely been investigated. We evaluated the weekly proportion of negative respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results and weekly positive rates of each respiratory virus during the social distancing period (10th-41st weeks of 2020) and the corresponding period in different years, utilizing the national respiratory virus surveillance dataset reported by the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The proportions of negative respiratory virus PCR test results increased up to 87.8% and 86.1% during level 3 and level 2 of the social distancing period, respectively. The higher the level of social distancing, the higher the proportion of negative respiratory virus PCR test results. During the social distancing period, the mean weekly positive rates for parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, human coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus were significantly lower than those during the same period in 2015-2019 (0.1% vs. 9.3%, P <0.001; 0.1% vs. 7.2%, P <0.001; 0.4% vs. 2.3%, P <0.001; and 0.2% vs. 5.3%, P <0.001, respectively). The mean positive rate for rhinovirus/enterovirus during level 3 social distancing was lower than that in the same period in 2015-2019 (8.5% vs. 19.0%, P <0.001), but the rate during level 1 social distancing was higher than that in the same period in 2015-2019 (38.3% vs. 19.4%, P <0.001).

However, the diagnosis of IIVDE is challenging because the prognosis and imaging characteristics are poorly characterized. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the clinical and imaging characteristics of tentatively diagnosed IIVDE in dogs to assess the prognostic utility of neurological grade and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. METHODS: Twenty dogs were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: Nonchondrodystrophic breeds (n = 16) were more predisposed than chondrodystrophic breeds. Most dogs showed acute onset of clinical signs. Neurological examination at admission showed predominant non-ambulatory paraparesis (n = 9); paresis (n = 16) was confirmed more frequently than paralysis (n = 4). Follow-up neurological examination results were only available for 11 dogs, ten of whom showed neurological improvement and 8 showed successful outcomes at 1 month. The characteristic MRI findings include thoracic vertebra (T)2 hyperintense, T1 hypointense, intramedullary linear tracts with reduced disc volume, and cleft of the annulus fibrosus. None of the MRI measurements were significantly correlated with neurological grade at admission. Neurological grade did not differ according to the presence of parenchymal hemorrhage, parenchymal contrast enhancement, and meningeal contrast enhancement. Neurological grades at admission showed a statistical correlation with those observed at the 1-month follow-up (r = 0.814, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: IIVDE is a rare form of disc extrusion commonly experienced after physical activity or trauma and most frequently affects the cranial-cervical and thoracolumbar regions of nonchondrodystrophic dog breeds. Neurological score at admission emerged as a more useful prognostic indicator than MRI findings in dogs with suspected IIVDE.","Kim, Jaehwan; Kim, Hyoju; Hwang, Jeongyeon; Eom, Kidong",J Vet Sci,324,30

In contrast to other dental clinics, the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (Germany) decided not to limit dental treatment to emergencies alone, but to continue dental care for all patients, with increased safety measures. As such, health care professionals may be exposed to additional physical and mental stress. The aim of this study was to assess the perspectives of all persons involved in dental care (dentists, dental assistants, students, and patients) regarding the aspects of safety measures, anxiety about self-infection and infecting others, and other prospects in the period March to December 2020 using a questionnaire. Data collection was performed between 14 December 2020 and 23 January 2021. A total of 35 dentists (response rate of 79.5%), 23 dental assistants (65.7%), 84 students (80%), and 51 patients (21.8%) completed the survey. The patients did not notice any changes in the care received. Dentists and dental assistants reported a higher workload due to additional safety measures. The majority of dentists, students, and patients agreed that normal patient care was maintained. One-third of dental assistants would have preferred emergency treatment alone and expressed significantly higher anxiety about COVID-19 infection than all other groups (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, all groups showed a predominantly positive perspective on dental care, and anxiety about self-infection and infecting others was especially low. However, additional measures are time-consuming and compound daily patient care. This concept, based on well-established infection control, might be a viable proposal for current and future pandemics.","Schlenz, M. A.; Schmidt, A.; Wostmann, B.; May, A.; Howaldt, H.

METHODS: Data from post-session surveys were analyzed to assess participant satisfaction, knowledge gaps, change in knowledge, and anticipated changes in practice as a result of Project ECHO COVID-19. A content analysis was conducted of the 243 questions and concerns posted by over 2000 participants in the Question and Answer function of Zoom during the first 8 sessions (March 4-April 29, 2020). RESULTS: Of 5243 registrants, 49% attended at least one session. Respondents agreed or strongly agreed that didactic sessions (97%) and case presentations (96%) met their learning needs; 93% reported gaining new knowledge, and 88% would implement that knowledge. Only 32% and 53% of respondents anticipated changing workflows and adapting to telehealth, respectively, despite the need for both as the pandemic continued. The content analysis identified 3 categories: clinical operations (eg, testing, triage, telehealth, billing); patient care (diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, management of high-risk vulnerable populations); and epidemiology (viral spread, implications for public health). CONCLUSIONS: Care of vulnerable populations and clinical operations should be addressed when planning education and clinical interventions for public health crises. Adapting the Project ECHO model to be more scalable was an effective means of creating a community of practice among health professionals when evidence-based guidance was not available to manage the implications of a pandemic.","Thies, Kathleen M; Gonzalez, Melanie; Porto, Ariel; Ashley, Karen L; Korman, Stephanie; Lamb, Mandy",J Prim Care Community Health,324,26

(2) Methods: We used a dynamic agent-based population model to compare different vaccination strategies targeted to the elderly (65 &gt;= years), middle aged (45-64 years), younger (15-44 years), vulnerable (risk of severe disease due to comorbidities), and healthcare workers (HCW). First, outcomes were optimized for an initially available vaccine batch for 200,000 individuals. Second, stepwise optimization was performed deriving a prioritization sequence for 2.45 million individuals, maximizing the reduction in total hospitalizations and deaths compared to no vaccination. We considered sterilizing and non-sterilizing immunity, assuming a 70% effectiveness. (3) Results: Maximum reduction of hospitalizations and deaths was achieved by starting vaccination with the elderly and vulnerable followed by middle-aged, HCW, and younger individuals. Optimizations for vaccinating 2.45 million individuals yielded the same prioritization and avoided approximately one third of deaths and hospitalizations. Starting vaccination with HCW leads to slightly smaller reductions but maximizes occupational safety. (4) Conclusion: To minimize COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths, our study shows that elderly and vulnerable persons should be prioritized for vaccination until further vaccines are available.","Jahn, B.; Sroczynski, G.; Bicher, M.; Rippinger, C.; Muhlberger, N.; Santamaria, J.; Urach, C.; Schomaker, M.; Stojkov, I.; Schmid, D.; Weiss, G.; Wiedermann, U.; Redlberger-Fritz, M.; Druml, C.; Kretzschmar, M.; Paulke-Korinek, M.; Ostermann, H.; Czasch, C.; Endel, G.; Bock, W.; Popper, N.; Siebert, U.",Vaccines (Basel),324,24

Since Stevens first introduced Sub-Tenon's anaesthesia into cataract surgery it has shown itself to be a safe, simple, and efficient technique. The advantages of this type of block are comparable to those of sharp needle anaesthesia and complications are minimal. Several studies have found that the anaesthesia provided by Sub-Tenon's capsule injection is as good as or better for cataract surgery than that achieved by retrobulbar injection, but the efficacy of Sub-Tenon's block in vitreoretinal surgery is less well established. Methods. We performed 50 vitreoretinal procedures; 50 eyes received a Sub-Tenon's injection of a 5 ml mixture (50:50) of lidocaine and ropivacaine, plus 15 IU mL-1 of Hyaluronidase. Results. In 45 cases, only one injection was needed to achieve sufficient anaesthesia and akinesia; in 5 cases a second injection was performed five minutes after the first. Mean surgical time was 45.7 minutes. After surgery, each patient was asked to indicate his value on the VAS pain scale. Mean VAS degree was 2.4. In 7 cases, VAS was > 3 and the pain was successfully managed with the administration of paracetamol in the postoperative period. No light perception was detected at the end of surgery in 33 patients. All cases with 2 injections had no light perception at the end of surgery. Anaesthesia lasted throughout the surgery in all cases. The surgeon performed all surgery comfortably and with no difficulty. Conclusions. According to our experience and to a growing body of evidence, Sub-Tenon's anaesthesia appears to be a safe, simple, versatile, and effective technique and should be considered as a real alternative method of anaesthesia in vitreoretinal surgery.","Franco, Fabrizio; Vicchio, Lidia; Barbera, Giuseppe Ruben; Virgili, Gianni; Giansanti, Fabrizio",Rom J Ophthalmol,324,20

The study aimed to provide data on cannabis use and self-reported behavioral changes among MCUs with preexisting chronic conditions in response to the pandemic. METHODS: An internet-based questionnaire was administered to adults &#8805;18 who self-reported medicinal cannabis use within the past year. Data are from respondents between March 21 and April 23, 2020; response rate was 83.3%. Health conditions and cannabis frequency, route, and patterns of use were assessed via the COVID-19 Cannabis Health Questionnaire (Vidot et al. 2020). RESULTS: Participants (N = 1202) were predominantly non-Hispanic white (82.5%) and 52.0% male (mean age 47.2 years). Mental health (76.7%), pain (43.7%), cardiometabolic (32.9%), respiratory (16.8%), and autoimmune (12.2%) conditions were most reported. Those with mental health conditions reported increased medicinal cannabis use by 91% since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic compared to those with no mental health conditions (adjusted odds ratio: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.38-2.65). 6.8% reported suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Two percent (2.1%) have been tested for COVID-19 with only 1 positive test result. Some MCUs (16%) changed their route of cannabis administration, switching to nonsmoking forms. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of MCUs reported at least one preexisting chronic health condition. Over half report fear of COVID-19 diagnosis and giving the virus to someone else; yet only some switched from smoking to nonsmoking forms of cannabis. Clinicians may consider asking about cannabis use among their patients, particularly those with chronic health conditions.","Vidot, Denise C; Islam, Jessica Y; Harrell, Melissa B; Rao, Devika R; Chavez, Jennifer V; Hlaing, WayWay M; Weiner, Michelle; Messiah, Sarah E",J Addict Dis,324,15

Through electrophysiology and fluorescence spectroscopy experiments, we show that even in the absence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, the S1 subunit from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to neutral phospholipid membranes leads to their mechanical destabilization and permeabilization. A similar cytotoxic effect of the protein was seen in human lung epithelial cells. A monoclonal antibody generated toward the S1 subunit alleviates to a considerable extent the destabilizing potential of the protein in such model membranes. Finally, we demonstrate the proof-of-concept capability of an &#945;-hemolysin (&#945;-HL) protein nanopore to detect in aqueous buffer and real time the region-binding domain of the S1 subunit from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by monitoring its immunological interaction with a target antibody. Our results may offer new perspectives in understanding the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, its treatment, and real-time detection.","Asandei, Alina; Mereuta, Loredana; Schiopu, Irina; Park, Jonggwan; Seo, Chang Ho; Park, Yoonkyung; Luchian, Tudor",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),324,16

This final project report presents the detailed design process of a hydraulic soft actuator powered robotic fish for aquatic creature study capable of swimming along the 3D trajectory. The robotic fish is designed based on the analysis of the pro and cons of existing designs. Except for the mechanical and electronic designs and manufacturing method of crucial components, a simplified open-loop control algorithm was designed to check the functionality of the application board and microcontroller in the Proteus simulation environment. As the key component of the robotic fish, Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations were conducted to visualise the soft actuator's deformation under different pressure to validate the design. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were also conducted to improve the hydrodynamic efficiency of the shape of robotic fish. Although physical manufacturing is impossible due to the pandemic, the simulations show overall good performance in terms of control, actuation, and hydrodynamic efficiency.","Hou, Ningzhe",,324,32

METHODS: This is a multi-center retrospective observational study involving 59 Italian centers. We retrospectively reviewed the prevalence of interstitial pneumonia detected during the COVID period (between March 16 and 27, 2020) and compared to a pre-COVID period (January-February 2020) and a control time (in 2019). The diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia was done considering lung alterations of CT of PET. RESULTS: Overall, [18F]FDG PET/CT was performed on 4008 patients in the COVID period, 19,267 in the pre-COVID period, and 5513 in the control period. The rate of interstitial pneumonia suspicious for COVID-19 was significantly higher during the COVID period (7.1%) compared with that found in the pre-COVID (5.35%) and control periods (5.15%) (p < 0.001). Instead, no significant difference among pre-COVID and control periods was present. The prevalence of interstitial pneumonia detected at PET/CT was directly associated with geographic virus diffusion, with the higher rate in Northern Italy. Among 284 interstitial pneumonia detected during COVID period, 169 (59%) were FDG-avid (average SUVmax of 4.1). CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase of interstitial pneumonia incidentally detected with [18F]FDG PET/CT has been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. A majority of interstitial pneumonia were FDG-avid. Our results underlined the importance of paying attention to incidental CT findings of pneumonia detected at PET/CT, and these reports might help to recognize early COVID-19 cases guiding the subsequent management.","Albano, Domenico; Bertagna, Francesco; Alongi, Pierpaolo; Baldari, Sergio; Baldoncini, Alfonso; Bartolomei, Mirco; Boccaletto, Franco; Boero, Michele; Borsatti, Eugenio; Bruno, Andrea; Burroni, Luca; Capoccetti, Francesca; Castellani, Massimo; Cervino, Anna Rita; Chierichetti, Franca; Ciarmiello, Andrea; Corso, Angelo; Cuocolo, Alberto; De Rimini, Maria Luisa; Deandreis, Desiree039; Dottorini, Massimo Eugenio; Esposito, Filomena; Farsad, Mohsen; Gasparini, Massimo; Grana, Chiara Maria; Gregianin, Michele; Guerra, Luca; Loreti, Fabio; Lupi, Andrea; Martino, Gianluigi; Milan, Elisa; Modoni, Sergio; Morbelli, Silvia; Muni, Alfredo; Nicolai, Emanuele; Palumbo, Barbara; Papa, Sergio; Papaleo, Alberto; Pellerito, Riccardo; Poti, Carlo; Romano, Pasquale; Rossetti, Claudio; Rossini, Pierluigi; Rubini, Giuseppe; Ruffini, Livia; Sacchetti, Gianmauro; Savelli, Giordano; Schiavariello, Saverio; Sciagrà, Roberto; Sciuto, Rosa",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,324,20

The maximal information coefficients ranged from 0.76 to 1.00, which indicated that the public's perceptions were significantly associated with the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of the participants had sufficient COVID-19 protection knowledge and skills and were able to avoid risky behaviors. Thus, it is necessary to apply different health education measures tailored to work and study resumption for specific populations to improve their self-protection and, ultimately, to prevent a possible rebound of COVID-19.","Cui, Tingting; Yang, Guoping; Ji, Lili; Zhu, Lin; Zhen, Shiqi; Shi, Naiyang; Xu, Yan; Jin, Hui",J Med Internet Res,324,8

In this review, we have surveyed the most used methodologies for diagnosis of COVID-19, which can be basically categorized into genetic-material detection and immunoassays. Detection of genetic material with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and similar techniques has been achieved with high accuracy, but these methods are expensive and require time-consuming protocols which are not widely available, especially in less developed countries. Immunoassays for detecting a few antibodies, on the other hand, have been used for rapid, less expensive tests, but their accuracy in diagnosing infected individuals has been limited. We have therefore discussed the strengths and limitations of all of these methodologies, particularly in light of the required combination of tests owing to the long incubation periods. We identified the bottlenecks that prevented mass testing in many countries, and proposed strategies for further action, which are mostly associated with materials science and chemistry. Of special relevance are the methodologies which can be integrated into point-of-care (POC) devices and the use of artificial intelligence that do not require products from a well-developed biotech industry.","Mattioli, Isabela A; Hassan, Ayaz; Oliveira, Osvaldo N; Crespilho, Frank N",ACS Sens,324,33

However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in the semen remains underexplored. Thus, we systematically reviewed the existing studies on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen. Methods: A literature search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Ovid databases was performed for articles from the dates of their inception to August 2020 using the following keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV2, seminal, semen, and sperm. After excluding non-human studies and articles that were not in the English language, we identified 19 relevant studies. The full text of the articles were reviewed and a total of eight articles remained after applying our selection criteria. Results: After reviewing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the eight different studies using semen samples, only one reported the presence of the virus. Six out of 160 total semen samples with SARS-CoV-2 positive demonstrated the presence of viral RNA, of which 2 were from males in the recovery phase and 4 from the acute phase of the infection. Conclusion: The novel nature of SARS-CoV-2 has limited the number and size of studies on semen. Nevertheless, the current literature, while limited, has confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen in one out of the eight reported studies and totaling 4.3% of the population screened. Taken together, the risk of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen appears to be extremely low and likely negligible in recovered men. Future studies need to focus on whether complete viral particles can be seen in semen and the possibility of sexual transmission.","Gonzalez, Daniel C; Khodamoradi, Kajal; Pai, Raghav; Guarch, Kristopher; Connelly, Zachary M; Ibrahim, Emad; Arora, Himanshu; Ramasamy, Ranjith",Res Rep Urol,324,24

However, typical turnaround times for batch-processed laboratory PCR tests remain 12-24h. Although rapid antigen lateral flow testing (LFD) has been widely adopted in UK emergency care settings, sensitivity is limited. We recently demonstrated that AI-driven triage (CURIAL-1.0) allows high-throughput COVID-19 screening using clinical data routinely available within 1h of arrival to hospital. Here we aimed to determine operational and safety improvements over standard-care, performing external/prospective evaluation across four NHS trusts with updated algorithms optimised for generalisability and speed, and deploying a novel lab-free screening pathway in a UK emergency department. MethodsWe rationalised predictors in CURIAL-1.0 to optimise separately for generalisability and speed, developing CURIAL-Lab with vital signs and routine laboratory blood predictors (FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP) and CURIAL-Rapide with vital signs and FBC alone. Models were calibrated during training to 90% sensitivity and validated externally for unscheduled admissions to Portsmouth University Hospitals, University Hospitals Birmingham and Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS trusts, and prospectively during the second-wave of the UK COVID-19 epidemic at Oxford University Hospitals (OUH). Predictions were generated using first-performed blood tests and vital signs and compared against confirmatory viral nucleic acid testing. Next, we retrospectively evaluated a novel clinical pathway triaging patients to COVID-19-suspected clinical areas where either model prediction or LFD results were positive, comparing sensitivity and NPV with LFD results alone. Lastly, we deployed CURIAL-Rapide alongside an approved point-of-care FBC analyser (OLO; SightDiagnostics, Israel) to provide lab-free COVID-19 screening in the John Radcliffe Hospitals Emergency Department (Oxford, UK), as trust-approved service improvement. Our primary improvement outcome was time-to-result availability; secondary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV assessed against a PCR reference standard. We compared CURIAL-Rapides performance with clinician triage and LFD results within standard-care. Results72,223 patients met eligibility criteria across external and prospective validation sites. Model performance was consistent across trusts (CURIAL-Lab: AUROCs range 0.858-0.881; CURIAL-Rapide 0.836-0.854), with highest sensitivity achieved at Portsmouth University Hospitals (CURIAL-Lab:84.1% [95% Wilsons score CIs 82.5-85.7]; CURIAL-Rapide:83.5% [81.8 - 85.1]) at specificities of 71.3% (95% Wilsons score CIs: 70.9 - 71.8) and 63.6% (63.1 - 64.1). For 3,207 patients receiving LFD-triage within routine care for OUH admissions between December 23, 2021 and March 6, 2021, a combined clinical pathway increased sensitivity from 56.9% for LFDs alone (95% CI 51.7-62.0) to 88.2% with CURIAL-Rapide (84.4-91.1; AUROC 0.919) and 85.6% with CURIAL-Lab (81.6-88.9; AUROC 0.925). 520 patients were prospectively enrolled for point-of-care FBC analysis between February 18, 2021 and May 10, 2021, of whom 436 received confirmatory PCR testing within routine care and 10 (2.3%) tested positive. Median time from patient arrival to availability of CURIAL-Rapide result was 45:00 min (32-64), 16 minutes (26.3%) sooner than LFD results (61:00 min, 37-99; log-rank p<0.0001), and 6:52 h (90.2%) sooner than PCR results (7:37 h, 6:05-15:39; p<0.0001). Sensitivity and specificity of CURIAL-Rapide were 87.5% (52.9-97.8) and 85.4% (81.3-88.7), therefore achieving high NPV (99.7%, 98.2-99.9). CURIAL-Rapide correctly excluded COVID-19 for 58.5% of negative patients who were triaged by a clinician to COVID-19-suspected (amber) areas. ImpactCURIAL-Lab & CURIAL-Rapide are generalisable, high-throughput screening tests for COVID-19, rapidly excluding the illness with higher NPV than LFDs. CURIAL-Rapide can be used in combination with near-patient FBC analysis for rapid, lab-free screening, and may reduce the number of COVID-19-negative patients triaged to enhanced precautions ( amber) clinical areas.","Soltan, Andrew AS; Yang, Jenny; Pattanshetty, Ravi; Novak, Alex; Rohanian, Omid; Beer, Sally; Soltan, Marina A; Thickett, David R; Fairhead, Rory; Collaborative, - CURIAL Translational; Zhu, Tingting; Eyre, David W; Clifton, David A",,324,1

Their all-out efforts contributed to Hubei finally winning the fight to prevent and control the pandemic. The aim of this study is to explore the influence of perceived organizational support on the emotional labor of medical personnel in Hubei Province. A group of 170 medical personnel from (tertiary) hospitals who participated in the pandemic aid operation in Hubei completed self-administered questionnaires, including the perceived organizational support scale, emotional labor scale, and professional identity scale. This study used Pearson's correlation in SPSS to analyze the three variables of organizational support, emotional labor, and professional identity. Organizational support and emotional labor (r = 0.443, P &lt; 0.01), organizational support and professional identity (r = 0.631, P &lt; 0.01), and emotional labor and occupational identity (r = 0.511, P &lt; 0.01) showed a significant positive correlation. The bootstrapping mediating effect test was used to determine the overall mediating effect of occupational identity. Occupational identity was a complete mediating effect between organizational support and emotional labor. The results show that a strong sense of organizational support can promote higher emotional labor among medical workers in Hubei Province. A strong sense of organizational support will also promote a stronger professional identity;further, a strong professional identity completely mediates the effect of perceived organizational support on emotional labor. These results infer that in emergency medical and health services, medical personnel can realize a high sense of organizational support, which could enhance their professional identity;this enables them to combine their professional goals with organizational goals more actively and to finally pay higher emotional labor to achieve organizational goals.","Zeng, Z.; Wang, X.; Bi, H.; Li, Y.; Yue, S.; Gu, S.; Xiang, G.",Frontiers in Psychology,324,20

We report a case of aortic angiosarcoma in association with a graft. We also conducted a clinicopathological review of cases of primary aortic sarcomas associated with implanted grafts. CASE REPORT The patient was an 82-year-old woman. She underwent thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) at age 78 because of an aneurysm in the descending aorta. Approximately 4 years after the TEVAR, computed tomography revealed a type II endoleak and expansion of the aneurysm. Her c-reactive protein level rose to 34 mg/dL, and Ga scintigraphy showed 67Ga accumulation at the aneurysm. She had fever up to 39°C, and a stent graft infection was suspected. Despite administration of antibiotics, her condition deteriorated, and she died. Postmortem examination identified epithelioid aortic angiosarcoma at the aorta with aneurysm repair and the graft, and the aortic angiosarcoma invaded the left lower lobe of the lung. CONCLUSIONS Our clinicopathological review revealed that the proper clinical diagnosis was very difficult owing to confusion of aortic sarcoma after the implantation with the infected graft, atypical endoleak, or pseudoaneurysm. The histological diagnosis was ambiguous because immunohistochemical and genetic studies were not adequately conducted. Overall prognosis of aortic sarcoma is poor as most patients die within a year, with no effective treatments.

Independent external clinical validation of performance characteristics is of paramount importance. METHODS: Four fully automated assays, Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Siemens SARS-CoV-2 total (COV2T) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG (COV2G) were evaluated using 350 pre-pandemic samples and 700 samples from 245 COVID-19 patients (158 hospitalized, 87 outpatients). RESULTS: All tests showed very high diagnostic specificity. Sensitivities in samples collected at least 14 days after disease onset were slightly lower than manufacturers' claims for Roche (93.0%), Abbott (90.8%), and Siemens COV2T (90.3%), and distinctly lower for Siemens COV2G (78.8%). Concordantly negative results were enriched for immunocompromised patients. ROC curve analyses suggest a lowering of the cut-off index for the Siemens COV2G assay. Finally, the combination of two anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is feasible when considering borderline reactive results. CONCLUSIONS: Thorough on-site evaluation of commercially available serologic tests for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remains imperative for laboratories. The potentially impaired sensitivity of the Siemens COV2G necessitates a switch to the company's newly filed SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay for follow-up studies. A combination of tests could be considered in clinical practice.","Irsara, Christian; Egger, Alexander E; Prokop, Wolfgang; Nairz, Manfred; Loacker, Lorin; Sahanic, Sabina; Pizzini, Alex; Sonnweber, Thomas; Mayer, Wolfgang; Schennach, Harald; Loeffler-Ragg, Judith; Bellmann-Weiler, Rosa; Tancevski, Ivan; Weiss, Günter; Anliker, Markus; Griesmacher, Andrea; Hoermann, Gregor",Clin. chem. lab. med,324,1

Additionally, the study investigated the moderating role of country-of-origin (COO) effect on these relationships. 296 U.S. restaurant customers recruited via a market research company completed the online survey. Structural equation modeling was used for data analyses. The results indicated that dining involvement had a direct positive effect on customers' intention to dine out. Moreover, both perceived importance of preventive measures and dining involvement could enhance customers' intention to dine out indirectly via brand trust. Positive COO effect moderated the relationship between perceived importance of preventive measures and brand trust.

Here, we perform structural modeling of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be proteolytically-sensitive. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and that the presence of this structural loop in 2019-nCoV may affect virus stability and transmission.","Jaimes, Javier A.; Andre, Nicole M.; Millet, Jean K.; Whittaker, Gary R.",,324,16

We sought to define the extent of fetal telehealth conversion at a large fetal cardiac care center and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy for studies performed. Methods: At our center, fetal telemedicine expanded from one MFM site before the pandemic to four additional sites by May 2020. A retrospective review of fetal telecardiology visits between March 15 and July 15, 2020, was performed. The chart was reviewed for confirmation of diagnosis postnatally. Results: With pandemic onset, there was a large increase in the number of telemedicine visits with a total of 122 mothers seen between five MFM clinics. Fourteen mothers (11.5%) had abnormal fetal echocardiograms requiring additional follow-up, and seven mothers (5.8%) had a fetal echocardiogram suspicious for a critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). All the fetal echocardiograms suspicious for CCHD were confirmed on postnatal echocardiogram. To our knowledge, none of the normal fetal echocardiograms were found to have congenital heart disease postnatally. Conclusions: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we rapidly transitioned to fetal telecardiology using a variety of formats. This has reduced potential infectious exposure for pregnant mothers and minimized contact between physicians without compromising diagnostic accuracy. In our experience, the expansion of a telemedicine program requires strong initial infrastructure, prior relationships with MFM providers, and appropriate training among obstetric sonographers.","Schwartz, Bryanna N; Klein, Jennifer H; Barbosa, Megan B; Hamersley, Sheri L; Hickey, Kimberly W; Ahmadzia, Homa K; Broth, Richard E; Pinckert, Thomas L; Sable, Craig A; Donofrio, Mary T; Krishnan, Anita",Telemed. j. e. health,324,32

Rheumatic manifestations, such as a seronegative non-erosive polyarthritis have been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics and the prevalence of rheumatic features in thyroiditis patients, and to ascertain whether the association with systemic autoimmune disorders improved the arthritis manifestations. METHODS: In total, 180 thyroiditis patients were enrolled. Major clinical and demographic characteristics have been recorded. Patients underwent a rheumatological clinical assessment and extra-articular manifestations allowing for a differential diagnosis with systemic autoimmune diseases and spondyloarthropathy. Presence of systemic autoimmune diseases was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 8.33% of thyroiditis patients shown a peripheral inflammatory arthritis (P = 0.002). Female gender (P = 0.042) and thyroid peroxidase (TPOAbs) positivity (P = 0.001) were more frequent. In total, 37 patients had systemic autoimmune diseases (P = 0.0003). A significant high prevalence of coeliac disease and Addison disease was found (P = 0.034 and P = 0.049, respectively). In patients with coeliac disease, the articular manifestations were more frequent (21.21%) (P = 0.001) and the risk to develop joint involvement was 2.96. CONCLUSION: Although we found an articular involvement in about one-third of thyroiditis patients, the prevalence of inflammatory arthropathy was only 8.33%. The prevalence of other coexisting autoimmune disorders was 34.26% with a significant prevalence of coeliac disease (7.41%). Thyroiditis patients with coeliac disease have an articular involvement more frequently than those without. In these patients, we have found a high risk of developing arthritis than patients with only thyroiditis, suggesting cumulative autoimmune effects in the developing articular involvement.","Lupoli, Gelsy Arianna; Tasso, Marco; Costa, Luisa; Caso, Francesco; Scarpa, Raffaele; Del Puente, Antonio; Peluso, Rosario",Rheumatology (Oxford),324,16

The CHA2DS2-VASc and modified CHA2DS2-VASc score of all patients was calculated. Also, we received all patients' complete biochemical markers including D-dimer, Troponin I, and c-reactive protein on admission. We enrolled 1000 patients; 791 were admitted to the general medical service and 209 to the ICU; 82 of these 209 patients died. The ROC curves of the CHA2DS2-VASc and M-CHA2DS2-VASc scores were analyzed. The cut-off values of these scores for predicting mortality were &#8805; 3 (2 or under and 3). The CHA2DS2-VASc and M-CHA2DS2-VASc scores had an area under the curve value of 0.89 on the ROC. The sensitivity and specificity of the CHA2DS2-VASc scores were 81.7% and 83.8%, respectively; the sensitivity and specificity of the M-CHA2DS2-VASc scores were 85.3% and 84.1%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that CHA2DS2-VASc, Troponin I, D-Dimer, and CRP were independent predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Using a simple and easily available scoring system, CHA2DS2-VASc and M-CHA2DS2-VASc scores can be assessed in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

By assessing student predictions of exam performance and analyzing themes from 276 student narrative surveys, we highlight the power of a careful balance between cognitive and social interventions to help students recover. Students in this study showed a 50% loss of efficacy beliefs after ERI (midsemester) but were able to improve to at least 75% above starting efficacy beliefs after instructor interventions. Thus, we also show how academic efficacy is highly malleable and is mediated in relationships. In turn, we demonstrate a new assessment model that uses student narrative writing to reveal ""invisible"" threats to students' perceptions of their capacity to succeed. Finally, we generalize from their findings to provide recommendations for effective strategies for supporting those students for whom every semester feels like a pandemic.","Camfield, Eileen Kogl; Schiller, NaTasha R; Land, Kirkwood M",CBE Life Sci Educ,324,15

The goal of this consensus statement is to examine the current evidence for performing tracheostomy in patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 and offer guidance to physicians on the preparation, timing, and technique while minimizing the risk of infection to health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: A panel including intensivists and interventional pulmonologists from three professional societies representing 13 institutions with experience in managing patients with COVID-19 across a spectrum of health-care environments developed key clinical questions addressing specific topics on tracheostomy in COVID-19. A systematic review of the literature and an established modified Delphi consensus methodology were applied to provide a reliable evidence-based consensus statement and expert panel report. RESULTS: Eight key questions, corresponding to 14 decision points, were rated by the panel. The results were aggregated, resulting in eight main recommendations and five additional remarks intended to guide health-care providers in the decision-making process pertinent to tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: This panel suggests performing tracheostomy in patients expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation. A specific timing of tracheostomy cannot be recommended. There is no evidence for routine repeat reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing in patients with confirmed COVID-19 evaluated for tracheostomy. To reduce the risk of infection in HCWs, we recommend performing the procedure using techniques that minimize aerosolization while wearing enhanced personal protective equipment. The recommendations presented in this statement may change as more experience is gained during this pandemic.","Lamb, Carla R; Desai, Neeraj R; Angel, Luis; Chaddha, Udit; Sachdeva, Ashutosh; Sethi, Sonali; Bencheqroun, Hassan; Mehta, Hiren; Akulian, Jason; Argento, A Christine; Diaz-Mendoza, Javier; Musani, Ali; Murgu, Septimiu",Chest,324,26

Our work presents the first application of the BERTSum model to conversational language. We generate abstractive summaries of narrated instructional videos across a wide variety of topics, from gardening and cooking to software configuration and sports. In order to enrich the vocabulary, we use transfer learning and pretrain the model on a few large cross-domain datasets in both written and spoken English. We also do preprocessing of transcripts to restore sentence segmentation and punctuation in the output of an ASR system. The results are evaluated with ROUGE and Content-F1 scoring for the How2 and WikiHow datasets. We engage human judges to score a set of summaries randomly selected from a dataset curated from HowTo100M and YouTube. Based on blind evaluation, we achieve a level of textual fluency and utility close to that of summaries written by human content creators. The model beats current SOTA when applied to WikiHow articles that vary widely in style and topic, while showing no performance regression on the canonical CNN/DailyMail dataset. Due to the high generalizability of the model across different styles and domains, it has great potential to improve accessibility and discoverability of internet content.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient satisfaction, patient and physician impression of encounter completeness, and reimbursement between in-person, video, and telephone encounters. This study also assessed factors influencing patient satisfaction, perception of completeness, and choice of future evaluation type. METHODS: This was a prospective study of all encounters at a health care-system owned practice. Encounter type, encounter modality, patient demographics, primary diagnoses, reimbursement data, and physician assessment of encounter completeness were tracked. Patient satisfaction was assessed via standardized questions. RESULTS: There were 447 encounters, with 303 in-person (67.8%), 98 video (21.9%), and 46 telephone (10.3%). Patient satisfaction data was obtained from 251 patients. There was similar patient satisfaction among all encounter modalities. Both patients and physicians were more likely to deem an in-person encounter as complete. Physicians were more likely to report an in-person encounter to be complete for food allergy (P < .001) and chronic rhinitis (P = .001) compared with video or telephone, whereas patients reported in-person encounters for food allergy to be complete compared with other modalities (P = .002). Patients reported that future encounter types should depend on the clinical situation. CONCLUSIONS: There was similar patient satisfaction with in-person, video, and telephone encounters in an allergy/immunology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chronic rhinitis and food allergy are more likely to call for an in-person evaluation. New patient visits are likely to be the highest yield to focus on for in-person evaluations.","Mustafa, S Shahzad; Vadamalai, Karthik; Ramsey, Allison",J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. Pract,324,17

From our screening of over one million compounds including approved drugs, investigational drugs, natural products, and organic compounds, and a rescreening protocol incorporating enzyme dynamics via ensemble docking, we have been able to identify a range of prospective 3CLpro inhibitors. Importantly, some of the identified compounds had previously been reported to exhibit inhibitory activities against the 3CLpro enzyme of the closely related SARS-CoV virus. The top-ranking compounds are characterized by the presence of multiple bi- and monocyclic rings, many of them being heterocycles and aromatic, which are flexibly linked allowing the ligands to adapt to the geometry of the 3CLpro substrate site and involve a high amount of functional groups enabling hydrogen bond formation with surrounding amino acid residues, including the catalytic dyad residues H41 and C145. Among the top binding compounds we identified several tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which include a bioflavonoid, the group of natural products that binds best to 3CLpro. Another class of compounds that decently binds to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease are steroid hormones, which thus may be endogenous inhibitors and might provide an explanation for the age-dependent severity of COVID-19. Many of the compounds identified by our work show a considerably stronger binding than found for reference compounds with in vitro demonstrated 3CLpro inhibition and anticoronavirus activity. The compounds determined in this work thus represent a good starting point for the design of inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication.","Olubiyi, Olujide O; Olagunju, Maryam; Keutmann, Monika; Loschwitz, Jennifer; Strodel, Birgit",Molecules (Basel),324,0

OBJECTIVES: The study was undertaken to assess the use of face masks among students during the COVID-19 pandemic, with focus on similarities and differences between medical and non-medical students. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was based on the specially designed survey. The questionnaire, after consultation with 10 students, was created using Google Forms and posted on numerous Facebook groups for students in Poland. The recall period of the questionnaire was the previous 7 days. In 48 h, 2,315 answers were obtained. Fifty-nine questionnaires were excluded due to data incompleteness and failure to fulfil inclusion criteria. Therefore, 2,256 surveys (97.5%) were considered for final analysis. RESULTS: Medical students showed significantly different attitudes and practices concerning the use of face masks. Medical students used face masks more commonly and for longer periods of time. Moreover, they wore single-use masks more often and less frequently re-used them. Also, multiple use of single-use face masks and masks decontamination procedures were less common among medical students.

Tracheostomy is an essential procedure in critically ill COVID-19 patients; however, it is an aerosol-generating technique and thus carries the risk of infection transmission. We report our experience with percutaneous tracheostomy and its safety in a real medical setting. Methods: During the COVID-19 outbreak, 13 critically ill patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Daegu Catholic University Medical Center between February 24 and April 30, 2020. Seven of these patients underwent percutaneous tracheostomy using Ciaglia Blue Rhino. The medical environment, percutaneous tracheostomy method, and COVID-19 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were retrospectively reviewed. After treatment, the COVID-19 infection status of healthcare personnel was investigated by RT-PCR. Results: The ICU contained negative pressure cohort areas and isolation rooms, and healthcare personnel wore a powered air-purifying respirator system. We performed seven cases of percutaneous tracheostomy in the same way as in patients without COVID-19. Five patients (71.4%) tested positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR at the time of tracheostomy. The median cycle threshold value for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was 30.60 (interquartile range [IQR], 25.50-36.56) in the nasopharynx and 35.04 (IQR, 28.40-36.74) in sputum. All healthcare personnel tested negative for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Conclusion: Percutaneous tracheostomy was performed with conventional methods in the negative pressure cohort area. It was safe to perform percutaneous tracheostomy in an environment of COVID-19 infection.","Kim, Eun Jin; Yoo, Eun-Hyung; Jung, Chi Young; Kim, Kyung Chan",,324,16

METHODS: 39 Patients confirmed by RT-PCR were included. We collected clinical features, laboratory test results, smear sample information, and quarantine room information. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were conducted. We analyzed the factors associated with environmental contamination. RESULT: Among 39 COVID-19 cases, 10 were asymptomatic and 37 were imported from aboard. We collected 271 swab samples from environmental surfaces related to observational patients. Eighteen swab samples from seven patients were positive. The highest contamination rates occurred on cups (100%), followed by hand sink (12.82%), toilet seat and flush (7.89%), telephone (5.56%), bedside table (5.56%), and floor drain (5.41%). The results showed that environmental surface contamination was associated with the clinical cycle threshold values for patients (P = 0.01) and the sampling interval time after the cases left their rooms (P = 0.03). The duration of environmental surface contamination was associated with the wet status of the sampling site (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that environmental contamination might be attributed to the viral load in the respiratory tracts of patients and the sampling interval time after the cases left their rooms. Moist surfaces were more vulnerable to remaining SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive. Our study highlights the importance of implementing strict chemical disinfection strategies in quarantine rooms.","Liu, Jie; Liu, Jingwen; He, Zheng; Yang, Zhicong; Yuan, Jun; Wu, Haoying; Zhu, Pingting; Fu, Xuesong; Lin, Yunwan; Zhang, Ying; Zhao, Zhengyang; He, Shiyu; Ma, Xiaowei",Int J Infect Dis,324,24

While this practice has improved livestock production, it is a major cause of antimicrobial resistance in microbes affecting livestock and humans. This has led to the banning of prophylactic antibiotic use in animals in many countries. To compensate for this, alternatives have been sought from natural sources such as plants. While many studies have reported the antimicrobial activity of medicinal plants with potential for use as phytogenic/botanical feed additives, little information exists on their mode of action. This study is based on our earlier work and describes ultrastructural damage induced by acetone crude leaf extracts of Syzygium legatii and Eugenia zeyheri (Myrtaceae) active against diarrhoeagenic E. coli of swine origin using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and fluorescent microscopy (FM). Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to investigate the chemical composition of plant extracts. RESULTS: The extracts damaged the internal and external anatomy of the cytoplasmic membrane and inner structure at a concentration of 0.04 mg/mL. Extracts also led to an increased influx of propidium iodide into treated bacterial cells suggesting compromised cellular integrity and cellular damage. Non-polar compounds such as &#945;-amyrin, friedelan-3-one, lupeol, and ß-sitosterol were abundant in the extracts. CONCLUSIONS: The extracts of S. legatii and E. zeyheri caused ultrastructural damage to E. coli cells characterized by altered external and internal morphology. These observations may assist in elucidating the mode of action of the extracts.","Famuyide, Ibukun M; Fasina, Folorunso O; Eloff, Jacobus N; McGaw, Lyndy J",BMC Vet Res,324,21

While this format is used in face-to-face classroom settings, it is less clear if it can be adapted for online settings. With the rapid shift to online instruction because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we explored whether collaborative group testing could be implemented online through video conferencing. Our hypothesis was that online collaborative group testing would be feasible and effective for facilitating student learning. Twelve students enrolled in two sections of an introductory kinesiology course (Spring, n=9;Summer, n=3), took exams individually and then immediately again in small groups (3-4 students). The Spring section completed exam 1 in-class and exam 3 online (exam 2 was modified as a take-home because of the onset of COVID-19 pandemic). The Summer section completed all exams online. For both sections, the group online exam was delivered using Zoom ?breakout rooms?. Individual and group scores for exam 3 were evaluated along with student's perceptions relating to the collaborative group testing format. As expected, group exam scores were higher than individual scores (98±1% vs. 79±18%;P&lt;0.05). Most students strongly agreed that the group exam format was collaborative (83%), less stressful than traditional testing (67%), and allowed them to go beyond their previous level of individual knowledge (83%). Additionally, all students recommended the format be implemented in future online courses. Of the students who completed group exams both in-class and online, the majority strongly agreed (67%) that the level of interaction with group members and overall experience was similar. In summary, preliminary results suggest that collaborative group testing can be implemented online effectively and that it was favorably perceived by students.","Wedig, Isaac Elmer Steven",The FASEB Journal,324,16

To identify the putative roles of these miRs in zoonosis, we assessed their conservation, compared with humans, in some key wild and domestic animal carriers of zoonotic viruses, including bat, pangolin, pig, cow, rat, and chicken. Out of the seven miRs under study, miR-3611 was the most strongly conserved across all species; miR-5197 was the most conserved in pangolin, pig, cow, bat, and rat; miR-1307 was most strongly conserved in pangolin, pig, cow, bat, and human; miR-3691-3p in pangolin, cow, and human; miR-3934-3p in pig and cow, followed by pangolin and bat; miR-1468 was most conserved in pangolin, pig, and bat; while miR-8066 was most conserved in pangolin and pig. In humans, miR-3611 and miR-1307 were most conserved, while miR-8066, miR-5197, miR-3334-3p and miR-1468 were least conserved, compared with pangolin, pig, cow, and bat. Furthermore, we identified that changes in the miR-5197 nucleotides between pangolin and human can generate three new miRs, with differing tissue distribution in the brain, lung, intestines, lymph nodes, and muscle, and with different downstream regulatory effects on KEGG pathways. This may be of considerable importance as miR-5197 is localized in the spike protein transcript area of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our findings may indicate roles for these miRs in viral-host co-evolution in zoonotic hosts, particularly highlighting pangolin, bat, cow, and pig as putative zoonotic carriers, while highlighting the miRs' roles in KEGG pathways linked to viral pathogenicity and host responses in humans. This in silico study paves the way for investigations into the roles of miRs in zoonotic disease.","Lange, Sigrun; Arisan, Elif Damla; Grant, Guy H; Uysal-Onganer, Pinar",Viruses,324,16

This study seeks to identify the specific sources of procedural volume loss and recovery in a large academic system at the epicenter of the pandemic. Materials and Methods: All procedures performed during the first 33 weeks of 2020 in the Department of Radiology of a large academic health system were reviewed retrospectively. Data included modality, billed current procedural terminology (CPT) codes, and patient service location. Each procedure was assigned to 1 of 8 categories: biopsy, drainage, enteric access, venous access, neuro (both spinal and cerebral), oncology, vascular (both arterial and venous), and other. For analysis of the effects of COVID-19, volumes were aggregated weekly and a “surge” period was defined beginning with the first local COVID-19 positive patient and ending when new daily cases crossed below 25% of the peak. Results: There were significant decreases in all categories during the surge period. The largest declines were seen in vascular (-52%), biopsy (-44%), and oncology (-43%) procedures and the smallest in venous (-14%) and enteric (-12%) access. When stratified by site of service, there were relative increases over baseline in inpatient oncology (+44%), biopsy (+18%), and enteric access (+10%) procedures following the surge. Conclusions: During the local COVID-19 outbreak, procedural volume loss was offset by increasing the department’s role in providing venous and enteric access. The relative increase in inpatient interventional oncology and biopsies during the recovery is likely multifactorial but may support prior assertions that delayed diagnosis and treatment due to the pandemic has resulted in more severe disease at presentation.

Se han informado casos de ACV relacionados con esta infección viral. OBJETIVOS: Conocer la experiencia de diferentes partes del mundo respecto al ACV y covid-19 con el fin de mejorar el reconocimiento y saber qué hacer cuando se empiecen a presentar estos pacientes en nuestro medio. MÉTODOS: Se hizo una revisión de los estudios observacionales disponibles utilizando PubMed, Scopus, así como otras fuentes de literatura gris para las publicaciones sobre ACV y covid-19. Se identificaron datos demográficos, tiempo de aparición del ACV desde el diagnóstico de covid-19. Principales hallazgos radiológicos, laboratorios y pronóstico. RESULTADOS: Se obtuvieron ocho estudios, con 43 sujetos que tuvieron ACV isquémico e infección por SARS-CoV-2. La edad promedio fue de 67,4 años, siendo en su mayoría hombres (58,1%).Un hallazgo importante fue el número de casos de ACV con oclusión de vaso grande en 22 de 31 casos reportados (71%). La mediana de NIHSS fue de 14,5 puntos. Se presentó una mortalidad del 27,5% de los sujetos con ACV El estadio más frecuente por covid-19 fue el de condición severa 58,3%. La aparición del ACV luego de la infección por SARS-CoV-2 fue de 10,6 días en promedio. En los laboratorios se identificó una elevación del fibrinógeno (92%), dímero-D (76%) y LDH (82%) respectivamente. El tratamiento recibido de forma más frecuente para el ACV fue la antiagregación, en 51%, mientras que las terapias de reperfusión se hicieron en el 30% de los casos. La mayoría de los pacientes (93%) presentaron síntomas de covid-19, solo 3 pacientes (7%) no presentaron síntomas típicos de esta enfermedad, sin embargo tuvieron alteración del estado de conciencia asociado al ACV CONCLUSIÓN: Los estados de inflamación e hipercoagulabilidad que se presentan durante la infección por SARS-CoV-2 probablemente están en relación con el desarrollo de ACV, lo cual en este caso podrá explicar el gran número de oclusiones de vaso grande. Los marcadores de inflamación generalmente están presentes.

This work introduces the {beta}SEIR model, which adds to the classical SEIR model a differential law to model the variation in the transmission rate. It considers two opposite thrives generally found in a population: first, reaction to disease presence that may be linked to mitigation strategies, which tends to decrease transmission, and second, the urge to return to normal conditions that pulls to restore the initial value of the transmission rate. Our results open a wide spectrum of dynamic variabilities in the curve of new infected, which are justified by reaction and restoration thrives that affect disease transmission over time. Some of these dynamics have been observed in the existing COVID-19 disease data. In particular and to further exemplify the potential the model proposed in this article, we show its capability of capturing the evolution of the number of new confirmed cases of Chile and Italy for several months after epidemic onset, while incorporating a reaction to disease presence with decreasing adherence to mitigation strategies, as well as a seasonal effect on the restoration of the initial transmissibility conditions.","Córdova-Lepe, Fernando; Vogt-Geisse, Katia",,324,15

Most COVID-19-Pregnancy patients showed mild to moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with no pregnancy loss and no congenital transmission of the virus; however, an increase in hypoxia-induced preterm deliveries was apparent. Also, the breastmilk of several mothers with COVID-19 tested negative for the virus. Taken together, the natural barrier function during pregnancy and postpartum seems to deter the SARS-CoV-2 transmission from mother-to-child. This clinical observation warrants to explore the maternal-fetal interface and identify the innate defense factors for prevention and control of COVID-19-Pregnancy. Lactoferrin (LF) is a potent antiviral iron-binding protein present in the maternal-fetal interface. In concert with immune co-factors, maternal-LF modulates chemokine release and lymphocyte migration and amplify host defense during pregnancy. LF levels during pregnancy may resolve hypertension via down-regulation of ACE2; consequently, may limit the membrane receptor access to SARS-CoV-2 for cellular entry. Furthermore, an LF-derived peptide (LRPVAA) has been shown to block ACE receptor activity in vitro. LF may also reduce viral docking and entry into host cells and limit the early phase of COVID-19 infection. An in-depth understanding of LF and other soluble mammalian milk-derived innate antiviral factors may provide insights to reduce co-morbidities and vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection and may lead to the development of effective nutraceutical supplements.","Naidu, Sreus A G; Clemens, Roger A; Pressman, Peter; Zaigham, Mehreen; Davies, Kelvin J A; Naidu, A Satyanarayan",J Diet Suppl,324,1

Herein, several ultrashort peptidase inhibitors against the RBD-ACE2 interaction were obtained by a computer-aided approach based on the RBD-binding residues on the protease domain (PD) of ACE2. The designed peptides were tested on a model coronavirus GX_P2V, which has 92.2 and 86% amino acid identity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and RBD, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy analysis predicted a potential binding pocket on the RBD of the spike protein, and this was confirmed by the specifically designed peptides SI5&#945; and SI5&#945;-b. They have only seven residues, showing potent antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay result also confirmed their inhibitory ability against the RBD-ACE2 interaction.

Embelin, a quinone natural product, is known to have antiviral activity against influenza and hepatitis B. Preliminary studies by our group also indicate its ability to inhibit HSV-1 in cultured cells. METHODS: Docking and DFT methods applied to the protease target. RESULTS: a mechanism for this inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease is described, specifically due to formation of a covalent bond between S(Cys145) and an embelin C(carbonyl). This is assisted by two protein amino acids (1) N(imidazole-His41) which is able to capture H[S(Cys145)] and (2) HN(His163), which donates a proton to embelin O(carbonyl) forming an OH moiety that results in inhibition of the viral protease. A similar process is also seen with the anti-inflammatory drugs methyl prednisolone and dexamethasone, used for Covid-19 patients. Methyl prednisolone and dexamethasone are methide quinones, and possess only one carbonyl moiety, instead of two for embelin. Additional consideration was given to another natural product, emodin, recently patented against Covid-19, as well as some therapeutic quinones, vitamin K, suspected to be involved in Covid-19 action, and coenzyme Q10. All show structural similarities with embelin, dexamethasone and methyl prednisolone results. CONCLUSIONS: Our data on embelin and related quinones indicate that these natural compounds may represent a feasible, strategic tool against Covid-19.","Caruso, Francesco; Rossi, Miriam; Pedersen, Jens Z; Incerpi, Sandra",J Infect Public Health,324,11

To maximize delivery to the lungs, we formulated remdesivir as a dry powder for inhalation using thin film freezing (TFF). TFF produces brittle matrix nanostructured aggregates that are sheared into respirable low-density microparticles upon aerosolization from a passive dry powder inhaler. In vitro aerodynamic testing demonstrated that drug loading and excipient type affected the aerosol performance of remdesivir. Remdesivir combined with optimal excipients exhibited desirable aerosol performance (up to 93.0% FPF< 5 µm; 0.82 µm mass median aerodynamic diameter). Remdesivir was amorphous after the TFF process, which benefitted drug dissolution in simulated lung fluid. TFF remdesivir formulations are stable after one month of storage at 25 °C/60% relative humidity. An in vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation showed that TFF remdesivir-leucine was poorly absorbed into systemic circulation while TFF remdesivir-Captisol® demonstrated increased systemic uptake compared to leucine. Remdesivir was hydrolyzed to the nucleoside analog GS-441524 in the lung, and levels of GS-441524 were greater in the lung with leucine formulation compared to Captisol®. In conclusion, TFF technology produces high-potency remdesivir dry powder formulations for inhalation that are suitable to treat patients with COVID-19 on an outpatient basis and earlier in the disease course where effective antiviral therapy can reduce related morbidity and mortality.","Sahakijpijarn, Sawittree; Moon, Chaeho; Koleng, John J; Christensen, Dale J; Williams Iii, Robert O",,324,16

METHODS: Two RBCs (Venus and Venus Pearl; Kulzer) that use different monomer and photo-initiator systems, but have a similar filler volume and shade, were exposed to either just blue light, or violet and blue light from two different LCUs (Translux Wave and Translux 2Wave; Kulzer). Distance and exposure times were adjusted so that both LCUs delivered 5 similar levels of radiant exposures (RE) between 1.5 J/cm² to 25 J/cm² in the blue wavelength range. Thus, the violet light was additional light. The top and bottom of 2-mm thick specimens were subjected to a depth-sensing indentation test (Martens hardness/HM, Vickers hardness/HV, indentation modulus/YHU, mechanical work/Wtotal, plastic deformation work/Wplas, creep/Cr) was performed at. The viability of human gingival fibroblasts was assessed after three days of exposure to RBC eluates. One and multiple-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) post-hoc tests (&#945; = 0.05), t-test and a Spearman correlation analysis were used. RESULTS: As the RE increased, the mechanical properties increased at a greater rate at the top compared to the bottom of the RBCs. Values measured at the bottom of 2-mm increments approached the values measured at the top only when RE > 25 J/cm² of blue light was delivered. Toxicity decreased with RE and elution cycles and was lower for Venus Pearl. Within one RE level, addition of violet light resulted in significantly improved properties (in 131 out of 150 comparisons, p < 0.05). This effect was stronger for Venus Pearl. There was a good correlation between mechanical and biological parameters. This correlation decreased as the number of eluates increased. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The mechanical and biological response to variation in RE is interrelated. The addition of violet light has a positive effect, particularly at low RE.","Ilie, Nicoleta; Schmalz, Gottfried; Fujioka-Kobayashi, Masako; Lussi, Adrian; Price, Richard Bengt",J Dent,324,1

We used this natural experiment imposed by a COVID-19 lockdown to examine how mandated low social exposure influenced socially anxious university students, and compared their anxiety to that of socially anxious students in preceding academic years with no social distancing. Methods: Ninety-nine socially anxious students were assessed for social anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters. Students from the 2019-2020 academic year (which included a lockdown followed by social distancing measures at the end of the fall semester) were compared to students from preceding years (2016-2019) on social anxiety levels. Results: Whereas social anxiety decreased in socially anxious students from the fall to the spring semester in the years preceding the pandemic, during the 2019-2020 academic year social anxiety levels remained high and unchanged. These results held when controlling for depressive symptoms and when analyzing social anxiety items that cannot be confounded with COVID-19-related anxiety. Conclusions: The current results suggest that reduced exposure to social situations may play a role in the maintenance of social anxiety. Alternative explanations are discussed.","Arad, Gal; Shamai-Leshem, Dana; Bar-Haim, Yair",Cognit Ther Res,324,13

En este contexto de emergencia, la comunicación de malas noticias toma especial relevancia por el modo particular en que debe llevarse a cabo: la necesidad de mantener distanciamiento sanitario y las restricciones de movilidad impuestas a la población general hacen que esta tarea deba ser realizada, muchas veces, de manera remota, en su mayoría mediante llamados telefónicos. Esto enfrenta a los profesionales a una serie de obstáculos particulares: a) la mayoría de ellos poseen escasa o nula formación sobre esta clase de habilidades comunicativas, b) la comunicación efectiva de malas noticias depende, en gran parte, del lenguaje corporal utilizado, ausente en este tipo de intercambios, y c) dado que este tipo de diálogo remoto no es recomendable -con excepción de circunstancias particulares como la actual- existe escasa literatura disponible para guiar a quienes deben cumplir esta tarea. Este manuscrito ofrece recomendaciones sobre pautas básicas para la comunicación remota de malas noticias por teléfono, en situaciones en las cuales no se pueda llevar a cabo esta tarea de forma presencial. Se presenta una propuesta estructurada en torno de cuatro ""momentos"" para orientar la transmisión de malas noticias a distancia, con el fin de mejorar los cuidados a pacientes, familiares y cuidadores durante este intercambio y también reducir el impacto negativo que este intercambio tiene sobre los profesionales de la salud.","Belli, Laura F.",Rev. panam. salud pública,324,16

COVID-19 disease ranges from mild flu-like episodes to other serious and even life-threatening conditions, mainly due to acute respiratory failure. These patients are frequently admitted to our Intensive Care Units in relation to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The lack of a treatment based on scientific evidence has led to the use of different management guidelines, in many cases with rapid changes in the applied protocols.

Such situations might exacerbate workplace violence (WPV) against physicians, as has been reported in several parts of the world. METHODS: To identify the frequency and characteristics of WPV suffered by physicians attending COVID-19 patients in Peru, a descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted with an online survey of 200 physicians. RESULTS: Of the survey respondents, 84.5% had suffered some type of WPV; 97.6% of these suffered nonphysical violence. Suffering more than one incident of violence was reported by 75.7% of respondents. The primary aggressor was a patient's family member or caregiver. Violence occurred most frequently in critical areas inside the health service facility, such as COVID-19 triage, tents, and hospital units, although it also occurred during teleconsultations. Multiple shortcomings of the health services were perceived as the main trigger of violence. Being a female physician (odds ratio [OR]â¯=â¯2.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]â¯=â¯1.06-5.83) and working in a COVID-19 ICU (ORâ¯=â¯5.84, 95% CIâ¯=â¯1.60-21.28) were the main factors associated with WPV. CONCLUSION: Violence against physicians attending COVID-19 patients in Peru is common. The perceived factors that contribute most to violence are linked to deficiencies in health services.","Muñoz Del Carpio-Toia, Agueda; Begazo Muñoz Del Carpio, Lucía; Mayta-Tristan, Percy; Alarcón-Yaquetto, Dulce Esperanza; Málaga, Germán",Jt.

The pandemic is currently underway, and to date has caused approximately 2.42 million deaths worldwide. The first vaccines have recently been licensed; however, research continues to identify therapeutic agents to prevent serious complications, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticoagulant or antiviral agents authorized for other therapeutic indications. Epidemiological evidence shows that advanced age and comorbidities, such as diabetes, heart disease, and dyslipidemia may represent COVID-19 risk factors. In particular, in patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with statins, it is recommended that treatment should not be discontinued if COVID-19 infection occurs. The pleiotropic effects of statins are well known. In this brief review, we propose that the use of statins can potentially protect against SARS-CoV-2-induced tissue damage and improve lung function in COVID-19 patients through several pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects of statins that may be a significant benefit in patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with statins and COVID-19 positive.

Using emotional contagion and social cognitive theories, we tested the proposition that higher contagion of anger (i.e., a negative emotion that interferes with mental functioning and enables inappropriate behavior) would trigger moral justifications for safety violations, whereas higher contagion of joy (i.e., a positive emotion accompanied by an optimal operating condition and constructive activity) would prevent safety-related moral disengagement. In turn, moral disengagement was predicted to be related to higher rates of subsequent workplace injuries. Using a cross-country and multi-method (i.e., cross-lagged, cross-sectional) design, data from 503 employees in the U.S. (two-wave) and 538 employees in Italy (cross-sectional) supported the hypothesized mediation model. Specifically, both in the U.S. and Italy, emotional contagion of anger positively predicted moral disengagement, whereas emotional contagion of joy negatively predicted moral disengagement. Furthermore, moral disengagement positively predicted experienced injuries and partially mediated the relationship between contagion of joy/anger and injuries. These findings suggest that moral justifications of safety violations, and related injuries, may be prevented by exchanges of positive emotions (and triggered by exchanges of negative emotions) that employees absorb during social interactions at work. Theoretical and practical implications for organizational ethics are discussed in light of the globally increasing emotional pressure and concerns for a safe and psychologically healthy environment in today’s workplace, particularly given the recent pandemic spread of Coronavirus disease (CoVid-19).","Petitta, Laura Probst Tahira M.; Ghezzi, Valerio Barbaranelli Claudio",Safety Science,324,21

To guide this technically challenging data integration task and to make gene discovery and hypotheses generation easier for researchers, we have developed a comprehensive software package called KnetMiner which is open-source and containerized for easy use. KnetMiner is an integrated, intelligent, interactive gene and gene network discovery platform that supports scientists explore and understand the biological stories of complex traits and diseases across species. It features fast algorithms for generating rich interactive gene networks and prioritizing candidate genes based on knowledge mining approaches. KnetMiner is used in many plant science institutions and has been adopted by several plant breeding organizations to accelerate gene discovery. The software is generic and customizable and can therefore be readily applied to new species and data types; for example, it has been applied to pest insects and fungal pathogens; and most recently repurposed to support COVID-19 research.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The lymphocyte subsets and cytokines of 31 patients with severe COVID-19 (7 deaths and 24 survivals) were longitudinally analyzed. RESULTS: The mean age of enrolled patients was 64 years, 24 (77.4%) patients were men, and 23 (74.2%) patients had comorbidities. Compared with survival group, the death group showed significant and sustained increases in the levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 from baseline to 28 days after admission (all p<0.05). No significant differences were observed in the levels of TNF-&#945;, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12P70, IL-17, IFN-&#945;, and IFN-Î³ between the death group and survival group during the follow-up (all p>0.05). The absolute counts of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD45+ T cells were lower in both survival group and death group patients from hospital admission to 3 days after admission, and gradually recovered in 4 to 35 days in the survival group, but continually stayed at low levels in the death group during the follow-up.

Persad et al argue that their system is the product of a successful process of reflective equilibrium-a philosophical methodology whereby theories, principles and considered judgements are balanced with each other and revised until we achieve an acceptable coherence between our various beliefs. Yet I argue that many of the principles and intuitions underpinning CLF conflict with each other, and that Persad et al have failed to achieve an acceptable coherence between them.

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The Cochrane methodology for a rapid living systematic review was applied. Primary research papers, published from 1 January to 30 June 2020, reporting patients' data, with no limits of study design were included. Studies were categorized for study design, research question, COVID-19 phase, limitations of functioning (disability) of rehabilitation interest and type of rehabilitation service involved. Methodological quality assessment was based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools, and the level of evidence table (OCEBM 2011) for all the other studies. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Thirty-six, out of 3703 papers, were included. One paper was of level 2 (RCT), 7 were of level 3 (2 cohort studies, 2 cross-sectional studies and 3 case-control studies), and 28 papers of level 4 (descriptive studies); 61% of papers reported epidemiological data on clinical presentations, 5 investigated natural history/determining factors, 1 searched prevalence, 2 studies reported on intervention efficacy (though not on harms), and 5 studies looked at health service organization. CONCLUSIONS: Main issues emerging from the review: it is advised to test for COVID-19 people with neurological disorders presenting with symptom changes; dysphagia is a frequent complication after oro-tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU; after discharge, COVID-19 survivors may report persistent restrictive ventilatory deficits regardless of disease severity; there is only sparse and low quality evidence concerning the efficacy of any rehabilitation intervention to promote functional recovery; a substantial increase in resource (staff and equipment) is needed for rehabilitation.","Ceravolo, Maria G; Arienti, Chiara; de Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Negrini, Francesco; Lazzarini, Stefano G; Patrini, Michele; Negrini, Stefano",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,324,24

The virus enters the human cells after binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 receptor in target tissues. ACE2 expression is induced in response to inflammation. The colon expression of ACE2 is upregulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), highlighting a potential risk of intestinal inflammation in promoting viral entry in the human body. Because mechanisms that regulate ACE2 expression in the intestine are poorly understood and there is a need of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, we have settled to investigate whether natural flavonoids might regulate the expression of Ace2 in intestinal models of inflammation. The results of these studies demonstrated that pelargonidin activates the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) in vitro and reverses intestinal inflammation caused by chronic exposure to high fat diet or to the intestinal braking-barrier agent TNBS in a AhR-dependent manner. In these two models, development of colon inflammation associated with upregulation of Ace2 mRNA expression. Colon levels of Ace2 mRNA were directly correlated with Tnf-&#945; mRNA levels. Molecular docking studies suggested that pelargonidin binds a fatty acid binding pocket on the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. In vitro studies demonstrated that pelargonidin significantly reduces the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to ACE2 and reduces the SARS-CoV-2 replication in a concentration-dependent manner. In summary, we have provided evidence that a natural flavonoid might hold potential in reducing intestinal inflammation and ACE2 induction in the inflamed colon in a AhR-dependent manner.","Biagioli, Michele; Marchianò, Silvia; Roselli, Rosalinda; Di Giorgio, Cristina; Bellini, Rachele; Bordoni, Martina; Gidari, Anna; Sabbatini, Samuele; Francisci, Daniela; Fiorillo, Bianca; Catalanotti, Bruno; Distrutti, Eleonora; Carino, Adriana; Zampella, Angela; Costantino, Gabriele; Fiorucci, Stefano",Biochem Pharmacol,324,16

We aimed to report a series of patients with PCS attending a Post-COVID Unit and offer a comprehensive review on the topic. Adult patients with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were systematically assessed through a semi-structured and validated survey. Total IgG, IgA and IgM serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis were conducted, following PRISMA guidelines. Univariate and multivariate methods were used to analyze data. Out of a total of 100 consecutive patients, 53 were women, the median of age was 49 years (IQR: 37.8 to 55.3), the median of post-COVID time after the first symptoms was 219 days (IQR: 143 to 258), and 65 patients were hospitalized during acute COVID-19. Musculoskeletal, digestive (i.e., diarrhea) and neurological symptoms including depression (by Zung scale) were the most frequent observed in PCS patients. A previous hospitalization was not associated with PCS manifestation. Arthralgia and diarrhea persisted in more than 40% of PCS patients. The median of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 866.2 U/mL (IQR: 238.2 to 1681). Despite this variability, 98 patients were seropositive. Based on autonomic symptoms (by COMPASS 31) two clusters were obtained with different clinical characteristics. Levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were not different between clusters. A total of 40 articles (11,196 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Fatigue/muscle weakness, dyspnea, pain and discomfort, anxiety/depression and impaired concentration were presented in more than 20% of patients reported. In conclusion, PCS is mainly characterized by musculoskeletal, pulmonary, digestive and neurological involvement including depression. PCS is independent of severity of acute illness and humoral response. Long-term antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and a high inter-individual variability were confirmed. Future studies should evaluate the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may cause PCS and the best therapeutic options.

However, the pathways between frailty, postoperative complications, and mortality are poorly described. The authors hypothesized that the occurrence of postoperative complications would mediate a substantial proportion of the total effect of frailty on mortality after elective noncardiac surgery. METHODS: Following protocol registration, the authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of intermediate- to high-risk elective noncardiac surgery patients (2016) using National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data. The authors conducted Bayesian mediation analysis of the relationship between preoperative frailty (exposure, using the Risk Analysis Index), serious complications (mediator), and 30-day mortality (outcome), comprehensively adjusting for confounders. The authors estimated the total effect of frailty on mortality (composed of the indirect effect mediated by complications and the remaining direct effect of frailty) and estimated the proportion of the frailty-mortality association mediated by complications. RESULTS: The authors identified 205,051 patients; 1,474 (0.7%) died. Complications occurred in 20,211 (9.9%). A 2 SD increase in frailty score resulted in a total association with mortality equal to an odds ratio of 3.79 (95% credible interval, 2.48 to 5.64), resulting from a direct association (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% credible interval, 1.34 to 2.30) and an indirect association mediated by complications (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% credible interval, 1.58 to 2.96). Complications mediated 57.3% (95% credible interval, 40.8 to 73.8) of the frailty-mortality association. Cardiopulmonary complications were the strongest mediators among complication subtypes.

Identifying the barriers, benefits and training needs highlighted by clinicians may support the effective delivery of care. METHOD: Changes in the mode therapy sessions were delivered in during 2020 were assessed in two high-volume psychological therapies services. Sixty-six therapists completed a survey about their experiences of delivering therapy via video. RESULTS: The lockdown in March 2020 precipitated a dramatic shift from face-to-face to telephone and video-delivered sessions. Most clinicians (89%) found video-based sessions acceptable. Barriers to effective delivery included technological issues, problems with online platforms, and feeling more tired after sessions. Benefits included generalised learning from behavioural work, improvements in efficiency and in the therapeutic relationship, particularly in comparison with telephone-based sessions. Tutorials and support guides were recommended to maximise use of sessions via video. CONCLUSIONS: Video-delivered therapy was liked by clinicians and preferred to telephone-based sessions. Issues with platforms, internet connections and access for patients need addressing, local troubleshooting guides, video-based tutorials and greater support for low-intensity therapists to maximise uptake of video sessions where appropriate, may be beneficial.","Buckman, Joshua E J; Saunders, Rob; Leibowitz, Judy; Minton, Rebecca",Behav Cogn Psychother,324,26

The worldwide epidemiologic data showed higher mortality in males compared to females, suggesting a hypothesis about the protective effect of estrogens against severe disease progression with the ultimate end being patient's death. This article summarizes the current knowledge regarding the potential effect of estrogens and other modulators of estrogen receptors on COVID-19. While estrogen receptor activation shows complex effects on the patient's organism, such as an influence on the cardiovascular/pulmonary/immune system which includes lower production of cytokines responsible for the cytokine storm, the receptor-independent effects directly inhibits viral replication. Furthermore, it inhibits the interaction of IL-6 with its receptor complex. Interestingly, in addition to natural hormones, phytestrogens and even synthetic molecules are able to interact with the estrogen receptor and exhibit some anti-COVID-19 activity. From this point of view, estrogen receptor modulators have the potential to be included in the anti-COVID-19 therapeutic arsenal.","Abramenko, Nikita; Vellieux, Fréderic; Tesarová, Petra; Kejík, Zdenek; Kaplánek, Robert; Lacina, Lukás; Dvoránková, Barbora; Rösel, Daniel; Brábek, Jan; Tesar, Adam; Jakubek, Milan; Smetana, Karel",Int. j. mol. sci.

Learning from current experiences and challenges,19.999805,5.2937207,2020,"Based on HARPS-N radial velocities (RVs) and TESS photometry, we present a full characterisation of the planetary system orbiting the early K dwarf TOI-561. After the identification of three transiting candidates by TESS, we discovered two additional external planets from RV analysis. RVs cannot confirm the outer TESS transiting candidate, which would also make the system dynamically unstable. We demonstrate that the two transits initially associated with this candidate are instead due to single transits of the two planets discovered using RVs. The four planets orbiting TOI-561 include an ultra-short period (USP) super-Earth (TOI-561 b) with period $P_{\rm b} = 0.45$ d, mass $M_{\rm b} =1.59 \pm 0.36$ M$_\oplus$ and radius $R_{\rm b}=1.42 \pm 0.07$ R$_\oplus$, and three mini-Neptunes: TOI-561 c, with $P_{\rm c} = 10.78$ d, $M_{\rm c} = 5.40 \pm 0.98$ M$_\oplus$, $R_{\rm c}= 2.88 \pm 0.09$ R$_\oplus$; TOI-561 d, with $P_{\rm d} = 25.6$ d, $M_{\rm d} = 11.9 \pm 1.3$ M$_\oplus$, $R_{\rm d} = 2.53 \pm 0.13$ R$_\oplus$; and TOI-561 e, with $P_{\rm e} = 77.2$ d, $M_{\rm e} = 16.0 \pm 2.3$ M$_\oplus$, $R_{\rm e} = 2.67 \pm 0.11$ R$_\oplus$. Having a density of $3.0 \pm 0.8$ g cm$^{-3}$, TOI-561 b is the lowest density USP planet known to date. Our N-body simulations confirm the stability of the system and predict a strong, anti-correlated, long-term transit time variation signal between planets d and e. The unusual density of the inner super-Earth and the dynamical interactions between the outer planets make TOI-561 an interesting follow-up target.","Lacedelli, G.; Malavolta, L.; Borsato, L.; Piotto, G.; Nardiello, D.; Mortier, A.; Stalport, M.; Cameron, A.

Early-stage predictive biomarkers are needed to identify patients with a high risk of severe clinical courses and to stratify treatment strategies. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was previously described as a potential predictor for the outcome of critically ill patients and for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease. This prospective observational study evaluates the predictive potential of MIF for the clinical outcome after severe COVID-19 infection. Plasma MIF concentrations were measured in 36 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients over three days after intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Increased compared to decreased MIF was significantly associated with aggravated organ function and a significantly lower 28-day survival (sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score; 8.2 ± 4.5 to 14.3 ± 3, p = 0.009 vs. 8.9 ± 1.9 to 12 ± 2, p = 0.296; survival: 56% vs. 93%; p = 0.003). Arterial hypertension was the predominant comorbidity in 85% of patients with increasing MIF concentrations (vs. decreasing MIF: 39%; p = 0.015). Without reaching significance, more patients with decreasing MIF were able to improve their ARDS status (p = 0.142). The identified association between an early MIF response, aggravation of organ function and 28-day survival may open future perspectives for biomarker-based diagnostic approaches for ICU management of COVID-19 patients.","Bleilevens, Christian; Soppert, Josefin; Hoffmann, Adrian; Breuer, Thomas; Bernhagen, Jürgen; Martin, Lukas; Stiehler, Lara; Marx, Gernot; Dreher, Michael; Stoppe, Christian; Simon, Tim-Philipp",Diagnostics (Basel),324,22

Health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of infection because the virus is highly contagious and can be transmitted by a variety of routes. Health care workers are required to use a variety of personal protective equipment (PPE) for prolonged hours and, as a result, they face varying degrees of cutaneous complications. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online questionnaire survey to investigate skin problems caused by the use of PPE and personal hygiene measures. We developed a survey with 32 questions using Google forms and distributed it via WhatsApp and Facebook groups. RESULTS: A total of 1142 responses were obtained. Among the respondents, 88.1% reported adverse skin reactions due to PPE and personal hygiene measures. Female sex, working as a nurse, wearing PPE more than 6 h/day, and working more than 3 days/week increase the risk of PPE-related skin problems. CONCLUSION: In this study, we highlighted skin problems related to PPE and found out risk factors for PPE-related skin problems.","Etgu, Fatma; Onder, Sevda",Cutan Ocul Toxicol,324,22

We examined the levels and predictors of COVID symptoms, defined as fever plus difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, dry cough so severe that it disrupts sleep, and/or loss of sense of smell; and testing for SARS-CoV-2 by respondents and/or household members. About 8% of Canadians reported that they and/or one or more household members experienced COVID symptoms. Symptoms were more common in younger than in older adults, and among visible minorities. Overall, only 3% of respondents and/or household members reported testing for SARS-CoV-2. Being tested was associated with having COVID symptoms, Indigenous identity, and living in Quebec. Periodic nationally representative surveys of symptoms, as well as SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, are required in many countries to understand the pandemic and prepare for the future.","Wu, Daphne C; Jha, Prabhat; Lam, Teresa; Brown, Patrick; Gelband, Hellen; Nagelkerke, Nico; Birnboim, H Chaim; Reid, Angus",PLoS One,324,16

However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this complication remain unclear. A better understanding of causative processes by which COVID-19 may lead to cognitive impairment is essential for developing preventive and therapeutic interventions. METHODS: In this study, we conducted a network-based, multimodal omics comparison of COVID-19 and neurologic complications. We constructed the SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interactome from protein-protein interaction assay and CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic assay results and compared network-based relationships therein with those of known neurological manifestations using network proximity measures. We also investigated the transcriptomic profiles (including single-cell/nuclei RNA-sequencing) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) marker genes from patients infected with COVID-19, as well as the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in the brains of AD patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We found significant network-based relationships between COVID-19 and neuroinflammation and brain microvascular injury pathways and processes which are implicated in AD. We also detected aberrant expression of AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients with COVID-19. While transcriptomic analyses showed relatively low expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in human brain, neuroinflammatory changes were pronounced. In addition, single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses showed that expression of SARS-CoV-2 host factors (BSG and FURIN) and antiviral defense genes (LY6E, IFITM2, IFITM3, and IFNAR1) was elevated in brain endothelial cells of AD patients and healthy controls relative to neurons and other cell types, suggesting a possible role for brain microvascular injury in COVID-19-mediated cognitive impairment. Overall, individuals with the AD risk allele APOE E4/E4 displayed reduced expression of antiviral defense genes compared to APOE E3/E3 individuals. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest significant mechanistic overlap between AD and COVID-19, centered on neuroinflammation and microvascular injury. These results help improve our understanding of COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations and provide guidance for future development of preventive or treatment interventions, although causal relationship and mechanistic pathways between COVID-19 and AD need future investigations.","Zhou, Yadi; Xu, Jielin; Hou, Yuan; Leverenz, James B; Kallianpur, Asha; Mehra, Reena; Liu, Yunlong; Yu, Haiyuan; Pieper, Andrew A; Jehi, Lara; Cheng, Feixiong",Alzheimers Res Ther,324,1

However, it also provided new opportunities for arts and cultural engagement through virtual activities and streamed performances. Yet it remains unclear (i) who was likely to engage with the arts at home during lockdown, (ii) how this engagement differed from patterns of arts engagement prior to COVID-19, and (iii) whether home-based arts engagement was related to people's ability to cope with their emotions during lockdown. This study was therefore designed to address these questions. Methods: We used data collected in late May from the United Kingdom COVID-19 Social Study run by University College London. Multivariate regressions were used for the analysis (N = 19,384). Identified factors included demographic factors, socio-economic position, psychosocial wellbeing and health conditions, adverse events/worries, and coping styles. Results: Four types of home-based arts engagement were identified during the COVID-19 pandemic: digital arts and writing, musical activities, crafts, and reading for pleasure. Our results show that the strongest predictors of the engagement were age, education attainment, social support, and emotion-focused or supportive coping styles. In particular, younger adults (aged 18-29), non-keyworkers, people with greater social support, people who had lost work, those who were worried about catching the virus, and those with an emotion-focused, problem-focused or supportive coping style were more likely to have increased arts engagement during lockdown. Arts activities were used as approach and avoidance strategies to help cope with emotions, as well as to help improve self-development. Conclusion: Overall, our study suggests that while some people who engaged in the arts during the COVID-19 pandemic were those who typically engage under normal circumstances, the pandemic has also created new incentives and opportunities for others to engage virtually. Additionally, this study highlights the value of the arts as coping tools during stressful situations.","Mak, H. W.; Fluharty, M.; Fancourt, D.",Frontiers in Psychology,324,32

The model simulates three interrelated stochastic processes: epidemic spreading, availability of respiratory ventilators and changes in death statistics. We consider local and non-local modes of disease transmission. The first simulates transmission through social contacts in the vicinity of the place of residence while the second through social contacts in public places: schools, hospitals, airports, etc., where many people meet, who live in remote geographic locations. Epidemic spreading is modelled as a discrete-time stochastic process on random geometric networks. We use the Monte-Carlo method in the simulations. The following assumptions are made. The basic reproduction number is R0=2.5 and the infectious period lasts approximately ten days. Infections lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome in about one percent of cases, which are likely to lead to respiratory default and death, unless the patient receives an appropriate medical treatment. The healthcare system capacity is simulated by the availability of respiratory ventilators or intensive care beds. Some parameters of the model, like mortality rates or the number of respiratory ventilators per 100,000 inhabitants, are chosen to simulate the real values for the USA and Poland. In the simulations we compare 'do-nothing' strategy with mitigation strategies based on social distancing and reducing social mixing. We study epidemics in the pre-vacine era, where immunity is obtained only by infection. The model applies only to epidemics for which reinfections are rare and can be neglected. The results of the simulations show that strategies that slow the development of an epidemic too much in the early stages do not significantly reduce the overall number of deaths in the long term, but increase the duration of the epidemic. In particular, a hybrid strategy where lockdown is held for some time and is then completely released, is inefficient.","Burda, Zdzislaw",,324,1

Although effective vaccines against the disease have been developed, there are still points to be clarified about the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of COVID-19. In this study, we determined the binding energies and the bond types of complexes formed by open (6VYB) and closed (6VXX) forms of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and wild and mutant forms of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 proteins using the molecular docking approach. First, all missense SNPs were found in the NCBI Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP) for IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 and analyzed with SIFT, PROVEAN, PolyPhen-2, SNAP2, Mutation Assessor, and PANTHER cSNP web-based tools to determine their pathogenicity. When at least four of these analysis tools showed that the SNP had a pathogenic effect on the protein product, this SNP was saved for further analysis. Delta delta G (DDG) and protein stability analysis for amino acid changes were performed in the web-based tools I-Mutant, MUpro, and SAAFEC-SEQ. The structural effect of amino acid change on the protein product was made using the HOPE web-based tool. HawkDock server was used for molecular docking and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) analysis and binding energies of all complexes were calculated. BIOVIA Discovery Studio program was utilized to visualize the complexes. Hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and non-bonded contacts between Spike and IFITM protein chains in the complexes were detected with the PDBsum web-based tool. The best binding energy among the 6VYB-IFITM wild protein complexes belong to 6VYB-IFITM1 (-46.16 kcal/mol). Likewise, among the 6VXX-IFITM wild protein complexes, the most negative binding energy belongs to 6VXX-IFITM1 (-52.42 kcal/mol). An interesting result found in the study is the presence of hydrogen bonds between the cytoplasmic domain of the IFITM1 wild protein and the S2 domain of 6VYB. Among the Spike-IFITM mutant protein complexes, the best binding energy belongs to the 6VXX-IFITM2 N63S complex (-50.77 kcal/mol) and the worst binding energy belongs to the 6VXX-IFITM3 S50T complex (4.86 kcal/mol). The study suggests that IFITM1 protein may act as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Assays must be advanced from in silico to in vitro for the determination of the receptor-ligand interactions between IFITM proteins and SARS-CoV-2.","Giritlioglu, Nazli Irmak; Kucuk, Gizem Koprululu",,324,21

We assessed whether adding azithromycin to standard of care, which included hydroxychloroquine, would improve clinical outcomes of patients admitted to the hospital with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised clinical trial at 57 centres in Brazil. We enrolled patients admitted to hospital with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and at least one additional severity criteria as follows: use of oxygen supplementation of more than 4 L/min flow; use of high-flow nasal cannula; use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation; or use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to azithromycin (500 mg via oral, nasogastric, or intravenous administration once daily for 10 days) plus standard of care or to standard of care without macrolides. All patients received hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily for 10 days) because that was part of standard of care treatment in Brazil for patients with severe COVID-19. The primary outcome, assessed by an independent adjudication committee masked to treatment allocation, was clinical status at day 15 after randomisation, assessed by a six-point ordinal scale, with levels ranging from 1 to 6 and higher scores indicating a worse condition (with odds ratio [OR] greater than 1·00 favouring the control group). The primary outcome was assessed in all patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by molecular or serological testing before randomisation (ie, modified ITT [mITT] population). Safety was assessed in all patients according to which treatment they received, regardless of original group assignment. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04321278. FINDINGS: 447 patients were enrolled from March 28 to May 19, 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed in 397 patients who constituted the mITT population, of whom 214 were assigned to the azithromycin group and 183 to the control group. In the mITT population, the primary endpoint was not significantly different between the azithromycin and control groups (OR 1·36 [95% CI 0·94-1·97], p=0·11). Rates of adverse events, including clinically relevant ventricular arrhythmias, resuscitated cardiac arrest, acute kidney failure, and corrected QT interval prolongation, were not significantly different between groups. INTERPRETATION: In patients with severe COVID-19, adding azithromycin to standard of care treatment (which included hydroxychloroquine) did not improve clinical outcomes. Our findings do not support the routine use of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine in patients with severe COVID-19.

We here summarize the clinical and radiological characteristics of 90 confirmed cases and analyze their role in predicting the evolution of fibrosis. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiological data of 90 patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis. All subjects underwent an HRCT study on the day of admission and eight weeks later, and were treated with lopinavir + ritonavir (Kaletra) 400/100 mg two times a day or darunavir + ritonavir two times a day, and Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg two times a day. Pulmonary fibrosis was defined according to the Fleischner Society glossary of terms for thoracic imaging. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients developed pulmonary fibrosis (25.5%): 15 were males, whose mean age was 75 ± 15. The majority were active smokers (60.8%) and had comorbidities (78.2%), above all, hypertension (47.8%), and diabetes (34.7%). Interestingly, in our series of cases, the ""reversed halo sign"" is frequent (63%) and seems to be a typical COVID-19 pneumonitis pattern. The patients showing fibrosis had a higher grade of systemic inflammation (ESR and PCR) and appeared to have bone marrow inhibition with a significant reduction in platelets, leukocytes, and hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, our data showed that the reversed halo sign associated with a ground-glass pattern may be a typical HRCT pattern of COVID-19 pneumonitis. The evolution to pulmonary fibrosis is frequent in older males and patients with comorbidities and bone marrow involvement.","Marvisi, Maurizio; Ferrozzi, Francesco; Balzarini, Laura; Mancini, Chiara; Ramponi, Sara; Uccelli, Mario",Int J Infect Dis,324,6

With many different healthcare professionals contributing to the prehabilitation literature, there is significant variation in reported primary endpoints that restricts comparison. In addition, there has been limited work on patient-related outcome measures suggesting that patients with colorectal cancer needs and issues are being overlooked. The Defining Standards in Colorectal Optimisation Study aims to achieve international consensus from all stakeholders on key standards to provide a framework for reporting future prehabilitation research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review will identify key standards reported in trials of prehabilitation in colorectal surgery. Standards that are important to patients will be identified by a patient and public involvement (PPI) event. The longlist of standards generated from the systematic review and PPI event will be used to develop a three-round online Delphi process. This will engage all stakeholders (healthcare professionals and patients) both nationally and internationally. The results of the Delphi will be followed by a face-to-face interactive consensus meeting that will define the final standards for prehabilitation for elective colorectal surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The University of Glasgow College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences Ethics Committee has approved this protocol, which is registered as a study (200190120) with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative.

The value of epidemiological models lies in their ability to study various scenarios and to provide governments with a priori knowledge of the consequence of disease incursions and the impact of preventive strategies. A prevalent method of modeling the spread of pandemics is to categorize individuals in the population as belonging to one of several distinct compartments, which represents their health status with regard to the pandemic. In this work, a modified SIR epidemic model is proposed and analyzed with respect to the identification of its parameters and initial values based on stated or recorded case data from public health sources to estimate the unreported cases and the effectiveness of public health policies such as social distancing in slowing the spread of the epidemic. The analysis aims to highlight the importance of unreported cases for correcting the underestimated basic reproduction number. In many epidemic outbreaks, the number of reported infections is likely much lower than the actual number of infections which can be calculated from the model’s parameters derived from reported case data. The analysis is applied to the COVID-19 pandemic for several countries in the Gulf region and Europe.","Sallahi, Narjiss Park Heesoo El Mellouhi Fedwa Rachdi Mustapha Ouassou Idir Belhaouari Samir Arredouani Abdelilah Bensmail Halima",Biology,324,16

Especially in helicopter emergency medical systems (HEMS), which have limitations regarding loading weight and space and typically operate in rural and remote areas, whether MCDs have benefits for patients is still unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of MCDs in a large Swiss HEMS system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of all HEMS missions of Swiss Air rescue Rega between January 2014 and June 2016 with the use of an MCD (Autopulse®). Details of MCD use and patient outcome are reported from the medical operation journals and the hospitals' discharge letters. RESULTS: MCDs were used in 626 HEMS missions, and 590 patients (94%) could be included. 478 (81%) were primary missions and 112 (19%) were interhospital transfers. Forty-nine of the patients in primary missions were loaded under ongoing CPR with MCDs. Of the patients loaded after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 20 (7%) experienced a second CA during the flight. In interhospital transfers, 102 (91%) only needed standby use of the MCD. Five (5%) patients were loaded into the helicopter with ongoing CPR. Five (5%) patients went into CA during flight and the MCD had to be activated. A shockable cardiac arrhythmia was the only factor significantly associated with better survival in resuscitation missions using MCD (OR 0.176, 95% confidence interval 0.084 to 0.372, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We conclude that equipping HEMS with MCDs may be beneficial, with non-trauma patients potentially benefitting more than trauma patients.","Pietsch, Urs; Reiser, David; Wenzel, Volker; Knapp, Jürgen; Tissi, Mario; Theiler, Lorenz; Rauch, Simon; Meuli, Lorenz; Albrecht, Roland",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,324,13

To data, although some vaccines have been developed, there are no ideal drugs to treat novel coronavirus pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)). By examining the structure of the coronavirus and briefly describing its possible pathogenesis based on recent autopsy reports conducted by various teams worldwide, this review analyzes the possible structural and functional changes of the human body upon infection with SARS-CoV-2. We observed that the most prominent pathological changes in COVID-19 patients are diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) of the lungs and microthrombus formation, resulting in an imbalance of the ventilation/perfusion ratio and respiratory failure. Although direct evidence of viral infection can also be found in other organs and tissues, the viral load is relatively small. The conclusion that the injuries of the extra-pulmonary organs are directly caused by the virus needs further investigation.","Wu, Zhonglin; Zhang, Qi; Ye, Guo; Zhang, Hui; Heng, Boon Chin; Fei, Yang; Zhao, Bing; Zhou, Jing",J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,324,16

The COVID-19 pandemic has crippled health systems, exacerbated household food insecurity, and reversed economic growth, which together could set back improvements in undernutrition across low-income and middle-income countries. This paper highlights how the evidence base for nutrition, health, food systems, social protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions has evolved since the 2013 Lancet Series on maternal and child nutrition and identifies the priority actions needed to regain and accelerate progress within the next decade. Policies and interventions targeting the first 1000 days of life, including some newly identified since 2013, require renewed commitment, implementation research, and increased funding from both domestic and global actors. A new body of evidence from national and state-level success stories in stunting reduction reinforces the crucial importance of multisectoral actions to address the underlying determinants of undernutrition and identifies key features of enabling political environments. To support these actions, well-resourced nutrition data and information systems are essential. The paper concludes with a call to action for the 2021 Nutrition for Growth Summit to unite global and national nutrition stakeholders around common priorities to tackle a large, unfinished undernutrition agenda-now amplified by the COVID-19 crisis.","Heidkamp, Rebecca A; Piwoz, Ellen; Gillespie, Stuart; Keats, Emily C; D039,; Alimonte, Mary R; Menon, Purnima; Das, Jai K; Flory, Augustin; Clift, Jack W; Ruel, Marie T; Vosti, Stephen; Akuoku, Jonathan Kweku; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Lancet,324,16

Currently, it is one of the major threats to humanity. Moreover, any specific drug or vaccine unavailability against COVID-19 forces to discover a new drug on an urgent basis. Viral cycle inhibition could be one possible way to prevent the further genesis of this viral disease, which can be contributed by drug repurposing techniques or screening of small bioactive natural molecules against already validated targets of COVID-19. The main protease (Mpro) responsible for producing functional proteins from polyprotein is an important key step for SARS-CoV-2 virion replication. Natural product or herbal based formulations are an important platform for potential therapeutics and lead compounds in the drug discovery process. Therefore, here we have screened >53,500 bioactive natural molecules from six different natural product databases against Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) of COVID-19 through computational study. Further, the top three molecules were subjected to pharmacokinetics evaluation, which is an important factor that reduces the drug failure rate. Moreover, the top three screened molecules (C00014803, C00006660, ANLT0001) were further validated by a molecular dynamics study under a condition similar to the physiological one. Relative binding energy analysis of three lead molecules indicated that C00014803 possess highest binding affinity among all three hits.

Scientists and Researchers are having difficulty in finding articles that contain information relevant to them. Proper extraction of biomedical entities like Disease, Drug/chem, Species, Gene/protein, can considerably improve the filtering of articles resulting in better extraction of relevant information. Performance on BioNer benchmarks has progressively improved because of progression in transformers-based models like BERT, XLNet, OpenAI, GPT2, etc. These models give excellent results; however, they are computationally expensive and we can achieve better scores for domain-specific tasks using other contextual string-based models and LSTM-CRF based sequence tagger. Results: We introduce BioNerFlair, a method to train models for biomedical named entity recognition using Flair plus GloVe embeddings and Bidirectional LSTM-CRF based sequence tagger. With almost the same generic architecture widely used for named entity recognition, BioNerFlair outperforms previous state-of-the-art models. I performed experiments on 8 benchmarks datasets for biomedical named entity recognition. Compared to current state-of-the-art models, BioNerFlair achieves the best F1-score of 90.17 beyond 84.72 on the BioCreative II gene mention (BC2GM) corpus, best F1-score of 94.03 beyond 92.36 on the BioCreative IV chemical and drug (BC4CHEMD) corpus, best F1-score of 88.73 beyond 78.58 on the JNLPBA corpus, best F1-score of 91.1 beyond 89.71 on the NCBI disease corpus, best F1-score of 85.48 beyond 78.98 on the Species-800 corpus, while near best results was observed on BC5CDR-chem, BC3CDR-disease, and LINNAEUS corpus.","Patel, Harsh",,324,5

Health policies have been amended to allow easy access to virtual health care, highlighting the field's dynamic ability to adapt to a public health crisis. Academic detailing, a peer-to-peer collaborative outreach designed to improve clinical decision-making, has traditionally relied on in-person encounters for effectiveness. A growth in the adoption of telehealth technology translates to increases in academic detailing reach for providers unable to meet with academic detailers in person. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has used academic detailing to promote and reinforce evidence-based practices and has encouraged more virtual academic detailing (e-Detailing). Moreover, VA academic detailers are primarily clinical pharmacy specialists who provide clinical services and education and have made meaningful contributions to improving health care at VA. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and physical isolation orders, VA academic detailers have continued to meet with providers to disseminate critical health care information in a timely fashion by using video-based telehealth. When working through the adoption of virtual technology for the delivery of medical care, providers may need time and nontraditional delivery of ""evidence"" before eliciting signals for change. Academic detailers are well suited for this role and can develop plans to help address provider discomfort surrounding the use of telehealth technology. By using e-Detailing as a method for both familiarizing and normalizing health professionals with video-based telehealth technology, pharmacists are uniquely poised to deliver consultation and direct-care services. Moreover, academic detailing pharmacists are ambassadors of change, serving an important role navigating the evolution of health care in response to emergent public health crises and helping define the norms of care delivery to follow.","Hoffman, Jonathan D; Shayegani, Ramona; Spoutz, Patrick M; Hillman, Ashley D; Smith, Jason P; Wells, Daina L; Popish, Sarah J; Himstreet, Julianne E; Manning, Jane M; Bounthavong, Mark; Christopher, Melissa L D",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),324,24

RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values of SARS-CoV-2 &#8804; 34 and the first 7-9 days of symptoms are associated with enhanced infectivity. We determined Ct values and duration of symptoms of HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. As HCW often assume their greatest risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 is working on a COVID-19 unit, we also determined Ct values and symptom duration of inpatients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. METHODS: From 6/24/2020-8/23/2020, Ct values and duration of symptoms from 13 HCW, 12 outpatients, and 28 inpatients who had a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. RESULTS: Among HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 46.2% (6/13) were asymptomatic and requested testing due to an exposure to someone with COVID-19; 83.3% (5/6) of those exposures occurred in the community rather than in the hospital. The median Ct value of HCW was 23.2, and 84.6% (11/13) had a Ct value &#8804; 34. The median Ct value of 29.0 among outpatients with COVID-19 did not significantly differ from HCW. In contrast, inpatients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test had a median Ct value of 34.0 (p = 0.003), which translated into a median ~1,000-fold lower viral load than observed in HCW. Among those with symptoms related to COVID-19, no (0/6) HCW compared to 50% (6/12) of inpatients had symptoms for at least one week (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: At our institution, asymptomatic COVID-19 accounted for nearly half of the cases among HCW. Symptomatic HCW had high viral loads and short duration of symptoms, both of which are associated with peak infectivity. Infection prevention programs should educate HCW on these findings in an effort to increase adherence to the requirement to maintain six feet separation in workspaces and breakrooms, in addition to consistently wearing personal protection equipment.","McEllistrem, M Catherine; Clancy, Cornelius J; Buehrle, Deanna J; Singh, Nina; Lucas, Aaron; Sirianni, Valerie; Decker, Brooke K",PLoS One,324,1

COVID-19 is spreading rapidly with a high mortality rate due to unavailability of effective treatment or vaccine for the disease. The high rate of mutation and recombination in SARS-CoV2 makes it difficult for scientist to develop specific anti-CoV2 drugs and vaccines. SARS-CoV-2-Mpro cleaves the viral polyprotein to produce a variety of non-structural proteins, but in human host it also cleaves the nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-&#954;B) essential modulator (NEMO), which suppresses the activation of the NF-&#954;B pathway and weakens the immune response. Since the main protease (Mpro) is required for viral gene expression and replication, it is a promising target for antagonists to treat novel coronavirus disease and discovery of high resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-Mpro provide an opportunity for in silico identification of its possible inhibitors. In this study we intend to find novel and potential Mpro inhibitors from around 1830 chemically diverse and therapeutically important secondary metabolites available in the MeFSAT database by performing molecular docking against the Mpro structure of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6LZE). After ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profile and binding energy calculation through MM-GBSA for top five hits, Sterenin M was proposed as a SARS-CoV2-Mpro inhibitor with validation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. Sterenin M seems to have the potential to be a promising ligand against SARS-CoV-2, and thus it requires further validation by in vitro and in vivo studies.","Prajapati, Jignesh; Patel, Rohit; Goswami, Dweipayan; Saraf, Meenu; Rawal, Rakesh M",Comput Biol Med,324,9

In the absence of a vaccine against COVID-19 there is an urgent need to find supportive therapies that can stabilize the immune system and can help to deal with the infection, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly. This is especially relevant for our geriatric institutions and nursing homes. A major potential contributing factor for elderly is due to their high incidence of malnutrition: up to 80% among the hospitalized elderly. Malnutrition results when adequate macronutrients and micronutrients are lacking in the diet. Often missing in public health discussions around preventing and treating COVID-19 patients are nutritional strategies to support optimal function of their immune system. This is surprising, given the importance that nutrients play a significant role for immune function. Several micronutrients, such as vitamin D, retinol, vitamin C, selenium and zinc are of special importance supporting both the adaptive and innate immune systems. As suboptimal status or deficiencies in these immune-relevant micronutrients impair immune function and reduces the resistance to infections, micronutrient deficiencies should therefore be corrected as soon as possible, especially in the elderly and other vulnerable groups. According to epidemiological, experimental and observational studies, some case reports and a few intervention studies the supplementation of vitamin D and/or zinc are promising. The multiple anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of Vitamin D could explain its protective role against immune hyper reaction and cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19. A randomized, placebo-controlled intervention study even shows that high dose vitamin D supplementation promotes viral clearance in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. Besides, the data of a recent prospective study with COVID-19 patients reveal that a significant number of them were zinc deficient. The zinc deficient patients had more complications and the deficiency was associated with a prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. Thus, immune-relevant micronutrients may help to increase the physiological resilience against COVID-19.","Gröber, Uwe; Holick, Michael F",Int J Vitam Nutr Res,324,24

Contact tracing is an essential tool to change the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. Manual contact tracing of Covid-19 cases has significant challenges that limit the ability of public health authorities to minimize community infections. Personalized peer-to-peer contact tracing through the use of mobile apps has the potential to shift the paradigm. Some countries have deployed centralized tracking systems, but more privacy-protecting decentralized systems offer much of the same benefit without concentrating data in the hands of a state authority or for-profit corporations. Machine learning methods can circumvent some of the limitations of standard digital tracing by incorporating many clues and their uncertainty into a more graded and precise estimation of infection risk. The estimated risk can provide early risk awareness, personalized recommendations and relevant information to the user. Finally, non-identifying risk data can inform epidemiological models trained jointly with the machine learning predictor. These models can provide statistical evidence for the importance of factors involved in disease transmission. They can also be used to monitor, evaluate and optimize health policy and (de)confinement scenarios according to medical and economic productivity indicators. However, such a strategy based on mobile apps and machine learning should proactively mitigate potential ethical and privacy risks, which could have substantial impacts on society (not only impacts on health but also impacts such as stigmatization and abuse of personal data).

Similar to the ubiquitous adiabatic approximation of time-dependent density-functional theory, the static approximation, which substitutes a dynamical (\ie, frequency-dependent) kernel by its static limit, is usually enforced in most implementations of the BSE formalism. Here, going beyond the static approximation, we compute the dynamical correction of the electron-hole screening for molecular excitation energies thanks to a renormalized first-order perturbative correction to the static BSE excitation energies. The present dynamical correction goes beyond the plasmon-pole approximation as the dynamical screening of the Coulomb interaction is computed exactly within the random-phase approximation. Our calculations are benchmarked against high-level (coupled-cluster) calculations, allowing to assess the clear improvement brought by the dynamical correction for both singlet and triplet optical transitions.","Loos, Pierre-Franccois; Blase, Xavier",,324,1

The role of children and adolescents in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on susceptibility, symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns, and behavior. Objective: To systematically review the susceptibility to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among children and adolescents compared with adults. Data Sources: PubMed and medRxiv were searched from database inception to July 28, 2020, and a total of 13â¯926 studies were identified, with additional studies identified through hand searching of cited references and professional contacts. Study Selection: Studies that provided data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents (younger than 20 years) compared with adults (20 years and older) derived from contact tracing or population screening were included. Single-household studies were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis: PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data were followed, which was performed independently by 2 reviewers. Quality was assessed using a critical appraisal checklist for prevalence studies. Random-effects meta-analysis was undertaken. Main Outcomes and Measures: Secondary infection rate (contact-tracing studies) or prevalence or seroprevalence (population screening studies) among children and adolescents compared with adults. Results: A total of 32 studies comprising 41â¯640 children and adolescents and 268â¯945 adults met inclusion criteria, including 18 contact-tracing studies and 14 population screening studies. The pooled odds ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.37-0.85), with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 94.6%). Three school-based contact-tracing studies found minimal transmission from child or teacher index cases. Findings from population screening studies were heterogenous and were not suitable for meta-analysis. Most studies were consistent with lower seroprevalence in children compared with adults, although seroprevalence in adolescents appeared similar to adults. Conclusions and Relevance: In this meta-analysis, there is preliminary evidence that children and adolescents have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with an odds ratio of 0.56 for being an infected contact compared with adults. There is weak evidence that children and adolescents play a lesser role than adults in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. This study provides no information on the infectivity of children.","Viner, Russell M; Mytton, Oliver T; Bonell, Chris; Melendez-Torres, G J; Ward, Joseph; Hudson, Lee; Waddington, Claire; Thomas, James; Russell, Simon; van der Klis, Fiona; Koirala, Archana; Ladhani, Shamez; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina; Davies, Nicholas G; Booy, Robert; Eggo, Rosalind M",JAMA pediatr.

When all other diagnoses are exhausted, there is a turn to consideration of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), an idiopathic disease. We describe an unexpected finding in a young, otherwise healthy woman who was initially treated for presumed COP when all other diagnoses were ruled out. Case report: A 49-year-old female with no past medical history presented with dyspnea, cough, and progressive weakness for two weeks. Social history was significant for daily vaping. Vitals revealed a fever of 103.3°F, heart rate of 108 bpm, and respiratory rate of 18 with an oxygen saturation of 89% on room air. Physical exam was notable for decreased breath sounds at the lung bases and poor inspiratory effort. CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism but demonstrated bilateral multifocal consolidates and ground-glass opacities concerning for COVID-19 or pneumocystis pneumonia. Labs showed elevated c-reactive protein, d-dimer, and liver function tests. Testing was negative for HIV and COVID-19, at which point isolation precautions were discontinued. Given that other diagnoses were likely ruled out and alternative explanations for her findings were inconclusive, treatment was initiated and directed towards COP. Diagnostic bronchoscopy was performed and complicated by blood clots in the posterior subsegmental lobes, requiring intubation and ICU transfer, by which time bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) returned positive for COVID-19. With concern for COP due to COVID, treatment was shifted towards management of both disease states with initiation of solumedrol and remdesivir per hospital-specific protocol at the time. Her condition improved with treatment, allowing for extubation and discharge home on low flow supplemental oxygen. Discussion: A patient who presents with nonspecific respiratory complaints without COVID-19 exposure, multiple negative tests, and bloodwork inconsistent with typical infection can pose a significant challenge to healthcare workers. This case was initially treated as COP with differentials including pneumocystis or eosinophilic pneumonia, CAP, and EVALI. After finding COVID-19 in the BAL of a low suspicion case with multiple negative nasal swabs, it is clear that the exclusion of this disease was premature despite guideline-based testing. It also proposes the possibility of developing COP from COVID. This infection must continue to be considered in the setting of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in spite of local disease patterns and negative PCR tests.","Gupta, N.; Condiles, N.; Ahmed, B.; Liu, S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,324,20

Machine learning solutions have been shown to be useful for X-ray analysis and classification in a range of medical contexts. The purpose of this study is to create and evaluate a machine learning model for diagnosis of COVID-19, and to provide a tool for searching for similar patients according to their X-ray scans. In this retrospective study, a classifier was built using a pre-trained deep learning model (ReNet50) and enhanced by data augmentation and lung segmentation to detect COVID-19 in frontal CXR images collected between January 2018 and July 2020 in four hospitals in Israel. A nearest-neighbors algorithm was implemented based on the network results that identifies the images most similar to a given image. The model was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and of the precision-recall (P-R) curve. The dataset sourced for this study includes 2362 CXRs, balanced for positive and negative COVID-19, from 1384 patients (63 +/- 18 years, 552 men). Our model achieved 89.7% (314/350) accuracy and 87.1% (156/179) sensitivity in classification of COVID-19 on a test dataset comprising 15% (350 of 2326) of the original data, with AUC of ROC 0.95 and AUC of the P-R curve 0.94. For each image we retrieve images with the most similar DNN-based image embeddings; these can be used to compare with previous cases.","Goldstein, Elisha; Keidar, Daphna; Yaron, Daniel; Shachar, Yair; Blass, Ayelet; Charbinsky, Leonid; Aharony, Israel; Lifshitz, Liza; Lumelsky, Dimitri; Neeman, Ziv; Mizrachi, Matti; Hajouj, Majd; Eizenbach, Nethanel; Sela, Eyal; Weiss, Chedva S; Levin, Philip; Benjaminov, Ofer; Bachar, Gil N; Tamir, Shlomit; Rapson, Yael; Suhami, Dror; Dror, Amiel A; Bogot, Naama R; Grubstein, Ahuva; Shabshin, Nogah; Elyada, Yishai M; Eldar, Yonina C",,324,11

Therefore, the aim of this study is to find out if using cadaver dissections is still the golden standard for surgical training or using the medical simulators in surgery could replace cadaver dissections. Material / Methods: The study is conducted during the European Orthopaedics & Traumatology Education Platform accredited Shoulder Club International Cadaver Course including a number of 34 orthopedics trainees. The participants were randomly divided into two groups to be trained with the simulator (Group 1) and on cadavers (Group 2), followed by a test performed on shoulder arthroscopy simulator (Virtamed ArthroSTM, Switzerland). There was no conflict of interest before, during, or after the study. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. RESULTS: Group 2 had statistically significant higher Simulation Overview Procedure Time values than Group 1 (p<0.05) (Table 3), the meaning of which is: Participants trained with the simulator completed the given tasks in a shorter period of time. Group 2 had statistically significant higher Scratching of Humerus Cartilage values than Group 1 (p<0.05) (Table 4), which means: Participants trained with simulation has less scratching done on the humerus cartilage than the participants trained on a cadaver. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one to compare VR Simulators with cadavers for surgical education in an objective manner, while using qualitative and quantitative data. According to this study, it is possible to state that VR Simulators are just as effective as cadavers in means of training subjects. As medical education will face a total change all around the world after the COVID-19 pandemic, this study has the potential to be an important guide during and after this period.","HurI, GazI; GÜlSen, Mert RuSen; KarmiS, Ece Belen; KaragÜven, DoGaÇ",,324,24

This study evaluated the pattern of OAT uptake among PWID in two consecutive national bio-behavioral surveillance surveys (2010 and 2014) in Iran. METHODS: Data were obtained from two national bio-behavioral surveillance surveys (N2010 = 1783 and N2014 = 2166) implemented using convenience sampling at the harm reduction facilities and street venues in 10 geographically diverse urban centers across Iran. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to determine the correlates of OAT uptake for the 2014 survey, and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) along with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. RESULTS: The prevalence of OAT uptake decreased from 49.2% in 2010 to 45.8% in 2014 (P value = 0.033). OAT uptake varied across the studied cities ranging from 0.0 to 69.3% in the 2010 survey and 3.2 to 75.5% in the 2014 survey. Ever being married (AOR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.12, 1.75), having a history of incarceration (AOR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.16, 2.09), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sero-positivity (AOR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.08, 2.50) were associated with OAT uptake. Conversely, PWID who reported using only non-opioid drugs (AOR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.26, 0.71) and those who reported concurrent use of opioid and non-opioid drugs (AOR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.51, 0.86) were less likely to uptake OAT. CONCLUSIONS: Although OAT uptake among PWID in Iran is above the 40% threshold defined by the World Health Organization, there remain significant disparities across urban settings in Iran. Importantly, the OAT services appear to be serving high-risk PWID including those living with HIV and those with a history of incarceration. Evaluating service integration including mental health, HIV and hepatitis C virus care, and other harm reduction services may support the optimization of health outcomes associated with OAT across Iran.","Nakhaeizadeh, Mehran; Abdolahinia, Zahra; Sharifi, Hamid; Mirzazadeh, Ali; Haghdoost, Ali Akbar; Shokoohi, Mostafa; Baral, Stefan; Karamouzian, Mohammad; Shahesmaeili, Armita",Harm Reduct J,324,20

The study objective was to describe differences in time from injury to arrival for patients with traumatic hip fractures admitted during the pandemic to pre-pandemic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study at six level I trauma centers included patients with traumatic hip fractures. Patients with a non-fall mechanism and those who were transferred in were excluded. Patients admitted 16 March 2019-30 June 2019 were in the ""pre-pandemic"" group, patients were admitted 16 March 2020-30 June 2020 were in the ""pandemic"" group. The primary outcome was time from injury to arrival. Secondary outcomes were time from arrival to surgical intervention, hospital length of stay (HLOS), and mortality. RESULTS: There were 703 patients, 352 (50.1%) pre-pandemic and 351 (49.9%) during the pandemic. Overall, 66.5% were female and the median age was 82 years old. Patients were similar in age, race, gender, and injury severity score. The median time from injury to hospital arrival was statistically shorter for pre-pandemic patients when compared to pandemic patients, 79.5 (56, 194.5) min vs. 91 (59, 420), p = 0.04. The time from arrival to surgical intervention (p = 0.64) was statistically similar between groups. For both groups, the median HLOS was 5 days, p = 0.45. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher during the pandemic, 1.1% vs 3.4%, p = 0.04. CONCLUSIONS: While time from injury to hospital arrival was statistically longer during the pandemic, the difference may not be clinically important. Time from arrival to surgical intervention remained similar, despite changes made to prevent COVID-19 transmission.","Jarvis, Stephanie; Salottolo, Kristin; Madayag, Robert; Pekarek, Jennifer; Nwafo, Nnamdi; Wessel, Alexander; Duane, Therese; Roberts, Zachary; Lieser, Mark; Corrigan, Chad; Bar-Or, David",J Orthop Surg Res,324,16

We aimed to classify COVID-19 hospitalizations using an existing and novel approach and to assess the interrater reliability of both approaches. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study characterized severity of illness and likelihood of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as the cause of hospitalization in pediatric patients <18 years of age. Subjects had positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal testing or were diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and were hospitalized between May 10, 2020 (when universal screening of all admissions began) and February 10, 2021, at a university-based, quaternary care children's hospital in Northern California. Hospitalizations were categorized as either likely or unlikely to be caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel approach), and disease severity was categorized according to previously published classification of disease severity. RESULTS: Of 117 hospitalizations, 46 (39.3%) were asymptomatic, 33 (28.2%) had mild to moderate disease, 9 (7.7%) had severe illness, and 15 (12.8%) had critical illness (weighted &#954;: 0.82). A total of 14 (12%) patients had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. A total of 53 (45%) admissions were categorized as unlikely to be caused by SARS-CoV-2 (&#954;: 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: Although COVID-19 has considerable associated morbidity and mortality in children, reported hospitalization rates likely lead to overestimation of the true disease burden.","Kushner, Lauren E; Schroeder, Alan R; Kim, Joseph; Mathew, Roshni",Hosp. pediatr.

To identify positive strategies for midwifery education in this context, five case studies from the UK and beyond were conducted using an appreciative enquiry approach, from the perspectives of students, the maternity services, cross-university collaboration, and digital learning. A health system analysis was used to identify strategies to cope, adapt, and transform for the future, at the levels of individuals, teams, and the whole system. Findings showed that the implementation of effective responses was possible. Responding effectively and rapidly to a shock as profound as this pandemic requires courageous, respectful, evidence-based, innovative, collaborative, cross-sectoral working and leadership across education institutions, practice settings, the regulator, government, and with students themselves. Pre-existing trusting relationships and collaborative systems supported rapid responses. Effective digital learning requires a pro-active, student-centred approach, and addressing the problems of inequitable access to equipment and space. Joint problem-solving and focussing on the key outcomes that matter contribute to developing successful strategies and robust processes. The pandemic provides an opportunity for student midwives to be re-imagined as essential members of midwifery teams and not 'just students'. Transformative actions identified include whole-system working, tackling longstanding problems including racism, poverty, prejudice, and systemic discrimination, and keeping students at the heart of the education system.","Renfrew, Mary J; Bradshaw, Gwendolen; Burnett, Alicia; Byrom, Anna; Entwistle, Francesca; King, Kay; Olayiwola, Wendy; Thomas, Grace",Midwifery,324,24

This paper brings together key scientific uncertainties regarding the use of serological tests to assure immune status and a public health ethics perspective to inform key considerations in the ethical implementation of immunity passport policies. Ill-conceived policies have the potential to cause severe unintended harms that could result in greater inequity, the stigmatization of certain sectors of society, and heightened risks and unequal treatment of individuals due to erroneous test results. Immunity passports could, however, be used to achieve collective benefits and benefits for specific populations besides facilitating economic recovery. We conclude that sector-based policies that prioritize access to testing based on societal need are likely to be fairer and logistically more feasible, while minimizing stigma and reducing incentives for fraud. Clear guidelines need to be set out for which sectors of society should be prioritized for testing, and rigorous mechanisms should be in place to validate test results and identify cases of reinfection.","Voo, Teck Chuan; Clapham, Hannah; Tam, Clarence C",J Infect Dis,324,24

Since the initial outbreak, strategies to detect and isolate patients have been important to avoid uncontrolled viral spread. Although testing capacities have been upscaled, there is still a need for reliable high throughput test systems, specifically those that require alternative consumables. Therefore, we tested and compared two different methods for the detection of viral PCR products: rRT-PCR and mass spectrometry (MS). METHODS: Viral RNA was isolated and amplified from oro- or nasopharyngeal swabs. A total of 22 samples that tested positive and 22 samples that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR were analyzed by MS. Results of the rRT-PCR and the MS protocol were compared. RESULTS: Results of rRT-PCR and the MS test system were in concordance in all samples. Time-to-results was faster for rRT-PCR. Hands-on-time was comparable in both assays. CONCLUSIONS: MS is a fast, reliable and cost-effective alternative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from oral and nasopharyngeal swabs.","Wandernoth, Petra; Kriegsmann, Katharina; Groh-Mohanu, Cristina; Daeumer, Martin; Gohl, Peter; Harzer, Oliver; Kriegsmann, Mark; Kriegsmann, Joerg",Viruses,324,1

We assume that dissemination of awareness among susceptible individuals modifies public attitudes and behaviours towards this contagious disease which results in reducing the chance of contact with the coronavirus and hence decreasing the disease transmission. Moreover, the individual's behavioral response in the presence of global information campaigns accelerate the rate of hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and also encourage the asymptomatic individuals for conducting health protocols, such as self-isolation, social distancing, etc. We calibrate the proposed model with the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases for the Republic of India. We estimate eight epidemiologically important parameters, and also the size of basic reproduction number for India. We find that the basic reproduction number for India is greater than unity, which represents the substantial outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. Sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis are employed to determine the impacts of model parameters on basic reproduction number and symptomatic infected population. Our results reveal that to reduce disease burden in India, non-pharmaceutical interventions strategies should be implemented effectively to decrease basic reproduction number below unity. Continuous propagation of awareness through the internet and social media platforms should be regularly circulated by the health authorities/government officials for hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and quarantine of asymptomatic individuals to control the prevalence of disease in India.","Rai, Rajanish Kumar; Khajanchi, Subhas; Tiwari, Pankaj Kumar; Venturino, Ezio; Misra, Arvind Kumar",J Appl Math Comput,324,25

The virus has spread very rapidly to many countries across the world, resulting in the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Clinically, the diagnosis of this unprecedented illness, called coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), becomes difficult because it shares many symptoms with other respiratory pathogens, including influenza and parainfluenza viruses. Therefore, laboratory diagnosis is crucial for the clinical management of patients and the implementation of disease control strategies to contain SARS-CoV-2 at clinical and population level. Here, we summarize the main clinical and imaging findings of COVID-19 patients and discuss the advances, features, advantages, and limitations of different laboratory methods used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","da Silva, Severino Jefferson Ribeiro; Silva, Caroline Targino Alves da; Guarines, Klarissa Miranda; Mendes, Renata Pessôa Germano; Pardee, Keith; Kohl, Alain; Pena, Lindomar",ACS Infect Dis,324,20

This study examines the effects of two positive psychological resources on the mental health of Indian citizens during the early days of the lockdown. The effects of psychological capital (PsyCap) and internal locus of control on psychological distress of people via affect balance were tested. Data were collected through an online survey from 667 participants. Psychological distress was assessed using the GHQ-12, and affect balance was assessed as the preponderance of positive over negative affect. Results reveal that psychological capital and internal locus of control were negatively associated with psychological distress. In addition, affect balance mediated the relationship between psychological capital and psychological distress and the relationship between internal locus of control and psychological distress. Thus, both the psychological resources through affect balance acted as buffers protecting people from mental health deterioration during COVID-19 lockdown. However, the direct and indirect effects of psychological capital on psychological distress is stronger than that of internal locus of control. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.","Alat, Priya; Das, Sitanshu Sekhar; Arora, Alisha; Jha, Amrit Kumar",Curr Psychol,324,24

Employing a survey of 1096 adult Americans recruited via the Lucid platform, we examined the relationships between vaccine attributes, proposed policy interventions such as financial incentives, and misinformation on public vaccination preferences. Higher degrees of vaccine efficacy significantly increased individuals' willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, while a high incidence of minor side effects, a co-pay, and Emergency Use Authorization to fast-track the vaccine decreased willingness. The vaccine manufacturer had no influence on public willingness to vaccinate. We also found no evidence that belief in misinformation about COVID-19 treatments was positively associated with vaccine hesitancy. The findings have implications for public health strategies intending to increase levels of community vaccination.","Kreps, Sarah; Dasgupta, Nabarun; Brownstein, John S; Hswen, Yulin; Kriner, Douglas L",NPJ Vaccines,324,1

Based on the initial findings of a collaborative and comparative research project encompassing twenty-one countries in the Americas (www.inmovilidades.org), this article argues that the current pandemic justifies a perverse intersection between health policies and politics to control mobility that has configured a de facto state of exception in migration matters, which only magnifies the existing tension between mobility and control. By reviewing press material and policy documents, and complementing those with the testimonies of regional and extra-continental migrants, this article proves that common situations are arising across the Americas that disproportionately affect regional and extracontinental undocumented migrants and asylum seekers, consigning them to daily hyper-precarization and dispossession of rights. It also shows that new forms of migrant mobility are emerging. The article thus focuses on five intertwined common situations: 1) border closures and increased internal policing;2) suspension or limitation of the right to refuge;3) selective hyper-nationalist aid programmes;4) the adoption of a new anti-migrant legal architecture;and 5) new forms of migrant mobility and struggle. As the article suggests, against the current pandemic and hyper-control migrant mobilities are strategies for resistance with spatial effects on national and transnational scales across the continent.

En base a los resultados iniciales de un proyecto de investigación [End Page 11] colaborativo y comparativo que abarca vientiuno países de las Américas (www.inmovilidades.org), este artículo sostiene que la actual pandemia justifica una perversa intersección entre políticas de salud y políticas de control a la movilidad que ha configurado un estado de excepción de facto en materia migratoria, que no hace sino magnificar la tensión existente entre movilidad y control. A través de la revisión de material de prensa y documentos de política, y complementando con testimonios de migrantes regionales y extra-continentales, este artículo da cuenta de que en las Américas se están presentando situaciones comunes que afectan de manera desproporcionada a migrantes indocumentados y solicitantes de asilo, confinándolos a una híper-precarización y despojo de derechos cotidiano. También muestra que están surgiendo nuevas formas de movilidad migrante. Así, el artículo se centra en cinco situaciones comunes entrelazadas: 1) cierre de fronteras y aumento de la vigilancia policial interna;2) suspensión o limitación del derecho de refugio;3) programas selectivos de ayuda híper-nacionalista;4) adopción de una nueva arquitectura legal antinmigrante;y 5) nuevas formas de movilidad y lucha migrante.

Wage loss for migrant workers was the most common negative impact but lasted less than 2 months. Overall, rural China has escaped the worst impacts of the pandemic found in other developing countries. We argue that the structure of inequalities in today's China, now primarily based on market differentiations, has become far more complex than the simplistic rural–urban dichotomy based on the household registration (hukou) status can possibly explain. Rather than exacerbating the hukou‐based rural–urban inequality, the true impacts of the pandemic on rural China are more likely to result from the reforms of the agri‐food system. The suspected link between the new pathogen and the food system has created a misinformed urgency for the government to accelerate the industrialization of the food system, which we think can backfire and increase the likelihood of the next outbreak.

This paper aimed to report our experience with spine emergency surgery during the pandemic, with already limited resources for surgery. Methods This was a retrospective, single-center study, involving all patients admitted to our hospital during a period of 1st March – 31st December 2020 and underwent emergent spinal surgery. The data were collected from the patients’ medical records. Results We found 15 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Four patients were suspected to be infected by COVID-19, but none of them was confirmed to be infected by COVID-19 based on the PCR test. All patients had a history of injury: fell from height (53.3%), traffic accident (40%), and direct trauma (6.7%). The average time interval from injury to hospital admission was 38.6 h, from admission to surgery was 6.3 days, and from injury to surgery was 8.1 days. The patient who was suspected to be infected with COVID-19 has a significantly greater time interval from admission to surgery (p = 0.012). The surgery lasted for 3–6 h, with an average of 4.6 h. The average hospital stay duration was 13.3 days and it has a significant positive correlation with the time interval from admission to surgery (p = 0.001). Three months post-operatively, seven patients experienced an improvement in the Frankel grade, 4 patients had no changes in Frankel grade, and 2 patients died. Conclusion To our experience, the lack of human and material resources during the pandemic caused some delay in surgery. However, surgery performed later than 24 h during the pandemic might still bring benefit to the patient.","Sakti, Yudha Mathan Khadafi Rosyad Nur",Annals of Medicine and Surgery,324,24

Within 3 months, the World Health Organization defined COVID-19 as a pandemic, with more than 370,000 cases and 16,000 deaths worldwide. In consideration of the crucial role of diagnostic testing during COVID-19, the aim of this technical note was to provide a complete synthesis of approaches implemented for the management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. KEY FINDINGS: The planning of a robust plan to prevent the transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members should be fundamental in each radiology service. Moreover, the speed of spread and the incidence of the pandemic make it necessary to optimize the use of personal protective devices and dedicated COVID-19 equipment, given the limited availability of supplies. CONCLUSION: In the management of radiographic and CT imaging, staff should take special precautions to limit contamination between patients and other patients or professionals. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: An isolated imaging room should be dedicated to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, including radiography and CT scanners. This paper will provide guidance concerning disposable protective gear to be utilized, as well as on the cleaning and sanitation of radiology room and equipment.","Zanardo, M; Martini, C; Monti, C B; Cattaneo, F; Ciaralli, C; Cornacchione, P; Durante, S",Radiography (Lond),324,1

This study aimed to review and synthesize learning from previous literature focused on the impact on grief and bereavement during other infectious disease outbreaks. We conducted a rapid scoping review according to the principles of the Joanna Briggs Institute and analyzed qualitative data using thematic synthesis. From the 218 identified articles, 6 were included in the analysis. They were four qualitative studies, one observational study, and a systematic review. Studies were conducted in West Africa, Haiti, and Singapore. No research studies have focused on outcomes and support for bereaved people during a pandemic. Studies have tended to focus on survivors who are those who had the illness and recovered, recognizing that some of these individuals will also be bereaved people. Previous pandemics appear to cause multiple losses both directly related to death itself and also in terms of disruption to social norms, rituals, and mourning practices. This affects the ability for an individual to connect with the deceased both before and after the death, potentially increasing the risk of complicated grief. In view of the limited research, specific learning from the current COVID-19 crisis and the impact on the bereaved would be pertinent. Current focus should include innovative ways to promote connection and adapt rituals while maintaining respect. Strong leadership and coordination between different bereavement organisations is essential to providing successful postbereavement support.","Mayland, Catriona R; Harding, Andrew J E; Preston, Nancy; Payne, Sheila",J Pain Symptom Manage,324,14

In the absence of a vaccine, knowledge of the transmission routes and risk areas of infection remain the most important existing tools to prevent further spread. METHODS: Here we investigated the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the hospital environment at the Uppsala University Hospital Infectious Disease ward by RT-qPCR and determined the infectivity of the detected virus in vitro on Vero E6 cells. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in several areas, although attempts to infect Vero E6 cells with positive samples were unsuccessful. However, RNase A treatment of positive samples prior to RNA extraction did not degrade viral RNA, indicating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsids or complete virus particles protecting the RNA as opposed to free viral RNA. CONCLUSION: Our results show that even in places where a moderate concentration (Ct values between 30 and 38) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found; no infectious virus could be detected. This suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the hospital environment subsides in two states; as infectious and as non-infectious. Future work should investigate the reasons for the non-infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virions.","Krambrich, Janina; Akaberi, Dario; Ling, Jiaxin; Hoffman, Tove; Svensson, Lennart; Hagbom, Marie; Lundkvist, Åke",Virol J,324,29

The complexity and dynamism of the tourism industry render it particularly sensitive to internal and external random effects as witnessed with the rapid global expansion of this virulent pandemic and the responding severe quarantine and mobility measures imposed by national governments. Consequently, the fear generated by mass media and social media has led to successive border closures forcing overseas travellers to either cancel or indefinitely postpone travel plans. Could this be the opportunity to develop and implement a blueprint for adaptive and resilient tourism particularly in Small Island Developing States (SIDS)? The tourism sectors of these island states are highly vulnerable to external shocks the impacts of which are far reaching and potentially disastrous for long term national well-being.

Com a pandemia da Covid-19, observa-se que a vulnerabilidade individual da população LGBT+ tornou-se ainda mais intensa e explícita. Diante disso, o presente relato de experiência apresenta e analisa criticamente uma ação de estudantes de Medicina que buscaram promover a representatividade e uma rede de cuidado/apoio e solidariedade entre os(as) estudantes LGBT+ no contexto da pandemia. Relato de experiência: Este relato descreve a construção de um vídeo ""Evoluiu Challenge"" por acadêmicos(as) e médicos(as) graduados(as) do curso de Medicina de uma universidade pública brasileira. Diante do isolamento social e da necessidade de representatividade, encorajamento e empoderamento LGBT+ dentro do espaço acadêmico da Medicina, identificou-se a necessidade de ações, como a produção do vídeo, para que os(as) acadêmicos(as) mais vulnerabilizados(as) possam localizar em seus/suas colegas de curso uma rede de apoio, solidariedade e empoderamento. O projeto foi desenvolvido com 20 estudantes e três egressos(as) da mesma instituição. Ao todo, foram mais de 85 mil visualizações. Discussão: Diante da experiência relatada, destaca-se a importância dos avanços tecnológicos como promotores da ""aproximação"" em tempos de isolamento e distanciamento social. Nesse sentido, o vídeo resultou em significativa visibilidade à população LGBT+ presente no meio médico. Ademais, propiciou representatividade e a construção de uma rede de apoio estudantil, como descrito nas DCN, com a promoção do cuidado. Conclusão: A partir deste relato de experiência, fica visível a necessidade de implementação de estratégias de ações de apoio para a população LGBT+ nas universidades, como as redes de cuidado/solidariedade.

To address CACS patient concerns regarding their experience of care, our cancer center established a specialized CACS clinic in 2016. We applied the team science principle of the team mental model (TMM) to support development of an effective interprofessional collaborative CACS care team. In 2020, cessation of CACS clinic in-person visits during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatened the viability of the entrenched TMM and once again jeopardized the patient experience of care. We present a case-based vignette as a representative composite of patient experiences to illustrate the challenges. A 48-year-old female was referred to our CACS clinic for pancreatic cancer-associated appetite and weight loss during COVID-19. To reduce risk of infection, in-person clinic visits were curtailed. When informed about the resulting need to defer the CACS assessment, the patient and her spouse expressed concern that postponement would adversely affect her ability to undergo anticancer treatments or achieve beneficial outcomes. To minimize delays in CACS treatment and optimize the patient experience of care, we applied the team science principle of sense-making to help the team rapidly reformulate the TMM to provide interprofessional collaborative CACS care via telemedicine. The sense-making initiative highlights opportunities to examine sense-making within health care teams more broadly during and after the pandemic. The application of sense-making within interprofessional cancer care teams has not been described previously.","Portman, D. G.; Thirlwell, S.; Donovan, K.

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, can involve sequelae and other medical complications that last weeks to months after initial recovery, which has come to be called Long-COVID or COVID long-haulers. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to identify studies assessing long-term effects of COVID-19 and estimates the prevalence of each symptom, sign, or laboratory parameter of patients at a post-COVID-19 stage. Methods . LitCOVID (PubMed and Medline) and Embase were searched by two independent researchers. All articles with original data for detecting long-term COVID-19 published before 1 (st) of January 2021 and with a minimum of 100 patients were included. For effects reported in two or more studies, meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed using the MetaXL software to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed using I (2) statistics. This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewers and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, although the study protocol was not registered. Results. A total of 18,251 publications were identified, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of 55 long-term effects was estimated, 21 meta-analyses were performed, and 47,910 patients were included. The follow-up time ranged from 14 to 110 days post-viral infection. The age of the study participants ranged between 17 and 87 years. It was estimated that 80% (95% CI 65-92) of the patients that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed one or more long-term symptoms. The five most common symptoms were fatigue (58%), headache (44%), attention disorder (27%), hair loss (25%), and dyspnea (24%). All meta-analyses showed medium (n=2) to high heterogeneity (n=13). Conclusions . In order to have a better understanding, future studies need to stratify by sex, age, previous comorbidities, the severity of COVID-19 (ranging from asymptomatic to severe), and duration of each symptom. From the clinical perspective, multi-disciplinary teams are crucial to developing preventive measures, rehabilitation techniques, and clinical management strategies with whole-patient perspectives designed to address long COVID-19 care.","Lopez-Leon, S.; Wegman-Ostrosky, T.; Perelman, C.; Sepulveda, R.; Rebolledo, P.; Cuapio, A.; Villapol, S.",,324,15

However, the empirical use of antibiotics is still confusing. Presently, a total of 1123 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University was included in this retrospective cohort study. The clinical features, complications and outcomes were compared between the suspected bacterial infection and the no evidence of bacterial infection. The risk factors of mortality and the incidence of acute organ injury were analyzed. As a result, 473 patients were selected to suspected bacterial infection (SI) group based on higher white blood cell count and procalcitonin or bacterial pneumonia on chest radiography. 650 patients were selected to the no evidence of bacterial infection (NI) group. The SI group had more severely ill patients (70.2% vs. 39.8%), more death (20.5% vs. 2.2%), and more acute organ injury (40.2% vs. 11.2%). Antibiotics were found associated with improved mortality and an increased risk for acute organ injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Intravenous moxifloxacin and meropenem increased the death rate in patients with suspected bacterial infection, while oral antibiotics reduced mortality in this group. Moreover, penicillin and meropenem treatments were associated with increased mortality of the patients with no evidence of bacterial infection. In conclusion, patients with suspected bacterial infection were more likely to have negative clinical outcomes than those without bacterial infection.

Since COVID-19 emergence, many therapeutic regimens have been relentlessly explored, and although two vaccines have just received emergency use authorization by different governmental agencies, antiviral therapeutics based neutralizing antibodies and small-drug inhibitors can still be vital viable options to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. The viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) is the key molecular player that promotes human host cellular invasion via recognition of and binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene (ACE2). In this work, we report the results obtained by mutating in silico the 18 ACE2 residues and the 14 S-protein receptor binding domain (S-RBDCoV-2) residues that contribute to the receptor/viral protein binding interface. Specifically, each wild-type protein-protein interface residue was replaced by a hydrophobic (isoleucine), polar (serine and threonine), charged (aspartic acid/glutamic acid and lysine/arginine), and bulky (tryptophan) residue, respectively, in order to study the different effects exerted by nature, shape, and dimensions of the mutant amino acids on the structure and strength of the resulting binding interface. The computational results were next validated a posteriori against the corresponding experimental data, yielding an overall agreement of 92%. Interestingly, a non-negligible number of mis-sense variations were predicted to enhance ACE2/S-RBDCoV-2 binding, including the variants Q24T, T27D/K/W, D30E, H34S7T/K, E35D, Q42K, L79I/W, R357K, and R393K on ACE2 and L455D/W, F456K/W, Q493K, N501T, and Y505W on S-RBDCoV-2, respectively.","Laurini, Erik; Marson, Domenico; Aulic, Suzana; Fermeglia, Alice; Pricl, Sabrina",ACS Nano,324,1

Here, we have profiled the different B cell subsets elicited upon vaccination, using machine learning methods for interpreting high-dimensional flow cytometry data sets. The B cell response elicited by an adjuvanted vaccine formulation, compared to the antigen alone, was characterized using two automated methods based on clustering (FlowSOM) and dimensional reduction (t-SNE) approaches. The clustering method identified, based on multiple marker expression, different B cell populations, including plasmablasts, plasma cells, germinal center B cells and their subsets, while this profiling was more difficult with t-SNE analysis. When undefined phenotypes were detected, their characterization could be improved by integrating the t-SNE spatial visualization of cells with the FlowSOM clusters. The frequency of some cellular subsets, in particular plasma cells, was significantly higher in lymph nodes of mice primed with the adjuvanted formulation compared to antigen alone. Thanks to this automatic data analysis it was possible to identify, in an unbiased way, different B cell populations and also intermediate stages of cell differentiation elicited by immunization, thus providing a signature of B cell recall response that can be hardly obtained with the classical bidimensional gating analysis. © 2019 The Authors.

Sacco Hospital (Milan, Italy) between 21 February and 31 March 2020, patients with a laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 who also underwent a CXR were included in the study. To quantify the extent of lung involvement, each CXR image was given a score (Milan score), ranging from 0 to 24, depending on the presence of reticular pattern and/or ground-glass opacities and/or extensive consolidations in each of the 12 areas in which the lungs were divided. The score was calculated by an expert radiologist, blinded to laboratory tests. The ability of the Milan score to predict hospital admission and mortality, after adjusting for some variables (age; gender; comorbidities; time between symptoms onset and admission), using univariate and multivariate statistical analysis was investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: Among the 554 patients, 115 of which (21%) had a negative CXR, the in-hospital mortality was 16% (90/554). At univariate analysis, age, gender, and comorbidities were significant predictors of mortality and hospital admission. At multivariate analysis, adjusting for age and gender, the Milan score was an independent predictor of mortality and hospitalisation. In particular, patients with a Milan score &#8805; 9 had a mortality risk five-times higher than those with a lower score. Other independent predictors of mortality were gender and age. CONCLUSIONS: The CXR Milan score was an independent predictive factor of both in-hospital mortality and hospital admission.","Flor, N; Casazza, G; Saggiante, L; Savoldi, A P; Vitale, R; Villa, P; Martucci, F; Ballone, E; Castelli, A; Brambilla, A M",Clin. radiol,324,1

Corrected minute ventilation (VÌEcorr ) is a simple surrogate of dead space, but, despite its increasing use, its association with mortality has not been proven. The aim of our study was to assess the association between VÌEcorr and hospital mortality. We also compared the strength of this association with that of estimated VD/VT and ventilatory ratio. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study with prospectively collected data. We evaluated 187 consecutive mechanically ventilated subjects with ARDS caused by novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The association between VÌEcorr and hospital mortality was assessed in multivariable logistic models. The same was done for estimated VD/VT and ventilatory ratio. RESULTS: Mean ± SD VÌEcorr was 11.8 ± 3.3 L/min in survivors and 14.5 ± 3.9 L/min in nonsurvivors (P < .001) and was independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.15, P = .01). The strength of association of VÌEcorr with mortality was similar to that of VD/VT and ventilatory ratio. CONCLUSIONS: VÌEcorr was independently associated with hospital mortality in subjects with ARDS caused by COVID-19. VÌEcorr could be used at the patient's bedside for outcome prediction and severity stratification, due to the simplicity of its calculation. These findings need to be confirmed in subjects with ARDS without viral pneumonia and when lung-protective mechanical ventilation is not rigorously applied.","Fusina, Federica; Albani, Filippo; Bertelli, Michele; Cavallo, Erika; Crisci, Serena; Caserta, Rosalba; Nguyen, Maia; Grazioli, Michele; Schivalocchi, Valeria; Rosano, Antonio; Natalini, Giuseppe",Respir. care,324,16

A response commensurate with this challenge requires engaged leadership and organization across private and public sectors that span federal agencies, public and private healthcare systems, professional organizations, and industry. In the trauma and emergency care communities, we have long discussed the tension between competition in healthcare and the need for regional cooperation to respond to large-scale disasters. The response to COVID-19 has required unprecedented coordination of private and public sector entities. Given the competitive nature of the US health system, these sectors do not regularly work together despite the requirement to do so during a national emergency. This crisis has exposed how structural aspects of the present healthcare system have limited our ability to rapidly transition to a whole-nation response during a national crisis.

This study aimed to determine the relationship between changes in temperature, humidity, rainfall, and SARS-CoV-2 contagion. Five ecologically and climatically distinct regions were considered-Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, and Gilgit-Baltistan. Method: Data on daily COVID-19 cases and deaths were retrieved from government officials, while meteorological information was collected from Pakistan Meteorological Department.. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20 and the Spearman rank correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between the meteorological factors and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Result: Positive correlation of COVID-19 incidence was observed with all the temperature ranges (maximum, minimum and average) and negative correlation was seen with humidity, DTR and rainfall. COVID-19 deaths were positively associated with temperature and were negatively associated only with humidity. Linear regression showed that for every unit increase in humidity, there was a -3.345 daily significant decrease in COVID-19 cases, while in Karachi for every unit increase in humidity, there remained a 10.104 daily significant increase in cases. In Gilgit-Baltistan, for every unit increase in average temperature and rainfall respectively, significant increases of 0.534 and 1.286 in daily cases were found. Conclusion: This study signifies the effect of climate factors on COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate, but climate factors are not the only variable and several other interlinked factors enhance the spread of COVID-19. Hence, effective mitigation policies, enhancing testing capacities, and developing public attitudes toward adopting precautionary measures are important to overcome this overwhelming pandemic.","Basray, Rabia; Malik, Amber; Waqar, Wajiha; Chaudhry, Ambreen; Wasif Malik, Muhammad; Ali Khan, Mumtaz; Ansari, Jamil A; Ikram, Aamir",J Biosaf Biosecur,324,16

Our approach is motivated by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is the existence of two populations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement and for which the infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non confined for various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The model, initially formulated as a differential system, is discretised following a specific procedure, the discrete system serving as an integrator for the differential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is observed in the COVID-19 epidemic. Several conclusions can be reached, despite the very simple structure of our model. First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by just analysing data from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn out that the epidemic has reached a sizeable part of the world months before it became noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal feature of all our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a rekindling of the epidemic. Thus we sought the conditions for the second epidemic peak to be lower than the first one. This is possible in all the scenarios considered (abrupt, progressive or stepwise exit) but typically a progressive exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the progressive exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too different. From our results, the most promising strategy is that of a stepwise exit. And in fact its implementation could be quite feasible, with the major part of the population (minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously but obeying rigorous distancing constraints.","Nakamura, G.; Grammaticos, B.; Badoual, M.",,324,7

Findings on clinical and hematological parameters alone carry no significance apart from telling patients present status and hence are diminutive. This study aims to assess the hematological and serum biochemistry parameters and correlate them with the presenting symptoms and severity of disease which can help predict the need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, help in triage, assess the severity of the disease which will help clinicians decide their future course of action and further improve patients clinical outcome. Methods A total of 200 COVID-19 positive patients were included. Hematological and serum biochemistry parameters were recorded for the patients at the time of admission and categorized as mild, moderate, and severely ill based on clinical status and then admitted into various wards. Results Total leucocyte count (TLC) was significantly different and higher in severely ill patients (13,200 ± 6,999.2) compared to cases presented with mild and moderate symptoms (12,100 ± 6,488.41& 8,788.20 ± 4,954.32, p = 0.001). The mean difference of TLC, Neutrophil% (N%), Lymphocyte% (L%) and Monocyte (M%) was significantly different between mild and moderate symptoms cases (p = 0.030, p = 0.002, p = 0.004 & p = 0.003). Between groups comparison of moderate vs. severely ill cases showed a significant difference in TLC (p = 0.000), N% (p = 0.000), L% (0.000), and L/N ratio (p = 0.002). The serum ionic calcium (Ca), random blood sugar (RBS), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, prothrombin (PT), International Normalized Ratio (INR), ferritin, and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) level also differed significantly between mild, moderate and severely ill cases (p = 0.001, p=&lt;0.001, p = 0.002, p=&lt;00.1, p = 0006, p = 0.005, p=&lt;0.001 and p=&lt;0.001) respectively. Comparison of the mild vs. severely ill cases showed a significant difference in urea, fibrinogen, and procalcitonin (PCT) level (p = 0.005, p = 0.000 & p = 0.048) respectively. Conclusion The preliminary findings of this study suggest hematological and serum biochemistry parameters could be used as a screening tool to identify patients requiring intensive care and thus allowing clinical stratification and triage at the time of presentation.","Dubey, Deval B.; Mishra, Sridhar Reddy Himanshu D.; Rizvi, Aliya Ali Wahid",Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health,324,20

These materials reduce light penetration, concentrating heating by sunlight closer to the surface. We ran two climate model simulations: one of an ocean including colored detrital matter (Yellow Ocean) and one without (Green Ocean). Due to the decreased water clarity in the Yellow Ocean, upper ocean heat content was lower and temperatures were colder compared to the Green Ocean. The difference between these simulations is opposite to the ocean warming that has been observed in recent decades. Increasing precipitation in high-latitude regions has also been observed, with greater inputs of terrestrial organic materials to the ocean. We suggest that an increase in these yellowing materials behaves as a buffer that mitigates some effects of a warming climate.

The MEWS (AUC = 0.705, p = .007), compared with RAPS, the NRI was 0.371(p = .03), and the IDI = 0.092 (p = .046); The REMS (AUC = 0.841, p < .001), compared with MEWS, the NRI was 0.227(p = .12), and the IDI=0.09(p = .047); The Combining Predictor (AUC = 0.878, p < .001), compared with REMS, the NRI was 0.25(p = .113), and the IDI=0.02(p = .598). CONCLUSION: Patients with an old age, low blood oxygen saturation level and decreased lymphocyte count were at a high risk of COVID-19-related mortality. Moreover, our analysis revealed that the REMS had a better prognostic ability than the MEWS and RAPS when applied to COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggest that the REMS can be used as a rapid scoring tool for the early assessment of COVID-19 severity.","Hu, Hai; Kong, Weili; Yao, Ni; Qiu, Yanru; Yao, Rong",,324,1

The COVID-19 pandemic may further complicate self-care practices associated with HF. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to understand COVID-19's impact on HF self-care, as well as related coping adaptations that may blunt the impact of COVID-19 on HF health outcomes. METHODS: A qualitative study using phone interviews, guided by the framework of vulnerability analysis for sustainability, was used to explore HF self-care among older adults in central Texas during the late spring of 2020. Qualitative data were analyzed using directed content analysis. RESULTS: Seventeen older adults with HF participated (mean [SD] age, 68 [9.1] years; 62% female, 68% White, 40% below poverty line, 35% from rural areas). Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on the HF self-care behavior of physical activity. Themes of social isolation, financial concerns, and disruptions in access to medications and food indicated exposure, and rural residence and source of income increased sensitivity, whereas adaptations by healthcare system, health-promoting activities, socializing via technology, and spiritual connections increased resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings have implications for identifying vulnerabilities in sustaining HF self-care by older adults and empowering older adults with coping strategies to improve overall satisfaction with care and quality of life.","Radhakrishnan, Kavita; Allen, Catherine; DeMain, Atami Sagna; Park, Linda",J. cardiovasc. nurs,324,16

Worldwide measures are taken to prevent human to human transmission and improve general health. Public lifestyle and health are affected by social distancing and isolation. A strong host immune response to the novel coronavirus is a key factor, for protection against infection and avoiding reaching severe stages of the disease. AREAS COVERED: Pathophysiology and the human immune response of similar coronaviruses have been previously described. The novel coronavirus has distinct clinical stages related to the immune response. Exercise improves host innate immunity and affords protection to viral infections. Exercise also mitigates the negative effects of isolation including stress, anxiety, and sedentarism, all of which further reduces immunity and increases non-communicable disease risk. EXPERT OPINION: Improving host immunity and mitigating the negative effects of isolation via physical activity is strongly justified. Exercise should be done in moderate intensities and volumes during the current pandemic, which is a nutritionally, psychologically, socially challenging environment in the presence of a virulent viral organism. Proactively creating innovative health promotion models with technology and government involvement with the best available evidence should be encouraged to reduce physical inactivity during the current COVID-19 pandemic and after.","Ranasinghe, Chathuranga; Ozemek, Cemal; Arena, Ross",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,324,1

We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study to explore the experience of Covid-19 among Haredim. Paper surveys were self-administered between December 2020 and January 2021 in Haredi neighborhood pediatricians' offices in Brooklyn, New York. Of 102 respondents, 43% reported either a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral or antibody test. Participants trusted their physicians, Orthodox medical organizations, and rabbinic leaders for medical information. Knowledge of Covid-19 transmission and risk was good (69% answered &#8805; 4/6 questions correctly). Only 12% of respondents would accept a Covid-19 vaccine, 41% were undecided and 47% were strongly hesitant. Independent predictors of strong vaccine hesitancy included believing natural infection to be better than vaccination for developing immunity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-14.86), agreement that prior infection provides a path toward resuming communal life (aOR 4.10; 95% CI 1.22-13.77), and pandemic-related loss of trust in physicians (aOR 5.01; 95% CI 1.05-23.96). The primary disseminators of health information for self-protective religious communities should be stakeholders who understand these groups' unique health needs.

No specific therapies/vaccines are yet available for the treatment of COVID-19. Drug repositioning may offer a strategy and a number of drugs have been repurposed, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab. This paper describes the main pharmacological properties of such drugs administered to patients with COVID-19, focusing on their antiviral, immune-modulatory and/or anti-inflammatory actions. Where available, data from clinical trials involving patients with COVID-19 are reported. Preliminary clinical trials seem to support their benefit. However, such drugs in COVID-19 patients have peculiar safety profiles. Thus, adequate clinical trials are necessary for these compounds. Nevertheless, while waiting for effective preventive measures i.e. vaccines, many clinical trials on drugs belonging to different therapeutic classes are currently underway. Their results will help us in defining the best way to treat COVID-19 and reducing its symptoms and complications.

The relatively new EN 16615 simulates disinfection by wiping and allows for assessing the recovery of microorganisms from the surface and, importantly, the degree of spread of microorganisms when the surface is disinfected by wiping. For the first time, using this standard, the tested products in the form of commercial disinfectant wipes were compared with self-made wipes soaked in respective disinfectant liquids. The disinfected surfaces were simulated by homogeneous polyvinyl chloride plates. The studies were carried out not only with the standard, but also with clinical multidrug-resistant microbial strains. Based on the research, it can be concluded that the most effective products in the disinfection process (log10 reduction of &#8805;5) with the shortest contact time (1 min) were products containing ethanol, propanol, and quaternary ammonium compounds (self-made wipes) and propanol (commercial wipes).

Then, the binding abilities of these peptides to SARS-CoV-2 main protease and monoamine oxidase A were assessed. The results showed that NADH dehydrogenase could be a good protein source in generating potent binders to the two enzymes, followed by cytochrome b. In addition, some high-affinity oligopeptides (VIQY, ICIY, PISQF, VISAW, AIPAW, and PVSQF) were identified as dual binders to the two enzymes.

We realize this with a variational autoencoder (VAE) over the space of position and orientations of the robot end-effector. Geodesic motion skills let a robot plan movements from and to arbitrary points on the data manifold. They also provide a straightforward method to avoid obstacles by redefining the ambient metric in an online fashion.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus contribute to the propagation of this disease, and the existence of asymptomatic infection has caused widespread fear and concern in the control of this pandemic. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the origin and transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 in Anhui's two clusters, analyzed the role and infectiousness of asymptomatic patients in disease transmission, and characterized the complete spike gene sequences in the Anhui strains. RESULTS: We conducted an epidemiological investigation of two clusters caused by asymptomatic infections sequenced the spike gene of viruses isolated from 12 patients. All cases of the two clusters we investigated had clear contact histories, both from Wuhan, Hubei province. The viruses isolated from two outbreaks in Anhui were found to show a genetically close link to the virus from Wuhan. In addition, new single nucleotide variations were discovered in the spike gene. CONCLUSIONS: Both clusters may have resulted from close contact and droplet-spreading and asymptomatic infections were identified as the initial cause. We also analyzed the infectiousness of asymptomatic cases and the challenges to the current epidemic to provided information for the development of control strategies.","Yuan, Yuan; He, Jun; Gong, Lei; Li, Weiwei; Jiang, Liangliang; Liu, Jiang; Chen, Qingqing; Yu, Junling; Hou, Sai; Shi, Yonglin; Lu, Siqi; Zhang, Zhuhui; Ge, Yinglu; Sa, Nan; He, Lan; Wu, Jiabing; Sun, Yong; Liu, Zhirong",BMC Infect Dis,324,1

The first line of therapy is usually based on oral or intravenous iron supplementation; however, many patients remain anemic and do not respond. The key might lie in the pathogenesis of the anemia itself. Cancer-related anemia (CRA) is characterized by a decreased circulating serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation despite ample iron stores, pointing to a more complex problem related to iron homeostatic regulation and additional factors such as chronic inflammatory status. This review explores our current understanding of iron homeostasis in cancer, shedding light on the modulatory role of hepcidin in intestinal iron absorption, iron recycling, mobilization from liver deposits, and inducible regulators by infections and inflammation. The underlying relationship between CRA and systemic low-grade inflammation will be discussed, and an integrated multitarget approach based on nutrition and exercise to improve iron utilization by reducing low-grade inflammation, modulating the immune response, and supporting antioxidant mechanisms will also be proposed. Indeed, a Mediterranean-based diet, nutritional supplements and exercise are suggested as potential individualized strategies and as a complementary approach to conventional CRA therapy.","Natalucci, Valentina; Virgili, Edy; Calcagnoli, Federica; Valli, Giacomo; Agostini, Deborah; Zeppa, Sabrina Donati; Barbieri, Elena; Emili, Rita",Nutrients,324,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hyperoxic lung injured mice were used as the disease model. Pulmonary fibrosis was determined by H&E and Masson's staining. Autophagy was investigated by western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron microscopy. KEY FINDINGS: We observed that increased CX3CR1 expression corresponded with increased pulmonary fibrosis. Additionally, silencing of CX3CR1 significantly alleviated the fibrosis when compared to the control. We observed that exposure of mouse to hyperoxic environment increased macrophage levels along with an increased CD11b expression in the lung tissues. Subsequently, we also observed an increased expression of LC3-II and decreased p62 expression in hyperoxic mice models, suggesting the potential role of hyperoxia induced autophagy. CD11b and LC3/CX3CR1 were expressed and co-localized in a manner indicating CX3CR1 indeed does regulate macrophage autophagy in the hyperoxic lung injury model. We observed a decrease in hyperoxia-associated fibrosis, along with a decrease in autophagy when we used 3-MA (autophagy inhibitor) in our hyperoxic lung injury model. To elucidate the pathway through which CX3CR1 regulated autophagy, we further analyzed the Akt1 pathway. Our experimental results indicated that the Akt1 inhibitor (A-674563) did significantly decrease macrophage autophagy and fibrosis in hyperoxic mice models. SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, our data indicates a novel role of CX3CR1 in regulation of macrophage autophagy and promotion of pulmonary fibrosis in hyperoxic lung injured mice.","Chen, Yuqing; Zhang, Hai; Li, Feng; Wang, Xiaohui",Life Sci,324,27

Therefore, we developed an in vitro airway epithelial-endothelial cell culture model based on Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells and human lung microvascular endothelial cells (LMVECs), cultured on opposite sides of flexible porous poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) membranes. Calu-3 cells, cultured for two weeks at an air-liquid interface (ALI), showed good expression of the tight junction (TJ) protein Zonula Occludens 1 (ZO-1). LMVECs cultured submerged for three weeks were CD31-positive, but the expression was diffuse and not localized at the cell membrane. Barrier functions of the Calu-3 cell cultures and the co-cultures with LMVECs were good, as determined by electrical resistance measurements and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran) permeability assays. Importantly, the Calu-3/LMVEC co-cultures showed better cell viability and barrier function than mono-cultures. Moreover, there was no evidence for epithelial- and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT and EndoMT, respectively) based on staining for the mesenchymal markers vimentin and &#945;-SMA, respectively. These results indicate the potential of this new airway epithelial-endothelial model for lung research. In addition, since the PTMC membrane is flexible, the model can be expanded by introducing cyclic stretch for enabling mechanical stimulation of the cells. Furthermore, the model can form the basis for biomimetic airway epithelial-endothelial and alveolar-endothelial models with primary lung epithelial cells.","Pasman, Thijs; Baptista, Danielle; van Riet, Sander; Truckenmüller, Roman K; Hiemstra, Pieter S; Rottier, Robbert J; Hamelmann, Naomi M; Paulusse, Jos M J; Stamatialis, Dimitrios; Poot, André A",,324,1

The causative agent of this infection is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The data available on one of the promising therapeutic agents—nucleotide analog remdesivir (Gilead Sciences number GS5734)—were evaluated. These data were concerned with remdesivir activation from the prodrug to the active molecule—triphosphate containing 1′-cyano group and modified nucleobase. This triphosphate competes with the natural substrate adenosine triphosphate. Additionally, its mechanisms of action based on RNA and proofreading exonuclease inhibition, leading to the delayed RNA chain termination of infected cells, and basic pharmacological data were assessed. Additionally, the analytical determination of remdesivir and its metabolites in cells and body liquids and also some data from remdesivir use in other RNA infections—such as Ebola, Nipah virus infection, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)—were summarized. More recent and more detailed data on the clinical use of remdesivir in COVID-19 were reported, showing the intensive efforts of clinicians and scientists to develop a cure for this new disease.

With the vaccine trials still in clinical phases, mitigation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies primarily on robust virus detection methods and subsequent quarantine measures. Hence, the importance of rapid, affordable and reproducible virus testing will serve the need to identify and treat infected subjects in a timely manner. Based on the type of diagnostic assay, the primary targets are viral genome (RNA) and encoded proteins. Currently, COVID-19 detection is performed using various molecular platforms as well as serodiagnostics that exhibit approximately 71% sensitivity. These methods encounter several limitations including sensitivity, specificity, availability of skilled expertise and instrument access. Saliva-based COVID-19 diagnostics are emerging as a superior alternative to nasal swabs because of the ease of sample collection, no interaction during sampling, and high viral titers during early stages of infection. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is detected in the environment as aerosols associated with suspended particulate matter. Designing virus detection strategies in diverse samples will allow timely monitoring of virus spread in humans and its persistence in the environment. With the passage of time, advanced technologies are overcoming limitations associated with detection. Enhanced sensitivity and specificity of next-generation diagnostics are key features enabling improved prognostic care.

Despite rapidly increasing rates of infections and deaths, we observed decreases in anxiety, loneliness, and COVID-19-related concerns, especially in the first few days. Other mental health variables, such as stress levels, remained stable, whereas depressive symptoms increased. Despite social-distancing measures implemented by the Dutch government halfway through our study, students showed no changes in the frequency of in-person social activities. Dynamic network models identified potential vicious cycles between mental health variables and being alone, which predicted concerns about COVID-19 and was followed by further mental health problems.

During the first stage of the project, we conducted nearly 80 interviews in eight cities worldwide: Amsterdam, Berlin, London, Milan, New York, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, and St. Petersburg, and in Israel. The interviews were conducted in the spring of 2020 and reflect the atmosphere and perception of interviewees at the end of the first lockdown. Based on an analysis of the interviews, the findings are divided into three spheres: (1) the personal experience during the pandemic, including personal difficulties and the impact of the lockdown on family and social contacts; (2) Jewish communal life, manifested in changed functions and emergence of new needs, as well as religious rituals during the pandemic; and (3) perceived relations between the Jewish community and wider society, including relations with state authorities and civil society, attitudes of and towards official media, and the possible impact of COVID-19 on antisemitism. Together, these spheres shed light on how elderly Jews experience their current situation under COVID-19-as individuals and as part of a community. COVID-19 taught interviewees to reappraise what was important to them. They felt their family relations became stronger under the pandemic, and that their Jewish community was more meaningful than they had thought. They understood that online communication will continue to be present in all three spheres, but concluded that human contact cannot be substituted by technical devices.","Livne, Sharon; Bejarano, Margalit",Contemp Jew,324,10

Angiotensin AT1 and AT2 receptors, mainly known for their role in regulating water homeostasis and blood pressure and able to form heterodimers (AT1/2Hets), are present in the central nervous system. We assessed the functionality and expression of AT1/2Hets in Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: Immunocytochemistry was used to analyze the colocalization between angiotensin receptors; bioluminescence resonance energy transfer was used to detect AT1/2Hets. Calcium and cAMP determination, MAPK activation, and label-free assays were performed to characterize signaling in homologous and heterologous systems. Proximity ligation assays were used to quantify receptor expression in mouse primary cultures and in rat striatal sections. RESULTS: We confirmed that AT1 and AT2 receptors form AT1/2Hets that are expressed in cells of the central nervous system. AT1/2Hets are novel functional units with particular signaling properties. Importantly, the coactivation of the two receptors in the heteromer reduces the signaling output of angiotensin. Remarkably, AT1/2Hets that are expressed in both striatal neurons and microglia make possible that candesartan, the antagonist of AT1, increases the effect of AT2 receptor agonists. In addition, the level of striatal expression increased in the unilateral 6-OH-dopamine lesioned rat PD model and was markedly higher in parkinsonian-like animals that did not become dyskinetic upon levodopa chronic administration if compared with expression in those that became dyskinetic. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that boosting the action of neuroprotective AT2 receptors using an AT1 receptor antagonist constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy in PD.","Rivas-Santisteban, Rafael; Rodriguez-Perez, Ana I; Muñoz, Ana; Reyes-Resina, Irene; Labandeira-García, José Luis; Navarro, Gemma; Franco, Rafael",J Neuroinflammation,324,20

At the healthcare level there is the risk that nosocomial outbreaks can be local amplifiers. Adequate infection control practices are of critical importance, which include proper use of personal protective equipment. This equipment must be appropriate to the pathogen transmission route that, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, occurs through droplet and contact routes. The infected individual, when talking, coughing or sneezing, spreads droplets containing the virus, directly contaminating other individuals within one to two meters of distance, as well as the surrounding environment. Airborne transmission may occur when aerosol-generating procedures are performed. Concerning respiratory protection, there is currently weak evidence that the use of respirators provides better protection than surgical masks for SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses (with the exception of aerosol-generating procedures, in which case the use of a respirator is recommended). Eye protection should be guaranteed whenever there is a risk of splashes, droplets or aerosols. The use of different, or higher than necessary, level of personal protective equipment, for the transmission route of the agent, is a form of misuse and can affect its supply for situations when it is clearly indicated. The adequate provision of protective equipment, as well as training of healthcare professionals in its correct use, is highly recommended to ensure safety of care.","Peres, David; Boléo-Tomé, José Pedro; Santos, Gilda",Acta Med Port,324,1

Three cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been reported as a direct consequence of COVID-19. In spite of the scarce data for establishing a definitive link between COVID-19 and PD, some hypotheses have been proposed to explain the cases reported. They, however, do not fit well with the clinical findings reported for COVID-19 patients, in general, and for the PD cases reported, in particular. Given the importance of this potential connection, we present here a molecular-level mechanistic hypothesis that explains well these findings and will serve to explore the potential CNS damage in COVID-19 patients. The model explaining the cascade effects from COVID-19 to CNS is developed by using bioinformatic tools. It includes the post-translational modification of host proteins in the lungs by viral proteins, the transport of modified host proteins via exosomes out the lungs, and the disruption of protein-protein interaction in the CNS by these modified host proteins. Our hypothesis is supported by finding 44 proteins significantly expressed in the CNS which are associated with PD and whose interactions can be perturbed by 24 host proteins significantly expressed in the lungs. These 24 perturbators are found to interact with viral proteins and to form part of the cargoes of exosomes in human tissues. The joint set of perturbators and PD-vulnerable proteins form a tightly connected network with significantly more connections than expected by selecting a random cluster of proteins of similar size from the human proteome. The molecular-level mechanistic hypothesis presented here provides several routes for the cascading of effects from the lungs of COVID-19 patients to PD. In particular, the disruption of autophagy/ubiquitination processes appears as an important mechanism that triggers the generation of large amounts of exosomes containing perturbators in their cargo, which would insult several PD-vulnerable proteins, potentially triggering Parkinsonism in COVID-19 patients.","Estrada, Ernesto",Viruses,324,16

The major population we serve at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center (KJMC) are underprivileged with many of them having multiple comorbidities. Methods: This is a retrospective study wherein patients, admitted from February 2020 to April 2020 with hyperglycemia, were selected and divided into 2 groups based on presence or absence of C-19. Data include demographics, comorbidities, blood glucose level, serum osmolality, serum bicarbonate, anion gap, acute kidney injury (AKI), serum creatinine, ICU admission, length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Data were analyzed using descriptive study and T-test. Results: 100 patients were included in the C-19 group (CG) and 88 patients were included in the Non C-19 group (NCG). Major comorbidities were similar in both groups including HTN, DM, CKD followed by ESRD. Mean age of patients (years) was 65.68 in CG and 61.17 in NCG. 61% were male in CG and 53.41% were male in NCG. 16% and 9% developed DKA and HHS in CG, and 13.64% and 6.82% developed DKA and HHS in NCG respectively. 15% in CG had combined DKA &amp;HHS and 3.41% had same in NCG. Mean blood glucose level (mg/dl) was 541.6 in CG and 460.0 in NCG (p=0.03). Mean serum osmolality (mOsm/kg) was 335.7 (SD±41.01) in CG and 317.1 (SD±30.54) in NCG (p=0.01). Mean serum bicarbonate (mEq/L) was 17.73 (SD±6.31) in CG and 21.46 (SD±5.94) in NCG (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Mean anion gap was 17.93 (SD±7.6) in CG and 13.10 (SD±7.2) in NCG (p&amp;lt;0.0001). 56% in CG and 37% in NCG developed AKI respectively (p=0.01). Mean serum creatinine (mg/dl) was 4.22 in CG and 1.65 in NCG (p=0.004). 55% of CG were admitted to ICU and 34% of NCG were admitted to ICU (p=0.003). Median LOS (days) in discharged patients was 8 in CG and 5 in NCG (p=0.02). Mortality was 40% in CG and 3.41% in NCG (p&amp;lt;0.0001). 12 patients in CG and 2 patients in NCG developed new-onset diabetes. In the subset of DKA, interestingly, mean age (years) was 61.63 (SD±17.73) in CG and 39.67 in NCG (SD±13.39) (p=0.001). Conclusion: In our study, patients in the CG carry worse laboratory parameters, unfavorable clinical outcomes and strikingly higher mortality. We discovered increased incidence of new-onset diabetes and elderly DKA in CG. In an inner city population like ours, the burden of DM with significant social and health care disparities is quite severe. Diabetic patients with concurrent C-19 infection can have particularly negative outcomes and C-19 possibly damages the pancreatic islets resulting in acute hyperglycemic crisis.

There are limited data describing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant mothers and their newborns. The objective of this study is to describe characteristics and outcomes of maternal-newborn dyads with confirmed maternal SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational, descriptive cohort study with data collection from charts of maternal-newborn dyads who delivered at 4 major New York City metropolitan area hospitals between March 1 and May 10, 2020, with maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: There were a total of 149 mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 149 newborns analyzed (3 sets of twins; 3 stillbirths). Forty percent of these mothers were asymptomatic. Approximately 15% of symptomatic mothers required some form of respiratory support, and 8% required intubation. Eighteen newborns (12%) were admitted to the ICU. Fifteen (10%) were born preterm, and 5 (3%) required mechanical ventilation. Symptomatic mothers had more premature deliveries (16% vs 3%, P = .02), and their newborns were more likely to require intensive care (19% vs 2%, P = .001) than asymptomatic mothers. One newborn tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, which was considered a case of horizontal postnatal transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no distinct evidence of vertical transmission from mothers with SARS-CoV-2 to their newborns, we did observe perinatal morbidities among both mothers and newborns. Symptomatic mothers were more likely to experience premature delivery and their newborns to require intensive care.","Verma, Sourabh; Bradshaw, Chanda; Auyeung, N S Freda; Lumba, Rishi; Farkas, Jonathan S; Sweeney, Nicole B; Wachtel, Elena V; Bailey, Sean M; Noor, Asif; Kunjumon, Bgee; Cicalese, Erin; Hate, Rahul; Lighter, Jennifer L; Alessi, Samantha; Schweizer, William E; Hanna, Nazeeh; Roman, Ashley S; Dreyer, Benard; Mally, Pradeep V",Pediatrics,324,21

We aimed to study the epidemiology, clinical features and short-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital, including 55 severe patients and 166 non-severe patients, from January 2, 2020 to February 10, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 221 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU (intensive care unit) care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.","Zhang, Guqin; Hu, Chang; Luo, Linjie; Fang, Fang; Chen, Yongfeng; Li, Jianguo; Peng, Zhiyong; Pan, Huaqin",J Clin Virol,324,16

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature and meta-analysis of outcomes according to PRISMA statement standards to compare the routine vs. selective use of CT in adult patients presenting with non-traumatic AAP. RESULTS: Analysis of 722 patients from 4 randomised controlled trials showed no difference between the routine CT and selective CT groups in terms of proportion of correct diagnoses (OR 1.36,95% CI 0.89, 2.07, P = 0.15), mortality (RD 0.03, 95% CI - 0.08, 0.02, P = 0.27] and length of hospital stay (LOS) [MD - 0.26, 95% CI - 2.07, 1.55, P = 0.78).

We present our experience of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transplant patients in one of the most affected parts of the UK with direct comparison to waitlisted patients. METHODS: A single-center prospective study of symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive waitlisted and transplant patients was undertaken to compare these groups and assess clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 60 consecutive symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were identified with 32 active waitlisted patients and 28 functioning renal transplants. Demographics were similar. The incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in the waitlisted group was 9.9% compared to 1.9% in renal transplant patients (P < 0.001). Immunosuppression did not influence initial symptomology. Fifteen percent of patients in the waitlisted and 32% in the transplant groups died (P = 0.726). Mortality as proportion of total waitlisted (321 patients) and transplant population (1434 patients) of our centre was 1.5% and 0.6% (P < 0.001), respectively. C-reactive protein (CRP) at 48 h and peak CRP were associated with mortality in both groups while quick sequential organ failure assessment score at 48 h (P = 0.036) was associated with mortality for transplant patients. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of COVID-19 is higher in the waitlisted population but transplant patients have more severe disease, reflected by higher mortality. CRP at 48 h can be used as a predictive tool. In the absence of effective treatments, the current strategy of shielding is arguably the most important factor in protecting patients while resuming transplantation.","Mohamed, Ismail H; Chowdary, Prashanth B; Shetty, Shraddha; Sammartino, Cinzia; Sivaprakasam, Rajesh; Lindsey, Ben; Thuraisingham, Raj; Yaqoob, Muhammad M; Khurram, Muhammad A",Transplantation,324,23

METHODS: Thirty-six caregivers (64.94 ± 13.54 years, 41.7% female) of individuals with NCD (74.28 ± 6.76 years, 66.7% female) selected from the Body & Brain exercise program were interviewed over the phone. The following instruments were used: Barthel Index (BI) to assess care recipients' ability to function independently on activities of daily living (ADL), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to evaluate neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the CarerQol-7D/ CarerQol-VAS to determine caregiver subjective burden/well-being. RESULTS: Pre and post-confinement comparisons showed that care recipients significantly declined their independence in ADL (p = 0.003) and increased NPI total score (MD = 5.72; 95% CI: 1.19 to 10.25, p = 0.015).

Although most patients presenting with absent or mild symptoms recover completely, the highest morbidity and mortality rates are seen in the elderly, and patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, immunosuppressive diseases, diabetes, and pre-existing respiratory illnesses. Several therapeutic strategies have been examined, but a wide-ranging therapeutic option for particularly severe cases of COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. Considering the indications presented by COVID-19 patients who present similarly with inflammatory conditions, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration has been examined as a possible route to reduce proinflammatory markers such as ESR, CRP and ferritin by reducing inflammation, based on its anti-inflammatory effects as indicated by utilisation of IVIG for numerous other inflammatory conditions. Herein, summarising the recent key clinical evaluations of IVIG administration, we present our hypothesis that administration of IVIG within a specific dosage would be extremely beneficial towards reducing mortality and perhaps even the length of hospitalisation of patients exhibiting severe COVID-19 symptoms.","Yaqinuddin, Ahmed; Ambia, Ayesha Rahman; Elgazzar, Tasnim Atef; AlSaud, Maha Bint Mishari; Kashir, Junaid",Med Hypotheses,324,29

Chronic inflammation allows the host to recover or adapt through cellular and humoral responses, whereas acute inflammation leads to cytokine storms resulting in tissue damage. In this review, we present the overlapping outcomes of cancer inflammation with virus-induced inflammation. The study emphasises how anti-inflammatory drugs that work against cancer inflammation may work against the inflammation caused by the viral infection. It is established that the cytokine storm induced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to disease-associated mortality. While cancer remains the second among the diseases associated with mortality worldwide, cancer patients' mortality rates are often observed upon extended periods after illness, usually ranging from months to years. However, the mortality rates associated with COVID-19 disease are robust. The cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to be responsible for the multi-organ failure and increased mortality rates. Since both cancer and COVID-19 disease share overlapping inflammatory mechanisms, repurposing some anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs for COVID-19 may lower mortality rates. Here, we review some of these inflammatory mechanisms and propose some potential chemotherapeutic agents to intervene in them. We also discuss the repercussions of anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine with zinc or antiviral drugs such as ivermectin and remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm. In this review, we emphasise on various possibilities to reduce SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm.","Amere Subbarao, Sreedhar",Inflammopharmacology,324,10

Although it is unclear how long the pandemic will last, it may persist for many months. Throughout this time, it will be important to perform safe, comprehensive, and effective care for patients with and patients without COVID-19, recognizing that asymptomatic transmission is common with this disease. Local idiosyncrasies prevent a single prescriptive strategy. However, general considerations can be applied to most practice environments. A comprehensive strategy will include consideration of local COVID-19 statistics; availability of personal protective equipment (PPE); local, state, and federal government mandates; institutional regulatory guidance; local safety measures; health care worker availability; patient and health care worker risk factors; factors specific to the indication(s) for radiology care; and examination or procedure acuity. An accurate risk-benefit analysis of postponing versus performing a given routine radiology examination or procedure often is not possible due to many unknown and complex factors. However, this is the overriding principle: If the risk of illness or death to a health care worker or patient from health care-acquired COVID-19 is greater than the risk of illness or death from delaying radiology care, the care should be delayed; however, if the opposite is true, the radiology care should proceed in a timely fashion.","Davenport, Matthew S; Bruno, Michael A; Iyer, Ramesh S; Johnson, Amirh M; Herrera, Ramses; Nicola, Gregory N; Ortiz, Daniel; Pedrosa, Ivan; Policeni, Bruno; Recht, Michael P; Willis, Marc; Zuley, Margarita L; Weinstein, Stefanie",J.

Understanding the interaction between GNs and cell membranes is vital for learning how to avoid adverse effects and nanomedical applications. To better understand the nature of such perturbations, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to provide molecular details about the molecular mechanism. In this study, we observed two typical interaction states of the GN-membrane systems. Both states have different effects on the cell membrane (lipid density, membrane thickness, and the mobility of phospholipids). Of great interest is that the insertion of GNs could generate a liquid-ordered domain and dramatically reduce the rate of lipid flip-flop. A similar phenomenon could be found in the GN adhesion states. Thus, these results could facilitate molecular-level understanding of the cytotoxicity of nanomaterials and help future studies on designing personalized drugs and therapeutics for diseases.","Zhu, Xiaohong; Li, Na; Huang, Changxiong; Li, Zhen; Fan, Jun",J. phys. chem.

In order to collect the data, the demographic information questionnaire and descriptive open-ended questions prepared by the researchers were asked to the participants and the students were asked to fill the gaps in the question with the concept that visualized. Aim: In this study, it was aimed to analyze the situation of recreation activities in the covid-19 process through literature review, data analysis, and observations. Methods: Qualitative research method was used in this study. In this regard, our study was conducted using a (phenomenological) pattern, which is one of the qualitative research methods. Results: When Table 1 is examined, it is seen that the participants of the study consisted of 9 (23.1%) female students and 30 (76.9%) male students. The majority are around 21 (38.5%) and 22 (35.9) years old, the mean age of the total participant is 21. Only 1 (2.6%) person was infected with the Covid-19 virus, and the rest of 38 (97.4%) people were not infected. 2 (5.1%) of the participants reside in the village, 13 (33.3) in the district, and 24 (61.5) in the province. The situation of doing sports actively, on the other hand, 24 (61.5) people are doing sports actively, 15 (38.5) people are not doing sports actively. Conclusion: When the research results were examined, it was concluded that the participant students were exposed to various negative psychological situations such as their anxiety and stress levels increased, they became intolerant of uncertainty as their recreational activities stopped during the Covid-19 period.","Başkan, A.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted where antibody responses of IgG and IgA towards SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were studied over time in patients with COVID-19. Possible associations between antibody titers and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty patients with COVID-19, hospitalized at Skåne University hospital, Sweden, between April and June 2020 were included. IgG antibody responses were detected for all patients with the highest levels four weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. Levels of IgA were generally higher at diagnosis and decreased towards baseline 4 weeks after confirmed COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 had higher levels of antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with patients with mild disease. CONCLUSION: IgG and IgA antibodies towards the spike protein follow different kinetics during COVID-19 and patients with severe disease develop higher antibody levels.","Bläckberg, Anna; Fernström, Nils; Sarbrant, Emma; Rasmussen, Magnus; Sunnerhagen, Torgny",PLoS One,324,17

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic in March of 2020. COVID-19 has now been reported on every continent. In the United States, the total number of confirmed reported cases of COVID-19 has exceeded 1.8 million with the total death exceeding 100,000 people. The most common investigational diagnostics of this disease are RT-PCR and serology testing. The objective of this work was to validate two commercial kits for the detection of IgM and IgG using lateral flow immunoassay tests and to study the effect of the combination of both serology kits for better detection of immunoglobulins. A total of 195 patients presenting with respiratory symptoms suggestive of infection with SARS-Cov-2 were subject to serology and molecular testing. Two lateral flow immunochromatographic assay kits were used: the Healgen Scientific for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG and the Raybiotech for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG. Sensitivity and specificity of each kit alone and in combination were determined and compared. The limit of detection, inter and intra test variations, as well interfering substances and cross reactivity were also studied for both kits. The results show sensitivities for IgM detection varying between 58.9 and 66.2% for the kits alone and 87.7% of the combination of both kits. IgG detection was not significantly affected by this combination. Both kits manifested high specificities (99.2-100%). Both kits showed high clinical performance in terms of cross reactivity and interfering substances. Our results suggest using combinatory testing for the serology of COVID-19 after a full evaluation study, assessing all the parameters affecting their clinical performance before deciding on this combination.","Daoud, Ziad; McLeod, Jesse; Stockman, David L",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,324,22

How to find proper prevention and treatment methods has been a hot topic of discussion. The key to the problem is to understand when these intervention measures are the best strategies for disease control and how they might affect disease dynamics. In this paper, we build a transmission dynamic model in combination with the transmission characteristics of COVID-19. We thoroughly study the dynamical behavior of the model and analyze how to determine the relevant parameters, and how the parameters influence the transmission process. Furthermore, we subsequently compare the impact of different control strategies on the epidemic, the variables include intervention time, control duration, control intensity, and other model parameters. Finally, we can find a better control method by comparing the results under different schemes and choose the proper preventive control strategy according to the actual epidemic stage and control objectives.","Zhang, Yusheng; Li, Liang; Jiang, Yuewen; Huang, Biqing",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),324,0

OBJECTIVE.­: To develop and implement a digital slide-based virtual surgical pathology (VSP) clinical elective to meet the demand for meaningful and robust virtual clinical electives in response to the temporary suspension of in-person clinical rotations at JHUSOM. DESIGN.­: The VSP elective was modeled after the in-person surgical pathology elective to include virtual previewing and sign-out with standardized cases supplemented by synchronous and asynchronous pathology educational content. RESULTS.­: Validation of existing Web communications technology and slide-scanning systems was performed by feasibility testing. Curriculum development included drafting of course objectives and syllabus, Blackboard course site design, electronic-lecture creation, communications with JHUSOM leadership, scheduling, and slide curation. Subjectively, the weekly schedule averaged 35 to 40 hours of asynchronous, synchronous, and independent content, approximately 10 to 11 hours of which were synchronous.

Rural communities often have a higher proportion of residents who lack health insurance, live with comorbidities or disabilities, are aged &#8805;65 years, and have limited access to health care facilities with intensive care capabilities, which places these residents at increased risk for COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality (2,3). To better understand COVID-19 vaccination disparities across the urban-rural continuum, CDC analyzed county-level vaccine administration data among adults aged &#8805;18 years who received their first dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, or a single dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) during December 14, 2020-April 10, 2021 in 50 U.S. jurisdictions (49 states and the District of Columbia [DC]).

This study investigated the contribution of morbidities and related prescribed medications to COVID-19 associated mortality. Methods: Based on the various recently reported clinical scenarios a theoretical framework was designed to shed light on the mode of infection of the central nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 and possible management options. Results: Dopamine-release mechanisms in the central nervous system may play a major role in the entry and propagation of coronaviruses. Conclusion: This study emphasizes the need for a thorough and urgent investigation of the dopamine-release pathways in the central nervous system. These efforts will help find a definitive cure for the pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19).","Khalefah, Muad M; Khalifah, Ayman M",,324,1

Interpretation of thyroid tests during illness, however, is hampered by changes occurring in the context of non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). In order to elucidate these findings, we studied thyroid function in carefully selected cohorts of COVID-19 positive and negative patients. DESIGN: Cohort observational study. METHODS: We measured TSH, FT4, T3 within 24hours of admission in 196 patients without thyroid disease and/or confounding medications. 102 patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive; 41 admitted in the ICU, 46 in the ward and 15 outpatients. Controls consisted of 94 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients; 39 in the ICU and 55 in the ward. We designated the thyroid hormone patterns as consistent with NTIS, thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism. RESULTS: A NTIS pattern was encountered in 60% of ICU and 36% of ward patients, with similar frequencies between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients (46.0% vs 46.8%, p=NS). A thyrotoxicosis pattern was observed in 14.6% SARS-CoV-2 ICU patients vs. 7.7% in ICU negative (p=NS) and, overall in 8.8% of SARS-CoV-2 positive vs. 7.4% of negative patients. In these patients thyroglobulin levels were similar to those with normal thyroid function or NTIS. The hypothyroidism pattern was rare. CONCLUSIONS: NTIS pattern is common and relates to the severity of disease rather than SARS-CoV-2 infection. A thyrotoxicosis pattern is less frequently observed with similar frequency between patients with and without COVID-19. It is suggested that thyroid hormone monitoring in COVID-19 should not differ from other critically ill patients.","Vassiliadi, Dimitra Argyro; Ilias, Ioannis; Pratikaki, Maria; Jahaj, Edison; Vassiliou, Alice G; Detsika, Maria; Ampelakiotou, Kleio; Koulenti, Marina; Manolopoulos, Konstantinos N; Tsipilis, Stamatis; Gavrielatou, Evdokia; Diamantopoulos, Aristeidis; Zacharis, Alexandros; Athanasiou, Nicolaos; Orfanos, Stylianos; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Tsagarakis, Stylianos; Dimopoulou, Ioanna",,324,1

Universal testing on labor and delivery units has been implemented by many hospitals to ensure patient and staff safety. Asymptomatic carrier rates are expected to vary based on geographic differences in disease prevalence, although differences within the same city have not previously been reported. Additionally, clinical follow-up of women testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 during obstetric hospitalization have not been included in any prior reports. Objectives: To describe the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests among asymptomatic pregnant women at two Philadelphia obstetric hospitals, characterize the clinical course of those testing positive, and report symptom development among all women tested in the two weeks post-hospitalization. Study Design: This is an observational study of asymptomatic pregnant women who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing at two academic health centers (HUP and PAH) in Philadelphia, PA between April 13, 2020 and April 26, 2020. All women tested were contacted via telephone for symptom follow-up at one and two weeks post-discharge. Asymptomatic positive test rates are reported for the overall population and by hospital. The hospital and two-week post-hospital course are described for women testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Post-hospital symptom development among women testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 is also described. Results: Three hundred and eighteen asymptomatic women underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing during this two-week period. Eight women tested positive. The overall asymptomatic test positive rate was 2.5%. The rate at HUP was 3.8% compared to 1.3% at PAH (p = 0.283). Three women (37.5%) who were initially asymptomatic developed mild symptoms in the two weeks after positive test. Repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed in 14 of the 310 women (4.5%) who initially tested negative; two women (0.6%) were positive on repeat testing. 242 (78.1%) and 213 (68.7%) of the 310 women who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at time of initial hospitalization were reached for telephone follow-up at one and two weeks post-admission, respectively. Viral symptoms, including fevers, chills, shortness of breath, or cough, were self-reported in 4.5% and 4.2% of these women at one and two weeks post-discharge, respectively. Conclusions: The asymptomatic positive SARS-CoV-2 test rate among an obstetric population in Philadelphia differed between two hospitals and was lower than described in other geographic regions. This supports the importance of institution-specific testing protocols. The development of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection post-hospitalization among women with initial negative testing is uncommon.","Bender, Whitney R; Hirshberg, Adi; Coutifaris, Paulina; Acker, Alexandra L; Srinivas, Sindhu K",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,324,14

METHODS: An online survey was conducted by the Turkish Endometriosis & Adenomyosis Society and administered to patients with endometriosis who agreed to participate in the study. The survey included 25 questions prepared by an expert committee of four professionals (two gynecologists and two endometriosis specialists). RESULTS: Of the 290 questionnaires sent out, 261 (90%) were returned. A total of 213 (83.86%) patients reported that they were afraid of having endometriosis-related problems during the pandemic period. In addition, 133 (53.63%) patients thought the management of their endometriosis was affected because of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Clinical studies clearly indicate that endometriosis is a condition associated with high levels of chronic stress. The COVID-19 pandemic has led the public to experience psychological problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress, depression, and anxiety. The majority of patients with endometriosis were afraid of having endometriosis-related problems during the pandemic period. The majority of elective endometriosis surgeries have not been postponed. Patients were highly aware of the pandemic and practiced social distancing and hygiene. Only 4 (1.59%) patients with endometriosis required hospitalization.","Yalçin Bahat, Pinar; Kaya, Cihan; Selçuki, Nura F T; Polat, Ibrahim; Usta, Taner; Oral, Engin",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,324,15

In the case of PPE, a poor fit can jeopardize an individual's health and safety. In this paper we present an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that can identify a representative set of exemplars, individuals that can be utilized by designers as idealized sizing models. The algorithm is based around a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a Point-Net inspired encoder and decoder architecture trained on Human point-cloud data obtained from the CEASAR dataset. The learned latent space is then clustered to identify a specified number of sizing groups. We demonstrate this technique on scans of human faces to provide designers of masks and facial coverings a reference set of individuals to test existing mask styles.","Searcy, Jacob A.; Sokolowski, Susan L.",,324,10

Evidence for the effect of each of these vaccines on ability to transmit the virus is also beginning to emerge. We describe an approach to estimate these vaccines' effects on viral positivity, a prevalence measure which under the reasonable assumption that vaccinated individuals who become infected are no more infectious than unvaccinated individuals forms a lower bound on efficacy against transmission. Specifically, we recommend separate analysis of positive tests triggered by symptoms (usually the primary RCT outcome) and cross-sectional prevalence of positive tests obtained regardless of symptoms. The odds ratio of carriage for vaccine vs. placebo provides an unbiased estimate of vaccine effectiveness against viral positivity, under certain assumptions, and we show through simulations that likely departures from these assumptions will only modestly bias this estimate. Applying this approach to published data from the RCT of the Moderna vaccine, we estimate that one dose of vaccine reduces the potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more. We describe how these approaches can be translated into observational studies of vaccine effectiveness.","Lipsitch, Marc; Kahn, Rebecca",Vaccine,324,24
518400,518400,518400,Subjective burden and perspectives of German healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,20.192392,5.6165237,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was discovered in China in December 2019. It has developed into a threatening international public health emergency. With the exception of China, the number of cases continues to increase worldwide. A number of studies about disease diagnosis and treatment have been carried out, and many clinically proven effective results have been achieved. Although information technology can improve the transferring of such knowledge to clinical practice rapidly, data interoperability is still a challenge due to the heterogeneous nature of hospital information systems. This issue becomes even more serious if the knowledge for diagnosis and treatment is updated rapidly as is the case for COVID-19. An open, semantic-sharing, and collaborative-information modeling framework is needed to rapidly develop a shared data model for exchanging data among systems. openEHR is such a framework and is supported by many open software packages that help to promote information sharing and interoperability. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a shared data model based on the openEHR modeling approach to improve the interoperability among systems for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: The latest Guideline of COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment in China was selected as the knowledge source for modeling. First, the guideline was analyzed and the data items used for diagnosis and treatment, and management were extracted. Second, the data items were classified and further organized into domain concepts with a mind map. Third, searching was executed in the international openEHR Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM) to find the existing archetypes that could represent the concepts. New archetypes were developed for those concepts that could not be found. Fourth, these archetypes were further organized into a template using Ocean Template Editor. Fifth, a test case of data exchanging between the clinical data repository and clinical decision support system based on the template was conducted to verify the feasibility of the study. RESULTS: A total of 203 data items were extracted from the guideline in China, and 16 domain concepts (16 leaf nodes in the mind map) were organized. There were 22 archetypes used to develop the template for all data items extracted from the guideline. All of them could be found in the CKM and reused directly. The archetypes and templates were reviewed and finally released in a public project within the CKM. The test case showed that the template can facilitate the data exchange and meet the requirements of decision support. CONCLUSIONS: This study has developed the openEHR template for COVID-19 based on the latest guideline from China using openEHR modeling methodology. It represented the capability of the methodology for rapidly modeling and sharing knowledge through reusing the existing archetypes, which is especially useful in a new and fast-changing area such as with COVID-19.","Li, Mengyang; Leslie, Heather; Qi, Bin; Nan, Shan; Feng, Hongshuo; Cai, Hailing; Lu, Xudong; Duan, Huilong",J Med Internet Res,324,20

However, lockdown and shutdown interventions have caused new social problems and designating policy resumption for infection control when reopening society remains a crucial issue. We investigated the effects of different resumption strategies on COVID-19 transmission using a modeling study setting. METHODS: We employed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model to simulate COVID-19 outbreaks under five reopening strategies based on China's business resumption progress. The effect of each strategy was evaluated using the peak values of the epidemic curves vis-à-vis confirmed active cases and cumulative cases. Two-sample t-test was performed in order to affirm that the pick values in different scenarios are different. RESULTS: We found that a hierarchy-based reopen strategy performed best when current epidemic prevention measures were maintained save for lockdown, reducing the peak number of active cases and cumulative cases by 50 and 44%, respectively. However, the modeled effect of each strategy decreased when the current intervention was lifted somewhat. Additional attention should be given to regions with significant numbers of migrants, as the potential risk of COVID-19 outbreaks amid society reopening is intrinsically high. CONCLUSIONS: Business resumption strategies have the potential to eliminate COVID-19 outbreaks amid society reopening without special control measures. The proposed resumption strategies focused mainly on decreasing the number of imported exposure cases, guaranteeing medical support for epidemic control, or decreasing active cases.","Ge, Yong; Zhang, Wen-Bin; Wang, Jianghao; Liu, Mengxiao; Ren, Zhoupeng; Zhang, Xining; Zhou, Chenghu; Tian, Zhaoxing",BMC Public Health,324,28

SARS-CoV-2 targets the respiratory system, resulting in symptoms such as fever, headache, dry cough, dyspnea, and dizziness. These symptoms vary from person to person, ranging from mild to hypoxia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sometimes death. Although not confirmed, phylogenetic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bats; the intermediary facilitating its transfer from bats to humans is unknown. Owing to the rapid spread of infection and high number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, most countries have enacted strict curfews and the practice of social distancing while awaiting the availability of effective U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications and/or vaccines. This review offers an overview of the various types of coronaviruses (CoVs), their targeted hosts and cellular receptors, a timeline of their emergence, and the roles of key elements of the immune system in fighting pathogen attacks, while focusing on SARS-CoV-2 and its genomic structure and pathogenesis. Furthermore, we review drugs targeting COVID-19 that are under investigation and in clinical trials, in addition to progress using mesenchymal stem cells to treat COVID-19.

Evaluating the impact of lockdown on population mobility is important to help characterize the changes in social dynamics that affected viral diffusion. Using travel flows reconstructed from mobile phone trajectories, we measured how lockdown altered mobility patterns at both local and country scales. Lockdown caused a 65% reduction in countrywide number of displacements, and was particularly effective in reducing work-related short-range mobility, especially during rush hours, and recreational long-range trips. Anomalous increases in long-range movements, localized in both time and space, emerged even before lockdown announcement. Mobility drops were unevenly distributed across regions. They were strongly associated with active population, workers employed in sectors highly impacted by lockdown, and number of hospitalizations per region, and moderately associated with socio-economic level of the region. Major cities largely shrank their pattern of connectivity, reducing it mainly to short-range commuting, despite the persistence of some long-range trips. Our findings indicate that lockdown was very effective in reducing population mobility across scales. Caution should be taken in the timing of policy announcements and implementation. Individual response to policy announcements may generate unexpected anomalous behaviors increasing the risk of geographical diffusion. On the other hand, risk awareness may be beneficial in further decreasing mobility in largely affected regions. Our findings help predicting how and where restrictions will be the most effective in reducing the mobility and mixing of the population, thus aiding tuning recommendations in the upcoming weeks, when phasing out lockdown.","Pullano, G.; Valdano, E.; Scarpa, N.; Rubrichi, S.; Colizza, V.",,324,20

However, there is a need to assess the tele-yoga trainer and the training itself to ensure safety and effectiveness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Tele-Yoga Trainers Assessment (TYTA) tool was developed through (a) review of existing tools, (b) key informant interviews, and (c) validation by experts. It was tested for its feasibility in six persons with common mental disorders. A trained yoga therapist conducted tele-yoga therapy sessions which was webcast from NIMHANS Integrated Center for Yoga to NIMHANS Center for Well-Being for the first 15 days and to the respective homes of the participants using “Skype” in the remaining 15 days. Participants were assessed on (a) mental well-being, (b) satisfaction with overall health and were administered the (c) TYTA tool on the 1(st), 15(th), and 30(th) day. RESULTS: The TYTA was easy to administer for assessing the performance of the yoga trainer. The qualitative case reports of individual participants depicted that over 30 days, mental well-being and satisfaction with overall health improved trainer's performance. CONCLUSION: Tele-yoga therapy is feasible with minimum technology and availability of good internet access at the relay and reception site. The trainer must be assessed for his/her suitability and be provided guidelines for achieving desired outcomes.","Jagannathan, Aarti; Bhide, Shree Raksha; Varambally, Shivarama; Chandra, Prabha S.; Gangadhar, B.

It could be hypothesized that immunodeficient patients, due to immunosuppressive drugs or their disease, have a more severe disease course due to their immunocompromised state. However, it could also be hypothesized that some of the immunosuppressive drugs protect against a hyperinflammatory state. METHODS: We collected data on the incidence of COVID-19, disease course and SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in COVID-19 positive patients in a cohort of patients (n= 4497) known at the Clinical Immunology outpatient clinic in a tertiary care hospital in the Netherlands. RESULTS: In the first six months of the pandemic, 16 patients were identified with COVID-19, 14 by nasal swab PCR, and 2 patients by SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Eight patients were admitted to the hospital. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured in 8 patients and were detectable in all, including one patient on B-cell ablative therapy and one patient with Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorder. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the disease course differs among immunocompromised patients, independently of (dis)continuation of immunosuppressive drugs. Antibody production for SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised patients was shown. More research needs to be conducted to confirm these observations and guidelines regarding (dis)continuation of immunosuppressive drugs in COVID-19 positive immunocompromised patients should be developed.","Guchelaar, N.A.D.; van Laar, J.A.M.; Hermans, M.A.W.; van der Houwen, T.B.; Atmaca, S.; van Maaren, M.S.; Brkic, Z.; van Daele, P.L.A.; Dalm, V.A.S.H.; van Hagen, P.M.; Rombach, S.M.",J Transl Autoimmun,324,33

Prions are infectious agents that do not possess a genome and the pathogenic protein was not thought to evoke any immune response. Although we previously reported that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, suggesting the protective role of host innate immune responses mediated by IRF3 signalling, this remained to be clarified. Here, we investigated the reciprocal interactions of type I interferon evoked by IRF3 activation and prion infection and found that infecting prions cause the suppression of endogenous interferon expression. Conversely, treatment with recombinant interferons in an ex vivo model was able to inhibit prion infection. In addition, cells and mice deficient in type I interferon receptor (subunit interferon alpha/beta receptor 1), exhibited higher susceptibility to 22L-prion infection. Moreover, in in vivo and ex vivo prion-infected models, treatment with RO8191, a selective type I interferon receptor agonist, inhibited prion invasion and prolonged the survival period of infected mice. Taken together, these data indicated that the interferon signalling interferes with prion propagation and some interferon-stimulated genes might play protective roles in the brain. These findings may allow for the development of new strategies to combat fatal diseases.","Ishibashi, Daisuke; Homma, Takujiro; Nakagaki, Takehiro; Fuse, Takayuki; Sano, Kazunori; Satoh, Katsuya; Mori, Tsuyoshi; Atarashi, Ryuichiro; Nishida, Noriyuki",Brain,324,29

Hence, the interest in bat virus discovery has been increasing rapidly over the last decade. So far, most studies have focused on a single type of virus detection method, either PCR, virus isolation or virome sequencing. Here we present a comprehensive approach in virus discovery, using all three discovery methods on samples from the same bats. By family-specific PCR screening we found sequences of paramyxoviruses, adenoviruses, herpesviruses and one coronavirus. By cell culture we isolated a novel bat adenovirus and bat orthoreovirus. Virome sequencing revealed viral sequences of ten different virus families and orders: three bat nairoviruses, three phenuiviruses, one orbivirus, one rotavirus, one orthoreovirus, one mononegavirus, five parvoviruses, seven picornaviruses, three retroviruses, one totivirus and two thymoviruses were discovered. Of all viruses identified by family-specific PCR in the original samples, none was found by metagenomic sequencing. Vice versa, none of the viruses found by the metagenomic virome approach was detected by family-specific PCRs targeting the same family. The discrepancy of detected viruses by different detection approaches suggests that a combined approach using different detection methods is necessary for virus discovery studies.","Kohl, Claudia; Brinkmann, Annika; Radonić, Aleksandar; Dabrowski, Piotr Wojtek; Mühldorfer, Kristin; Nitsche, Andreas; Wibbelt, Gudrun; Kurth, Andreas",Sci Rep,324,26

Our contribution is the simultaneous analysis of the role of these US and EA drivers, as well as their interactions with real sector shocks. We corroborate the negative impact of US monetary policy tightening on cross-border lending to EMs, but we find that EA monetary policy seems to have an impact mostly on Emerging Europe, reflecting the fact that cross-border lending to most other EM regions is dollar denominated. We also find that real sector shocks in both the US and EA trigger an increase in cross-border lending, but less in EA when modeling the financial sector. Finally, for financial sector shocks, such as those associated with a decrease in bank leverage, our results indicate a broad-based overall contraction of cross-border lending if the shock originates in the US, and heterogenous effects across borrowing regions if the shock originates in the EA.","Cerutti, Eugenio; Osorio-Buitron, Carolina",J Jpn Int Econ,324,21

This is due to the complexity of the psychological and social mechanisms determining the positioning of individuals and groups against vaccination and associated activities. Understanding the role played by social media and the Internet in the current spread of the anti-vaccination (AV) movement is of crucial importance. Methods: We present novel, long-term Big Data analyses of Internet activity connected with the AV movement for such different societies as the US and Poland. The datasets we analyzed cover multiyear periods preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, documenting the behavior of vaccine related Internet activity with high temporal resolution. To understand the empirical observations, in particular the mechanism driving the peaks of AV activity, we propose an Agent Based Model (ABM) of the AV movement. The model includes the interplay between multiple driving factors: contacts with medical practitioners and public vaccination campaigns, interpersonal communication, and the influence of the infosphere (social networks, WEB pages, user comments, etc.). The model takes into account the difference between the rational approach of the pro-vaccination information providers and the largely emotional appeal of anti-vaccination propaganda. Results: The datasets studied show the presence of short-lived, high intensity activity peaks, much higher than the low activity background. The peaks are seemingly random in size and time separation. Such behavior strongly suggests a nonlinear nature for the social interactions driving the AV movement instead of the slow, gradual growth typical of linear processes. The ABM simulations reproduce the observed temporal behavior of the AV interest very closely. For a range of parameters, the simulations result in a relatively small fraction of people refusing vaccination, but a slight change in critical parameters (such as willingness to post anti-vaccination information) may lead to a catastrophic breakdown of vaccination support in the model society, due to nonlinear feedback effects. The model allows the effectiveness of strategies combating the anti-vaccination movement to be studied. An increase in intensity of standard pro-vaccination communications by government agencies and medical personnel is found to have little effect. On the other hand, focused campaigns using the Internet and social media and copying the highly emotional and narrative-focused format used by the anti-vaccination activists can diminish the AV influence. Similar effects result from censoring and taking down anti-vaccination communications by social media platforms. The benefit of such tactics might, however, be offset by their social cost, for example, the increased polarization and potential to exploit it for political goals, or increased ‘persecution’ and ‘martyrdom’ tropes.","Sobkowicz, Pawel; Sobkowicz, Antoni",Vaccines (Basel),324,20

Smoking increases the risk of respiratory infections; thus, cessation represents a huge opportunity for public health. However, there is scarce evidence about if and how smoking affects the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We performed an observational case-control study, assessing the single-day point prevalence of smoking among 218 COVID-19 adult patients hospitalized in 7 Italian non-intensive care wards and in a control group of 243 patients admitted for other conditions to 7 general wards COVID-19-free. We compared proportions for categorical variables by using the χ2 test and performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify the variables associated with risk of hospitalization for COVID-19. RESULTS: The percentages of current smokers (4.1% vs 16%, p=0.00003) and never smokers (71.6% vs 56.8%, p=0.0014) were significantly different between COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 patients. COVID-19 patients had lower mean age (69.5 vs 74.2 years, p=0.00085) and were more frequently males (59.2% vs 44%, p=0.0011). In the logistic regression analysis, current smokers were significantly less likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with non-smokers (Odds ratio 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11-0.48, p<0.001), even after adjusting for age and gender (OR 0.14; 95% CI, 0.06-0.31, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We reported an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smokers among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in non-intensive care wards. The meaning of these preliminary findings, which are in line with those currently emerging in literature, is unclear; they need to be confirmed by larger studies. IMPLICATIONS: An unexpectedly low prevalence of current smokers among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in some Italian non-intensive care wards is reported. This finding could be a stimulus for the generation of novel hypotheses on individual predisposition and possible strategies for reducing the risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2, and needs to be confirmed by further larger studies designed with adequate methodology.","Meini, Simone; Fortini, Alberto; Andreini, Roberto; Sechi, Leonardo Alberto; Tascini, Carlo",Nicotine Tob Res,324,16

Secondary objectives were to validate the video, identify the challenges in producing it, and the responses to these challenges. METHODS: Rheumatologists from 7 Middle Eastern Arab countries (MEAC) discussed unmet needs in the education of patients with RA. They reviewed pre-existing educational audiovisual material and drafted the script for a new video in Arabic. The video was produced in collaboration with a technical team, then validated by patients using a standardized interview. At each step of production, challenges were identified. RESULTS: Twenty-three rheumatologists from MEAC identified unmet needs in patients’ education. A video was produced, explaining the concepts of treat-to-target and showing a patient performing self-assessment using DAS-28. Sixty-two patients were interviewed for validation and found the video to be useful and easy to understand, albeit not replacing the physician’s visit. Most common challenges encountered included acceptance of patient empowerment, agreement on DAS-28 as composite measure, production of a comprehensible written Arabic text, and addressing the population cultural mix. CONCLUSION: Despite challenges, the video was well accepted among patients and can be used for clinical and research purposes. It is particularly useful in pandemic periods where social distancing is recommended.","Ziade, Nelly; Arayssi, Thurayya; Elzorkany, Bassel; Daher, Amani; Karam, Ghada Abi; Jbara, Mohammad Abu; Aiko, Alla; Alam, Elie; Emadi, Samar Al; Mashaleh, Manal Al; Badsha, Humeira; Kibbi, Lina El; Halabi, Hussein; Harifi, Ghita; Khan, Bhavna; Masri, Abdel Fattah; Menassa, Jeanine; Merashli, Mira; Merheb, Georges; Messaykeh, Jamil; Mroue’, Kamel; Saad, Sahar; Salloum, Nelly; Uthman, Imad; Masri, Basel",Mediterr J Rheumatol,324,25

Sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR) assays are available for RVA but require submission of the clinical samples to diagnostic laboratories. Patient-side immunoassays for RVA protein detection have shown variable results, particularly with samples from unintended species. A sensitive and specific test for detection of RVA on the farm would facilitate rapid management decisions. The insulated isothermal RT-PCR (RT-iiPCR) assay works in a portable machine to allow sensitive and specific on-site testing. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate a commercially available RT-iiPCR assay for RVA detection in feces from different animal species. This assay was compared to an in-house rtRT-PCR assay and a commercially available rtRT-PCR kit, as well as an ELISA and EM for RVA detection. All three PCR assays targeted the well-conserved NSP5 gene. Clinical fecal samples from 108 diarrheic animals (mainly cattle and horses) were tested. The percentage of positive samples by ELISA, EM, in-house rtRT-PCR, commercial rtRT-PCR, and RT-iiPCR was 29.4%, 31%, 36.7%, 51.4%, 56.9%, respectively. The agreement between different assays was high (81.3–100%) in samples containing high viral loads. The sensitivity of the RT-iiPCR assay appeared to be higher than the commercially available rtRT-PCR assay, with a limit of detection (95% confidence index) of 3–4 copies of in vitro transcribed dsRNA. In conclusion, the user-friendly, field-deployable RT-iiPCR system holds substantial promise for on-site detection of RVA.","Soltan, Mohamed A.; Tsai, Yun-Long; Lee, Pei-Yu A.; Tsai, Chuan-Fu; Chang, Hsiao-Fen G.; Wang, Hwa-Tang T.; Wilkes, Rebecca P.",J Virol Methods,324,27

Predominant findings in case series of kidney biopsies include acute tubular injury and collapsing podocytopathy. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on kidney biopsy of a patient with COVID19-associated Henoch-Schönlein vasculitis, to investigate the underlying molecular changes. METHOD: A 46-year-old woman presented with cutaneous vasculitis, arthritis, fever and microscopic hematuria. SARS-CoV-2 PCR on nasopharyngeal swab turned positive. Despite quick spontaneous resolution of symptoms, hematuria persisted and proteinuria increased in the next weeks. Subsequent kidney biopsy showed IgA nephropathy. Kidney biopsy was dissociated into a single-cell suspension and RNA was sequenced. 6126 kidney cells passed quality filters. Publicly available single cell sequencing data of 3 healthy kidney samples were integrated to allow comparison. The skin biopsy, performed at the initial presentation, was stained for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the ACE2 protein using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Unsupervised clustering analysis of kidney identified 12 distinct cell types (Figure 1). T-lymphocytes were significantly enriched in COVID19 associated IgA nephropathy (16.7% versus 0.5%, 1.2% and 4.1% in healthy kidney, IgA nephropathy/healthy kidney ratio of relative % of T-/NK-cell clusters of 8.5), with a deviation towards CD8 lymphocytes and NK(T) cells (Figure 2). NK cells were solely present in IgA nephropathy compared to healthy kidney (1.5% versus 0% in all healthy kidneys). Several genes involved in immune activation, oxidative stress and injury were upregulated in podocytes and mesangial cells. For example, one of the genes upregulated in podocytes was macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) which is known to be involved in podocyte injury and mesangial sclerosis. In endothelial cells pathways involved in NK cell immunity, antigen presentation, interferon gamma signaling, and viral entry were upregulated. In T lymphocytes pathways of antigen presentation and T cell cytotoxicity were enriched. In the skin biopsy, immunohistochemistry was positive for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inside inflammatory cells, while the ACE2 receptor was positive in the same inflammatory cells, as well as inside endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: Although both innate and adaptive immunity are considered to be involved in IgA nephropathy, our single cell sequencing data demonstrates that mainly T-lymphocytes, especially CD8 cells and NK cells, are enriched in COVID19 associated IgA nephropathy. Further elucidation of the involved pathways and the T cell receptor is planned. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be identified inside the inflammatory cells in the skin in the context of cutaneous vasculitis, suggesting a direct pathologic effect.","Heylen, Line; Boeckx, Bram; Jacobs, Tim; Bosisio, Francesca Maria; Weynand, Birgit; Marcelis, Lukas; Dendooven, Amélie; Hendrickx, Liesbet; Fransis, Sabine; Steensels, Deborah; Van Boxstael, Sam; Van Asbroeck, Pieter Jan; Thevissen, Kristof; Van Eyken, Peter; Lambrechts, Diether",Nephrol Dial Transplant,324,30

We also test the effectiveness of government imposition of public health measures to reduce the risk of transmission and impact of the pandemic, especially in the early phase. R0 is estimated from the statistical model as 3.21 using a 0.147 estimated growth rate [95% C.I: 0.137-0.157] and a 15-day time to recovery after COVID-19 infection. This estimate of the initial R0 is consistent with others reported in the literature from other parts of Africa, China and Europe. Our results also indicate that COVID-19 transmission reduced consistently in Ghana after the imposition of public health interventions - such as border restrictions, intra-city movement, quarantine and isolation - during the first phase of the pandemic from March to May 2020. However, the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) beyond mid-May 2020 does not represent the true situation given there was not a consistent testing regime in place. This is also confirmed by our Jack-knife bootstrap estimates which show that the positivity rate over-estimates the true incidence rate from mid-May 2020. Given concerns about virus mutations, delays in vaccination and a possible new wave of the pandemic, there is a need for systematic testing of a representative sample of the population to monitor the reproduction number. There is also an urgent need to increase the availability of testing for the general population to enable early detection, isolation and treatment of infected individuals to reduce progression to severe disease and mortality.","Frempong, N.

Using data from the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR),§ CDC assessed the association between body mass index (BMI) and risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., hospitalization, intensive care unit [ICU] or stepdown unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death). Among 148,494 adults who received a COVID-19 diagnosis during an emergency department (ED) or inpatient visit at 238 U.S. hospitals during March-December 2020, 28.3% had overweight and 50.8% had obesity. Overweight and obesity were risk factors for invasive mechanical ventilation, and obesity was a risk factor for hospitalization and death, particularly among adults aged <65 years. Risks for hospitalization, ICU admission, and death were lowest among patients with BMIs of 24.2 kg/m2, 25.9 kg/m2, and 23.7 kg/m2, respectively, and then increased sharply with higher BMIs. Risk for invasive mechanical ventilation increased over the full range of BMIs, from 15 kg/m2 to 60 kg/m2. As clinicians develop care plans for COVID-19 patients, they should consider the risk for severe outcomes in patients with higher BMIs, especially for those with severe obesity. These findings highlight the clinical and public health implications of higher BMIs, including the need for intensive COVID-19 illness management as obesity severity increases, promotion of COVID-19 prevention strategies including continued vaccine prioritization (6) and masking, and policies to ensure community access to nutrition and physical activities that promote and support a healthy BMI.","Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Goodman, Alyson B.; Belay, Brook; Freedman, David S.; Sucosky, Marissa S.; Lange, Samantha J.; Gundlapalli, Adi V.; Boehmer, Tegan K.; Blanck, Heidi M.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,324,24

Anxiety disorders are associated with intolerance to uncertainty. In this review we describe brain circuits and sensorimotor pathways involved in human reactions to uncertainty. We present the healthy mode of coping with uncertainty and discuss deviations from this mode. Methods: Literature search of PubMed and Google Scholar. Results: As manifestation of anxiety disorders includes peripheral reactions and negative cognitions, we suggest an integrative model of threat cognitions modulated by sensorimotor regions: “The Sensorimotor-Cognitive-Integration-Circuit.” The model emphasizes autonomic nervous system coupling with the cortex, addressing peripheral anxious reactions to uncertainty, pathways connecting cortical regions and cost-reward evaluation circuits to sensorimotor regions, filtered by the amygdala and basal ganglia. Of special interest are the ascending and descending tracts for sensory-motor crosstalk in healthy and pathological conditions. We include arguments regarding uncertainty in anxiety reactions to the pandemic and derive from our model treatment suggestions which are supported by scientific evidence. Our model is based on systematic control theories and emphasizes the role of goal conflict regulation in health and pathology. We also address anxiety reactions as a spectrum ranging from healthy to pathological coping with uncertainty, and present this spectrum as a transdiagnostic entity in accordance with recent claims and models. Conclusions: The human need for controllability and predictability suggests that anxiety disorders reactive to the pandemic's uncertainties reflect pathological disorganization of top-down bottom-up signaling and neural noise resulting from non-pathological human needs for coherence in life.","Goldstein Ferber, Sari; Shoval, Gal; Zalsman, Gil; Mikulincer, Mario; Weller, Aron",Front Psychiatry,324,1

Only one other study has attempted to reduce bothersome urinary symptoms through an intervention after flexible cystoscopy. METHODS: This was a randomised controlled trial in which patients were randomised 1:1 to receive lidocaine gel pre and post flexible cystoscopy (treatment) or lidocaine gel pre flexible cystoscopy only (control). Patient-reported outcome measures were used to assess symptoms and quality of life prior to cystoscopy, on day 2 and day 7 post cystoscopy. RESULT: Fifty patients were divided equally between the treatment and control groups. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups (p = 1.000). An overall symptoms variable was measured, though no significant difference was found in the distribution of responses between the groups at baseline, 2 or 7 days after the flexible cystoscopy (p = 0.423, 0.651,0.735).

The disease is multifocal, with a course ranging from indolent, with only skin manifestations to fulminant, with extensive visceral involvement. In the current view, all forms of KS have a common etiology in human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 infection, and the differences among them are due to the involvement of various cofactors. In fact, HHV-8 infection can be considered a necessary but not sufficient condition for the development of KS, because further factors (genetic, immunologic, and environmental) are required. The role of cofactors can be attributed to their ability to interact with HHV-8, to affect the immune system, or to act as vasoactive agents. In this contribution, a survey of the current state of knowledge on many and various factors involved in KS pathogenesis is carried out, in particular by highlighting the facts and controversies about the role of some drugs (quinine analogues and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) in the onset of the disease. Based on these assessments, it is possible to hypothesize that the role of cofactors in KS pathogenesis can move toward an effect either favoring or inhibiting the onset of the disease, depending on the presence of other agents modulating the pathogenesis itself, such as genetic predisposition, environmental factors, drug intake, or lymph flow disorders. It is possible that the same agents may act as either stimulating or inhibiting cofactors according to the patient’s genetic background and variable interactions. Treatment guidelines for each form of KS are outlined, because a unique standard therapy for all of them cannot be considered due to KS heterogeneity. In most cases, therapeutic options, both local and systemic, should be tailored to the patient’s peculiar clinical conditions.","Ruocco, Eleonora; Ruocco, Vincenzo; Tornesello, Maria Lina; Gambardella, Alessio; Wolf, Ronni; Buonaguro, Franco M.",Clinics in Dermatology,324,2

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in New York to select plasma donors for a randomized, double‐blind, controlled convalescent plasma trial. Clearance for donation required successful completion of an online questionnaire and an in‐person screening visit, which included (a) completion of a Donor Health Questionnaire (DHQ), (b) Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody testing using an immunochromatographic anti‐ severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) test, (c) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing if <28 days from symptom resolution, and (d) routine blood bank testing. RESULTS: After receiving 3093 online questionnaires, 521 individuals presented for in‐person screening visits, with 40.1% (n = 209) fully qualifying. Subjects (n = 312) failed to progress due to the following reasons: disqualifying answer from DHQ (n = 30, 9.6%), insufficient antibodies (n = 198, 63.5%), persistent positive PCR tests (n = 14, 4.5%), and blood donation testing labs (n = 70, 22.4%). Importantly, 24.6% and 11.1% of potential donors who reported having PCR‐diagnosed infection had low or undetectable SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody levels, respectively. Surprisingly, 62.9% (56/89) of subjects had positive PCR tests 14–27 days after symptom resolution, with 13 individuals continuing to be PCR positive after 27 days. CONCLUSION: It is feasible for a single site to fully qualify a large number of convalescent plasma donors in a short period of time. Among otherwise qualified convalescent plasma donors, we found high rates of low or undetectable antibody levels and many individuals with persistently positive PCR tests.","Carter, Jason A.; Freedenberg, Alex T.; Romeiser, Jamie L.; Talbot, Lillian R.; Browne, Nicholas J.; Cosgrove, Megan E.; Shevik, Margaret E.; Generale, Laura M.; Rago, Molly G.; Caravella, Giuseppina A.; Ahmed, Tahmeena; Mamone, Linda J.; Bennett‐Guerrero, Elliott",Transfusion,324,24

There is a need for research on fears and perceived risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 so as to understand the impact on wellbeing and inform service provision. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the correlates of COVID‐19 fears and perceived risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 among people with rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. DESIGN: A cross‐sectional survey design was applied in Aotearoa New Zealand in the period after initial nationwide lockdowns. METHOD: An online survey was completed from July to September 2020 by 126 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 96) or ankylosing spondylitis (n = 30) who had previously been recruited to the Patient Opinion Real‐Time Anonymous Liaison (PORTAL) study in 2015 or 2018. The survey included demographics and health information as well as measures of COVID‐19 fears and experiences, functional disability and fatigue‐related disability. RESULTS: Fears about COVID‐19 were higher among younger participants, those who had been tested for SARS‐CoV‐2, and those who experienced more flares over the initial lockdown. Perceived risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was also higher among individual who had been tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 and those taking biologic medications. CONCLUSION: Fears about COVID‐19 and perceived risk of infection are related to age, health and medications among individuals with rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. These findings inform how health professionals can help address the concerns of particular groups of people with rheumatic disease by providing relevant information about the ongoing effects of the pandemic.","Treharne, Gareth J.; Johnstone, Grace; Fletcher, Benjamin D.; Lamar, Roisin S.

This resulted in social–ecological impacts and added another layer of complexity to managing PAs. This paper presents the results of a survey in Snowdonia National Park capturing the views of over 700 local residents on the impacts of COVID‐19 restrictions and possible scenarios and tools for managing tourist numbers. Lower visitor numbers were seen in a broadly positive way by a significant number of respondents while benefit sharing issues from tourism also emerged. Most preferred options to manage overcrowding were restricting access to certain paths, the development of mobile applications to alert people to overcrowding and reporting irresponsible behavior. Our findings are useful for PA managers and local communities currently developing post‐COVID‐19 recovery strategies.","Jones, Nikoleta; McGinlay, James; Jones, Angela; Malesios, Chrisovalantis; Holtvoeth, Jens; Dimitrakopoulos, Panayiotis G.; Gkoumas, Vassilis; Kontoleon, Andreas",Conserv Lett,324,20

On March 11, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. The first instance of the virus in Nigeria was documented on February 27, 2020. Methods This study provides a preliminary epidemiological analysis of the first 45 days of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria quantifying. We estimated the early transmissibility via time-varying reproduction number based on Bayesian method that incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of serial interval (time interval between symptoms onset in an infected individual and the infector) and adjusted for disease importation. Findings By April 11, 2020, 318 confirmed cases and 10 deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in Nigeria. At day 45, the exponential growth rate was 0.07 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.05-0.10) with doubling time of 9.84 days (95% CI: 7.28 - 15.18). Separately for travel related and local cases the doubling time was 12.88 days and 2.86 days, respectively. Furthermore, we estimated the reproduction number for each day of the outbreak using three-weekly window while adjusting for travel related cases. The estimated reproduction number was 4.98 (95% CrI: 2.65 -8.41) at day 22 (March 19, 2020), peaking at 5.61 (95% CrI: 3.83 -7.88) at day 25 (March 22, 2020). The median reproduction number over the study period was 2.71 and the latest value at April 11, 2020 was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.26 - 1.58). Interpretation These 45-day estimates suggested that cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria have been remarkably lower than expected and the preparedness to detect needs to be shifted to stop local transmission.","Adegboye, Oyelola; Adekunle, Adeshina I; Gayawan, Ezra",,324,16

Therefore, rapid diagnosis in conjunction with infection prevention measures is important to prevent transmission of the diseases. Recently, a new Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV (Xpert 4-in-1) assay enables the detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2, flu A, flu B, and RSV in upper respiratory tract specimens. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the Xpert 4-in-1 assay by comparing it with that of the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assays for the detection of the four viruses in nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens. A total of 279 NP specimens, including 66, 56, 64, and 53 specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2, flu A, flu B, and RSV, respectively, were included. The Xpert 4-in-1 assay demonstrated high concordance with the comparator assays, with overall agreement for SARS-CoV-2, flu A, flu B, and RSV at 99.64%, 100%, 99.64%, and 100%, respectively, and a high Cohen’s kappa (κ) value ranging from 0.99 to 1.00, indicating an almost perfect correlation between assays. The cycle threshold value association between positive samples also showed a good correlation between assays. In conclusion, the overall performance of the Xpert 4-in-1 assay was highly comparable to that of the Xpert SARS-CoV-2 and Xpert Flu/RSV assays for the detection and differentiation of SARS CoV-2, flu A, flu B, and RSV in NP specimens.","Leung, Eddie Chi-man; Chow, Viola Chi-ying; Lee, May Kin-ping; Tang, Kevin Pui-san; Li, Daniel Kwok-cheung; Lai, Raymond Wai-man",J Clin Microbiol,324,29

Ils constituent une population cible pour la vaccination. Toutefois, la réponse vaccinale chez ces patients n’est pas connue. Matériels et méthodes Étude observationnelle monocentrique portant sur l’ensemble des patients HDC à qui la vaccination contre la COVID-19 par le vaccin à ARNm BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech®) a été proposée. Deux injections ont été réalisées à 28j d’intervalle, dans le bras opposé à l’abord vasculaire. Les données cliniques ont été recueillies prospectivement. La recherche d’anticorps spécifiques (IgG et IgM anti-protéine Spike) a été réalisée par immunochromatographie (COVID-19 BSS, Biosynex®) sur des sérums collectés avant la première injection, puis avant la seconde et 1 mois après. Les résultats sont exprimés en médiane [IQR : 25–75] ou %. Résultats Entre le 15 janvier et le 21 mars 2021, la vaccination a été proposée aux 55 patients du centre et acceptée par 49 (89,1 %) patients, les 6 autres ayant refusé. Parmi les 49 patients vaccinés, l’âge médian est de 70 [63–82,5] ans, 17 (34,7 %) sont diabétiques, et 8 (16,3 %) ont une greffe d’organe solide. La durée médiane en dialyse à la vaccination est de 26,2 [17,8–49,9] mois ; les patients sont dialysés sur une membrane en polysulfone (PSF), sauf 4 (8,2 %) sur une membrane en polyméthylmétacrylate (PMMA). La séroprévalence en IgG à j0 est de 12,2 % (6/49 patients, dont 4 ayant un antécédent de COVID symptomatique de plus de 3 mois, avec PCR positive). Parmi les 43 patients séronégatifs à l’inclusion, 10 sont encore en cours de vaccination. Les 33 patients ayant complété le schéma vaccinal ont les résultats suivants, respectivement avant la seconde injection et 1 mois après : IgM, 9,1 % (3 patients) et 12,1 % (4 patients) ; IgG, 9,1 % (3 patients) et 87,9 % (29 patients). Tous les patients positifs en IgM le sont également en IgG (aucun n’a développé de signes cliniques évocateurs de COVID-19 dans le suivi). Parmi les 4 patients non répondeurs, 1 recevait une immunothérapie pour cancer cutané, et tous ont une membrane en PSF. Tous les patients transplantés d’organe ont eu une réponse vaccinale positive 1 mois après la seconde injection. Le profil sérologique des patients dialysés avec un filtre en PMMA est comparable à ceux avec un filtre en PSF. La tolérance est bonne: 1 patiente a présenté une réponse systémique avec fièvre et frisson, et 60,1 % ont eu une réaction douloureuse au point d’injection ayant duré 24h. Conclusion L’acceptation et la réponse vaccinale au vaccin à ARNm contre la COVID-19 sont bonnes chez les patients HDC.","Monge, M.; Richaud, C.; De Laroche, M.; Lefevre, M.; Camps, S.; Compain, F.",Infectious Diseases Now,324,16

Likewise, natural disasters and health emergencies considerably impact immunization endeavors, such as the coronaviurs 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has overwhelmed the entire world. It was already anticipated that the pandemic would severely affect Pakistan's vaccination programs due to interruptions in routine vaccination and the overstretching of healthcare systems. Consequently, there are anticipations of outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs). Yet empirical evidence is missing. Drawing on qualitative research, this article focuses on the impact of COVID-19 on routine vaccination programs in Pakistan. Our data come from a small village located in Pakistan's Sindh province where local people refused the routine polio vaccine that was stopped for a while, then resumed in July 2020. They suspected both the vaccine and COVID-19 to be a “Western plot.” We argue that these perceptions and practices can be seen against the backdrop of economic, socio-cultural, and (geo)political forces, which are encoded in “societal memory.” Not only is there a need to reverse the significant impacts of COVID-19 on routine vaccination by arranging supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), but also the government must deal with other pressing issues that affect the vaccination programs in the country.","Ali, Inayat; Sadique, Salma; Ali, Shahbaz",Front Sociol,324,29

Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to improve clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with severe disease. This case series explores the safety and effectiveness of intravenous allogeneic cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), formulated as CAP-1002, in critically ill patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Adverse reactions to CAP-1002, clinical status on the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale, and changes in pro-inflammatory biomarkers and leukocyte counts were analyzed. All patients (n = 6; age range 19–75 years, 1 female) required ventilatory support (invasive mechanical ventilation, n = 5) with PaO(2)/FiO(2) ranging from 69 to 198. No adverse events related to CAP-1002 administration were observed. Four patients (67%) were weaned from respiratory support and discharged from the hospital. One patient remains mechanically ventilated as of April 28th, 2020; all survive. A contemporaneous control group of critically ill COVID-19 patients (n = 34) at our institution showed 18% overall mortality at a similar stage of hospitalization. Ferritin was elevated in all patients at baseline (range of all patients 605.43–2991.52 ng/ml) and decreased in 5/6 patients (range of all patients 252.89–1029.90 ng/ml). Absolute lymphocyte counts were low in 5/6 patients at baseline (range 0.26–0.82 × 10(3)/µl) but had increased in three of these five patients at last follow-up (range 0.23–1.02 × 10(3)/µl). In this series of six critically ill COVID-19 patients, intravenous infusion of CAP-1002 was well tolerated and associated with resolution of critical illness in 4 patients. This series demonstrates the apparent safety of CAP-1002 in COVID-19.

The effect of climatic factors on spreading of COVID-19 can play an important role in the new Coronavirus outbreak. In this study, the main parameters, including the number of infected people with COVID-19, population density, intra-provincial movement, and infection days to end of the study period, average temperature, average precipitation, humidity, wind speed, and average solar radiation investigated to understand how can these parameters effects on COVID-19 spreading in Iran? The Partial correlation coefficient (PCC) and Sobol’-Jansen methods are used for analyzing the effect and correlation of variables with the COVID-19 spreading rate. The result of sensitivity analysis shows that the population density, intra-provincial movement have a direct relationship with the infection outbreak. Conversely, areas with low values of wind speed, humidity, and solar radiation exposure to a high rate of infection that support the virus's survival. The provinces such as Tehran, Mazandaran, Alborz, Gilan, and Qom are more susceptible to infection because of high population density, intra-provincial movements and high humidity rate in comparison with Southern provinces.","Ahmadi, Mohsen; Sharifi, Abbas; Dorosti, Shadi; Ghoushchi, Saeid Jafarzadeh; Ghanbari, Negar",Sci Total Environ,324,1

The consequent inflammation is not able to clear viruses. The persistent excessive inflammatory response can build up a clinical picture that is very difficult to manage and potentially fatal. Modulating the immune response plays a key role in fighting the disease. One of the main defence systems is the activation of neutrophils that release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) under the stimulus of autophagy. Various molecules can induce NETosis and autophagy; some potent activators are damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and, in particular, the high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). This molecule is released by damaged lung cells and can induce a robust innate immunity response. The increase in HMGB1 and NETosis could lead to sustained inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, blocking these molecules might be useful in COVID-19 treatment and should be further studied in the context of targeted therapy.","Cicco, Sebastiano; Cicco, Gerolamo; Racanelli, Vito; Vacca, Angelo",Mediators Inflamm,324,1

The cardiovascular and renal systems are most affected in Fabry patients and may require heart or kidney transplants in the late stages of the disease depending on severity of manifestations. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has proven to delay progression of Fabry disease considerably, especially when started early in life. Current research has shown that individuals who have received cardiac or renal transplants or are currently on dialysis have the greatest probability of developing severe manifestations of COVID-19. It has also been shown that people who contract COVID-19 experience a rapid increase in cytokine levels which can lead to a prothrombotic state and have a greater risk in the presence of comorbidities. A history of cardiac or renal transplants as well as the naturally elevated cytokine levels in Fabry disease make it likely that COVID-19 could have a greater impact on the health of these patients. We report the case of a 67-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, history of kidney transplant, and Fabry disease treated late in progression of the disease first with agalsidase beta ERT, then oral migalastat who developed severe manifestations of COVID-19. The autopsy findings showed acute and organizing hyaline membrane disease consistent with COVID 19 pneumonia and secondary invasive bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with cavitary lesion formation. The sections of the heart showed scattered subendocardial fibrosis, and the transplanted kidneys showed thyroidization and interstitial nephritis potentially secondary to COVID-19, in addition to his long-standing renal disease.

This not only ensures that viral proteins will be produced, but also stifles innate host defences that are aimed at inhibiting the capacity of infected cells for protein synthesis. Remarkably, nearly every step of the translation process can be targeted by virally encoded functions.

Given the possibly detrimental effects of ageism on individuals and societies, we were interested in older adults’ perception of ageism in the Corona-crisis and its relation to their health and well-being.

The positive retest group showed shorter durations between symptom onset and hospitalization (P < 0.001) and symptom onset and the first positive NAAT (P = 0.033). The positive retest group had higher basophil counts (P = 0.023) and direct bilirubin (P = 0.032) and chlorine concentrations (P = 0.023) but lower potassium concentrations (P = 0.001) than the negative retest group. Multivariable regression analysis showed that coughing (OR = 7.59, 95% CI 2.28–25.32, P = 0.001) and serum chloride concentrations (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.08–1.77, P = 0.010) were independently associated with a positive retest result. Coughing and serum chloride concentrations were independent risk factors for positive NAAT retest results. Patients with a hospital stay of < 2 weeks or a short incubation period should stay in isolation and be monitored to reduce transmission. These results could help identify patients who require closer surveillance.","Yi, Wanwan; Long, Xuan; Liu, Jin; Shi, LiShuai; Chen, Zichen; Yang, Jing; Yang, Ziyu; Lv, Zhongwei; Fan, Hengwei",Hum Cell,324,16

Chest CT scan may be helpful in early diagnosing of COVID-19. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CT using RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 as reference standard and investigated reasons for discordant results between the two tests. Methods In this prospective single centre study in the Netherlands, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a PCR upon arrival at the ED. CT results were compared with PCR test(s). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Discordant results were investigated using discharge diagnoses. Results Between March 13th and March 24th 2020, 193 symptomatic ED patients were included. In total, 43.0% of patients had a positive PCR and 56.5% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 89.2%, specificity 68.2%, likelihoodratio (LR) + 2.81 and LR- 0.16. Sensitivity was higher in patients with high risk pneumonia (CURB-65 score ≥3; n=17, 100%) and with sepsis (SOFA score ≥2; n=137, 95.5%). Of the 35 patients (31.8%) with a suspicious CT and a negative PCR, 9 had another respiratory viral pathogen, and in 7 patients, COVID-19 was considered likely. One of nine patients with a non-suspicious CT and a positive PCR had developed symptoms within 48 hours before scanning. Discussion The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic ED patients is high, but used as a single diagnostic test, CT can not safely diagnose or exclude COVID-19. However, CT can be used as a quick first screening tool.","Gietema, Hester A; Zelis, Noortje; Nobel, J.

Moreover, as of the 13th of March 2020, the WHO has announced that the European continent is now the main centre of the pandemic. Many European governments have already implemented harsh measures to attempt to contain the spread of the virus. In Portugal, there are, as of the 20th of March 2020, 1020 confirmed cases. One of the questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the spread is going to evolve in time. A timely idea of the amount of cases that will exist in a near future can allow governments and policy makers to act accordingly. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation. As some of the parameters were unknown, and the data for Portugal is still scarce, given that the outbreak started later (first case on the 2nd of March) I used Italian data (first reported case in Italy on the 31st of January) to predict them. I then construct two or three different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal, considering both the effectiveness of the mitigation measurements implemented by the government, and the self-protective measures taken by the population, as explained in the South Korean model. In the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000 people by the beginning of April. If measures are appropriately taken this number can be reduced to about 800 cases. In case that some measures are taken, but their implementation is not done appropriately, the active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. The actual figures probably lie between the interval (~800-7,000) and the peak will be reached between 9th and the 20nd of April 2020. Without control and self-protective measures, this model predicts that the figures of active cases of SARS-covid-2 would reach a staggering ~40,000 people It shows the importance of control and self-protecting measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate measures, this number can be brought down to ~800-7,000 people. Hopefully that will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.","Teles, Pedro",,324,30

This analysis reports COVID-19 patient demographics, infection, mortality, and case-fatality rates in the veteran population. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis using the Veterans Affairs informatics and computing infrastructure tool to assess the veterans' COVID-19 infections at the Veterans Affairs facilities from March 4th to June 23rd, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 10,621,580 veterans in this analysis, 59.7% were ≥65 yo, 92.5% were men, 68.7% were white, and 14.2% were black. Veterans ≥65 yo comprised 52.1% of cases and 89.9% of deaths. The relative mortality and case-fatality rates of black veterans, when compared with white veterans, were 2.83 (CI 2.56–3.14; P < .001) and 0.75 (CI 0.68–0.82; P < .001), respectively. Among the veterans who died from COVID-19, 87.4% had a history of cardiovascular disease, 56.5% had a history of diabetes, and 33.6% were obese. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly veterans (≥65yo) and veterans with a history of cardiovascular disease represent a large proportion of the VA COVID-19 cases and deaths. Black veterans had higher mortality rates but lower case fatality rates when than white veterans.","Luo, Jessica; Jeyapalina, Sujee; Stoddard, Gregory J.; Kwok, Alvin C.; Agarwal, Jayant P.",Ann Epidemiol,324,23

Accordingly, the use of immunomodulatory agents has been suggested but still remains controversial. Our working hypothesis is that methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus may be an effective and safety drug combination for treating severe COVID-19 patients. Methods and analysis: TACROVID is a randomized, open-label, single-center, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus plus standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone, in patients at advanced stage of COVID-19 disease with lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory response. Patients are randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two arms (42 patients in each group). The primary aim is to assess the time to clinical stability after initiating randomization. Clinical stability is defined as body temperature < 37.5 C, and PaO2/FiO2 > 400 and/or SatO2/FiO2 > 300, and respiratory rate < 24 rpm; for 48 consecutive hours. Discussion: Methylprednisolone and tacrolimus might be beneficial to treat those COVID-19 patients progressing into severe pulmonary failure and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome. The rationale for its use is the fast effect of methylprednisolone pulses and the ability of tacrolimus to inhibit both the CoV-2 replication and the secondary cytokine storm. Interestingly, both drugs are low-cost and can be manufactured on a large scale; thus, if effective and safe, a large number of patients could be treated in developed and developing countries.","Solanich, X.; Antoli, A.; Padulles, N.; Fanlo, M.; Iriarte, A.; Mitjavila, F.; Capdevila, O.; Molina, M.; Sabater, J.; Bas, J.; Mensa-Vilaro, A.; Niubo, J.; Calvo, N.; Bolivar, S.; Rigo-Bonnin, R.; Arregui, L.; Tebe, C.; Hereu, P.; Videla, S.; Corbella, X.",,324,30

By April 2020, there are over a million two hundred thousand confirmed cases and more than sixty-five thousand deaths worldwide Meanwhile in Asia, where the disease began, the spread continues, in China it seems for now to have passed its peak. Italy, Spain, France, and the US have been the countries more affected in terms of deaths. The coronavirus is more dangerous to the elderly and those with certain pre-existing medical conditions which is precisely the profile of lung cancer patients. Essential cancer services should be delivered but all steps should be taken to protect patients and the health workforce from infection with COVID-19. This presents a major challenge to radiotherapy (RT) departments worldwide in curbing the spread of COVID-19 while ensuring the continuity of services. In RT, shortening overall treatment time to reduce the number of patients present in the department is an important consideration. An international panel, including the majority of countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with expertise in the management of cancer in high-volume comprehensive centres from the largest societies of radiation oncology worldwide have come together to share their experience on COVID-19 preparedness in the context of lung cancer RT to deliver optimal care in such exceptional circumstances, based on the latest evidence. A comprehensive systematic review of the literature through a PubMed search was undertaken. Given that lung cancer is one of the most common and severe pathologies in radiation oncology departments, the following recommendations require particularly urgent consideration. The decision-making paths strongly depend on locally available resources, and a tailored approach should be used to attend lung cancer patients during this pandemic.","Liao, Zhongxing; Campo, Eleonor Rivin del; Salem, Ahmed; Pang, Qingsong; Liu, Hui; Guerra, Jose Luis Lopez",Lung Cancer,324,20

The aim of this study was to describe attitudes and behaviours towards the Canadian COVID-19 public health response, and identify risk-modifying behaviours based on socio-demographic characteristics. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was administered in May 2020 to members of a paid panel representative of the Canadian population by age, gender, official language, and region of residence. A total of 4981 respondents provided responses for indicators of self-reported risk perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours towards COVID-19 public health measures. RESULTS: More than 90% of respondents reported confidence in the ability to comply with a variety of public health measures. However, only 51% reported preparedness for illness in terms of expectation to work if sick or access to paid sick days. Risk perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours varied by demographic variables. Men, younger age groups, and those in the paid workforce were less likely to consider public health measures to be effective, and had less confidence in their ability to comply. Approximately 80% of respondents reported that parents provided childcare and 52% reported that parents in the workforce provided childcare while schools were closed. CONCLUSION: Policies to help address issues of public adherence include targeted messaging for men and younger age groups, social supports for those who need to self-isolate, changes in workplace policies to discourage presenteeism, and provincially co-ordinated masking and safe school policies.

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, RT-PCR tests have been considered the gold standard due to their high sensitivity and specificity. However, RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to return positive results when administered to individuals who are past the infectious stage of the disease. Meanwhile, antigen-based tests are often treated as a less accurate substitute for RT-PCR, however, new evidence suggests they may better reflect infectiousness. Consequently, the two test types may each be most optimally deployed in different settings. Here, we present an epidemiological model with surveillance testing and coordinated isolation in two congregate living settings (a nursing home and a university dormitory system) that considers test metrics with respect to viral culture, a proxy for infectiousness. Simulations show that antigen-based surveillance testing coupled with isolation greatly reduces disease burden and carries a lower economic cost than RT-PCR-based strategies. Antigen and RT-PCR tests perform different functions toward the goal of reducing infectious disease burden and should be used accordingly.","Love, J.; Wimmer, M. T.; Toth, D. J.

These complications can be the result of serious conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), peptic ulcers, and recently COVID-19. Limited liver and kidney function leads to increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) within the body resulting in elevated levels of ammonia in the mouth, nose, and skin. Similarly, peptic ulcers, commonly from H. pylori, result in ammonia production from urea within the stomach. The presence of these biomarkers enables a potential screening protocol to be considered for frequent, non-invasive monitoring of these conditions. Unfortunately, detection of ammonia in these mediums is rather challenging due to relatively small concentrations and an abundance of interferents. Currently, there are no options available for non-invasive screening of these conditions continuously and in real-time. Here we demonstrate the selective detection of ammonia using a vapor phase thermodynamic sensing platform capable of being employed as part of a health screening protocol. The results show that our detection system has the remarkable ability to selectively detect trace levels of ammonia in the vapor phase using a single catalyst. Additionally, detection was demonstrated in the presence of interferents such as carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and acetone common in human breath. These results show that our thermodynamic sensors are well suited to selectively detect ammonia at levels that could potentially be useful for health screening applications.","Ricci, Peter P.; Gregory, Otto J.",Sci Rep,324,16

Patients with AIADs, PIDs, and SIDs: (1) Do not present contraindications to COVID-19 vaccines if a mRNA vaccine is used and administered in a stabilized disease phase without active infection. (2) Should usually not discontinue immunosuppressive therapy, which may be modulated depending on the patient’s clinical condition. (3) When eligible, should have a priority access to vaccination.

Recently, a cellular protein, synaptotagmin-binding, cytoplasmic RNA-interacting protein (SYNCRIP), also known as NSAP1, was found to bind HCV RNA and enhance HCV IRES-dependent translation. We investigate whether this protein is also involved in the HCV RNA replication. We found that SYNCRIP was associated with detergent-resistant membrane fractions and colocalized with newly-synthesized HCV RNA. Knock-down of SYNCRIP by siRNA significantly decreased the amount of HCV RNA in the cells containing a subgenomic replicon or a full-length viral RNA. Lastly, an in vitro replication assay after immunodepletion of SYNCRIP showed that SYNCRIP was directly involved in HCV RNA replication. These findings indicate that SYNCRIP has dual functions, participating in both RNA replication and translation in HCV life cycle.","Liu, Helene Minyi; Aizaki, Hideki; Choi, Keum S.; Machida, Keigo; Ou, James J.-H.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,324,9

For the construction of a uracil auxotroph, the URA3 gene was excised by homologous recombination. The expression cassette of codon-optimized l-ribose isomerase gene from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus DL-28 under the control of the GAPDH promoter was integrated to the uracil auxotroph.

This outbreak coincided with early reports of exponential pandemic growth in New Delhi, which reached a peak of > 400 000 newly confirmed cases on 7 May 2021. METHODS: Epidemiological information including date of symptom onset, date of positive-sample detection, and travel and contact history for individual cases from this flight were collected. Whole genome sequencing was performed, and sequences were classified based on the dynamic Pango nomenclature system. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis compared sequences from this flight alongside other cases imported from India to Hong Kong on 26 flights between June 2020 and April 2021, as well as sequences from India or associated with India-related travel from February to April 2021, and 1217 reference sequences. RESULTS: Sequence analysis identified six lineages of SARS-CoV-2 belonging to two variants of concern (Alpha and Delta) and one variant of public health interest (Kappa) involved in this outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed at least three independent sub-lineages of Alpha with limited onward transmission, a superspreading event comprising 37 cases of Kappa, and transmission of Delta to only one passenger. Additional analysis of another 26 flights from India to Hong Kong confirmed widespread circulation of all three variants in India since early March 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The broad spectrum of disease severity and long incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 pose a challenge for surveillance and control. As illustrated by this particular outbreak, opportunistic infections of SARS-CoV-2 can occur irrespective of variant lineage, and requiring a nucleic acid test within 72 hours of departure may be insufficient to prevent importation or in-flight transmission.","Dhanasekaran, Vijaykrishna; Edwards, Kimberly M; Xie, Ruopeng; Gu, Haogao; Adam, Dillon C; Chang, Lydia D J; Cheuk, Sammi S Y; Gurung, Shreya; Krishnan, Pavithra; Ng, Daisy Y M; Liu, Gigi Y Z; Wan, Carrie K C; Cheng, Samuel S M; Tsang, Dominic N C; Cowling, Benjamin J; Peiris, Malik; Poon, Leo L M",J. travel med,324,1

One hundred and five (24.6%) were PCR positive, while 321 (75.4%) were PCR negative. Most patients were males 241 (56.6%) while 185(43.3%) were females. Over 185(43.3%) patients presented with symptoms, and the rest of the patients 241 (56.6%) were asymptomatic. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 had sensitivity 89.5%, specificity 99.06%, positive predictive value (PPV) 96.90%, negative predictive value (NPV) 96.6%, and positive likelihood ratio 4.26, while negative likelihood ratio 0.1. Diagnostic accuracy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 was 96.7% based on receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Conclusion: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 is very useful for the detection of past COVID-19 infection; it can be proved helpful in the identification of post-COVID complications and actual disease burden in a population.","Afzal, Nayab; Tariq, Naila; Raza, Saba; Shakeel, Danish",Cureus,324,26

The World Health Organization launched a global campaign to improve ORT coverage in 1978, with activities such as educational campaigns, training health workers and the creation of designate programming. Despite these efforts, ORT coverage remains relatively low. The objective of this systematic review is to identify the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of oral rehydration therapy in low and middle-income countries. METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy comprised of relevant subject headings and keywords was executed in 5 databases including OVID Medline, OVID Embase, OVID HealthStar, Web of Science and Scopus. Eligible studies underwent quality assessment, and a directed content analysis approach to data extraction was conducted and aligned to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to facilitate narrative synthesis. RESULTS: The search identified 1570 citations and following removal of duplicates as well as screening according to our inclusion/exclusion criteria, 55 articles were eligible for inclusion in the review. Twenty-three countries were represented in this review, with India, Bangladesh, Egypt, Nigeria, and South Africa having the most representation of available studies. Study dates ranged from 1981 to 2020. Overarching thematic areas spanning the barriers and facilitators that were identified included: availability and accessibility, knowledge, partnership engagement, and design and acceptability. CONCLUSION: A systematic review of studies on implementation of ORT in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) highlights key activities that facilitate the development of successful implementation that include: (1) availability and accessibility of ORT, (2) awareness and education among communities, (3) strong partnership engagement strategies, and (4) adaptable design to enhance acceptability. The barriers and facilitators identified under the CIFR domains can be used to build knowledge on how to adapt ORT to national and local settings and contribute to a better understanding on the implementation and use of ORT in LMICs. The prospects for scaling and sustaining ORT (after years of low use) will increase if implementation research informs local applications, and implementers engage appropriate stakeholders and test assumptions around localized theories of change from interventions to expected outcomes. REGISTRATION: A protocol for this systematic review was developed and uploaded onto the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews database (Registration number: CRD420201695).","Ezezika, Obidimma; Ragunathan, Apira; El-Bakri, Yasmine; Barrett, Kathryn",PLoS One,324,33

Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation. Methods: We performed a case series of COVID-19 positive/suspected patients admitted between 2/1/2020 and 4/4/2020 who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine or a combination. We evaluated baseline and post-medication QT interval (QTc, Bazett) using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as: a) maximum QTc [≥]500 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc [≥]550 (if QRS [≥]120 ms) and b) increased QTc of [≥]60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Results: Of 490 COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs, and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive, 25 suspected) met study criteria (age 62{+/-}17 yrs, 61% male). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 448{+/-}29 ms and increased to 459{+/-}36ms (p=0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18{+/-}43 ms vs -0.2{+/-}28 ms in women, p=0.02). 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. In a multivariable logistic regression, age, sex, Tisdale score, Elixhauser score, and baseline QTc were not associated with critical QTc prolongation (p>0.14). Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared to either drug, with many-fold greater prolongation with the combination vs. azithromycin alone (17{+/-}39 vs. 0.5{+/-}40 ms, p=0.07). No patients manifested torsades de pointes. Conclusions: Overall, 12% of patients manifested critical QTc interval prolongation, and traditional risk indices failed to flag these patients. With the drug combination, QTc prolongation was several-fold higher compared to azithromycin alone. The balance between uncertain benefit and potential risk when treating COVID-19 patients with these drugs should be carefully assessed prior to use.","Ramireddy, A.; Chugh, H.

In a short time, the health emergency became a global pandemic. To date, there are about 18.8 million infected people and about 700,000 deaths. There are currently no effective vaccines, and treatments are mostly experimental. The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are different, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS). Data from previous coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS-CoV (2003 outbreak) and emerging epidemiological data from the current global COVID-19 pandemic suggest that there could be substantial tissue fibrotic consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection, responsible for severe and in some cases fatal lung lesions. Some data show that even patients cured of viral infection have lung fibrotic tissue residues responsible for incorrect respiratory function even after healing. The role of antifibrotic drug therapy in patients with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection or in patients cured of residual pulmonary fibrosis is still to be defined and unclear; the scientific rationale for initiating, continuing, or discontinuing therapy is poorly defined. In this article, we describe the advantages of antifibrotic therapy in patients with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 viral infection to prevent the worsening and aggravation of the clinical situation, and the advantages it could have in the role of preventing pulmonary fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in accelerating the complete healing process.","Vitiello, Antonio; Pelliccia, Chiara; Ferrara, Francesco",SN Compr Clin Med,324,26

Here, we estimate from European data that COVID-19 cases are expected to double initially every three days, until social distancing interventions slow this growth, and that the impact of such measures is typically only seen nine days - i.e. three doubling times - after their implementation. We argue that such temporal patterns are more critical than precise estimates of the basic reproduction number for initiating interventions.

Two strains of mice were studied: BALB/c mice, which develop an acute and lethal hepatitis and C3H mice which develop a chronic brain infection. In BALB/c mice, viral RNA and antigens appeared during the first 24 h post infection (p.i.) in liver, whereas viral RNA was barely detectable in brain, up until death at day 3 p.i. In C3H mice, viral RNA and antigens were detected simultaneously in liver and brain only at day 2 p.i. In brain, the virus was detected in meningeal and ependymal cells and in perivascular cortical areas (days 5 and 7 p.i.). After day 49, the virus was no longer detected in brain parenchyma, but persisted in meningeal cells. Two host-dependent genetic differences in viral processing were observed in the liver: (1) the virus was first detected in Kupffer cells in BALB/c mice and mostly in hepatocytes in C3H mice; (2) in BALB/c mice, the 180 kDa S viral glycoprotein appeared more frequently cleaved in 90 kDa form than in C3H mice.","Décimo, D.; Boespflug, Odile; Meunier-Rotival, M.; Hadchouel, Michelle; Tardieu, M.",Arch Virol,324,21

METHODS: In this paper, we explore key areas of consideration when selecting roles and tasks; present current knowledge regarding these issues; and suggest how decision-makers could consider these issues when assigning tasks in their setting. This paper draws on the chapter “Community Health Worker Roles and Tasks” in Developing and Strengthening Community Health Worker Programs at Scale: A Reference Guide and Case Studies for Program Managers and Policymakers, as well as on a recently published compendium of 29 case studies of national CHW programmes and on recently published literature pertaining to roles and tasks of CHWs. RESULTS: This paper provides a list of questions that aim to help programme planners think about important issues when determining CHW roles and tasks in their setting. Planners need to assess whether the recommended roles and tasks are considered acceptable and appropriate by their target population and by the CHWs themselves and those who support them. Planners also need to think about the practical and organizational implications of each task for their particular setting with regard to training requirements, health systems support, work location, workload, and programme costs. CONCLUSION: When planning CHW roles and tasks, planners, programme implementers, and policy-makers should draw from global guidance and research evidence, but they also need to engage with the experiences, needs, and concerns of local communities and health workers. By drawing from both sources of information, they will stand a better chance of developing programmes that are effective in achieving their goals while remaining acceptable to those affected by them, feasible to implement, and sustainable over time.","Glenton, Claire; Javadi, Dena; Perry, Henry B.",Health Res Policy Syst,324,16

Other polyomaviruses (BKPyV and JCPyV) have been associated with illness in immunocompromised patients, and some studies suggest a higher prevalence of WUPyV and KIPyV in this population. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a higher prevalence or viral load for WUPyV and KIPyV exists in immunocompromised children compared with immunocompetent children. STUDY DESIGN: We measured the prevalence and viral load of WU and KI PyV by quantitative real-time PCR of viral DNA in respiratory tract specimens from pediatric hematology/oncology patients and immunocompetent controls with acute respiratory illnesses. RESULTS: The prevalence of WUPyV in the immunocompromised population was 5/161 (3%) versus 14/295 (5%) in the control population (P = 0.5), and 9/161 (5.6%) versus 7/295 (2.3%) respectively for KIPyV (P = 0.13). The mean viral load (in copies per cell or mL of sample) for KIPyV, was higher in the immunocompromised group compared to the control group (P = 0.019), but was not statistically different for WUPyV. A higher prevalence was seen in the hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients compared with other immunocompromised patients (6/26 versus 3/43, P = 0.054). Viral persistence was demonstrated only in 1/25 (4%) of sequential samples for KIPyV, and no persistence was seen for WUPyV. CONCLUSIONS: A higher prevalence of WUPyV or KIPyV in the immunocompromised population compared with the immunocompetent group was not demonstrated. Higher viral loads for KIPyV in the immunocompromised group may suggest an increased pathogenic potential in this population.","Rao, Suchitra; Garcea, Robert L.; Robinson, Christine C.; Simões, Eric A.F.",J Clin Virol,324,11

Currently, World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of molecular assays for confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection which are highly expensive and require specialized laboratory equipment. This is a limitation in mass testing and in low resource settings. SARS CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibody tests have had poor diagnostic performance that do not guarantee their use in diagnostics. In this study we demonstrate a concept of using a combination of RDTs in an algorithm to improve their performance for diagnostics. Method: Eighty six (86) EDTA whole blood samples were collected from SARS-CoV-2 positive cases admitted at Masaka and Mbarara Regional Referral Hospitals in Uganda. These were categorized from day when confirmed positive as follows; category A (0-3 days, 10 samples), category B (4-7 days, 20 samples), Category C (8-17 days, 11 samples) and Category D (18-28 days, 20 samples). Plasma was prepared, transported to the testing laboratory and stored at -200C prior to testing. A total of 13 RDTS were tested following manufacturers instructions. Data was entered in Microsoft Excel exported to STATA for computation of sensitivity and specificity. We computed for all possible combinations of 2 of the 13 RDTS (13C2) that were evaluated in parallel algorithm. Results: The individual sensitives of the RDTs ranged between 74% and 18% and there was a general increasing trend across the categories with days since PCR confirmation. A total of 78 possible combinations of the RDTs to be used in parallel was computated. The combinations of the 2 RDTS improved the sensitivities to 90%. Discussion: We demonstrate that use of RDTs in combinations can improve their overall sensitivity. This approach when used on a wider range of combination of RDTs may yield combinations that can give sensitivities that are of diagnostics relevance in mass testing and low resource setting.","Kushemererwa, G.

Same day Y-90 RE provides an opportunity to minimize logistical challenges and infection risk associated with COVID-19, thus improving patient access. AIM: To describe the use of same day Y-90 RE with routine single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) in order to optimize therapy. METHODS: All patients were selected for Y-90 RE through a multidisciplinary tumor board, and were screened and tested for COVID-19 infection per institutional protocol. A same day procedure was developed, consisting of angiography, imaging, and Y-90 resin particle delivery. Routine SPECT/CT after technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin (Tc-99m MAA) administration was performed for assessment of arterial supply, personalized dosimetry, and extrahepatic activity. Post-treatment Y-90 bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT was performed for confirmation of particle delivery, by utilization of energy windowing to limit signal from previously administered Tc-99m MAA particles. RESULTS: A total of 14 patients underwent same day Y-90 RE between March and June 2020. Mean lung shunt fraction was 6.13% (range 3.5%-13.1%). Y-90 RE was performed for a single lesion in 7 patients, while the remaining 7 patients had treatment of multifocal lesions. The largest lesion measured 8.3 cm. All patients tolerated the procedure well and were discharged the same day. CONCLUSION: Same day Y-90 RE with resin-based microspheres is feasible, and provides an opportunity to mitigate infection risk and logistical challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies would provide new insight into pre-existing immunity, virus transmission dynamics, and the nuances of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. To date, existing SARS-CoV-2 serology tests have limited utility due to insufficient reliable detection of antibody levels lower than what is typically present after several days of symptoms. To measure lower quantities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA with higher resolution than existing assays, we developed a new ELISA protocol with a distinct plate washing procedure and timed plate development via use of a standard curve. Very low optical densities from samples added to buffer coated wells at as low as a 1:5 dilution are reported using this ‘BU ELISA’ method. Use of this method revealed circulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N) reactive antibodies (IgG, IgM, and/or IgA) in 44 and 100 percent of pre-pandemic subjects, respectively, and the magnitude of these antibodies tracked with antibody levels of analogous viral proteins from endemic coronavirus (eCoV) strains. The disease status (HIV, SLE) of unexposed subjects was not linked with SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibody levels; however, quantities were significantly lower in subjects over 70 years of age compared with younger counterparts. Also, we measured SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N- specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies from 29 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at varying disease states, including 10 acute COVID-19 hospitalized subjects with negative serology results by the EUA approved Abbott IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N- specific IgM, IgG, IgA levels measured by the BU ELISA revealed higher signal from 9 of the 10 Abbott test negative COVID-19 subjects than all pre-pandemic samples for at least one antibody specificity/isotype, implicating improved serologic identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection via multi-parameter, high sensitive antibody detection. We propose that this improved ELISA protocol, which is straightforward to perform, low cost, and uses readily available commercial reagents, is a useful tool to elucidate new information about SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity and has promising implications for improved detection of all analytes measurable by this platform.","Yuen, Rachel R.; Steiner, Dylan; Pihl, Riley M.F.; Chavez, Elizabeth; Olson, Alex; Smith, Erika L.; Baird, Lillia A.; Korkmaz, Filiz; Urick, Patricia; Sagar, Manish; Berrigan, Jacob L.; Gummuluru, Suryaram; Corley, Ronald B.; Quillen, Karen; Belkina, Anna C.; Mostoslavsky, Gustavo; Rifkin, Ian R.; Kataria, Yachana; Cappione, Amedeo J.; Gao, Wenda; Lin, Nina H.; Bhadelia, Nahid; Snyder-Cappione, Jennifer E.",Front Immunol,324,20

Integration of this data with viral ChIRP-MS data from three other positive-sense RNA viruses defined pan-viral and SARS-CoV-2-specific host interactions. Functional interrogation of these factors with a genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed that the vast majority of viral RNA-binding proteins protect the host from virus-induced cell death, and we identified known and novel anti-viral proteins that regulate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Finally, our RNA-centric approach demonstrated a physical connection between SARS-CoV-2 RNA and host mitochondria, which we validated with functional and electron microscopy data, providing new insights into a more general virus-specific protein logic for mitochondrial interactions. Altogether, these data provide a comprehensive catalogue of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-host protein interactions, which may inform future studies to understand the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis, as well as nominate host pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic benefit.","Flynn, Ryan A.; Belk, Julia A.; Qi, Yanyan; Yasumoto, Yuki; Schmitz, Cameron O.; Mumbach, Maxwell R.; Limaye, Aditi; Wei, Jin; Alfajaro, Mia Madel; Parker, Kevin R.; Chang, Howard Y.; Horvath, Tamas L.; Carette, Jan E.; Bertozzi, Carolyn; Wilen, Craig B.; Satpathy, Ansuman T.",bioRxiv,324,20

Although the mutation rate is limited, recently introduced mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to alter viral fitness. In addition to amino acid changes, mutations could affect RNA secondary structure critical to viral life cycle, or interfere with sequences targeted by host miRNAs. We have analysed subsets of genomes from SARS-CoV-2 isolates from around the globe and show that several mutations introduce changes in Watson–Crick pairing, with resultant changes in predicted secondary structure. Filtering to targets matching miRNAs expressed in SARS-CoV-2-permissive host cells, we identified ten separate target sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome; three of these targets have been lost through conserved mutations. A genomic site targeted by the highly abundant miR-197-5p, overexpressed in patients with cardiovascular disease, is lost by a conserved mutation. Our results are compatible with a model that SARS-CoV-2 replication within the human host is constrained by host miRNA defences. The impact of these and further mutations on secondary structures, miRNA targets or potential splice sites offers a new context in which to view future SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and a potential platform for engineering conditional attenuation to vaccine development, as well as providing a better understanding of viral tropism and pathogenesis.","Hosseini Rad SM, Ali; McLellan, Alexander D.",Int J Mol Sci,324,1

Using data on a large cross section of countries, we empirically test whether and to what extent the incidence and severity of disease epidemics affect the prevalence of entrepreneurship. The results show that both the occurrence and severity of epidemics spur entrepreneurial activity.

Empirical consensus has long held that telework reduces overall travel, but several updated studies now suggest the opposite. Meanwhile, telework has steadily increased in many countries, and few studies have examined contexts where regular teleworkers have grown to form an early majority. We study how telework influences daily travel in such a context, namely, Sweden from 2011 to 2016. Using representative micro-data from the Swedish National Travel Survey, this study also captures travel behaviour during the defined period when the telework was actually practiced, distinguishing different telework arrangements and analysing a range of travel behavioral outcomes. We conclude that telework leads to reduced travel demand, more use of active transport modes, and congestion relief. Important differences between full- and part-day teleworkers are also highlighted, stressing the importance of understanding telework as a diversified coping strategy for organizing the spatiotemporality of everyday life.","Elldér, Erik",J Transp Geogr,324,33

The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19: a public health emergency of international concern. Having into consideration the lockdown and quarantine situation, we decided to do evaluate the current emotional state on the general population with a web-based survey in English and in Spanish, which was considered a useful and fast method that could help us determine how people perceived stress and worry due to the COVID-19. Methods: The survey included a 22 items, gathering information in 3 sections: Sociodemographic data, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) by Cohen and additional queries that assessed the current worry and change of behaviours due to this pandemic. Results: The survey received 891 respondents from 25 countries, from March 17 to 23rd, 2020. The mean age of the respondents was 43.8 (14.2) years old, and more than two thirds were women. 12.8% were health personnel.The mean of the PSS-10 score was 17.4 (6.4). Significantly higher scores were observed among women, youth, students, and among those who expressed concern and those who perceived increased susceptibility to the COVID-19. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between the health professionals and the general population. A good correlation was observed between mean relative volume (RSV) of the las 14 days and the number of cases reported (rho = 0.68, p <0.001) and deaths (rho = 0.51, p <0.001). Discussion: With these results we describe an increase of affective symptoms due to the COVID-19. This pandemic is raising the anxiety levels. The findings of our study show the affective and cognitive alterations people are going through. This survey is the first attempt to measure the psychological consequences this pandemic is having, in order to be able to later be able to provide the support to confront this global issue, addressing the mental health care that will be needed.","Limcaoco, R.

This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in combination with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin on early virological response (EVR) in chronic hepatitis C Egyptian patients. Naïve 120 Egyptian patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection were divided into two groups. Group 1 have administered the standard of care therapy (pegylated interferon alfa‐2a plus ribavirin) for 12 weeks, (n = 60). Group 2 have administered hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care therapy for 12 weeks, (n = 60). Therapeutics included hydroxychloroquine (200 mg) oral twice daily, peginterferon alfa‐2a (160 μg) subcutaneous once weekly and oral weight‐based ribavirin (1000–1200 mg/day). Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. The percentage of early virological response was significantly more in patients given the triple therapy than in patients given the standard of care [54/60 (90%) vs. 43/60 (71.7%); P = 0.011; respectively]. Biochemical response at week 12 was also significantly higher in patients given the triple therapy compared with the standard of care [58/60 (96.7%) vs. 42/60 (70%); P < 0.001; respectively]. Along the study, the observed adverse events were mild and similar across treatment groups. Addition of hydroxychloroquine to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin improves the rate of early virological and biochemical responses in chronic hepatitis C Egyptian patients without an increase in adverse events.

Italy registered the third highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world and the second highest in Europe. An anonymous online survey composed of 40 questions has been sent to dentists practicing in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia, one of the areas in Italy most affected by COVID-19. The survey was aimed at highlighting the practical and emotional consequences of COVID-19 emergence on daily clinical practice. Specifically, it assessed dentists’ behavioral responses, emotions and concerns following the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic restrictive measures introduced by the Italian national administrative order of 10 March 2020 (DM-10M20), as well as the dentists’ perception of infection likelihood for themselves and patients. Furthermore, the psychological impact of COVID-19 was assessed by means of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 test (GAD-7), that measures the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms. Using local dental associations (ANDI-Associazione Nazionale Dentisti Italiani, CAO-Commissione Albo Odontoiatri) lists, the survey was sent by email to all dentists in the district of Modena and Reggio Emilia (874 practitioners) and was completed by 356 of them (40%). All dental practitioners closed or reduced their activity to urgent procedures, 38.2% prior to and 61.8% after the DM-10M20. All reported a routinely use of the most common protective personal equipment (PPE), but also admitted that the use of PPE had to be modified during COVID-19 pandemic. A high percentage of patients canceled their previous appointments after the DM-10M20. Almost 85% of the dentists reported being worried of contracting the infection during clinical activity. The results of the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) evaluation showed that 9% of respondents reported a severe anxiety. To conclude, the COVID-19 emergency is having a highly negative impact on the activity of dentists practicing in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia. All respondents reported practice closure or strong activity reduction. The perception of this negative impact was accompanied by feelings of concern (70.2%), anxiety (46.4%) and fear (42.4%). The majority of them (89.6%) reported concerns about their professional future and the hope for economic measures to help dental practitioners.","Consolo, Ugo; Bellini, Pierantonio; Bencivenni, Davide; Iani, Cristina; Checchi, Vittorio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,324,20

Design Cross‐sectional study. Methods Faecal samples from 84 Australian dairy and dairy beef properties (597 samples) were screened for rotavirus and coronavirus using real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, for Salmonella spp. using selective enrichment faecal culture, and for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (K99) and Cryptosporidium parvum using a commercial enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. A logistic regression with random effects model was used to compare prevalence of pathogens in dairy and dairy beef operations. Results Enteric pathogens were isolated from 97.6% of outbreaks and 95.0% of samples. Rotavirus was the most common pathogen identified (477/597, 79.9%) followed by C. parvum (349/597, 58.5%), Salmonella spp. (142/597, 23.8%), coronavirus (129/597, 21.6%) and E. coli K99 (104/597, 17.4%). Multiple pathogens were identified on 96.4% of farms and from 71.0% of samples. Samples from dairy beef properties were more likely to have multiple pathogens than dairy properties (P < 0.05), whereas rotavirus and Salmonella spp. were more likely to be identified in samples collected from dairy beef than dairy properties (P < 0.05). Conclusion Most outbreaks of calf diarrhoea in dairy and dairy beef operations involve multiple pathogens. Rotavirus and C. parvum were the most frequently identified pathogens across production systems. Salmonella spp. and rotavirus were more frequently identified in dairy beef operations.","Izzo, MM; Kirkland, PD; Mohler, VL; Perkins, NR; Gunn, AA; House, JK",Aust Vet J,324,15

To control this virus, vaccine design becomes imperative. In this study, potential epitopes-based vaccine candidates were explored. Six hundred (6 0 0) genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the viPR database to generate CD8(+) T-cell, CD4+ T-cell and linear B-cell epitopes which were screened for antigenicity, immunogenicity and non-allergenicity. The results of this study provide 19 promising candidate CD8(+) T-cell epitopes that strongly overlap with 8 promising B-cells epitopes. Another 19 CD4(+) T-cell epitopes were also identified that can induce IFN-γ and IL-4 cytokines. The most conserved MHC-I and MHC-II for both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell epitopes are HLA-A*02:06 and HLA-DRB1*01:01 respectively. These epitopes also bound to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). The population coverage of the conserved Major Histocompatibility Complex Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) for both CD8(+) T-cell and CD4(+) T-cell ranged from 65.6% to 100%. The detailed analysis of the potential epitope-based vaccine and their mapping to the complete COVID-19 genome reveals that they are predominantly found in the location of the surface (S) and membrane (M) glycoproteins suggesting the potential involvement of these structural proteins in the immunogenic response and antigenicity of the virus. Since the majority of the potential epitopes are located on M protein, the design of multi-epitope vaccine with the structural protein is highly promising though the whole M protein could also serve as a viable epitope for the development of an attenuated vaccine.

Laboratory test results are an important basis for clinicians to determine patient condition and formulate treatment plans. METHODS: Fifty-two thousand six hundred forty-four laboratory test results with continuous values of adult inpatients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized in the Fifth Hospital in Wuhan between 16 January 2020 and 18 March 2020 were compiled. The first and last test results were compared between survivors and non-survivors with variance test or Welch test. Laboratory test variables with significant differences were then included in the temporal change analysis. RESULTS: Among 94 laboratory test variables in 82 survivors and 25 non-survivors with COVID-19, white blood cell count, neutrophil count/percentage, mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, platelet-large cell percentage, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, fibrin (ogen) degradation product, middle fluorescent reticulocyte percentage, immature reticulocyte fraction, lactate dehydrogenase were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and lymphocyte count/percentage, monocyte percentage, eosinophil percentage, prothrombin activity, low fluorescent reticulocyte percentage, plasma carbon dioxide, total calcium, prealbumin, total protein, albumin, albumin-globulin ratio, cholinesterase, total cholesterol, nonhigh-density/low-density/small-dense-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly decreased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P < 0.05), in both first and last tests. Prothrombin time, prothrombin international normalized ratio, nucleated red blood cell count/percentage, high fluorescent reticulocyte percentage, plasma uric acid, plasma urea nitrogen, cystatin C, sodium, phosphorus, magnesium, myoglobin, creatine kinase (isoenzymes), aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, triglyceride were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and eosinophil count, basophil percentage, platelet count, thrombocytocrit, antithrombin III, red blood cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, total carbon dioxide, acidity-basicity, actual bicarbonate radical, base excess in the extracellular fluid compartment, estimated glomerular filtration rate, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1/ B were significantly decreased in non-survivors compared with survivors (P < 0.05), only in the last tests. Temporal changes in 26 variables, such as lymphocyte count/percentage, neutrophil count/percentage, and platelet count, were obviously different between survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: By the comprehensive usage of the laboratory markers with different temporal changes, patients with a high risk of COVID-19-associated death or progression from mild to severe disease might be identified, allowing for timely targeted treatment.

The processes explaining these age differences remain unclear. Intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulation play an important role in psycho-social adjustment and develop across the lifespan. This study investigated whether differences in COVID-19-related adjustment disorder symptoms can be explained by age-differences in rumination in a multi-national sample. Furthermore, linguistic indicators of ruminative processing were examined with reference to age. METHODS: N = 1401 participants (from USA, UK, Switzerland, Germany, aged 18-88) completed an online survey and a writing task. Measures included brooding, co-brooding, adjustment disorder symptoms, and language indicators of negative self- and communal-focus . RESULTS: Older participants reported less adjustment disorder symptoms which was mediated by less (co-)brooding. Participants reporting more (co-)brooding wrote about COVID-19 more negatively. While in younger adults more self-focus was associated with higher ruminative brooding, in older adults it was associated with less brooding. CONCLUSION: These findings contribute to a better understanding of regulatory mechanisms that help explain age differences in mental health. They warrant further research considering age-related differences, as our results suggest not only more adaptive emotion regulation as resilience factor in older individuals but also different qualities of self-focus while processing stressful events.","Dworakowski, Olenka; Huber, Zilla M; Meier, Tabea; Boyd, Ryan L; Horn, Andrea B",Aging Ment Health,324,16

Sixty herds with a herd size of ≥160 cows were visited once between December 2005 and March 2006. Thirty herds were known to have low mortality (LM) and 30 were known high mortality herds (HM). Upon the visit, data about housing and management was collected from interviews with personnel responsible for the calves. The herd status regarding the calves’ passive transfer (total protein), levels of α-tocopherol, β-carotene and retinol, and excretion of faecal pathogens (Cryptosporidium spp., Escherichia coli F5, rota and corona virus) was evaluated based on targeted sampling of high risk calf groups; in each herd, blood and faecal samples were collected from calves 1–7 and 1–14 days old, respectively. Similarly, the herd status regarding clinical respiratory disease in calves and history of respiratory virus exposure was evaluated based on lung auscultations and blood samplings of calves 60–90 days old. The median calf mortality risk (in calves 1–90 days of age) among HM herds was 9% (Range: 6–24%) and among LM herds 1% (Range: 0–2%). LM and HM herds were compared using five logistic regression models, covering potential risk factors within different areas: “Disease susceptibility”, “Factors affecting the gastrointestinal tract”, “Factors related to transmission of infectious disease”, “Hygiene” and “Labour management”. The percentage of calves, 1–7 days old, with inadequate serum concentrations of α-tocopherol and β-carotene were significantly higher in HM herds compared to LM herds and also associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR = 1.02; p = 0.023 and OR = 1.05; p = 0.0028, respectively). The variable “Average number of faecal pathogens in the sampled target group” was significantly associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR = 4.65; p = 0.015), with a higher average in HM herds. The percentage of calves with diarrhoea treated with antibiotics was significantly higher in HM herds and was associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR = 1.08; p = 0.021). The median age at death of calves in the age interval 1–90 days that died during a one-year period was significantly lower among HM herds (13 days) than in LM herds (24 days) (p = 0.0013) The results indicate that gastrointestinal disorders may be an important cause of calf mortality in large Swedish dairy herds.

Water absorption and water flow tests were executed over a healing period spanning 6 months to assess the sealing efficiency, and the crack width reduction with time was monitored. High variability was reported for both reference (REF) and healing-addition (ADD) series affecting the reproducibility of cracking. However, within each lab, the crack width creation was repeatable. ADD reported larger crack widths. The latter influenced the observed healing making direct comparisons across labs prone to errors. Water absorption tests highlighted were susceptible to application errors. Concurrently, the potential of water flow tests as a facile method for assessment of healing performance was shown across all labs. Overall, the importance of repeatability and reproducibility of testing methods is highlighted in providing a sound basis for incorporation of self-healing concepts in practical applications.","Litina, Chrysoula; Bumanis, Girts; Anglani, Giovanni; Dudek, Marta; Maddalena, Riccardo; Amenta, Maria; Papaioannou, Stamatoula; Pérez, Gloria; García Calvo, José Luis; Asensio, Eloy; Beltrán Cobos, Rubén; Tavares Pinto, Fabiano; Augonis, Algirdas; Davies, Robert; Guerrero, Ana; Sánchez Moreno, Mercedes; Stryszewska, Teresa; Karatasios, Ioannis; Tulliani, Jean-Marc; Antonaci, Paola; Bajare, Diana; Al-Tabbaa, Abir",Materials (Basel),324,23

Less than one year later, the 2019 ESC/EAS Dyslipidemia Guideline was published. While both provide important recommendations for managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk through lipid management, differences exist. Prior to the publication of both guidelines, important randomized clinical trial data emerged on non-statin lipid lowering therapy and ASCVD risk reduction. To illustrate important differences in guideline recommendations, we use this data to help answer three key questions: 1) Are ASCVD event rates similar in high-risk primary and stable secondary prevention? 2) Does imaging evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis justify aggressive use of statin and non-statin therapy (if needed) to reduce LDL-C levels below 55 ​mg/dL as recommended in the European Guideline? 3) Do LDL-C levels below 70 ​mg/dL achieve a large absolute risk reduction in secondary ASCVD prevention? The US guideline prioritizes both the added efficacy and cost implications of non-statin therapy, which limits intensive therapy to individuals with the highest risk of ASCVD. The European approach broadens the eligibility criteria by incorporating goals of therapy in both primary and secondary prevention. The current cost and access constraints of healthcare worldwide, especially amidst a COVID-19 pandemic, makes the European recommendations more challenging to implement. By restricting non-statin therapy to a subgroup of high- and, in particular, very high-risk individuals, the US guideline provides primary and secondary ASCVD prevention recommendations that are more affordable and attainable. Ultimately, finding a common ground for both guidelines rests on our ability to design trials that assess cost-effectiveness in addition to efficacy and safety.","Feldman, David I.; Michos, Erin D.; Stone, Neil J.; Gluckman, Ty J.; Cainzos-Achirica, Miguel; Virani, Salim S.; Blumenthal, Roger S.",Am J Prev Cardiol,324,16

This has included doubling or trebling intensive care (ICU) capacity within hospitals, augmenting this with Nightingale Hospitals, cancelling all non-emergency surgery and redeploying staff and equipment to focus on a single disease. At the same time, government and population efforts have - through social distancing then lockdown- successfully flattened the epidemic curve and so reduced demand. Together, these actions have enabled treatment of all those needing hospital care for COVID-19 and avoided the unfettered increase in mortality that would have accompanied an overwhelmed healthcare service.","Cook, T.

What is more, few studies have focused on the gender differences in mental health problems (MHPs) among HCWs during such an outbreak. Thus, the current study investigated the prevalence and gender differences of various MHPs among HCWs in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. This nationwide survey was conducted online from January 29 to February 3, 2020. General information was collected by questions about socio-demographics, work-related factors, and living situations. Depressive, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and the Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. Among the 2,198 contacted HCWs, 1,563 (71.1%) responded with valid data, of whom 1,293 (82.7%) were females. The prevalences of depressive, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms in participants were 50.7%, 44.7%, 52.5%, and 36.1%, respectively. Female HCWs had significantly higher scores in all four scales (p <0.001) and higher prevalences in all MHPs involved (range, odds ratio [OR] 1.55–1.97). After adjusting for potential confounders, female HCWs still had higher risks for all MHPs involved than males (range, adjusted OR 1.36–1.96). HCWs present high prevalences of depressive, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, female HCWs are more vulnerable to all MHPs involved. These findings highlight the need for timely, special care and support for HCWs during the outbreak, especially for females.","Liu, Shuai; Yang, Lulu; Zhang, Chenxi; Xu, Yan; Cai, Lidan; Ma, Simeng; Wang, Ying; Cai, Zhongxiang; Du, Hui; Li, Ruiting; Kang, Lijun; Zheng, Huirong; Liu, Zhongchun; Zhang, Bin",J Psychiatr Res,324,13

New-generation vessel sealing systems like LigaSure can cut and seal vascular structures and tissues. The aim of this study was to retrospectively compare hysterectomies performed with traditional instruments and those performed with LigaSure instruments to determine the possible advantages with the latter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with placenta percreta who underwent elective cesarean hysterectomy by the same surgeon were divided into two groups based on the type of instruments used. Group 1, the standard conventional hysterectomy group, operated with conventional instruments for cutting and tying; and Group 2, the LigaSure hysterectomy group, operated with the new-generation bipolar sealing and cutting instruments. The groups were retrospectively compared for bleeding, operating time, and complications. RESULTS: In Group 2, the operating time, intraoperative and total transfused erythrocyte suspension units, total fluid in the drain, and total hospital stay were lower than in Group 1 (p < .05), as was the need for internal iliac artery ligation (p = .013). The complication rates were similar between the two groups (p > .05). CONCLUSION: The use of LigaSure open instruments in cesarean hysterectomies in patients with placenta percreta may reduce operating times and the amount of bleeding.","Bakacak, Zeyneb; Bakacak, Murat; Uzkar, Aytekin; Yazar, Fatih Mehmet; Yaylali, Asli; Boran, Ömer Faruk; Güzin, Kadir",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,324,16

However, in practice, a fast, tall, and heavy-weighted mobile robot using optimal omnidirectional wheels may also need a suspension system in order to reduce the presence of vibrations and oscillations in the upper part of the mobile robot. This paper empirically evaluates whether a heavy-weighted omnidirectional mobile robot can take advantage of its passive suspension system in order to also use non-optimal or suboptimal omnidirectional wheels with a non-optimized inner gap. The main comparative advantages of the proposed suboptimal omnidirectional wheel are its low manufacturing cost and the possibility of taking advantage of the gap to operate outdoors. The experimental part of this paper compares the vibrations generated by the motion system of a versatile mobile robot using optimal and suboptimal omnidirectional wheels. The final conclusion is that a suboptimal wheel with a large gap produces comparable on-board vibration patterns while maintaining the traction and increasing the grip on non-perfect planar surfaces.","Palacín, Jordi; Martínez, David; Rubies, Elena; Clotet, Eduard",Sensors (Basel),324,2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey using a previously validated questionnaire was used to assess the awareness and knowledge levels of COVID-19 in this study, which was distributed via various online platforms to include as many participants as possible. The study targeted medical doctors, dentists, medical students, and dental students from the GCC region. Participants were at least 18 years old, voluntarily consented to complete the questionnaire, and were assured that their responses would remain anonymous. Permission was obtained using a previously validated and applied questionnaire to assess their level of awareness and knowledge regarding COVID-19. To compare the proportional responses between groups in descriptive statistics, a proportion Z-test was used to find any significant differences, with a statistical significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 1621 participants responded to our questionnaire. Almost two-thirds of the respondents were female (64.4%), and the majority were less than 25 years old (67.2%). Dentists accounted for 12.6% of the total population, and their clinical experience ranged from 0.25 to 52 years (median: 3 years, IQR: 1–10 years). Meanwhile, medical doctors accounted for 24.5% of the responses, and their clinical experience ranged from 0 to 50 years (median: 13 years, IQR: 3–23 years). Among the dental students, 42.3% were in the pre-clinical years, while 57.7% were in the clinical years of study. However, among medical students, 57.5% were in the pre-clinical years, while 42.5% were in the clinical years of study.

Different risk factors for schizophrenia increase oxidative stress phenomena raising the risk of developing psychosis. Oxidative stress induced by first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol significantly contributes to the development of extrapyramidal side effects. Haloperidol also exerts neurotoxic effects by decreasing antioxidant enzyme levels then worsening pro-oxidant events. Opposite to haloperidol, second-generation antipsychotics (or atypical antipsychotics) such as risperidone, clozapine, and olanzapine exert a strong antioxidant activity in experimental models of schizophrenia by rescuing the antioxidant system, with an increase in superoxide dismutase and glutathione (GSH) serum levels. Second-generation antipsychotics also improve the antioxidant status and reduce lipid peroxidation in schizophrenic patients. Interestingly, second-generation antipsychotics, such as risperidone, paliperidone, and in particular clozapine, reduce oxidative stress induced by microglia overactivation, decreasing the production of microglia-derived free radicals, finally protecting neurons against microglia-induced oxidative stress. Further, long-term clinical studies are needed to better understand the link between oxidative stress and the clinical response to antipsychotic drugs and the therapeutic potential of antioxidants to increase the response to antipsychotics.","Caruso, Giuseppe; Grasso, Margherita; Fidilio, Annamaria; Tascedda, Fabio; Drago, Filippo; Caraci, Filippo",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),324,5

While the challenges of conducting research in high-prevalence countries are well published, there is a paucity from low COVID-19 countries. METHODS: A PRISMA guided systematic review was conducted using the databases Ovid-Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science to identify relevant articles discussing ethical issues relating to research in low prevalence COVID-19 countries. RESULTS: The search yielded 133 original articles of which only 2 fit the inclusion criteria and aim, with neither specific to low prevalence. Most of the available literature focused on clinical management and resource allocation related to high prevalence countries. These results will be discussed under the ethical dimensions of equity, individual liberty, privacy and confidentiality, proportionality, public protection, provision of care, reciprocity, stewardship and trust.. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic review failed to identify articles relating to COVID-19 research ethics, specific to low prevalence countries. It shows that there is a significant gap in the literature that warrants further investigation. Common ethical principles were used to present a distinct set of challenges experienced by a country with a low prevalence of COVID-19.

This study aims to examine the current hand hygiene behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, post pandemic behavior intentions, and the relationship between behavior, psychosocial and contextual factors. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 28 May to 12 June 2020, with 896 valid responses obtained from Indonesian citizens over 18 years old. The survey questions included demographic characteristics, individual practices, risk perceptions, attitude, norm factors and ability factors related to hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive analysis, chi square and multiple logistic regression tests were used to analyse the data. The results showed that 82.32% of female respondents and 73.37% male respondents reported handwashing practice 8 times or more per day during COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who perceived themselves at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (OR 7.08, 2.26–22.17), had less negative perception toward the practice (OR 1.93, 1.32–2.82), perceived handwashing as an effective preventive measure (OR 1.77, 1.23–2.54), were female (OR 1.71, 1.21–2.41), perceived a more supportive norm (OR 1.68, 1.15–2.44) and noticed more barriers in access to handwashing facilities (OR 1.57, 1.05–2.36) were more likely to engage in hand hygiene practice more frequently during the pandemic. In conclusion, the majority of respondents did increase their frequency of hand hygiene practices during COVID-19 pandemic. In line with previous studies in other pandemic contexts, sex, perceived susceptibility and effectiveness are important predictors of hand hygiene practices, which are similar to findings from previous studies in other pandemic contexts. Addressing social norm related to the perceived hand hygiene practices of friends and important people is a potential health promotion strategy by creating hand hygiene norms in the community.","Dwipayanti, Ni Made Utami; Lubis, Dinar Saurmauli; Harjana, Ngakan Putu Anom",Front Public Health,324,1

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed demographic, laboratory and clinical indicators as predictors for severe courses of COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, MedRvix and bioRvix) for publications from December 2019 to May 31(st) 2020. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled odds ratios and differences of medians between (1) patients admitted to ICU versus non-ICU patients and (2) patients who died versus those who survived. We adapted an existing Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool for outcome studies. RESULTS: Of 6,702 unique citations, we included 88 articles with 69,762 patients. There was concern for bias across all articles included. Age was strongly associated with mortality with a difference of medians (DoM) of 13.15 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.37 to 14.94) between those who died and those who survived. We found a clinically relevant difference between non-survivors and survivors for C-reactive protein (CRP; DoM 69.10, CI 50.43 to 87.77), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; DoM 189.49, CI 155.00 to 223.98), cardiac troponin I (cTnI; DoM 21.88, CI 9.78 to 33.99) and D-Dimer (DoM 1.29mg/L, CI 0.9 – 1.69).

A specificity of less than one implies occurrence of false positive cases, which becomes particularly relevant with an increased number of tests. The recent increase in cases in Bavaria could therefore be smaller than reported. However, an increase in case counts can still be seen from Mid-July until September 2020. The additional consideration of a sensitivity less than one, i.e., the occurrence of false negative tests, results in an epidemic curve in which the daily case counts are increased by a constant factor, but the structure of the curve does not change considerably.","Guenther, F.; Bender, A.; HoÌhle, M.; Wildner, M.; KuÌchenhoff, H.",,324,28

Adjusted structural equation model showed that illness perceptions toward COVID-19 had significant direct effect on their adherence to precautionary measures (unstandardized β = 0.50, [95% CI, 0.28, 0.80], p = 0.001), and indirect effects through avoidance-based coping (β = −0.10 [95% CI, −0.26, −0.01], p = 0.016) and self-efficacy (β = −0.10, [95% CI, −0.18, −0.01], p = 0.025). These results imply that apart from emphasizing the health hazards of a novel infectious disease, an effective public health intervention and crisis communication should address avoidance-based coping and self-efficacy of the public in adherence to precautionary measures for COVID-19.","Chong, Yuen Yu; Chien, Wai Tong; Cheng, Ho Yu; Chow, Ka Ming; Kassianos, Angelos P.; Karekla, Maria; Gloster, Andrew",Int J Environ Res Public Health,324,1

This study aims to estimate the amount of face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, thereby expressing our concerns about waste management and plastic pollution and calling on appropriate solid waste management policies and governments to take the necessary measures to formulate their strategies at all levels. In this context, the number of masks in an area of 1 km(2) in 3 different cities was determined theoretically and experimentally. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were also used to evaluate plastic polymer characteristics of the single-use face mask. It was determined that the three cities produce roughly 10 tons of face masks in a day. With the increasing use of single-use plastics, the impact of face masks on microplastic pollution is of great concern. Although studies on the recovery of disposable masks continue, the level is insufficient. Therefore, studies to be carried out on technologies that will enable the repeated use of masks are important.

It has been observed that numerous viral proteins can oligomerize and form structures known as viroporins that alter the permeability of membranes. Previous findings have identified such proteins in cells infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a member of the same family that Dengue virus (DENV) belongs to (Flaviviridae). In the present work, we investigated whether the small hydrophobic DENV protein NS2B serves a viroporin function. METHODS: We cloned the DENV NS2B sequence and expressed it in a bacterial expression system. Subsequently, we evaluated the effect of DENV NS2B on membranes when NS2B was overexpressed, measured bacterial growth restriction, and evaluated changes of permeability to hygromycin. The NS2B protein was purified by affinity chromatography, and crosslinking assays were performed to determine the presence of oligomers. Hemolysis assays and transmission electron microscopy were performed to identify structures involved in permeability changes. RESULTS: The DENV-2 NS2B protein showed similitude with the JEV viroporin. The DENV-2 NS2B protein possessed the ability to change the membrane permeability in bacteria, to restrict bacterial cell growth, and to enable membrane permeability to hygromycin B. The NS2B protein formed trimers that could participate in cell lysis and generate organized structures on eukaryotes membranes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the DENV-2 NS2B viral protein is capable of oligomerizing and organizing to form pore-like structures in different lipid environments, thereby modifying the permeability of cell membranes.","León-Juárez, Moisés; Martínez-Castillo, Macario; Shrivastava, Gaurav; García-Cordero, Julio; Villegas-Sepulveda, Nicolás; Mondragón-Castelán, Mónica; Mondragón-Flores, Ricardo; Cedillo-Barrón, Leticia",Virol J,324,26

This two-phase survey evaluated PPE preparedness (adherence to Ministry of Health India (MoH) PPE-recommendations; HCW-training; PPE-inventory; PPE-breach management) in Indian intensive care units (ICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The phase 1 survey was distributed electronically to intensivists from 481 Indian hospitals between March 25, 2020, and April 06, 2020, as part of a multinational survey. Phase 2 was repeated in 320 Indian hospitals between April 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020. RESULTS: Response rate was 25% from 22 states. PPE practice varied between states and between private, government, and medical colleges. Between phase 1 and phase 2, all aspects of PPE training improved: donning/doffing 43% vs 66%, respectively; p value <0.01); safe waste disposal practices (38% vs 52%; p value = 0.09); intubation training (18% vs 31%; p value = 0.05); and transport (18% vs 31%; p value = 0.05). Perception of confidence for adequate PPE-training improved from 39 to 53% (p value = 0.26). In all, 47 to 60% ICUs adhered to MoH recommendations. Wearing N95-masks at all times increased from 47 to 60% (p value = 0.89). Very few ICUs provided quantitative/qualitative N95 masks fit testing (12% vs 29%; p value <0.01). Low-cost practices like “buddy-system” for donning-doffing (27% vs 44%; p value = 0.02) and showering after PPE breach (10% vs 8%; p value = 0.63) were underutilized. There was reluctance to PPE reuse. In all, 71% were unaware/diffident about PPE inventory. CONCLUSION: Despite interstate variability, most ICUs conformed to MoH recommendations. This survey conducted during initial pandemic phase demonstrated improved PPE preparedness uniformly across India with scope for further improvement. We suggest implementation of quality improvement measures to improve pandemic preparedness and minimize HCW infection rates, focused on regular PPE training, buddy system, and PPE-breach management.

In this investigation, we aimed to evaluate ADAMTS13 activity, von Willebrand factor level (VWF:Ag), and the corresponding ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag ratio, in patients with COVID‐19 and for associations with disease progression and acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with COVID‐19 were enrolled in this prospective, observational study. ADAMTS13 activity and VWF:Ag were measured at index ED visit. The primary endpoint was severe AKI defined by KDIGO stage 2 + 3 criteria, while the secondary endpoint was peak 30‐day COVID‐19 severity. RESULTS: A total of 52 adult COVID‐19 patients were enrolled. Overall, we observed that 23.1% of the cohort had a relative deficiency in ADAMTS13 activity, while 80.8% had elevated VWF:Ag. The ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower in patients with severe AKI (P = .002) and those who developed the severe form of COVID‐19 (P = .020). The ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag ratio was negatively correlated with age (P < .001) and LDH (P < .001), while positively correlated with hemoglobin (P = .041). After controlling for confounders, a one‐unit increase in ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio was associated with 20% decreased odds of severe AKI. CONCLUSION: A low ADAMTS13 activity:VWF:Ag ratio at ED presentation is associated with progression to severe COVID‐19 disease and severe AKI, with a pattern suggestive of a secondary microangiopathy. Further interventional studies should be conducted to assess the restoration of ADAMTS13:VWF:Ag ratio in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19.","Henry, Brandon Michael; Benoit, Stefanie W.; de Oliveira, Maria Helena Santos; Lippi, Giuseppe; Favaloro, Emmanuel J.; Benoit, Justin L.",Int J Lab Hematol,324,21

In the critically ill, the prognostic value of hs-cTnT, however, remains to be assessed given that most previous studies have involved a case mix of non- and severely ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted, from March to May 2020, in three French intensive care units (ICUs), a multicenter retrospective cohort study to assess in-hospital mortality predictability of hs-cTnT levels in COVID-19 patients. Results: 111 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (68% of male, median age 67 (58–75) years old) were included. At ICU admission, the median Charlson Index, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II, and PaO(2)/FiO(2) were at 3 (2–5), 37 (27–48), and 140 (98–154), respectively, and the median hs-cTnT serum levels were at 16.0 (10.1–31.9) ng/L.

Based on initial data from the UK and later data from other countries, this variant was estimated to have a transmission fitness advantage of around 40–80 % (Volz et al., 2021; Leung et al., 2021; Davies et al., 2021). AIM: This study aims to estimate the transmission fitness advantage and the effective reproductive number of B.1.1.7 through time based on data from Switzerland. METHODS: We generated whole genome sequences from 11.8 % of all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Switzerland between 14 December 2020 and 11 March 2021. Based on these data, we determine the daily frequency of the B.1.1.7 variant and quantify the variant’s transmission fitness advantage on a national and a regional scale. RESULTS: We estimate B.1.1.7 had a transmission fitness advantage of 43–52 % compared to the other variants circulating in Switzerland during the study period. Further, we estimate B.1.1.7 had a reproductive number above 1 from 01 January 2021 until the end of the study period, compared to below 1 for the other variants. Specifically, we estimate the reproductive number for B.1.1.7 was 1.24 [1.07–1.41] from 01 January until 17 January 2021 and 1.18 [1.06–1.30] from 18 January until 01 March 2021 based on the whole genome sequencing data. From 10 March to 16 March 2021, once B.1.1.7 was dominant, we estimate the reproductive number was 1.14 [1.00–1.26] based on all confirmed cases. For reference, Switzerland applied more non-pharmaceutical interventions to combat SARS-CoV-2 on 18 January 2021 and lifted some measures again on 01 March 2021. CONCLUSION: The observed increase in B.1.1.7 frequency in Switzerland during the study period is as expected based on observations in the UK. In absolute numbers, B.1.1.7 increased exponentially with an estimated doubling time of around 2–3.5 weeks. To monitor the ongoing spread of B.1.1.7, our plots are available online.","Chen, Chaoran; Nadeau, Sarah Ann; Topolsky, Ivan; Manceau, Marc; Huisman, Jana S.; Jablonski, Kim Philipp; Fuhrmann, Lara; Dreifuss, David; Jahn, Katharina; Beckmann, Christiane; Redondo, Maurice; Noppen, Christoph; Risch, Lorenz; Risch, Martin; Wohlwend, Nadia; Kas, Sinem; Bodmer, Thomas; Roloff, Tim; Stange, Madlen; Egli, Adrian; Eckerle, Isabella; Kaiser, Laurent; Denes, Rebecca; Feldkamp, Mirjam; Nissen, Ina; Santacroce, Natascha; Burcklen, Elodie; Aquino, Catharine; de Gouvea, Andreia Cabral; Moccia, Maria Domenica; Grüter, Simon; Sykes, Timothy; Opitz, Lennart; White, Griffin; Neff, Laura; Popovic, Doris; Patrignani, Andrea; Tracy, Jay; Schlapbach, Ralph; Dermitzakis, Emmanouil T.; Harshman, Keith; Xenarios, Ioannis; Pegeot, Henri; Cerutti, Lorenzo; Penet, Deborah; Blin, Anthony; Elies, Melyssa; Althaus, Christian L.; Beisel, Christian; Beerenwinkel, Niko; Ackermann, Martin; Stadler, Tanja",Epidemics,324,1

We investigated the protein and mRNA expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and proteinase TMPRSS2 in lungs from COPD patients and controls, and lung tissue from mice exposed acutely and chronically to CS. Also, we investigated the effects of CS exposure on SARS-CoV-2 infection in human bronchial epithelial cells. Methods In Cohort 1, ACE2-positive cells were quantified by immunostaining in FFPE sections from both central and peripheral airways. In Cohort 2, we quantified pulmonary ACE2 protein levels by immunostaining and ELISA, and both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels by RT-qPCR. In C57BL/6 WT mice exposed to air or CS for up to 6 months, pulmonary ACE2 protein levels were quantified by triple immunofluorescence staining and ELISA. The effects of CS exposure on SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated after 72hr in vitro infection of Calu-3 cells. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cells were fixed for IF staining with dsRNA-specific J2 monoclonal Ab, and cell lysates were harvested for WB of viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. Supernatants (SN) and cytoplasmic lysates were obtained to measure ACE2 levels by ELISA. Results In both human cohorts, ACE2 protein and mRNA levels were decreased in peripheral airways from COPD patients versus both smoker and NS controls, but similar in central airways. TMPRSS2 levels were similar across groups. Mice exposed to CS had decreased ACE2 protein levels in their bronchial and alveolar epithelia versus air-exposed mice exposed to 3 and 6 months of CS. In Calu3 cells in vitro, CS-treatment abrogated infection to levels below the limit of detection. Similar results were seen with WB for viral N protein, showing peak viral protein synthesis at 72hr. Conclusions ACE2 levels were decreased in both bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells from uninfected COPD patients versus controls, and from CS-exposed versus air-exposed mice. CS-pre-treatment did not affect ACE2 levels but potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in this in vitro model. These findings urge to further investigate the controversial effects of CS and COPD on SARS-CoV2 infection.","Tomchaney, M.; Contoli, M.; Mayo, J.; Baraldo, S.; Shuaizhi, L.; Cabel, CR.; Bull, DA.; Lick, S.; Malo, J.; Knoper, S.; Kim, SS.; Tram, J.; Rojas-Quintero, J.; Kraft, M.; Ledford, J.; Tesfaigzi, Y.; Martinez, F.D.; Thorne, C.

Building on global estimates suggesting that Peru is not on target to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 3.4, we estimated the contribution of various NCDs to the change in unconditional probability of dying from NCDs in 25 regions in Peru. METHODS: Using national death registries and census data, we estimated the unconditional probability of dying between ages 30 and 69 from any and from each of the following NCDs: cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated the contribution of each NCD to the change in the unconditional probability of dying from any of these NCDs between 2006 and 2016. RESULTS: The overall unconditional probability of dying improved for men (21.4%) and women (23.3%). Cancer accounted for 10.9% in men and 13.7% in women of the overall reduction; cardiovascular diseases also contributed substantially: 11.3% in men) and 9.8% in women. Consistently in men and women and across regions, diabetes moved in the opposite direction of the overall reduction in the unconditional probability of dying from any selected NCD. Diabetes contributed a rise in the unconditional probability of 3.6% in men and 2.1% in women. CONCLUSIONS: Although the unconditional probability of dying from any selected NCD has decreased, diabetes would prevent Peru from meeting international targets.

The cPass surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) has gained popularity globally as a dual application assay for: 1. Accurate SARS-CoV-2 population surveillance (seroprevalence) analysis and 2. Revealing the presence of antibodies that block and effectively neutralize the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain and the host cell ACE2 receptor in recovered or vaccinated individuals. This study describes an approach for accurate quantification of neutralizing antibodies using the cPass sVNT with an automated workflow on the Tecan EVO and Dynex Agility platforms that is applicable to other liquid handling systems. This methodology was used to assess the stability of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies between freeze/thaw and refrigerated sample storage conditions. Furthermore, a subset of twenty-five samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected/recovered individuals revealed a 600-fold difference in the neutralizing antibody response where low titers were represented in about half of the samples. Finally, pre- and post-vaccination samples were tested for neutralizing antibodies using the qualitative and semi-quantitative cPass sVNT protocols revealing undetectable or relatively low levels after the first vaccine dose and a decline in levels longitudinally over the months following the second dose. This wide range in neutralizing (blocking) antibodies from both natural infection and vaccination supports a differential immune response that may be attributed to several physiological and genetic factors underlining the potential for measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer levels post-vaccination to help ensure robust and prolonged immunity.","Taylor, Sean C.; Hurst, Beth; Martiszus, Ian; Hausman, Marvin S.; Sarwat, Samar; Schapiro, Jeffrey M.; Rowell, Sarah; Lituev, Alexander",Vaccine,324,30

The scale evaluates the emotional responses to COVID-19. To date, the FCV-19S has been translated and validated in about 20 languages and has been used in many published research. The current study aimed to validate the Polish version of the FCV-19S. METHOD: The FCV-19S was translated into Polish using forward- and back-translation. From May 15(th) to June 15(th) 2020, a total of 708 community members (Sample 1: 383 persons, 209 females, Sample 2: 325 persons, 198 females) participated in the online study. The participants were recruited using online advertisements in social media. Participation was anonymous, voluntary, and without compensation. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the one-factor structure of the FCV-19S. Then, measurement invariance was analyzed across samples, gender and age groups. To assess the validity of the scale, correlations between the FCV-19S and the remaining scales were computed. RESULTS: Internal consistency of the FCV-19S was good in both samples (Cronbach’s alpha 0.89 and 0.85). The CFA showed that the one-factor model fits the data well (RMSEA = 0.067, 90% CI [0.059–0.094], CFI = 0.977, TLI = 0.965, GFI = 0.986). The criteria for configural, metric, scalar and strict invariance were met for all models tested. The FCV-19S scores correlated significantly with age, subjective vulnerability to the disease, neuroticism, self-reported compliance with the pandemic measures, and three kinds of preventive behavior (i.e., social distancing, hand hygiene, and disinfecting things). CONCLUSION: The Polish version of the FCV-19S had a unidimensional structure, good reliability, and correlated as predicted with other variables. With the FCV-19S and the obtained results, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the government can gain more valuable information about people who may be at risk for negative psychological outcomes during the pandemic or who are not implementing protective behavior. The tool can be used in hospitals to quickly screen the level of fear in patients and minimize its severe adverse consequences.","Pilch, Irena; Kurasz, Zofia; Turska-Kawa, Agnieszka",PeerJ,324,5

However, combined throat/nasal sampling as a testing method has several advantages. We compared the combined throat/nasal sampling with nasopharyngeal sampling for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers suspected of COVID-19. METHODS: In 107 healthcare workers with symptoms of COVID-19, combined throat/nasal sampling and nasopharyngeal sampling was performed. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by RT-PCR targeting. RESULTS: A total of 80 healthcare workers (74.8%) tested negative with both sampling methods, and 25 healthcare workers (23.4%) tested positive with both sampling methods. There were two discrepant results with positive PCR in combined throat/nasal swabs and negative PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs (1.9%). The κ index for concordance between the 2 sampling methods was high (0.95). The median cycle threshold (Ct) value of PCR on nasopharyngeal samples was significantly lower than the Ct value of PCR on combined throat/nasal samples (19 (IQR 17–20) versus 21 (IQR 18–29) cycles, p value 0.01). CONCLUSION: Combined throat/nasal swabs yield a similar sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 as nasopharyngeal swabs and are a good alternative sampling method, despite a lower Ct value for the nasopharyngeal samples.","Vlek, A.

METHODS: The operating hours of Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) remained the same during the lockdown. We examined the number of consultations and STI at MSHC between January and June 2020 and stratified the data into pre-lockdown (3-February to 22-March), lockdown (23-March to 10-May) and post-lockdown (11-May to 28-June) with seven weeks in each period. Incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: The total number of consultations dropped from 7,818 in pre-lockdown to 4,652 during lockdown (IRR=0.60;95%CI:0.57-0.62) but increased to 5,347 in the post-lockdown period (IRR=1.15;95%CI:1.11-1.20). There was a 68% reduction in asymptomatic screening during lockdown (IRR=0.32; 95%CI:0.30-0.35) but it gradually increased in the post-lockdown period (IRR=1.59;95%CI:1.46-1.74). STI with milder symptoms showed a marked reduction, including non-gonococcal urethritis (IRR=0.60;95%CI:0.51-0.72), and candidiasis (IRR=0.61;95%CI:0.49-0.76) during lockdown compared with pre-lockdown. STI with more marked symptoms did not change significantly, including pelvic inflammatory disease (IRR=0.95;95%CI:0.61-1.47) and infectious syphilis (IRR=1.14;95%CI:0.73-1.77). There was no significant change in STI diagnoses in post-lockdown compared to lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The public appeared to be prioritising their attendance for sexual health services based on the urgency of their clinical conditions. This suggests that the effectiveness of clinical services in detecting, treating and preventing onward transmission of important symptomatic conditions is being mainly preserved despite large falls in absolute numbers of attendees.","Chow, Eric P F; Hocking, Jane S; Ong, Jason J; Phillips, Tiffany R; Fairey, Christopher K",Open Forum Infect Dis,324,24

These structures were first described over a century ago and originally termed “X-bodies,” as their function was not immediately appreciated. Whilst some inclusion bodies may represent cytopathic by-products of viral protein over-accumulation, X-bodies have emerged as virus “factories,” quasi-organelles that coordinate diverse viral infection processes such as replication, protein expression, evasion of host defenses, virion assembly, and intercellular transport. Accordingly, they are now generally referred to as viral replication complexes (VRCs). We previously used confocal fluorescence microscopy to unravel the complex structure of X-bodies produced by Potato virus X (PVX). Here we used 3D-structured illumination (3D-SIM) super-resolution microscopy to map the PVX X-body at a finer scale. We identify a previously unrecognized membrane structure induced by the PVX “triple gene block” (TGB) proteins, providing new insights into the complex interplay between virus and host within the X-body.","Linnik, Olga; Liesche, Johannes; Tilsner, Jens; Oparka, Karl J.",Front Plant Sci,324,24

This enzyme in its numerous isoforms and homologues, constitutes the quintessential offence and defence factors, in the form of surface proteins, secreted molecules, gut digestive enzymes, venom in specialised glands or plant latex, among other manifestations. Occurring as trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, collagenase, thrombin, subtilisin etc., it mediates a diverse array of functions, including pathological roles as inflammatory, coagulatory to haemorrhagic. This review emphasizes that despite the superficial differences in mechanisms, most health issues, be they infectious, allergic, metabolic, or neural have a common conduit. This enzyme, in its various glycosylated forms leads to signal misinterpretations, wreaking havoc. However, organisms are endowed with serine protease inhibitors which might restrain this ubiquitous yet deleterious enzyme.

In this study, transient IFITM expression vectors were used to investigate whether IFITMs inhibit feline foamy viral (FFV) replication and which step of viral replication is inhibited. In our studies, viral production was significantly reduced when cells were infected with FFV at almost same times such as −3, 0, or 3 h post-transfection with IFITM vector. However viral production was not reduced even though cells were infected with FFV at 3 or 6 days post-transfection when production of IFITM proteins was maximized. Considering that IFITM expression was maximized at 3 days post-transfection, the stage of viral replication inhibited by IFITM appears to be the late step of viral replication. Moreover, the viral Gag proteins detected in the virus-infected cell lysates were proportionally correlated with viral titer of the culture supernatants. Therefore, it is likely that IFITMs can restrict production of FFV at the late step of viral replication.","Kim, Jinsun; Shin, Cha-Gyun",Animal cells and systems,324,1

Particularly in health and medical research, Google Trends has been increasingly used over the last decade. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the search activity of pain-related parameters on Google Trends from among the most populated regions worldwide over a 3-year period from before the report of the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in these regions (January 2018) until December 2020. METHODS: Search terms from the following regions were used for the analysis: India, China, Europe, the United States, Brazil, Pakistan, and Indonesia. In total, 24 expressions of pain location were assessed. Search terms were extracted using the local language of the respective country. Python scripts were used for data mining. All statistical calculations were performed through exploratory data analysis and nonparametric Mann–Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Although the overall search activity for pain-related terms increased, apart from pain entities such as headache, chest pain, and sore throat, we observed discordant search activity. Among the most populous regions, pain-related search parameters for shoulder, abdominal, and chest pain, headache, and toothache differed significantly before and after the first officially confirmed COVID-19 cases (for all, P<.001). In addition, we observed a heterogenous, marked increase or reduction in pain-related search parameters among the most populated regions. CONCLUSIONS: As internet searches are a surrogate for public interest, we assume that our data are indicative of an increased incidence of pain after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as these increased incidences vary across geographical and anatomical locations, our findings could potentially facilitate the development of specific strategies to support the most affected groups.","Szilagyi, Istvan-Szilard; Ullrich, Torsten; Lang-Illievich, Kordula; Klivinyi, Christoph; Schittek, Gregor Alexander; Simonis, Holger; Bornemann-Cimenti, Helmar",J Med Internet Res,324,30

These challenges have led to the need for new approaches and technologies to reinforce the capacity of traditional surveillance systems for detecting emerging infectious diseases. In the last few years, the availability of novel web-based data sources has contributed substantially to infectious disease surveillance. This study explores the burgeoning field of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems by examining their current status, importance, and potential challenges. METHODS: A systematic review framework was applied to the search, screening, and analysis of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases to extensively review the English literature published between 2000 and 2015. Eleven surveillance systems were chosen for evaluation according to their high frequency of application. Relevant terms, including newly coined terms, development and classification of the surveillance systems, and various characteristics associated with the systems were studied. RESULTS: Based on a detailed and informative review of the 11 web-based infectious disease surveillance systems, it was evident that these systems exhibited clear strengths, as compared to traditional surveillance systems, but with some limitations yet to be overcome. The major strengths of the newly emerging surveillance systems are that they are intuitive, adaptable, low-cost, and operated in real-time, all of which are necessary features of an effective public health tool. The most apparent potential challenges of the web-based systems are those of inaccurate interpretation and prediction of health status, and privacy issues, based on an individual’s internet activity. CONCLUSION: Despite being in a nascent stage with further modification needed, web-based surveillance systems have evolved to complement traditional national surveillance systems. This review highlights ways in which the strengths of existing systems can be maintained and weaknesses alleviated to implement optimal web surveillance systems.

The spread of COVID-19 is increasing day by day, imposing human lives and economy at risk. Due to the increased enormity of the number of COVID-19 cases, the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is imperative in the current scenario. AI would be a powerful tool to fight against this pandemic outbreak by predicting the number of cases in advance. Deep learning-based time series techniques are considered to predict world-wide COVID-19 cases in advance for short-term and medium-term dependencies with adaptive learning. Initially, the data pre-processing and feature extraction is made with the real world COVID-19 dataset. Subsequently, the prediction of cumulative confirmed, death and recovered global cases are modelled with Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) and Prophet approaches. For long-term forecasting of COVID 19 cases, multivariate LSTM models employed. The performance metrics are computed for all the models and the prediction results are subjected to comparative analysis to identify the most reliable model. From the results, it is evident that the Stacked LSTM algorithm yields higher accuracy with an error of less than 2% compared to the other considered algorithms for the studied performance metrics. Country-specific analysis of India and city-specific analysis of Chennai COVID-19 cases are predicted and analyzed in detail. Also, statistical hypothesis analysis and correlation analysis are done on the COVID 19 datasets by including the features like temperature, rainfall, population, total infected cases, area and population density during the months of May, June, July and August to find out the best suitable model.

It raised the question contained in the main research problem: to what extent do military students at universities tend to behave in a pro-social and altruistic way in situations that pose a threat to the other people’s life and health, and what is the relationship between these behaviors and socialization in the civil environment? At the outset, the hypothesis was adopted that the candidates for professional soldiers show (or at least should show) a higher propensity for this type of behavior.

The aerosol particles were captured and removed from the air by rain and the concentration of aerosol particles significantly decreased after rain events. Therefore, rain is regarded as having a good effect on air environments in terms of the respiratory health of the general public. However, humid environments produced by long-term rain events such a monsoon may be a sufficient condition for the growth of microorganisms and vibrations because of the splashing of droplets may facilitate the aerosolization of ground microorganisms. We therefore hypothesize that the rain may increase concentrations of bioaerosols in outdoor air environments, thereby possibly influencing respiratory diseases. To verify this hypothesis, at the initial stepwise approach, we measured the concentration of airborne biological particles before, after, and during rain in a monsoon season. The measurement data of the concentration of fungal particles and bacterial particles show quantitatively that the bioaerosol concentrations during the rain event are several times higher than the concentration of the bioaerosols in the condition of no rain.","Heo, Ki Joon; Kim, Hannah Bae; Lee, Byung Uk",J Aerosol Sci,324,3

A vast amount of structural information is available for the ectodomain of S, a primary target by the host immune system, but much less is known regarding its transmembrane domain (TMD) and its membrane-proximal regions. Here, we determined the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of the S protein TMD in bicelles that closely mimic a lipid bilayer. The TMD structure is a transmembrane α-helix (TMH) trimer that assembles spontaneously in membrane. The trimer structure shows an extensive hydrophobic core along the 3-fold axis that resembles that of a trimeric leucine/isoleucine zipper, but with tetrad, not heptad, repeat. The trimeric core is strong in bicelles, resisting hydrogen-deuterium exchange for weeks. Although highly stable, structural guided mutagenesis identified single mutations that can completely dissociate the TMD trimer. Multiple studies have shown that the membrane anchor of viral fusion protein can form highly specific oligomers, but the exact function of these oligomers remain unclear.

The recent discovery of the crystallized structure of the main protease (M(pro)) from SARS-CoV-2 has provided an opportunity for utilizing computational tools as an effective method for drug discovery. Targeting viral replication has remained an effective strategy for drug development. M(pro) of SARS-COV-2 is the key protein in viral replication as it is involved in the processing of polyproteins to various structural and nonstructural proteins. Thus, M(pro) represents a key target for the inhibition of viral replication specifically for SARS-CoV-2. We have used a virtual screening strategy by targeting M(pro) against a library of commercially available compounds to identify potential inhibitors. After initial identification of hits by molecular docking-based virtual screening further MM/GBSA, predictive ADME analysis, and molecular dynamics simulation were performed. The virtual screening resulted in the identification of twenty-five top scoring structurally diverse hits that have free energy of binding (ΔG) values in the range of −26-06 (for compound AO-854/10413043) to −59.81 Kcal/mol (for compound 329/06315047). Moreover, the top-scoring hits have favorable AMDE properties as calculated using in silico algorithms. Additionally, the molecular dynamics simulation revealed the stable nature of protein-ligand interaction and provided information about the amino acid residues involved in binding. Overall, this study led to the identification of potential SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) hit compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties. We believe that the outcome of this study can help to develop novel M(pro) inhibitors to tackle this pandemic. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Not only affecting the lungs and provoking acute respiratory distress, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is able to infect multiple cell types including cardiac and vascular cells. Hence a significant proportion of infected patients develop cardiac events such as arrhythmias and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities are at highest risk of cardiac death. To face the pandemic and limit its burden, health authorities have launched several fast track calls for research projects aiming to develop rapid strategies to combat the disease, as well as longer-term projects to prepare for the future. Biomarkers have the possibility to aid in clinical decision making and tailoring healthcare in order to improve patient quality of life. The biomarker potential of circulating RNAs has been recognized in several disease conditions, including cardiovascular disease. RNA biomarkers may be useful in the current COVID-19 situation. The discovery, validation and marketing of novel biomarkers, including RNA biomarkers, require multi-centre studies by large and interdisciplinary collaborative networks, involving both the academia and the industry.

The objective of this study was to determine if the addition of commercial feed additives (e.i., acids, salt and sugar) to swine feed can be an effective strategy to inactive PDCoV. RESULTS: Six commercial feed acids (UltraAcid P, Activate DA, KEMGEST, Acid Booster, Luprosil, and Amasil), salt, and sugar were evaluated. The acids were added at the recommended concentrations to 5 g aliquots of complete feed, which were also inoculated with 1 mL of PDCoV and incubated for 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days. In another experiment, double the recommended concentrations of these additives were also added to the feed samples and incubated for 0, 1, 3, 7, and 10 days. All samples were stored at room temperature (~25 °C) followed by removal of aliquots at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days. Any surviving virus was eluted in a buffer solution and then titrated in swine testicular cells. Feed samples without any additive were used as controls. Both Weibull and log-linear kinetic models were used to analyze virus survival curves. The presence of a tail in the virus inactivation curves indicated deviations from the linear behavior and hence, the Weibull model was chosen for characterizing the inactivation responses due to the better fit. At recommended concentrations, delta values (days to decrease virus concentration by 1 log) ranged from 0.62–1.72 days, but there were no differences on virus survival among feed samples with or without additives at the manufacturers recommended concentrations. Doubling the concentration of the additives reduced the delta value to ≤ 0.28 days (P < 0.05) for all the additives except for Amasil (delta values of 0.86 vs. 4.95 days). Feed additives that contained phosphoric acid, citric acid, or fumaric acid were the most effective in reducing virus survival, although none of the additives completely inactivated the virus by 10- days post-inoculation. CONCLUSIONS: Commercial feed additives (acidifiers and salt) may be utilized as a strategy to decrease risk of PDCoV in feed, specially, commercial feed acidifiers at double the recommended concentrations reduced PDCoV survival in complete feed during storage at room temperature. However, none of these additives completely inactivated the virus.","Cottingim, Katie M.; Verma, Harsha; Urriola, Pedro E.; Sampedro, Fernando; Shurson, Gerald C.; Goyal, Sagar M.",Porcine Health Manag,324,20

A limited set of algorithms exists for estimating the rate of nucleotide substitution and inferring phylogenetic trees from such data. The authors here present a new method, Tree and Rate Estimation by Local Evaluation (TREBLE) that robustly calculates the rate of nucleotide substitution and phylogeny with several orders of magnitude improvement in computational time. Methods: For the basis of its rate estimation TREBLE novelly utilizes a geometric interpretation of the molecular clock assumption to deduce a local estimate of the rate of nucleotide substitution for triplets of dated sequences. Averaging the triplet estimates via a variance weighting yields a global estimate of the rate. From this value, an iterative refinement procedure relying on statistical properties of the triplets then generates a final estimate of the global rate of nucleotide substitution. The estimated global rate is then utilized to find the tree from the pairwise distance matrix via an UPGMA-like algorithm. Results: Simulation studies show that TREBLE estimates the rate of nucleotide substitution with point estimates comparable with the best of available methods. Confidence intervals are comparable with that of BEAST. TREBLE's phylogenetic reconstruction is significantly improved over the other distance matrix method but not as accurate as the Bayesian algorithm. Compared with three other algorithms, TREBLE reduces computational time by a minimum factor of 3000. Relative to the algorithm with the most accurate estimates for the rate of nucleotide substitution (i.e. BEAST), TREBLE is over 10 000 times more computationally efficient.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an Arterivirus that has been devastating the swine industry worldwide. Interstitial pneumonia is considered to be one of the most obvious clinical signs of PRRSV infection, suggesting that the inflammatory response plays an important role in PRRSV pathogenesis. However, whether DHX36 is involved in PRRSV-induced inflammatory cytokine expression remains unclear. In this study, we found that PRRSV infection increased the expression of DHX36. Knockdown of DHX36 and its adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) by small-interfering RNA in MARC-145 cells significantly reduced NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression after PRRSV infection. Further investigation revealed that PRRSV nucleocapsid protein interacted with the N-terminal quadruplex binding domain of DHX36, which in turn augmented nucleocapsid protein-induced NF-κB activation. Taken together, our results suggest that DHX36–MyD88 has a relevant role in the recognition of PRRSV nucleocapsid protein and in the subsequent activation of pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathway.","Jing, Huiyuan; Zhou, Yanrong; Fang, Liurong; Ding, Zhen; Wang, Dang; Ke, Wenting; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo",Front Immunol,324,26

In patients with known malignancies, in addition to constraints in routine healthcare, the risk of being susceptible to developing severe forms of the disease is of grave concern. While follow-up studies on survivors of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 2003 outbreak revealed increased susceptibility to infections, tumours and cardiovascular abnormalities, recent studies implicating angiopoietin 2 in induction of inflammatory intussusceptive angiogenesis and diffuse alveolar damage in COVID-19 patients raises the possibility of progression of carcinogenetic processes in patients with known malignancies. Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) mediated cellular entry of SARS-Cov2 leads to receptor shedding of ACE-2 and disrupts the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis (RAAS). This augments the pro-inflammatory and proliferative effects of RAAS, while attenuating the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative angiotensin 1-7 /Mas pathway. Angiopoietin-2, a molecule responsible for angiogenesis and cancer progression which corelates with tumour load in certain cancers, is upregulated by angiotensin 2-AT1 Receptor axis. Tumour microenvironment—comprising of various cells, blood vessels and extra cellular matrix which express the RAAS peptides—plays a key role in cancer initiation, progression and metastasis. Angiotensin 2 induces the formation of a desmoplastic environment, favouring cancer cell growth. ACE-2 downregulation causes bradykinin accumulation which may exert its proliferative action via mitogen activated protein kinase pathways which has established roles in cancers of breast and kidney. In addition to cytokine storm causing organ damage, acute inflammation in COVID-19 may also cause epithelial mesenchymal transition and heat shock protein 27 phosphorylation, both of which are key mediators in cancer signalling pathways. We hypothesise that SARS-Cov2, by impacting the RAAS and immune system, has the potential to cause tumour cell proliferation, apoptosis evasion and metastasis, thereby increasing the possibility of cancer progression in patients with known malignancies.","Saha, Aritra; Anirvan, Prajna",Ecancermedicalscience,324,3

While the first case was recorded in Hubei in December 2019, the extent of early community spread in Central Europe before this period is unknown. A high proportion of asymptomatic cases and undocumented infections, high transmissibility, and phylogenetic genomic diversity have engendered the controversial possibility of early international community spread of SARS-CoV-2 before its emergence in China. METHODS: To assess the early presence of lethal COVID-19 in Switzerland, we retrospectively performed an analysis of deaths at University Hospital Basel between October 2019 and February 2020 (n = 310), comparing the incidence of clinical causes of death with March 2020 (n = 72), the month during which the first lethal COVID-19 cases in Basel were reported. Trends of COVID-19-suggestive sequelae, such as bronchopneumonia with organization, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pulmonary embolisms (PE) were evaluated. In cases where autopsy was performed (n = 71), analogous analyses were conducted on the cause of death and pulmonary histological findings. Eight cases with a COVID-19-suggestive clinical history and histopathology between October 2019 and February 2020, and 3 cases before October 2019, were selected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. RESULTS: A statistically significant rise in pulmonary causes of death was observed in March 2020 (p = 0.03), consistent with the reported emergence of lethal COVID-19 in Switzerland. A rise in lethal bronchopneumonia was observed between December 2019 and January 2020, which was likely seasonal. The incidence of lethal ARDS and PE was uniformly low between October 2019 and February 2020. All autopsy cases analyzed by means of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR yielded negative results. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the absence of early lethal community spread of COVID-19 in Basel before its initial reported emergence in Switzerland in March 2020.","Haslbauer, Jasmin Dionne; Perrina, Valeria; Matter, Matthias; Dellas, Athanassios; Mihatsch, Michael J.; Tzankov, Alexandar",Pathobiology,324,28

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical courses of adult patients admitted for COVID-19 and identify associations between inpatient clinical features and post-discharge need for acute care. DESIGN: Retrospective chart reviews were performed to record laboratory values, temperature, and oxygen requirements of 99 adult inpatients with COVID-19. Those variables were used to predict emergency department (ED) visit or readmission within 30 days post-discharge. PATIENTS (OR PARTICIPANTS): Age ≥ 18 years, first hospitalization for COVID-19, admitted between March 1 and May 2, 2020, at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center, managed by an inpatient medicine service. MAIN MEASURES: Ferritin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, procalcitonin, white blood cell count, absolute lymphocyte count, temperature, and oxygen requirement were noted. KEY RESULTS: Of 99 patients, five required ED admission within 30 days, and another five required readmission. Fever within 24 h of discharge, oxygen requirement, and laboratory abnormalities were not associated with need for ED visit or readmission within 30 days of discharge after admission for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that neither persistent fever, oxygen requirement, nor laboratory marker derangement was associated with need for acute care in the 30-day period after discharge for severe COVID-19. These findings suggest that physicians need not await the normalization of laboratory markers, resolution of fever, or discontinuation of oxygen prior to discharging a stable or improving patient with COVID-19.","Saab, Faysal G.; Chiang, Jeffrey N.; Brook, Rachel; Adamson, Paul C.; Fulcher, Jennifer A.; Halperin, Eran; Manuel, Vladimir; Goodman-Meza, David",J Gen Intern Med,324,28

Such emerging epidemic viruses come again and again over years, leading to similar destructive consequences. Air-borne transmission among humans is the main reason for the rapid spreading of the virus. Blocking the air-borne transmission should be a significant measure to suppress the spreading of the pandemic. Considering the hospital is the most “dangerous” place to occur massive cross-infection among patients as emerging virus usually comes in a disguised way, an air distribution optimization of a general three-bed hospital ward in China is carried out in this paper. Using the Eulerian-Lagrangian method, sneeze process from patients who are assumed to be the virus carrier, which is responsible for a common event to trigger cross-infection, is simulated. The trajectory of the released toxic particle and the probability of approaching others in the same ward are calculated. Two evaluation parameter, total maximum time (TMT) and overall particle concentration (OPC) to reflect the particle mobility and probability to cause cross-infection respectively, are developed to evaluate the proposed ten air distributions in this paper.

We aimed to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with cancer and COVID-19, and examined risk factors for mortality in this population. METHODS: We did a retrospective, multicentre, cohort study of 205 patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and with a pathological diagnosis of a malignant tumour in nine hospitals within Hubei, China, from Jan 13 to March 18, 2020. All patients were either discharged from hospitals or had died by April 20, 2020. Clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and cancer histories were compared between survivors and non-survivors by use of χ(2) test. Risk factors for mortality were identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13 and Mar 18, 2020, 205 patients with cancer and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled (median age 63 years [IQR 56–70; range 14–96]; 109 [53%] women). 183 (89%) had solid tumours and 22 (11%) had haematological malignancies. The median duration of follow-up was 68 days (IQR 59–78). The most common solid tumour types were breast (40 [20%] patients), colorectal (28 [14%]), and lung cancer (24 [12%]). 54 (30%) of 182 patients received antitumour therapies within 4 weeks before symptom onset. 30 (15%) of 205 patients were transferred to an intensive care unit and 40 (20%) died during hospital admission. Patients with haematological malignancies had poorer prognoses than did those with solid tumours: nine (41%) of 22 patients with haematological malignancies died versus 31 (17%) of 183 patients with solid tumours (hazard ratio for death 3·28 [95% CI 1·56–6·91]; log rank p=0·0009). Multivariable regression analysis showed that receiving chemotherapy within 4 weeks before symptom onset (odds ratio [OR] 3·51 [95% CI 1·16–10·59]; p=0·026) and male sex (OR 3·86 [95% CI 1·57–9·50]; p=0·0033) were risk factors for death during admission to hospital. INTERPRETATION: Patients with cancer and COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital had a high case-fatality rate. Unfavourable prognostic factors, including receiving chemotherapy within 4 weeks before symptom onset and male sex, might help clinicians to identify patients at high risk of fatal outcomes.

Currently, standoff emotion detection is mostly reliant on the analysis of facial expressions and/or eye movements acquired from optical or video cameras. Meanwhile, although they have been widely accepted for recognizing human emotions from the multimodal data, machine learning approaches have been mostly restricted to subject dependent analyses which lack of generality. In this paper, we report an experimental study which collects heartbeat and breathing signals of 15 participants from radio frequency (RF) reflections off the body followed by novel noise filtering techniques. We propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture based on the fusion of raw RF data and the processed RF signal for classifying and visualising various emotion states. The proposed model achieves high classification accuracy of 71.67 % for independent subjects with 0.71, 0.72 and 0.71 precision, recall and F1-score values respectively. We have compared our results with those obtained from five different classical ML algorithms and it is established that deep learning offers a superior performance even with limited amount of raw RF and post processed time-sequence data. The deep learning model has also been validated by comparing our results with those from ECG signals. Our results indicate that using wireless signals for stand-by emotion state detection is a better alternative to other technologies with high accuracy and have much wider applications in future studies of behavioural sciences.","Khan, Ahsan Noor; Ihalage, Achintha Avin; Ma, Yihan; Liu, Baiyang; Liu, Yujie; Hao, Yang",PloS one,324,29

A sample of 1100 respondents was drawn from an internet research panel, and a questionnaire survey was administered to evaluate their willingness to be vaccinated by gender, age group, place of living, and underlying illness history. After using descriptive statistics and the chi-squared test to evaluate categorical variables, 65.7% of the participants indicated a willingness to be vaccinated; among them were older age groups, those in rural areas, and those with underlying medical conditions. In addition, males showed less hesitancy towards being vaccinated. Although selectivity bias exists, this study is the first to examine the willingness of Japanese people to be vaccinated. Since vaccine hesitancy and refusal ratio were found to be higher in Japan than in other countries, policy efforts are needed to make the country’s vaccination program viable.","Yoda, Takeshi; Katsuyama, Hironobu",Vaccines (Basel),324,16

In human postmortem brain tissue, the neurodegeneration and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) are found. Whether IgLON5 antibodies induce neurodegeneration or neurodegeneration provokes an immune response causing inflammation and antibody formation remains to be elucidated. We investigated the effects of anti-IgLON5 antibodies on human neurons. Human neural stem cells were differentiated for 14–48 days and exposed from Days 9 to 14 (short-term) or Days 13 to 48 (long-term) to either (i) IgG from a patient with confirmed anti-IgLON5 antibodies or (ii) IgG from healthy controls. The electrical activity of neurons was quantified using multielectrode array assays. Cultures were immunostained for β-tubulin III and p-tau and counterstained with 4′,6-Diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). To study the impact on synapses, cultures were also immunostained for the synaptic proteins postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and synaptophysin. A lactate dehydrogenase release assay and nuclei morphology analysis were used to assess cell viability. Cultures exposed to anti-IgLON5 antibodies showed reduced neuronal spike rate and synaptic protein content, and the proportion of neurons with degenerative appearance including p-tau (T205)-positive neurons was higher when compared to cultures exposed to control IgG. In addition, cell death was increased in cultures exposed to anti-IgLON5 IgG for 21 days. In conclusion, pathological anti-IgLON5 antibodies induce neurodegenerative changes and cell death in human neurons. This supports the hypothesis that autoantibodies may induce the neurodegenerative changes found in patients with anti-IgLON5-mediated disease. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential use of stem cell-based in vitro models for investigations of antibody-mediated diseases. As anti-IgLON5 disease is heterogeneous, more studies with different IgLON5 antibody samples tested on human neurons are needed.","Ryding, Matias; Gamre, Mattias; Nissen, Mette S.; Nilsson, Anna C.; Okarmus, Justyna; Poulsen, Anne A.

Internet search volumes are useful data that can sensitively detect trends of the public's attention during a pandemic outbreak situation. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to analyze the public’s interest in COVID-19 proliferation, identify the correlation between the proliferation of COVID-19 and interest in immunity and products that have been reported to confer an enhancement of immunity, and suggest measures for interventions that should be implemented from a health and medical point of view. METHODS: To assess the level of public interest in infectious diseases during the initial days of the COVID-19 outbreak, we extracted Google search data from January 20, 2020, onward and compared them to data from March 15, 2020, which was approximately 2 months after the COVID-19 outbreak began. In order to determine whether the public became interested in the immune system, we selected coronavirus, immune, and vitamin as our final search terms. RESULTS: The increase in the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases that occurred after January 20, 2020, had a strong positive correlation with the search volumes for the terms coronavirus (R=0.786; P<.001), immune (R=0.745; P<.001), and vitamin (R=0.778; P<.001), and the correlations between variables were all mutually statistically significant. Moreover, these correlations were confirmed on a country basis when we restricted our analyses to the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Korea. Our findings revealed that increases in search volumes for the terms coronavirus and immune preceded the actual occurrences of confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that during the initial phase of the COVID-19 crisis, the public’s desire and actions of strengthening their own immune systems were enhanced. Further, in the early stage of a pandemic, social media platforms have a high potential for informing the public about potentially helpful measures to prevent the spread of an infectious disease and provide relevant information about immunity, thereby increasing the public’s knowledge.","Lee, Jinhee; Kwan, Yunna; Lee, Jun Young; Shin, Jae Il; Lee, Keum Hwa; Hong, Sung Hwi; Han, Young Joo; Kronbichler, Andreas; Smith, Lee; Koyanagi, Ai; Jacob, Louis; Choi, SungWon; Ghayda, Ramy Abou; Park, Myung-Bae",J Med Internet Res,324,1

Among the reasons for this are that tests for the virus are not randomly administered, and that the most commonly used tests can yield a substantial fraction of false negatives. In this article, we propose a simple and easy-to-use Bayesian model to estimate the infection rate, which is only partially identified. The model is based on the mapping from the fraction of positive test results to the cumulative infection rate, which depends on two unknown quantities: the probability of a false negative test result and a measure of testing bias towards the infected population. Accumulating evidence about SARS-CoV-2 can be incorporated into the model, which will lead to more precise inference about the infection rate.","Bollinger, Christopher R.; van Hasselt, Martijn",Econ Lett,324,1

The 3′-terminal one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, namely spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid, interspersed with genes for accessory proteins that are largely nonstructural and called ‘open reading frame’ (ORF) proteins with alphanumerical designations, but not in a consistent or sequential order. Here, I report a comparative study of these ORF proteins, mainly encoded in two gene clusters, i.e. between the Spike and the Envelope genes, and between the Membrane and the Nucleocapsid genes. For brevity and focus, a greater emphasis was placed on the first cluster, collectively designated as the ‘orf3 region’ for ease of referral. Overall, an apparently diverse set of ORFs, such as ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF3c, ORF3d, ORF4 and ORF5, but not necessarily numbered in that order on all CoV genomes, were analyzed along with other ORFs. Unexpectedly, the gene order or naming of the ORFs were never fully conserved even within the members of one Genus. These studies also unraveled hitherto unrecognized orf genes in alternative translational frames, encoding potentially novel polypeptides as well as some that are highly similar to known ORFs. Finally, several options of an inclusive and systematic numbering are proposed not only for the orf3 region but also for the other orf genes in the viral genome in an effort to regularize the apparently confusing names and orders. Regardless of the ultimate acceptability of one system over the others, this treatise is hoped to initiate an informed discourse in this area.","Barik, Sailen",Infect Genet Evol,324,16

Early exploratory studies suggest significant increases in food insecurity in the United States. Comprehensive longitudinal research across multiple locations is needed to understand the range of impacts and responses at the household level and to improve preparedness for future events. This protocol paper outlines the formation of the National Food Access and COVID research Team (NFACT), a collaborative, interdisciplinary, multi-state research effort that will utilize common measurement tools, codebooks, code, data aggregation tools, and outreach materials to collectively examine and communicate the effect of COVID-19 on household food access and security. NFACT is led by an executive committee of researchers from four institutions, with additional NFACT collaborating institutions across more than a dozen states. A survey was developed by the NFACT executive team in March 2020, with additional refinements in May 2020, using both existing validated questions and new original questions, which were piloted and validated in Vermont. The project provides suggestive guidance for recruitment, and is designed to allow each study site to adopt recruitment strategies that meet their budget and needs. Primary outcomes of interest include food security status, employment status, food access challenges and concerns, dietary intake, and use of food assistance programs. Additional outcomes assess emotional eating, stigma, COVID-19 perceptions and experiences, and pro-environmental purchasing behaviors. This protocol and the establishment of NFACT provide important advancements in COVID-19 and food security research by generating harmonized data and assessing comparable outcomes across geographies and time. The collaborative, open-source approach makes research tools available to teams who might not have the resources to design their own tools, and can enable streamlined data collection, large-scale comparative analyses, and cost savings through reduced administrative tasks. The project has contributed to building new networks between and within states. Enabling facilitation and implementation of instruments in study sites has provided flexibility and meaningful opportunity for local stakeholder engagement and relevant outreach for informed public health decision-making.","Niles, M.

However, the advent of new genetic COVID-19 variants has increased more attention representing a worrying threat not only for not vaccinated but also for vaccinated people as virus infections have been shown also in the last ones. Herein, we report different clinical cases and radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in six fully vaccinated patients. Two patients had a history of Rituximab therapy for follicular lymphoma and with persistent positivity for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs and with moderate pneumonia on the chest computed tomography (CT). One patient who resulted to be positive to delta variant 8 days after the second vaccination dose, died shortly after. Two patients were hospitalized due to the worsening of fever and dyspnea in presence of mild pneumonia on CT. In one patient mild pneumonia was found on the chest-CT performed after a lipothymic episode associated with chest pain and positive NP/OP swab tested for SARS-CoV-2. These data suggested that in fully vaccinated people, caution should be preserved, and the use of masks and social distancing should be continued in all closed environments. However, further clinical trials should be done to better understand how various factors can influence vaccine immunogenicity as the presence of virus mutations, age factors, and the presence of an immunocompromised state.","Brogna, Barbara; Bignardi, Elio; Brogna, Claudia; Capasso, Chiara; Gagliardi, Giuliano; Martino, Alberigo; Musto, Lanfranco Aquilino",Medicina (Kaunas),324,22

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 117 deceased patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction and undergone chest CT were enrolled. We evaluated initial chest CT findings and their relationship, location, prevalence, and the frequency with mortality. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 73 ±18 years; 71 of all patients were male and 46 were female. The predominant feature was pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) lesion (82.0%), and 59.8% of cases had pure consolidation. There was no cavitation or architectural distorsion. Pericardial effusion was found in 9.4% the patients, and pleural effusions were found in 15.3% of them. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy was only 11.9% in total. CONCLUSION: In deceased patients, on admission CTs, pure consolidation, pleural and pericardial effusion, mediastinal LAP were more common than ordinary cases.

Kerourien is a place known for its stigmatizing crime, poverty, marginalization and state of disrepair. Social work is higher on the agenda than climate action. The team thus acknowledged that local narratives might not make much mention of climate change, and recognized part of the work might be to shift awareness to the actual or potential, current or future, connections between everyday non-climate concerns and climate issues. Such a shift called for a practical intervention, centered on local culture. The narrative collection process was dovetailed with preparing the neighbourhood’s 50th anniversary celebration and establishing a series of art performances to celebrate the neighbourhood and its residents. Non-climate and quasi-climate stories were collected, documented, and turned into art forms. The elements of climate service co-production in this process are twofold. First, they point to the ways in which non-climate change related local concerns may be mapped out in relation to climate change adaptation, showing how non-climate change concerns call for climate information. Secondly, they show how the co-production of climate services may go beyond the provision of climate information by generating procedural benefits such as local empowerment – thus generating capacities that may be mobilized to face climate change. We conclude by stressing that “place-based climate service co-production for action” may require questioning the nature of the “services” rendered, questioning the nature of “place,” and questioning what “action” entails. We offer leads for addressing these questions in ways that help realise empowerment and greater social justice.","Baztan, Juan; Vanderlinden, Jean-Paul; Jaffrès, Lionel; Jorgensen, Bethany; Zhu, Zhiwei",Clim Risk Manag,324,16

Its mortality rate is higher in individuals over 80 years of age and in people with comorbidities, so these constitute the risk group for severe forms of the disease. We analyzed the factors associated with death in confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state of Rio de Janeiro. This cross-sectional study evaluated the association between individual demographic, clinical, and epidemiological variables and the outcome (death) using data from the Unified Health System information systems. METHODS: We used the extreme boosting gradient (XGBoost) model to analyze the data, which uses decision trees weighted by the estimation difficulty. To evaluate the relevance of each independent variable, we used the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) metric. From the probabilities generated by the XGBoost model, we transformed the data to the logarithm of odds to estimate the odds ratio for each independent variable. RESULTS: This study showed that older individuals of black race/skin color with heart disease or diabetes who had dyspnea or fever were more likely to die. CONCLUSIONS: The early identification of patients who may progress to a more severe form of the disease can help improve the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and is thus essential to reduce the lethality of the disease.

A great deal of effort has been made to find effective drugs against this disease. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were widely adopted in treating COVID-19, but the results were contradictive. CQ/HCQ have been used to prevent and treat malaria and are efficacious anti-inflammatory agents in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. These drugs have potential broad-spectrum antiviral properties, but the underlying mechanisms are speculative. In this review, we re-evaluated the treatment outcomes and current hypothesis for the working mechanism of CQ/HCQ as COVID-19 therapy with a special focus on disruption of Ca(2+) signaling. In so doing, we attempt to show how the different hypotheses for CQ action on coronavirus may interact and reinforce each other. The potential toxicity is also noted due to its action on Ca(2+) and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels in cardiac myocytes and neuronal cells. We propose that intracellular calcium homeostasis is an alternative mechanism for CQ/HCQ pharmacology, which should be considered when evaluating the risks and benefits of therapy in these patients and other perspective applications.","Zhan, Xiping; Dowell, Sharon; Shen, Ying; Lee, Dexter L.",Heliyon,324,16

CRISPR diagnostics can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable, and accurate. Here, we report the development of an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA that can be read with a mobile phone microscope. The assay achieved ∼100 copies/μL sensitivity in under 30 min of measurement time and accurately detected pre-extracted RNA from a set of positive clinical samples in under 5 min. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity and directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics. Integrated with a reader device based on a mobile phone, this assay has the potential to enable rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening for SARS-CoV-2.","Fozouni, Parinaz; Son, Sungmin; Díaz de León Derby, María; Knott, Gavin J.; Gray, Carley N.; D’Ambrosio, Michael V.; Zhao, Chunyu; Switz, Neil A.; Kumar, G.

The pigment appears to be synthesized in the shell gland. The protoporphyrin IX synthetic pathway is well defined, but precisely where and how it is synthesized in the shell gland of the brown-egg laying hen is still ambiguous. The pigment is deposited onto all shell layers including the shell membranes, but most of it is concentrated in the outermost layer of the calcareous shell and in the cuticle. Recently, the genes that are involved in pigment synthesis have been identified, but the genetic control of synthesis and deposition of brown pigment in the commercial laying hen is not fully understood. The brown coloration of the shell is an important shell quality parameter and has a positive influence on consumer preference. The extent of pigment deposition is influenced by the housing system, hen age, hen strain, diet, stressors, and certain diseases such as infectious bronchitis. In this article, the physiological and biochemical characteristics of the brown pigment in commercial brown-egg layers are reviewed in relation to its various functions in the poultry industry.","Samiullah, S.; Roberts, J.R.; Chousalkar, K.",Poult Sci,324,16

Description Notre objectif était d’évaluer : – la nécessité clinique ; – la tolérance ; – l’immunogénicité d’une 3e injection vaccinale chez les patients HD. Méthodes Nous avons comparé la gravité des maladies COVID des patients HD non vaccinés, après 1 dose ou 2 dose vaccinale issues du registre national français REIN. Nous avons ensuite mesuré les taux d’IgG anti-RBD et la réponse interféron gamma des lymphocytes T CD4 et CD8 spécifiques 10 à 14jours après la 3e injection vaccinale chez 56 patients hémodialysés ayant un défaut de réponse après 2 doses. Résultats obtenus ou attendus Entre le 01/02/2021 et le 18/05/2021, 105 cas de COVID-19 sont survenus chez des HD après 2 injections vaccinales, 179 après 1 dose et 1094 chez des HD non vaccinés. Si la vaccination diminue la sévérité de la maladie COVID(p < 0,0001), la mortalité reste élevée même après 2 doses(12 %), justifiant la réalisation d’une troisième dose aux patients non protégés. La tolérance de la 3e dose vaccinale était identique à celle de la 2e dose(effets indésirables mineurs à modérés chez 0 à 30 % des patients). La 3e dose permettait d’augmenter le taux d’IgG anti-RBD de 106,0 BAU/mL[IQR 9,7-458,0] à 1463 BAU/mL[IQR 207,5-2665], p < 0,0001. En analyse multivariée, une réponse CD4 après 2 doses était associée à une réponse optimale après 3 doses (OR=7,89 ;[IC95 % 1,31–68,7], p = 0,034). Conclusion Deux doses de vaccin ARNm anti-SARS Cov2 sont insuffisantes pour protéger totalement tous les patients HD. Chez les non répondeurs, une 3ème dose vaccinale est bien tolérée, et permet d’augmenter le taux d’IgG anti-RBD chez une majorité de patients.","Espi, M.; Charmetant, X.; Barba, T.; Koppe, L.; Pelletier, C.; Kalbacher, E.; Chalencon, E.; Fouque, D.; Juillard, L.; Thaunat, O.",Néphrologie & Thérapeutique,324,16

Inhibition of ERK5 has therapeutic potential in cancer and inflammation and this has prompted the development of ERK5 kinase inhibitors (ERK5i). However, few ERK5i programmes have taken account of the ERK5 transactivation domain. We have recently shown that the binding of small molecule ERK5i to the ERK5 kinase domain stimulates nuclear localisation and paradoxical activation of its transactivation domain. Other kinase inhibitors paradoxically activate their intended kinase target, in some cases leading to severe physiological consequences highlighting the importance of mitigating these effects. Here, we review the assays used to monitor ERK5 activities (kinase and transcriptional) in cells, the challenges faced in development of small molecule inhibitors to the ERK5 pathway, and classify the molecular mechanisms of paradoxical activation of protein kinases by kinase inhibitors.","Cook, Simon J.; Tucker, Julie A.; Lochhead, Pamela A.",Biochem Soc Trans,324,26

Design Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis. Setting 260 acute care hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 17th January and 5th June 2020, with a minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 19th June 2020). Participants 451 children and young people aged less than 19 years admitted to 116 hospitals and enrolled into the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emergency Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK study with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcome Measures Admission to critical care (high dependency or intensive care), in-hospital mortality, or meeting the WHO preliminary case definition for MIS-C. Results Median age was 3.9 years [interquartile range (IQR) 0.3-12.9 years], 36% (162/451) were under 12 months old, and 57% (256/450) were male. 56% (224/401) were White, 12% (49/401) South Asian and 10% (40/401) Black. 43% (195/451) had at least one recorded comorbidity. A muco-enteric cluster of symptoms was identified, closely mirroring the WHO MIS-C criteria. 17% of children (72/431) were admitted to critical care. On multivariable analysis this was associated with age under one month odds ratio 5.05 (95% confidence interval 1.69 to 15.72, p=0.004), age 10 to 14 years OR 3.11 (1.21 to 8.55, p=0.022) and Black ethnicity OR 3.02 (1.30 to 6.84, p=0.008). Three young people died (0.7 %, 3/451) aged 16 to 19 years, all of whom had profound comorbidity. Twelve percent of children (36/303) met the WHO MIS-C criteria, with the first patient developing symptoms in mid-March. Those meeting MIS-C criteria were older, (median age 10.8 years ([IQR 8.4-14.1] vs 2.0 [0.2-12.6]), p<0.001) and more likely to be of non-White ethnicity (70% (23/33) vs 43% (101/237), p=0.005). Children with MIS-C were four times more likely to be admitted to critical care (61% (22/36) vs 15% (40/267, p<0.001). In addition to the WHO criteria, children with MIS-C were more likely to present with headache (45% (13/29) vs 11% (19/171), p<0.001), myalgia (39% (11/28) vs 7% (12/170), p<0.001), sore throat (37% (10/27) vs (13% (24/183, p = 0.004) and fatigue (57% (17/30) vs 31% (60/192), p =0.012) than children who did not and to have a platelet count of less than 150 x109/L (30% (10/33) vs 10% (24/232), p=0.004). Conclusions Our data confirms less severe covid-19 in children and young people than in adults and we provide additional evidence for refining the MIS-C case definition. The identification of a muco-enteric symptom cluster also raises the suggestion that MIS-C is the severe end of a spectrum of disease.

CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old man was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) in 3 vessels (3VD) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 61% and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with routine hemodialysis. The patient was scheduled for a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He underwent surgery after COVID-19 screening using a checklist provided by the hospital. The patient’s condition worsened on the 3rd postoperative day in the ward, and he was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), reintubated, and tested for COVID-19 with a real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we excluded the other possible pneumonia causes (e.g., influenza). An RT-PCR test performed after surgery revealed that the patient was positive for COVID-19. COVID-19 tracing was performed for all health care providers and relatives; all results were negative except for 1 family member. The patient was treated for 4 days in the isolation ICU but died due to complications of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows the importance of testing patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection before hospital admission for elective surgery and during the hospital stay, and the importance of developing rapid and accurate testing methods that can be used in countries and centers with limited health resources.","Soetisna, Tri Wisesa; Buana, Andhika Citra; Tirta, Edward Suryadi; Ardiyan, Ardiyan; Aligheri, Dicky; Herlambang, Bagus; Tjubandi, Amin; Hanafy, Dudy Arman; Sugisman, Sugisman",Am J Case Rep,324,1

Nucleic acid testing of respiratory tract specimens for SARS-CoV-2 is the current gold standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the diagnostic accuracy of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid may be lower than optimal. The detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies should be used as a serological non-invasive tool for the diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. AIM: To investigate the diagnostic value of SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG and nucleic acid detection in COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 652 suspected COVID-19 patients, and 206 non-COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Integrated TCM and Western Medicine Hospital. Data on SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and serum antibody tests were collected to investigate the diagnostic value of nucleic acid RT-PCR test kits and immunoglobulin (Ig)M/IgG antibody test kits. The χ2 test was used to compare differences between categorical variables. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was provided by the Wilson score method. All analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). RESULTS: Of the 652 suspected COVID-19 patients, 237 (36.3%) had positive nucleic acid tests, 311 (47.7%) were positive for IgM, and 592 (90.8%) were positive for IgG. There was a significant difference in the positive detection rate between the IgM and IgG test groups (P < 0.001). Using the RT-PCR results as a reference, the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of IgM/IgG combined tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection were 98.5%, 95.8%, and 97.1%, respectively. Of the 415 suspected COVID-19 patients with negative nucleic acid test results, 366 had positive IgM/IgG tests with a positive detection rate of 88.2%. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that serological IgM/IgG antibody combined test had high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and can be used in combination with RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Meng, Qing-Bin; Peng, Jing-Jing; Wei, Xin; Yang, Jia-Yao; Li, Peng-Cheng; Qu, Zi-Wei; Xiong, Yong-Fen; Wu, Guang-Jiang; Hu, Zhi-Min; Yu, Jian-Chun; Su, Wen",World J Clin Cases,324,24
