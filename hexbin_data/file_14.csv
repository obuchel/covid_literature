As establishing baseline thoracic radiography for the cynomolgus monkey is essential, we tested the hypothesis that age and sex may affect the thoracic radiography parameters of this species. METHODS: Here, 697 healthy cynomolgus monkeys were segregated by sex and age (three age groups: 25–36 months, 37–48 months, 49–60 months). The lung length (LL), maximal interior thoracic depth (TD), maximal interior thoracic breadth (TBr), cardiac silhouette breadth (CBr), cardiothoracic ratio (CR), right and left costophrenic angles (RCA and LCA), and right hilar height ratio (R-HHR) were assessed by chest film. Statistical analysis was applied to examine the effect of age, sex, and age × sex interactions. RESULTS: Significant effects by age were shown for LL, TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Significant effects by sex were found for TD, TBr, CBr, CR, and R-HHR. Significant effects by age × sex were observed for TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Both TD and TBr increased with age in both sexes, and both were significantly higher in males than in females in the group aged 49–60 months. CBr increased with age and was significantly higher in males than in females across all age groups. CR declined with age and was significantly higher in males than females across all age groups, and CR was similar or slightly higher relative to those previously found in other non-human primate species. As to the other parameters with no significant sex nor age-related differences, the R-HHR was greater than 1.00, and the angulation of bilateral costophrenic angles were sharp. CONCLUSIONS: The thoracic radiographic parameters for the healthy cynomolgus monkey presented here should prove useful in veterinary practice, research involving non-human primate models of respiratory or cardiovascular disorders, and morphological studies on cynomolgus monkeys.","Xie, Liang; Zhou, Qinming; Liu, Shigang; Wu, Qingyuan; Ji, Yongjia; Zhang, Lujun; Xu, Fan; Gong, Wei; Melgiri, Narayan D.; Xie, Peng",PLoS One,14,1

4356,4356,4356,Comparing “insider” and “outsider” news coverage of the 2014 Ebola outbreak,19.762894,0.7851376,2017-07-01,"OBJECTIVES: Information provided by news media during an infectious disease outbreak can affect the actions taken to safeguard public health. There has been little evaluation of how the content of news published during an outbreak varies by location of the news outlet. This study analyzes coverage of the 2014 Ebola outbreak by one news outlet operating within a country affected by the outbreak and one country not directly affected. METHODS: A qualitative content analysis was conducted of articles published in two national news outlets, The Globe and Mail (Canada) and the Vanguard (Nigeria), between January 1 and December 31, 2014. Articles available through LexisNexis Academic were sorted by date and sampled using a stratified sampling method (The Globe and Mail n = 100; Vanguard n = 105). A coding scheme was developed and modified to incorporate emerging themes until saturation was achieved. RESULTS: There were substantial differences in outbreak coverage in terms of the topic and content of the articles, as well as the sources consulted. The Globe and Mail framed the outbreak in terms of national security and national interests, as well as presenting it as an international humanitarian crisis. In contrast, the Vanguard framed the outbreak almost exclusively in terms of public health. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight how different geographic contexts can shape reporting on the same event. Further research is required to investigate how the political, social or economic situations of a country shape its news media, potentially influencing actions taken to control disease outbreaks.","Humphries, Brittany; Radice, Martha; Lauzier, Sophie",Can J Public Health,14,30

Lack of training in pain management remains the most significant obstacle to pain treatment alongside an inadequate emphasis on pain education in undergraduate medical curricula, negatively impacting on subsequent care of patients. This study aimed to determine the effect of a 12-week structured e-Learning course on the knowledge of pain management among Nigerian undergraduate medical students. METHODS: Prospective, multisite, pre-post study conducted across five medical colleges in Nigeria. Structured modules covering aspects of pain management were delivered on an e-Learning platform. Pre- and post-test self-assessments were carried out in the 12-week duration of the study. User experience questionnaires and qualitative interviews were conducted via instant messaging to evaluate user experiences of the platform. User experience data was analysed using the UEQ Data Analysis Tool and Framework Analysis. RESULTS: A total of 216 of 659 eligible students completed all sections of the e-Learning course. Participant mean age was 23.52 years, with a slight female predominance (55.3%). Across all participants, an increase in median pre- and post-test scores occurred, from 40 to 60 (Z = 11.3, p<0.001, effect size = 1.3), suggestive of increased knowledge acquisition relating to pain management. Participants suggested e-Learning is a valuable approach to delivering pain education alongside identifying factors to address in future iterations. CONCLUSION: e-Learning approaches to pain management education can enhance traditional learning methods and may increase students’ knowledge. Future iterations of e-Learning approaches will need to consider facilitating the download of data and content for the platform to increase user uptake and engagement. The platform was piloted as an optional adjunct to existing curricula. Future efforts to advocate and support integration of e-Learning for pain education should be two-fold; both to include pain education in the curricula of medical colleges across Nigeria and the use of e-Learning approaches to enhance teaching where feasible.","Onyeka, Tonia C.; Iloanusi, Nneka; Namisango, Eve; Onu, Justus U.; Okunade, Kehinde S.; Mohammed, Alhassan Datti; Gadanya, Muktar A.; Nagoma, Abubakar U.; Ojiakor, Samuel; Ilo, Chukwudi; Okuzu, Okey; Oduche, Chinelo; Ugwu, Ngozi; Allsop, Matthew J.",PLoS One,14,5

Ghana, like many other African nations, began screening travelers at all entry points into the country to enhance disease surveillance and response. This study aimed to assess the challenges of screening travelers for EVD at border entry in northern Ghana. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was an observational study using epidemiological weekly reports (Oct 2014-Mar 2015) of travelers entering Ghana in the Upper East Region (UER) and qualitative interviews with 12 key informants (7 port health officers and 5 district directors of health) in the UER. We recorded the number of travelers screened, their country of origin, and the number of suspected EVD cases from paper-based weekly epidemiological reports at the border entry. We collected qualitative data using an interview guide with a particular focus on the core and support functions (e.g. detection, reporting, feedback, etc.) of the World Health Organization’s Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system. Quantitative data was analyzed based on travelers screened and disaggregated by the three most affected countries. We used inductive approach to analyze the qualitative data and produced themes on knowledge and challenges of EVD screening. RESULTS: A total of 41,633 travelers were screened, and only 1 was detained as a suspected case of EVD. This potential case was eventually ruled out via blood test. All but 52 of the screened travelers were from Ghana and its contiguous neighbors, Burkina Faso and Togo. The remaining 52 were from the four countries most affected by EVD (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali). Challenges to effective border screening included: inadequate personal protective equipment and supplies, insufficient space or isolation rooms and delays at the border crossings, and too few trained staff. Respondents also cited lack of capacity to confirm cases locally, lack of cooperation by some travelers, language barriers, and multiple entry points along porous borders. Nonetheless, no potential Ebola case identified through border screening was confirmed in Ghana. CONCLUSION: Screening for Ebola remains sub-optimal at the entry points in northern Ghana due to several systemic and structural factors. Given the likelihood of future infectious disease outbreaks, additional attention and support are required if Ghana is to minimize the risk of travel-related spread of illness.","Awoonor-Williams, John Koku; Moyer, Cheryl A.; Adokiya, Martin Nyaaba",PLoS One,14,30

We present the design and methodology of the ACUDPN (ACUpuncture in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy) trial, which investigates the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) symptoms. The aim of this study is to investigate whether acupuncture is effective for the treatment of DPN symptoms. METHODS: This study is a two-armed, randomized, controlled, parallel group, open-label, confirmatory, multicenter trial (8-week intervention period plus 16 weeks of follow-up). Physicians in outpatient units in Germany who specialize in acupuncture treatment will treat 110 diabetes type II patients with clinical symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in the feet and legs with signs of neuropathy according to nerve conduction testing. The patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following two groups: (a) semi-standardized acupuncture plus routine care or (b) routine care alone. Acupuncture will consist of 12 treatments per patient over 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be the overall DPN-related complaints in the extremities after 8 weeks as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Further outcome measures will include DPN-related pain, the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI), Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain Impact (DPNPI) scores, and nerve conduction parameters of the sural nerve at weeks 8, 16, and 24. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will be available in 2021 and will help clarify whether acupuncture can be considered effective for the treatment of DPN with regard to the subdimensions of the neuropathic clinical picture.

Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) are related to prolonged hospitalizations. Present study explored whether the use of sugammadex could reduce PPCs and thereby reduce hospital length of stay (LOS) after lung surgery. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent elective open lobectomy for lung cancer from January 2010 to December 2015. Patients were divided into the sugammadex group and pyridostigmine group. The primary outcome was hospital LOS and secondary outcomes were postoperative complications and overall survival at 1 year. The cohort was subdivided into patients with and without prolonged LOS to explore the effects of sugammadex on outcomes in each group. Risk factors for LOS were determined via multivariate analyses. After propensity score matching, 127 patients were assigned to each group. RESULTS: Median hospital LOS was shorter (10.0 vs. 12.0 days) and the incidence of postoperative atelectasis was lower (18.1 vs. 29.9%) in the sugammadex group. However, no significant difference in overall survival between the groups was seen over 1 year (hazard ratio, 0.967; 95% confidence interval, 0.363 to 2.577). Sugammadex was a predictor related to LOS (exponential coefficient 0.88; 95% CI 0.82–0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that sugammadex is a preferable agent for neuromuscular blockade (NMB) reversal than cholinesterase inhibitors in this patient population.

AIM: In order to improve their detection, Santé publique France launched a surveillance system in 2019, based on the periodical analysis of health insurance data for medicalised acute gastroenteritis (mAGE). METHODS: Spatio-temporal cluster detection methods were applied to mAGE cases to prioritise clusters for further investigation. These investigations determined the plausibility that infection is of waterborne origin and the strength of association. RESULTS: Between January 2010 and December 2019, 3,323 priority clusters were detected (53,878 excess mAGE cases). They involved 3,717 drinking water supply zones (WSZ), 15.4% of all French WSZ. One third of these WSZ (33.4%; n = 1,242 WSZ) were linked to repeated clusters. Moreover, our system detected 79% of WBDO voluntarily notified to health authorities. CONCLUSION: Environmental investigations of detected clusters are necessary to determine the plausibility that infection is of waterborne origin. Consequently, they contribute to identifying which WSZ are linked to clusters and for which specific actions are needed to avoid future outbreaks. The surveillance system incorporates three priority elements: linking environmental investigations with water safety plan management, promoting the systematic use of rainfall data to assess waterborne origin, and focusing on repeat clusters. In the absence of an alternative clear hypothesis, the occurrence of a mAGE cluster in a territory completely matching a distribution zone indicates a high plausibility of water origin.","Pouey, Jerome; Galey, Catherine; Chesneau, Julie; Jones, Gabrielle; Franques, Nathalie; Beaudeau, Pascal; Mouly, Damien",Euro Surveill,14,30

However, their efficacy in post-extubated sepsis patients remains unclear. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of HFNC vs. NIV to prevent reintubation in post-extubated sepsis patients. METHODS: We conducted a single-centre, prospective, open-labelled, randomised controlled trial at the medical intensive care unit of Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. Sepsis patients who had been intubated, recovered, and passed the spontaneous breathing trial were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either HFNC or NIV support immediately after extubation. The primary outcome was rate of reintubation at 72 h after extubation. RESULTS: Between 1st October 2017 and 31st October 2019, 222 patients were enrolled and 112 were assigned to the HFNC group and 110 to the NIV group. Both groups were well matched in baseline characteristics. The median [IQR] age of the HFNC group was 66 [50–77] vs. 65.5 [54–77] years in the NIV group. The most common causes of intubation at admission were shock-related respiratory failure (57.1% vs. 55.5%) and acute hypoxic respiratory failure (34.8% vs. 40.9%) in the HFNC and NIV groups, respectively. The duration of mechanical ventilation before extubation was 5 [3–8] days in the HFNC group vs. 5 [3–9] days in the NIV group. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome: 20/112 (17.9%) in the HFNC group required reintubation at 72 h compared to 20/110 (18.2%) in the NIV group [relative risk (RR) 0.99: 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.70–1.39); P = 0.95]. The 28-day mortality was not different: 8/112 (7.1%) with HFNC vs. 10/110 (9.1%) with NIV (RR 0.88: 95% CI (0.57–1.37); P = 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: Among sepsis patients, there was no difference between HFNC and NIV in the prevention of reintubation at 72 h after extubation.

Public hospitals are mostly, but not always, under the supervision of the Health Ministry. There are a certain number of other governing bodies that are directly involved in the management of hospitals. A cross-ministry group was set up in 2006 to facilitate the implementation of hospital reforms. Apart from the organizational structure, the funding of hospitals and its evolution is studied. Between 1979 and 1991, the government introduced a co-payment system in healthcare establishments. In 1992, the Ministry of Health officially granted greater autonomy to public hospitals. They were authorized to deliver paid services and to make profits, but were made responsible for their losses and debts. By 2003, central government funding had fallen to 8% of the hospital budget. As a result, public hospitals in China behave very similarly to for-profit firms, while being governed as any traditional public structure. The next step is the current experiment of a Diagnostics Related Group-based payment in China. Along with the financial autonomy of public hospitals, different reforms have been directed at developing private hospitals, even though many obstacles still remain.","Milcent, Carine",Healthcare Reform in China,14,30

We also prove the NP-hardness of the general reachable pair cut problem and propose a greedy edge betweenness based approach as the benchmark in selecting the candidate edges for solving our problem. Furthermore, we transform the de-small-world network problem as an OR-AND Boolean function maximization problem, which is also an NP-hardness problem. In addition, we develop a numerical relaxation approach to solve the Boolean function maximization and the de-small-world problem. Also, we introduce the short-betweenness, which measures the edge importance in terms of all short paths with distance no greater than a certain threshold, and utilize it to speed up our numerical relaxation approach.

On virus entry, TMEV might use peripheral myelin P0 protein as a virus receptor. For persistence, TMEV seems to require myelin functional proteins or structural myelin itself. Here, myelin and oligodendrocyte loss and downregulation of myelin genes would lead to demyelination, but might limit virus spread in the central nervous system. Unlike experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a pathogenic role of anti-myelin autoimmunity is unclear in TMEV infection. Anti-myelin autoantibodies have been detected in TMEV infection. Among them, only anti-galactocerebroside (GC) antibody is shown to be myelinotoxic, and has molecular mimicry with TMEV. Myelin-specific T cells play no role in initiation or progression of demyelination in the first two to three months after TMEV infection. However, cellular autoimmunity against several myelin antigens (epitope spreading) can be detected during the late chronic stage.

Asthma related genes and environmental factors play a role in the etiology. Nowadays, asthma is regarded as a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways instead of solely a reversible airway obstruction. Asthma is often diagnosed on specific symptoms such as chest tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, and coughing. It is likely that, rather than a single disease entity, asthma consists of related, partially overlapping syndromes. The first symptoms often are experienced before the age of 5. Children with the highest risk have a family history of atopy and/or asthma. Viral infections with symptoms of wheezing acquired in the first year of life may be associated with the risk of developing asthma later on [1]. However, making the diagnosis with a reasonable certainty that is supported by spirometry is only possible from the age of 6 onward. More than 50% of children with a period of wheezing earlier on in life are not diagnosed as having asthma at the age of 6 [2]. The use of rescue and anti-inflammatory medication has largely altered the prospects of asthma patients and has improved their quality of life. Thus, nowadays, most asthma patients lead a normal life without restrictions. Disease control achieved by the asthmatics is an important predictor of the likelihood of complications of the disease [3]. However, asthma exacerbations neither respond to inhaled steroids nor can they substantially be prevented in this way [4, 5]. Only the use of oral corticos-teroids seems to be unmistakably effective in case of exacerbations [6, 7].","Bueving, Herman J.; Wouden, Johannes C. van der",Allergy Frontiers: Therapy and Prevention,14,30

Many microorganisms have been associated with bronchiectasis, both as a complication of the anatomic abnormalities and possibly as a cause of the structural disease as well [2, 3]. Diverse polymicrobial communities are present in the airways of patients with bronchiectasis [4]. Studies using standard microbiologic culture techniques have demonstrated the presence of bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens in the lungs of bronchiectasis patients both when the patient is clinically stable and when there is an exacerbation of disease [2, 5]. Newer molecular techniques have broadened our understanding of the microbiome in bronchiectasis patients [4, 6]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been repeatedly shown to be a problematic pathogen in patients with bronchiectasis and is associated with a worse prognosis [7, 8]. Multiple epidemiologic reports have shown that approximately 20–35% of patients worldwide with bronchiectasis are chronically infected with P. aeruginosa [2, 9, 10].

Clinically, HLH/MAS is a life-threatening condition that is usually diagnosed among febrile hospitalized patients (children and adults) who commonly present with unremitting fever and a shock-like multiorgan dysfunction scenario. Laboratory studies reveal pancytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated markers of inflammation (ESR, CRP), hyperferritinemia, and features of coagulopathy. In about 60% of cases, excess hemophagocytosis (macrophages/histiocytes engulfing other hematopoietic cell types) is noted on biopsy specimens from the bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, and other organs. HLH/MAS has been hypothesized to occur when a threshold level of inflammation has been achieved, and genetic and environmental risk factors are believed to contribute to the hyperinflammatory state. A broad variety of infections, from viruses to fungi to bacteria, have been identified as triggers of HLH/MAS, either in isolation or in addition to an underlying inflammatory disease state. Certain infections, particularly by members of the herpesvirus family, are the most notorious triggers of HLH/MAS. Treatment for infection-triggered MAS requires therapy for both the underlying infection and dampening of the hyperactive immune response.","Eloseily, Esraa M.; Cron, Randy Q.",The Microbiome in Rheumatic Diseases and Infection,14,30

A coupled UV-photolysis-biodegradation process was used to decompose decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) in clay slurries. A novel bioslurry bioreactor (NBB) was employed in which BDE-209 degradation was maximized by the simultaneous application of LED UVA irradiation and biodegradation by a mixed bacterial culture. The rate of BDE-209 degradation decreased in the order: coupled UV photolysis-biodegradation (1.31 × 10(-2) day(-1)) > UV photolysis alone (1.10 × 10(-2) day(-1)) > biodegradation alone (1.00 × 10(-2) day(-1)). Degradation intermediates detected included hydroxylated polybrominated diphenylethers, partially debrominated PBDE congeners and polybrominated dibenzofuran. The UV-resistant bacterial strains isolated that could utilize BDE-209 as a sole carbon source included Stenotrophomonas sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Microbacterium sp. These strains encoded important functional genes such as dioxygenase and reductive dehalogenases. Continuous UV irradiation during the NBB process affected various biochemical oxidative reactions during PBDEs biodegradation. Simultaneous photolysis and biodegradation in the NBB system described reduces operational time, energy, expense, and maintenance-demands required for the remediation of BDE-209 when compared to sequential UV-biodegradation process or to biodegradation alone.

This study aimed to explore 558 Taiwanese university students’ various online learning motivations, and to compare the salient differences before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. A survey named “COVID-19 Online Learning Motivation (COLM)” questionnaire was developed to thoughtfully evaluate the students’ online learning task value, goal orientation, and self-efficacy. The results indicate that, first, the COLM questionnaire was valid and reliable for adequately probing the students’ various online learning motivations. In general, the students expressed substantial increase in agreement for Attainment value, Utility value, Mastery-approach goal, Mastery-avoidance goal, Performance-avoidance goal, and Functional self-efficacy after the COVID-19 outbreak. This study further compared the two groups of students’ scores on the COLM scales based on whether they had actual online learning experiences during the pandemic. The findings suggest that the students who had experienced comprehensive online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic may have held lower expectations regarding the personal relevance and anticipated future practicality of adopting online learning before the pandemic. Interestingly, these preexisting differences on the two scales seemed to diminish after the outbreak of COVID-19, implying that this distressing pandemic which occurred worldwide did indeed have some impacts on how the Taiwanese university students valued the personal relevance and the future expected returns of adopting online learning in higher education.","Lin, Tzung-Jin",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,14,12

With the pandemic spreading at such an alarming rate, a lot of efforts are in the process of identification of an effective treatment at it's earliest. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is such a drug that is being studied as a repurposed agent, although the early results are still inconclusive. However, an important adverse effect that has raised concerns in the recent times is its possible cardiac toxicity, mainly the 'QT,' prolongation in electro-cardiogram, which has created a sense of apprehension for its use in traditional indications like rheumatological conditions. In decades of HCQ use by rheumatologists, this cardiac toxicity was rarely ever seen. So, what is different in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era? This review outlines various studies on HCQ reporting cardiac adverse events in patients with rheumatic diseases as well as, in patients with COVID-19 infection. In addition, two important observations were noticed; first, the doses that have been used in the current COVID-19 scenario are much higher than what are used in rheumatology. Second, COVID-19 infection may by itself lead to intrinsic cardiac abnormalities, which is probably acting as a confounder. Most of the available and credible data suggest that HCQ is a safe drug, including the RECOVERY trial stating no cardiotoxicity by HCQ. This review reinforces the safety profile of HCQ in a data-driven manner and addresses the concerns of the physicians. However, its cautious use in those with pre-existing cardiac abnormalities cannot be overemphasized.","Padiyar, Shivraj; Danda, Debashish",European journal of rheumatology,14,7

HLA-G expression is mainly restricted to the fetal-maternal interface on the extravillous cytotrophoblast, placenta, amnion. Methods: The purpose of this study is to investigate the HLA-G and KIR2DL4 expression in chorionic villous among 2 groups with missed abortion: group 1 - 27cases with normal karyotype and group 2 - 22 with fetal polyploidy. Criteria of inclusion: abortive material from two groups of women with missed abortion; 6-12 weeks gestational age, singleton pregnancy, cytogenetic of chorionic villous was obligatory - normal fetal karyotype and polyploidy of fetus. Results: During IHC investigations the average relative area of HLA-G expression in trophoblast was counted (in 1st group 33.9 ± 3.5 and in 2nd group 38.6 ± 2.8). Expression of HLA-G the most verified in extravillous chorion stroma. The average relative area of KIR2DL4 receptor was not statistically different among two groups (31.6 ± 2.4 and 32.2 ± 1.7). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest the role of HLA-G for the progression in early reproductive losses. Low expression of HLA-G is associated with pregnancy complications and can be one of the reasons for spontaneous abortion.","Bespalova, Olesya; Bakleicheva, Margarita; Ivashchenko, Tatiana; Tral, Tatiana; Tolibova, Gulrukhsor; Kogan, Igor",Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,14,1

OBJECTIVES To genotype the -794 CATT5-8 and -173G>C MIF polymorphisms in Mexican patients with apical periodontitis as a genetic risk of exacerbation. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study involved 120 patients with apical periodontitis: 60 with a diagnosis of acute apical periodontitis (Group A) and 60 without previous episodes of exacerbation (Group B). Allelic discrimination was performed from peripheral blood DNA; the repeat polymorphism -794 CATT5-8 was genotyped with sequencing, while the -173G>C polymorphism was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using TaqMan probes. The associations between MIF polymorphisms, haplotypes and the risk of exacerbated apical periodontitis were assessed. RESULTS The allele CATT7 was associated with the risk of a stage of acute inflammation (OR = 4.13; 95% CI = 1.82-9.63; p =< 0.001). Regarding the -173G >C polymorphism, a process of inflammation exacerbation was only associated with the CC genotype (OR = 4.1; 95% CI = 1.02-20.84; p = 0.045). The analysis of the haplotype showed that the combination CATT7/C increases the risk of exacerbation of apical periodontitis (OR = 3.57; 95% CI = 1.038-13.300; p = 0.021).

Oncomine database analysis showed that IGSF10 expression was significantly reduced in most cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In the TCGA-LUAD dataset, IGSF10 expression correlated positively with proportions of tumor-infiltrated B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that overall survival of patients with low IGSF10 expression was significantly shorter than those with high IGSF10 expression. MiRWalk2.0 database analysis and dual luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-106b-5p suppressed IGSF10 expression by binding to its 3'UTR. MiR-106b-5p levels inversely correlated with IGSF10 expression in the TCGA-LUAD dataset. Moreover, inhibition of miR-106b-5p significantly decreased in vitro proliferation, migration, and invasion by LUAD cells, whereas miR-106b-5p overexpression reversed those effects. These results demonstrate that IGSF10 is an independent prognostic factor for LUAD. Furthermore, miR-106b-5p suppressed IGSF10 expression in LUAD tissues by binding to its 3'UTR, which makes IGSF10 and miR-106b-5p potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in LUAD patients.","Ling, Bo; Liao, Xianjiu; Tang, Qiang; Ye, Guangbin; Bin, Xiaoyun; Wang, Jianchu; Pang, Yaqin; Qi, Guangzi",Aging,14,8

However, these interventions increase the risk of respiratory infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP constitutes a serious burden for the healthcare system and worsens the patient's outcomes; thus, several preventive strategies have been implemented. This communication reviews the current knowledge on VAP pathogenesis and the latest preventive measures. RECENT FINDINGS Pathogen-laden oropharyngeal secretions leak across the endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff; thus, a continuous control of the internal cuff pressure and cuffs made of polyurethane improve sealing effectiveness and associated risks of infections. Subglottic secretions aspiration prevents VAP, and the latest evidence demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of late-onset VAP. The role of ETT biofilm in the pathogenesis of VAP is not fully elucidated. Nevertheless, antimicrobial-coated ETTs have showed beneficial effects in VAP incidence. Recent experimental evidence has challenged the benefits associated with the use of the semirecumbent position; yet, these findings need to be corroborated in clinical trials. The latest results from trials testing the effects of selective digestive decontamination (SDD) showed beneficial effects on patients' outcomes, but concerns remain regarding the emergence of bacterial resistance, specifically upon digestive tract re-colonization. The use of oropharyngeal decontamination with antiseptics and the use of probiotics are potential alternatives to SDD. SUMMARY There is consistent evidence that strategies affecting the primary mechanisms of VAP pathogenesis efficiently reduce the occurrence of the disease. Preventive measures should be implemented grouped into bundles to improve overall efficacy.","Ramirez, Paula; Bassi, Gianluigi L; Torres, Antonio",Current opinion in critical care,14,1

We aimed to identify clinical and perfusion CT (PCT) variables which are independently associated with PHs. METHODS In this observational cohort study, based on the Acute Stroke Registry Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL) from 2003 to December 2013, we selected patients with AIS involving the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory who were thrombolysed within 4.5 h of symptoms' onset and who had a good quality baseline PCT at the beginning of IVT. In addition to demographic, clinical, laboratory and non-contrast CT data, volumes of salvageable tissue and ischemic core on PCT, as well as absolute CBF and CBV values within the ischemic regions were compared in patients with and without PH in multivariate analysis. RESULTS Of the 190 included patients, 24 (12.6%) presented a PH (11 had PH1 and 13 had PH2). In multivariate analysis of the clinical and radiological variables, the lowest CBV in the core and lower body weight was both significantly associated with PH (p = 0.009 and p = 0.024, respectively). CONCLUSION In thrombolysed MCA strokes, maximal hypoperfusion severity depicted by lowest CBV values in the core region and lower body weight are independently correlated with PH. This information, if confirmed in other case series, may add to the stratification of revascularisation decisions in patients with a perceived high PH risk.","Tsetsou, S; Amiguet, M; Eskandari, A; Meuli, R; Maeder, P; Jiang, B; Wintermark, M; Michel, P",Neuroradiology,14,17

METHODS The framework proposed is based on a systematic review of the scientific literature (2001-2016) combined with data derived from a series of semistructured interviews with experts and practitioners in ERC, and it is designed to support local, national, and international public health organizations in implementing evaluation studies in ERC. RESULTS We identified a list of ERC outcomes from the full-text review of 152 articles and categorized these into 3 groups, depending upon the level at which the outcome was measured: (1) information environment, (2) population, and (3) public health system. We analyzed interviewees' data from 18 interviews to identify practices and processes related to the effectiveness of ERC and included these as key structural components and processes in the developed evaluation framework. CONCLUSIONS Researchers and public health practitioners interested in the evaluation of ERC can use the conceptual framework described in this article to guide the development of evaluation studies and methods for assessing communication outcomes related to public health emergencies.","Savoia, Elena; Lin, Leesa; Gamhewage, Gaya M",American journal of public health,14,31

DESIGN Prospective cohort study (December 2013 to October 2014). SETTING Privately owned emergency and referral teaching hospital. ANIMALS Forty-nine client-owned dogs and 16 client-owned cats. INTERVENTIONS Patients wherein NGT placement was recommended and client consent was obtained were included in the interventional group. Those with an NGT placed (NGT group) had the NGT aspirated every 4 hours. Patients for whom placement of a NGT was declined by the owner served as a reference group (NoNGT). Venous blood gas and electrolyte values were obtained every 12 hours. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Thirty-five dogs and cats had an NGT placed. Thirty dogs and cats did not have an NGT placed. The serum venous blood gas and electrolyte changes were compared over time within the NGT group and between the NGT and NoNGT groups. No cases developed HCMA. In the NGT group, blood pH increased over time. There was no significant difference between the NGT and the NoNGT group in the average value of pH, HCO3- , base excess, chloride, or corrected chloride. Serum venous blood gas, chloride, and corrected chloride changes were not associated with the volumes of gastric fluid aspirated over time. CONCLUSIONS In this small population of dogs and cats, intermittent NGT aspiration was not associated with the development of HCMA over a period of up to 36 hours after NGT placement.","Chih, Annie; Rudloff, Elke; Waldner, Cheryl; Linklater, Andrew K J",Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care,14,5

We also tried to determine the most appropriate time for treatment of this condition. METHOD From 2000 to 2018, the medical records of 56 patients (33 males and 23 females) who had CAF diagnoses were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS The mean age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 3.9 ± 4.6 years (range, 1 month to 18 years) and the mean duration of the follow-up period was 7.4 ± 4.5 years (range, 1 year to 17.5 years). The right coronary artery (RCA) was the most common origin site for CAF, the left main coronary artery (LMCA) was the second most common origin site whereas the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was the third most common origin site. Catheter angiography showed that right ventricle (RV) was the site of termination for CAF in 23 patients (41.1%) while the CAF drained to the pulmonary artery in 16 patients (28.6%). Transcatheter intervention was performed in ten patients, while CAF were corrected surgically in five patients. Transcatheter intervention was initially attempted in two out of the five surgically-treated patients, but the procedure was unsuccessful. A vascular plug was deployed in six patients, a platinum coil was used in three patients, and a platinum coil with tissue adhesive was placed in one patient using a catheter. Early complications were seen in two patients during transcatheter intervention and in one patient during surgery. There were no instances of death or late complications in patients treated surgically or via transcatheter. CONCLUSIONS Coronary artery fistulae are usually asymptomatic, and medical therapy with long term follow up is the first line treatment. Fistulae that cause hemodynamically significant shunting, chamber enlargement, or visible symptoms should be closed at an early age. This study shows that transcatheter closure is a safe treatment option for CAF that may be performed with high success. Also, it should be known that surgery may be performed effectively with low rates of complications. Because complications can develop in treated and untreated patients of all ages, follow-up should occur during the patient`s lifetime.","Yakut, Kahraman; Tokel, N Kürşad; Varan, Birgül; Erdoğan, İlkay; Özkan, Murat",The Turkish journal of pediatrics,14,28

OBJECTIVE To examine long-term survival in a large multisite cohort of patients who underwent bariatric surgery compared with matched control patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a retrospective cohort study, we identified 2500 patients (74% men) who underwent bariatric surgery in Veterans Affairs (VA) bariatric centers from 2000-2011 and matched them to 7462 control patients using sequential stratification and an algorithm that included age, sex, geographic region, body mass index, diabetes, and Diagnostic Cost Group. Survival was compared across patients who underwent bariatric surgery and matched controls using Kaplan-Meier estimators and stratified, adjusted Cox regression analyses. EXPOSURES Bariatric procedures, which included 74% gastric bypass, 15% sleeve gastrectomy, 10% adjustable gastric banding, and 1% other. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause mortality through December 2013. RESULTS Surgical patients (n = 2500) had a mean age of 52 years and a mean BMI of 47. Matched control patients (n = 7462) had a mean age of 53 years and a mean BMI of 46. At the end of the 14-year study period, there were a total of 263 deaths in the surgical group (mean follow-up, 6.9 years) and 1277 deaths in the matched control group (mean follow-up, 6.6 years). Kaplan-Meier estimated mortality rates were 2.4% at 1 year, 6.4% at 5 years, and 13.8% at 10 years for surgical patients; for matched control patients, 1.7% at 1 year, 10.4% at 5 years, and 23.9% at 10 years. Adjusted analysis showed no significant association between bariatric surgery and all-cause mortality in the first year of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.28 [95% CI, 0.98-1.68]), but significantly lower mortality after 1 to 5 years (HR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.36-0.56]) and 5 to 14 years (HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.39-0.58]). The midterm (>1-5 years) and long-term (>5 years) relationships between surgery and survival were not significantly different across subgroups defined by diabetes diagnosis, sex, and period of surgery. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among obese patients receiving care in the VA health system, those who underwent bariatric surgery compared with matched control patients who did not have surgery had lower all-cause mortality at 5 years and up to 10 years following the procedure. These results provide further evidence for the beneficial relationship between surgery and survival that has been demonstrated in younger, predominantly female populations.","Arterburn, David E; Olsen, Maren K; Smith, Valerie A; Livingston, Edward H; Van Scoyoc, Lynn; Yancy, William S; Eid, George; Weidenbacher, Hollis; Maciejewski, Matthew L",JAMA,14,16

METHODS A case study was carried out, including 781 sperm donor candidates (1991 semen samples) collected between November 23, 2019 and July 23, 2020 (a period covering COVID-19 lock-down in China) in University-affiliated Sichuan provincial Human Sperm Bank. RESULT(S) Our results suggested that sperm motility is susceptible to ambient pollution exposure. Exposure to particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10), O3 and NO2 during late stage of spermatogenesis appeared to have weak but positive association with semen quality. Exposure to CO late in sperm development appeared to have inverse relationship with sperm movement parameters. Exposure to SO2 appeared to influence semen quality throughout spermatogenesis. Collinearity did not appear to be a major issue in our analysis based on correlationship analysis; we conducted robustness test of the regression results with additional analysis on a subset of our study population to affirm our results. CONCLUSION(S) Male exposure to different air pollutants have different correlations with semen quality parameters during different exposure windows of spermatogenesis.

This study aimed to compare outcomes and cost of laparoscopic and open appendectomy in a district hospital. METHODS A retrospective analysis of 230 patients who underwent appendectomy at the Division of General Surgery of the Civil Hospital of Ragusa, Italy, from May 2008 to May 2012 was performed. The variables analyzed included patients data (age, gender, previous abdominal surgery, preoperative WBC count, duration of symptoms, ASA risk score), rate of uncomplicated or complicated appendicitis, operative time, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and total costs. The patients were divided in two groups according to the surgical approach and compared for each variable. The results were analyzed using the t Student test for quantitative variables, and the Chi-square test with Yates correction and Fisher exact test for categorical. RESULTS Laparoscopic appendectomy was performed in 139 patients, open appendectomy in 91. Two cases (1.4%) were converted to open procedure and included in the laparoscopic group data. Patient data and rate of complicated appendicitis were similar in the two study groups. There was no statistical difference (p = 0.476) in the mean operative time between the laparoscopic (52.2 min; range, 20-155) and open appendectomy (49.3 min; range, 20-110) groups. The overall incidence of minor and major complications was significantly lower (p = 0.006) after laparoscopic appendectomy (2.9%, 4 cases) than after open appendectomy (13.2%, 12 cases); rate of intra-abdominal abscess were similar. The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter (p = 0.001) in laparoscopic group (2.75 days; range, 1-8) than in open group (3.87 days; range, 1-19). The mean total cost was 2282 Euro in laparoscopic group and 2337 Euro in open group, with a no significant difference of 55 Euro (p = 0.812). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic appendectomy is associated with fewer complications, shorter hospital stay, and similar operative time, intra-abdominal abscess rate, and total costs, compared with open appendectomy. Therefore, laparoscopic appendectomy can be recommended as preferred approach in acute appendicitis.","Minutolo, Vincenzo; Licciardello, Alessio; Di Stefano, Biagio; Arena, Manuel; Arena, Goffredo; Antonacci, Vincenzo",BMC surgery,14,8

However, after the discovery of penicillin by Fleming in 1928, and the subsequent introduction of the much cheaper and safer antibiotics in the 1930s, serum therapy was largely abandoned. However, the broad and general use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has resulted in the development of multi-resistant strains of bacteria with limited to no response to existing treatments and the need for alternative treatment options. The combined specificity and flexibility of antibody-based treatments makes them very valuable tools for designing specific antibody treatments to infectious agents. These attributes have already caused a revolution in new antibody-based treatments in oncology and inflammatory diseases, with many approved products. However, only one monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, for the prevention and treatment of respiratory syncytial virus, is approved for infectious diseases. The high cost of monoclonal antibody therapies, the need for parallel development of diagnostics, and the relatively small markets are major barriers for their development in the presence of cheap antibiotics. It is time to take a new and revised look into the future to find appropriate niches in infectious diseases where new antibody-based treatments or combinations with existing antibiotics, could prove their value and serve as stepping stones for broader acceptance of the potential for and value of these treatments.","Hey, Adam",Microbiology spectrum,14,31

Intracorporeal knot tying still remains a technical challenge for the surgeon. Self-anchoring suture incorporates a new concept for tissue approximation and reduces intracorporeal knot tying problems. There are very few reports on self-anchoring knotless suture and its application for laparoscopic pyeloplasty in children. We present our results of a series of consecutive children undergoing laparoscopic pyeloplasty with knotless barbed sutures. MATERIAL AND METHOD We prospectively evaluate 15 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic pyeloplasty with knotless barbed sutures (V-LocTM, Covidien) for ureteropelvic anastomosis. The decision of the operation was given by pediatric nephrology-urology-radiologic imaging diagnostic team, and all patients were operated by a single surgeon. Pyeloplasty was performed without pelvic reduction, and the anastomosis was made by barbed sutures using running fashion. RESULTS The mean age of the patients were 5.39 (3 months-17 years). Two cases had undergone a right-sided pyeloplasty, and thirteen had undergone a left-sided pyeloplasty. The duration of the operative procedure was 60-110 min. Neither intraoperative nor postoperative complication was encountered in any of the cases. Patients were followed by ultrasonographic evaluation. The anteroposterior diameter (AP) diameter of renal pelvis and hydronephrosis grade Society for Fetal Urology (SFU) are significantly different when compared with pre-operative and postoperative period (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). Owing to the renal parenchymal thickness change by age pre-operative and postoperative thickness comparison is adjusted by age, because age is considered as a covariate (confounder variable). We observed statistically significant (p = 0.003) difference in parenchymal thickness in all cases. Follow-up periods of the 15 consecutive pediatric pyeloplasty cases were 6-54 months. CONCLUSION In the present study, successful outcome of the laparoscopic pyeloplasty using barbed suture was shown for the first time in children in literature. We believe that successful outcome of laparoscopic pyeloplasty could be achieved by eliminating knots and less manipulation on the wound edge also minimizes tissue injury during the procedure.","Yilmaz, O; Tanriverdi, H I; Cayirli, H; Ertan, P; Sencan, A; Genc, A; Taneli, C",Journal of pediatric urology,14,1

Barriers to influenza vaccination programs included lack of data on cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination programs (87%) and on influenza disease burden (84%), competing health priorities (80%), lack of public perceived risk from influenza (79%), need for better risk communication tools (77%), lack of financial support for influenza vaccine programs (75%), a requirement to use only WHO-prequalified vaccines (62%), and young children require two vaccine doses (60%). Activities for advancing influenza vaccination programs included educating healthcare workers (97%) and decision-makers (91%) on the benefits of influenza vaccination, better estimates of influenza disease burden (91%) and cost of influenza vaccination programs (89%), simplifying vaccine introduction by focusing on selected high-risk groups (82%), developing tools to prioritize target populations (80%), improving availability of influenza diagnostic testing (79%), and developing collaborations with neighboring countries for vaccine procurement (74%) and regulatory approval (73%). Responses varied by country region and income status. CONCLUSIONS Local governments and key international stakeholders can use the results of this survey to improve influenza vaccination programs in LMICs, which is a critical component of global pandemic preparedness for influenza and other pathogens such as coronaviruses. Additionally, strategies to improve global influenza vaccination coverage should be tailored to country income level and geographic location.","Kraigsley, Alison M; Moore, Kristine A; Bolster, Amanda; Peters, Maya; Richardson, Dominique; Arpey, Meredith; Sonnenberger, Michelle; McCarron, Margaret; Lambach, Philipp; Maltezou, Helena C; Bresee, Joseph S",Vaccine,14,1

However, this global measure of cardiac function might not be suitable to detect the regional effects sorted by this therapy, and is hampered by high operator variability and loading dependency. Deformation imaging might be more accurate in detecting potential regional functional improvements by cardiac regenerative therapy. OBJECTIVE The aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive overview of current literature on the value of deformation imaging in cardiac regenerative therapy. METHODS A systematic review of current literature available on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane databases was performed regarding both animal- and patient studies in which deformation imaging was used to study cardiac cell therapy. After critical appraisal, outcomes regarding study design, type of cell therapy, procedural characteristics, outcome measure, method for measuring strain and efficacy on both LVEF and deformation parameters were depicted. RESULTS A total of 30 studies, 15 preclinical and 15 clinical, were included for analysis. Deformation outcomes improved significantly in 14 out of 15 preclinical studies and in 10 out of 15 clinical studies, whilst LVEF improved in 12 and 4 articles respectively. Study designs and used deformation outcomes varied significantly among the included papers. CONCLUSION 6 studies found a positive effect on deformation outcomes without LVEF improvement. Hence, deformation imaging seems at least equal, and perhaps superior, to LVEF measurement in the assessment of cardiac regenerative therapy. However, strategies varied substantially and call for a standardized approach.","van Klarenbosch, Bas R; Chamuleau, Steven A J; Teske, Arco J",Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,14,6

Several honeybee populations across Europe have well-documented adaptations of mite-resistant traits but little is known about host adaptations towards the virus infections vectored by the mite. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the possible contribution of adapted virus tolerance and/or resistance to the enhanced survival of four well-documented mite-resistant honeybee populations from Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands and France, in relation to unselected mite-susceptible honeybees. Caged adult bees and laboratory reared larvae, from colonies of these four populations, were inoculated with DWV and ABPV in a series of feeding infection experiments, while control groups received virus-free food. Virus infections were monitored using RT-qPCR assays in individuals sampled over a time course. In both adults and larvae the DWV and ABPV infection dynamics were nearly identical in all groups, but all mite-resistant honeybee populations had significantly higher survival rates compared to the mite-susceptible honeybees. These results suggest that adapted virus tolerance is an important component of survival mechanisms.","Locke, Barbara; Thaduri, Srinivas; Stephan, Jörg G; Low, Matthew; Blacquière, Tjeerd; Dahle, Bjørn; Le Conte, Yves; Neumann, Peter; de Miranda, Joachim R",Scientific reports,14,12

A combination of rule-based filtering and manual classification methods was used to classify user comments on COVID-19 Facebook posts of three public health authorities: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, Public Health England, and Ministry of Health, Singapore. A total of 104,304 comments were analyzed for posts published between 1 January, 2020, and 31 March, 2020, along with COVID-19 cases and deaths count data from the three countries. Findings indicate that the perceived benefits of physical distancing measures (n = 3,463; 3.3%) was three times higher than perceived barriers (n = 1,062; 1.0%). Perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 (n = 2,934; 2.8%) was higher compared with perceived severity (n = 2,081; 2.0%). Although susceptibility aspects of physical distancing were discussed more often at the start of the year, mentions on the benefits of intervention emerged stronger toward the end of the analysis period, highlighting the shift in beliefs. The health belief model is useful for understanding Facebook users' beliefs at a basic level, and it provides a scope for further improvement.","Tan, Soon Guan; Sesagiri Raamkumar, Aravind; Wee, Hwee Lin",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,14,16

BACKGROUND Much knowledge is available concerning change in complex cognitive capacities under the effects of thermal stress. Our science can inform critical care facilities as to remediation strategies such as work-rest schedules to minimize performance error in highly cognitively demanding circumstances such as intensive care units. METHOD The present exposition draws from the state-of-the-art understanding concerning thermal stress effects on cognition and workload in complex and demanding tasks. RESULTS The summation and synthesis of HF/E findings provides important insights into combinatorial effects of forms of stress, typically dealt with only as discrete sources in traditional standards and regulations. The identified interaction between ascending thermal stress and cognitive task demand provides an instance of the plurality of ways HF/E can specify performance limitations in safety-critical circumstances, as witnessed in the current pandemic. CONCLUSION Accumulated HF/E insights provide systematic ways in which to address and ameliorate the combined forces of physical and cognitive stress on medical personnel constrained to use varying forms of PPE. These principles extend beyond this specific domain to all who are required to work in differential and isolated microclimates. APPLICATION To minimize the possibility of critical and life-threatening error in intensive care facilities which necessitate PPE use, we need principled work-rest ratio and heat stress mitigation guidance. To promote health, we need to champion healthy work practices in our health workers. HF/E insights can help achieve this important goal.","Hancock, P A",Human factors,14,5

OBJECTIVES This study explored the reliability of using a type III device in patients with significant medical conditions to diagnose sleep apnea. METHODS Patients had an overnight sleep study conducted simultaneously with both polysomnogram (PSG) and a type III (NOX-T3) monitoring device. All patients had stable multiple co-existing medical illnesses without any changes in medications and conditions within one month of sleep study. RESULTS Between July 2019 to March 2020, there were altogether 74 patients recruited with analyzable data. Five major disease groups were identified in the cohort: psychiatric illnesses, stroke, ischemic heart diseases (IHD) and chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Psychiatric patients with medications were found to have the lowest AHI (23.7/hr) and arousal index (46.6/hr). The CKD group had the highest mean arousal index (71.4/hr) and obstructive apnea count (110.2). NOX-T3 respiratory event index (REI) was significantly lower than the PSG AHI (mean REI 31.4 vs mean AHI: 42.2). The number of patients with no/mild/moderate/severe OSA diagnosed by NOX-T3 and PSG were 7/17/19/31 and 5/11/20/38 respectively. CONCLUSION NOX-T3 device can reliably diagnose OSA in patients with different stable co-existing medical conditions. There is a tendency for underestimation of the severity of the OSA with NOX-T3 in patients with co-existing medical conditions especially with sedative medications. A positive NOX-T3 reliably diagnose OSA whereas a negative NOX-T3 result need to be interpreted with caution.","To, Kin Wang; Chan, Tat On; Chan, Wing Chi; Choo, Kah Lin; Hui, David S C",The clinical respiratory journal,14,19

There is a lack of evidence regarding the inflammatory stress response with the use of different energy devices. The present study was conducted to evaluate and compare the inflammatory response in total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) using three different energy devices. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted in 60 women with abnormal uterine bleeding undergoing TLH. They were divided into three groups based on the energy devices used, namely integrated bipolar and ultrasonic energy (Thunderbeat), ultrasonic (Harmonic) and electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing system (Ligasure). Cytokines and chemokines were measured in all three groups at different time points. RESULTS Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) increased postsurgery in all three groups and gradually declined by 72 hours. The geometric mean serum (IL)-6 levels was highest with Ligasure at 24 hours as compared with the other groups. Levels of TNF-α, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1) α, MIP-1 β were also higher at 3 hours in the Ligasure group. When the differences between the groups were measured at different time points, there was a significantly greater increase in serum IL-6 levels in the Ligasure group at 24 hours (p=0.010). No significant difference was found in the post-operative course between the groups. CONCLUSION A greater inflammatory response was seen after the use of Ligasure indicating greater tissue damage. However, this response was not correlated with any difference in postoperative recovery.","Roy, Kallol Kumar; Gc, Netra; Singhal, Seema; Bharti, Juhi; Kumar, Sunesh; Mitra, Dipendra K; Ray, Ruma; Meena, Jyoti; Vanamail, Perumal",Journal of the Turkish German Gynecological Association,14,12

Current ablative therapies for bleeding ectatic vessels have the potential for deep tissue injury leading to ulcerations, perforation, and fistulas. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy avoids deep tissue injury and is a promising treatment for CRP. OBJECTIVE To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of RFA for the treatment of CRP. DESIGN Multicenter, retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database. SETTING Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, Massachusetts; Sarasota Memorial Hospital and Suncoast Endoscopy of Sarasota, Florida. PATIENTS A total of 39 consecutive patients with CRP. INTERVENTIONS Endoscopic RFA of CRP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS The primary endpoint of the study was complete resolution of rectal bleeding. Secondary endpoints included visually scored improvement of CRP on endoscopic follow-up by using a rectal telangiectasia density (RTD) grading score, improvement in hemoglobin level, and adverse events related to the procedure. RESULTS A total of 39 male patients (mean [± standard deviation {SD}] age 72.9 ± 6.6 years) were included in the study. The mean number of RFA sessions was 1.49 (median 1, interquartile range [IQR] 1-2, range 1-4), with a mean interval of 18 weeks between sessions. Rectal bleeding stopped completely in all patients during the mean follow-up of 28 months (range 7-53 months). A significant improvement occurred in the mean (± SD) hemoglobin level from 11.8 ± 2 to 13.5 ± 1.6 g % (P < .0001). Endoscopic severity also improved significantly with an improvement in the median RTD score from 3 (IQR 2-3) to 0 (IQR 0-1) (P < .0001). Treatment with RFA led to discontinuation of blood transfusion and iron therapy in 92% and 82% patients, respectively. LIMITATIONS Retrospective analysis, lack of control group. CONCLUSION RFA therapy led to complete resolution of rectal bleeding in all treated CRP patients, with improvement in clinical and endoscopic indices without any major adverse events. Further controlled studies are needed to establish RFA as the endoscopic therapy of choice for treatment of CRP.","Rustagi, Tarun; Corbett, F Scott; Mashimo, Hiroshi",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,14,20

A robust and up to date overview of empirical evidence assessing and substantiating health equity impact of health insurance schemes among specific vulnerable populations in LMICs beyond the more common parameters, such as income level, is lacking. We fill this gap by conducting a systematic review of how social inclusion affects access to equitable health financing arrangements in LMIC. METHODS We searched 11 databases to identify peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 1995 and January 2018 that addressed the enrolment and impact of health insurance in LMIC for the following vulnerable groups: female-headed households, children with special needs, older adults, youth, ethnic minorities, migrants, and those with a disability or chronic illness. We assessed health insurance enrolment patterns of these population groups and its impact on health care utilization, financial protection, health outcomes and quality of care. RESULTS The comprehensive database search resulted in 44 studies, in which chronically ill were mostly reported (67%), followed by older adults (33%). Scarce and inconsistent evidence is available for individuals with disabilities, female-headed households, ethnic minorities and displaced populations, and no studies were yielded reporting on youth or children with special needs. Enrolment rates seemed higher among chronically ill and mixed or insufficient results are observed for the other groups. Most studies reporting on health care utilization found an increase in health care utilization for insured individuals with a disability or chronic illness and older adults. In general, health insurance schemes seemed to prevent catastrophic health expenditures to a certain extent. However, reimbursements rates were very low and vulnerable individuals had increased out of pocket payments. CONCLUSION Despite a sizeable literature published on health insurance, there is a dearth of good quality evidence, especially on equity and the inclusion of specific vulnerable groups in LMIC. Evidence should be strengthened within health care reform to achieve UHC, by redefining and assessing vulnerability as a multidimensional process and the investigation of mechanisms that are more context specific.","van Hees, Suzanne G M; O'Fallon, Timothy; Hofker, Miranda; Dekker, Marleen; Polack, Sarah; Banks, Lena Morgon; Spaan, Ernst J A M",International journal for equity in health,14,1

Our aim was to study routinely collected clinical parameters as predictors of 90-day mortality in older patients attending our ED. METHODS We conducted a retrospective follow-up study at the Leiden University Medical Center (The Netherlands) among patients aged 70 years or older attending the ED in 2012. Predictors were age, gender, time and way of arrival, presenting complaint, consulting medical specialty, vital signs, pain score and laboratory testing. Cox regression analyses were performed to analyse the association between these predictors and 90-day mortality. RESULTS Three thousand two hundred one unique patients were eligible for inclusion. Ninety-day mortality was 10.5 % for the total group. Independent predictors of mortality were age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 1.04-1.08), referral from another hospital (HR 2.74, 95 % CI 1.22-6.11), allocation to a non-surgical specialty (HR: 1.55, 95 % CI 1.13-2.14), increased respiration rate (HR up to 2.21, 95 % CI 1.25-3.92), low oxygen saturation (HR up to 1.96, 95 % CI 1.19-3.23), hypothermia (HR 2.27, 95 % CI 1.28-4.01), fever (HR 0.43, 95 % CI 0.24-0.75), high pain score (HR 1.55, 95 % CI 1.03-2.32) and the indication to perform laboratory testing (HR 3.44, 95 % CI 2.13-5.56). CONCLUSIONS Routinely collected parameters at the ED can predict 90-day mortality in older patients presenting to the ED. This study forms the first step towards creating a new and simple screening tool to predict and improve health outcome in acutely presenting older patients.","Hofman, Susanna E; Lucke, Jacinta A; Heim, Noor; de Gelder, Jelle; Fogteloo, Anne J; Heringhaus, Christian; de Groot, Bas; de Craen, Anton J M; Blauw, Gerard Jan; Mooijaart, Simon P",BMC emergency medicine,14,0

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN BALB/c nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with IGF-1R-expressing human bone sarcoma xenografts (OS-1, EW-5, and EW-8) which showed high, modest, or no response, respectively, to R1507, a monoclonal antibody targeting the extracellular domain of IGF-1R. An IGF-1R-negative tumor (OS-33), unresponsive to IGF-1R inhibitors, was examined as well. Mice were injected with (111)In-R1507. Biodistribution and immuno-SPECT/computed tomography imaging studies were carried out 1, 3, and 7 days p.i. in mice with OS-1 and EW-5 xenografts and 3 days p.i. in mice with EW-8 and OS-33 xenografts. RESULTS Biodistribution studies showed specific accumulation of (111)In-R1507 in OS-1 and EW-5 xenografts (27.5 ± 6.5%ID/g and 14.0 ± 2.8%ID/g, 3 days p.i., respectively). Most importantly, (111)In-R1507 uptake in IGF-1R positive, but unresponsive, EW-8 xenografts (6.5 ± 1.5%ID/g, 3 days p.i.) was similar to that of the IGF-1R-negative OS-33 tumor (5.5 ± 0.6%ID/g, 3 days p.i.). Uptake in normal tissues was low and nonspecific. Corresponding immuno-SPECT images clearly discriminated between high, modest, and nonresponding tumors by showing a homogeneous (OS-1), heterogeneous (EW-5), or nonspecific (EW-8 and OS-33) tumor uptake of (111)In-R1507. CONCLUSIONS (111)In-R1507 immuno-SPECT is an excellent method to visualize membranous IGF-1R expression and target accessibility in vivo in human bone sarcoma xenografts and may serve as an independent marker to predict IGF-1R therapy (R1507) response in bone sarcoma patients.","Fleuren, Emmy D G; Versleijen-Jonkers, Yvonne M H; van de Luijtgaarden, Addy C M; Molkenboer-Kuenen, Janneke D M; Heskamp, Sandra; Roeffen, Melissa H S; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M; Houghton, Peter J; Oyen, Wim J G; Boerman, Otto C; van der Graaf, Winette T A",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,14,17

It has been suggested that minipuberty contributes to the development of reproductive organs, somatic growth, cognitive/behavioral, and sex-specific brain development. Given the well-known trade-off between the reproductive/endocrine and immune systems in adults, the immunological approach to minipuberty, which is characterized by transient activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal (HPG) axis seems to be ignored. This study focused on the relationship of the lymphocyte subsets with gonadotrophin and sex hormones during the minipuberty. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 121 newborns (58 male) were included in this cross-sectional study. The hormone and lymphocyte subsets studied were as follow:follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) estradiol (E), testosterone (T), CD19, CD16/56, CD3, CD3/CD4, CD3/CD8, and HLA-DR as lymphocyte activation marker. RESULTS The mean FSH levels were higher in females (15.15±10.12mIU/mL vs, 2.61±1.74mIU/mL) and LH in males (5.80±2.51mIU/mL vs. 1.91±12.89mIU/mL) (p<0.001 for each). The mean percentages of the CD3/CD4 levels were higher in females (54.61±6.70% vs. 51.17±6.77%) and CD3/CD8 in males (21.49±4.82% vs. 17.31±3.66%) (p <0.001 for each). In the females, the mean FSH levels negatively correlated with CD3/CD4 (rFSH-CD3/CD4 =-0.423, p=0.001) and positively correlated with CD3/CD8 (rFSH-CD3/CD8 =0.311, p=0.013). In the males, LH positively correlated with CD3/CD4 (rLH-CD3/CD4 =0.406, p<0.001) and negatively correlated with CD3/CD8 (rLH-CD3/CD8 =-0.486, p<0.001). CONCLUSION This study showed that the mean CD3/CD4 levels were higher in female and CD3/CD8 in male newborns, indicating that there was a sexual dimorphism in favor of immunostimulant in females and immunosuppressor components of immune response in males during the minipuberty. These interactions point to sex-specific trade-off between reproductive/endocrine and immune systems, which it reflects the an investment favoring in the reproductive system against the immune response during minipuberty, which is critical period for adult fertility, especially in males.","Karaoglan, Murat; Nacarkahya, Gulper",Clinical endocrinology,14,1

A total of 36.4 % of parents reported having concerns about their children's behaviour, emotions or relationships but only 16.4 % of them said that they would discuss these with their treating doctor. Our study showed that mental illness in parents had a substantial impact on parenting and their children. However, those who sought professionals help in this regard were few and far between. Services aimed at the specific needs of these parents should be developed.","Rohanachandra, Yasodha Maheshi; Amarabandu, H G Irosha; Rohanachandra, Lochana Thivanka",Asian journal of psychiatry,14,1

Unbiased transcriptome profiling is now widely used for a deeper understanding of a drug's mechanisms of action, off target effects, and cytotoxicity. Although currently available high-throughput RNA-Seq (HT RNA-Seq) methods such as PLATE-Seq, DRUG-Seq, and BRB-Seq serve these purposes, the inherent nature of these methods does not allow sample-wise sequencing library quality control. Here, we describe an HTR method called High-throughput CellulAr RNA Sequencing (HiCAR-Seq). HiCAR-Seq was optimized to work directly on cultured cells (as little as 1,000 cells) or 10 ng of total RNA. HiCAR-Seq involves reverse transcription from cultured cells or total RNA using oligo-dT primers followed by the PCR amplification of full-length cDNAs using sample-specific barcode primers in individual plate wells. Amplification of cDNA from every sample can be verified using Bioanalyzer. This step not only reveals cDNA amplification but also provides greater precision for pooling equal concentrations of cDNA from different samples. A single pooled cDNA library is made suitable for sequencing on Illumina sequencers using a tagmentation kit. Because HiCAR-Seq targets a small region at the 3' of the mRNAs, as little as 3 to 4 million reads/sample are enough to infer changes in gene expression in human or mouse cells. We believe that HiCAR-Seq represents a robust and competitive addition to the existing set of transcriptome-based high-throughput screening methods. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

This study investigated the effects of age on the outcomes of mechanical ventilation in the emergency department (ED) for advanced age with CAP. METHODS We retrospectively investigated the medical records of advanced age (age, ≥65 years) with CAP who required mechanical ventilation in the ED of our hospital between January 2006 and December 2012. The patients were divided into 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 years or older age groups. The following outcomes were measured: number of patients weaned from mechanical ventilation, in-hospital mortality, ventilator-free days, and intensive care unit days. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with mortality and weaning from mechanical ventilation. RESULTS Seventy-one patients (mean age, 79.5 years) were included. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 43.7%. No significant differences were observed among the 3 groups with regard to weaning from mechanical ventilation (P=.59), in-hospital mortality (P=.90), ventilator-free days (P=.83), or intensive care unit days (P=.12). Age was not significantly associated with weaning from mechanical ventilation or in-hospital mortality among advanced age. Diabetes mellitus was an independent factor for weaning from mechanical ventilation (P=.048) and was relatively associated with mortality (P=.051). CONCLUSIONS Age, in itself, may not be a factor limiting the initiation of mechanical ventilation in the ED in advanced age with CAP. Further studies should determine appropriate indications for mechanical ventilation in the ED for these patients.","Hifumi, Toru; Jinbo, Ippei; Okada, Ichiro; Kiriu, Nobuaki; Kato, Hiroshi; Koido, Yuichi; Inoue, Junichi; Kawakita, Kenya; Morita, Satoshi; Kuroda, Yasuhiro",The American journal of emergency medicine,14,1

This system is available as a smartphone app and Bluetooth-enabled token to help identify close contacts. As of February 1 2021, more than 80% of the population have either downloaded the mobile app or received the token in Singapore. Despite the high adoption rate of the TT mobile app and token (i.e. device), it is crucial to understand the role of social and normative perceptions in the uptake and usage by the public, given that the collective efforts for contact tracing. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to examine the normative influences (descriptive and injunctive norms) on the TT device use for contact tracing purposes, informed by the Theory of Normative Social Behavior (TNSB), a theoretical framework to explain how perceived social norms are related to behaviors. METHODS From January to February 2021, cross-sectional data were collected by a local research company through emailing their panel members who were: 1) Singapore citizens or permanent residents aged 21 years and above; 2) able to read English; and 3) Internet users with access to a personal email account. The study sample (n = 1,137) was restricted to those who had either downloaded the TT mobile app or received the token. RESULTS Multivariate (linear and ordinal logistic) regression analyses were carried out to assess the relationships of the behavioral outcome variables (TT device usage and intention of TT device usage) to potential correlates including perceived social norms, perceived community and interpersonal communication. Multivariate regression analyses indicated that descriptive norms (unstandardized regression coefficient, β = 0.31, SE = 0.29, p < .001) and injunctive norms (β = 0.16, SE = 0.16, p < .001) were significantly, positively associated with intention to use TT device. It was also found that descriptive norms were a significant correlate of TT device use frequency (adjusted odds ratio, OR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.66 - 2.61, p < .001). Though not significantly related to TT device use frequency, injunctive norms moderated the relationship between descriptive norms and the outcome variable (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03 - 1.21, p = .005). CONCLUSIONS This study provides useful implications for the design of effective intervention strategies to promote the uptake and usage of the digital methods for contact tracing in a multi-ethnic Asian population. Our findings highlight that influence from social networks plays an important role in developing normative perceptions in relation to TT device use for contact tracing. To promote the uptake of TT device and other preventive behaviors for COVID-19, it would be useful to devise norm-based interventions that address these normative perceptions by presenting high prevalence and approval of important social referents, such as family and close friends.

As organizations advance diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, an often overlooked focus of is the health status of employees and their families, where equitable access to high-value health benefits offerings should be available to all. This commentary provides guidance for employers to expand their DEI initiatives to include employee and family health and well-being as a central outcome measure. Employers should ensure that DEI efforts incorporate equitable benefits design, and objectively assess benefit design impact on healthcare utilization and cost. Additionally, employers must appreciate the workplace as a significant determinant of health-for lower income workers, in particular-with review of policies and practices to mitigate any discriminatory negative health or well-being impact. Further, race and ethnicity data should be incorporated in health benefits data analysis to understand more clearly the differential outcomes of health management offerings on these different sub-populations. Finally, social needs data should be incorporated into strategic benefits planning to better understand gaps and opportunities to foster greater benefits equity.

BA neurons did not respond to arbitrary visual stimuli, but acquired responses to stimuli that predicted either rewards or punishments. Most VTADA→BA axons were activated by both rewards and punishments, and they acquired responses to cues predicting these outcomes during learning. Responses to cues predicting food rewards in VTADA→BA axons and BA neurons in hungry mice were strongly attenuated following satiation, while responses to cues predicting unavoidable punishments persisted or increased.

While such collaborations are important for generating new knowledge that will help address global health inequities, there is evidence to suggest that current forms of collaboration may reproduce unequal power relations. Therefore, we conducted a qualitative study with scientists, researchers and those involved in research management, working in international health collaborations. Interviews were conducted between October 2019 and March 2020. We conducted 13 interviews with 15 participants. From our findings, we derive three major themes. First, our results reflect characteristics of equitable, collaborative research relationships. Here we find both relational features, specifically trust and belonging, and structural features, including clear contractual agreements, capacity building, inclusive divisions of labour, and the involvement of local communities. Second, we discuss obstacles to develop equitable collaborations. These include exclusionary labour practices, donor-driven research agendas, overall research culture, lack of accountability and finally, the inadequate financing of indirect costs for LMIC institutions. Third, we discuss the responsibilities for promoting science equity of funders, LMIC researchers, LMIC institutions, and LMIC governments. While other empirical studies have suggested similar features of equity, our findings extend these features to include local communities as collaborators in research projects and not only as beneficiaries. We also suggest the importance of funders paying for indirect costs, without which the capacity of LMIC institutions will continually erode. And finally, our study shows the responsibilities of LMIC actors in developing equitable collaborations, which have largely been absent from the literature.","Faure, Marlyn C; Munung, Nchangwi S; Ntusi, Ntobeko A B; Pratt, Bridget; de Vries, Jantina",PloS one,14,1

METHODS This prospective study included 51 patients (14 women, mean age 66 years) bearing 66 tumors (56 hepatic, 5 pulmonary, 5 renal tumors) with a median size of 16 ± 8.7 mm, referred for tumor ablation in an intention-to-treat fashion before preoperative anesthesiology visit. Cancellation and complications of HFJV were prospectively recorded. Anesthesia and procedure duration, as well as mean CO2 capnea, were recorded. When computed tomography guidance was used, 3D spacial coordinates of an anatomical target <2 mm in diameter on 8 slabs of 4 slices of 3.75-mm slice thickness were registered. RESULTS HFJV was used in 41 of 51 patients. Of the ten patients who were not candidate for HFJV, two patients had contraindication to HFJV (severe COPD), three had lesions invisible under HFJV requiring deep inspiration apnea for tumor targeting, and five patients could not have HFJV because of unavailability of a trained anesthetic team. No specific complication or hypercapnia related to HFJV were observed despite a mean anesthetic duration of 2 h and ventilation performed in procubitus (n = 4) or lateral decubitus (n = 6). Measured internal target movement was 0.3 mm in x- and y-axis and below the slice thickness of 3.75 mm in the z-axis in 11 patients.

We answered the question whether the higher sensitivity of women and elderly persons is quantitatively meaningful. Specifically, we investigated if it is large enough to hamper the diagnosis, classification and follow-up of pain conditions by clinicians. Materials and Methods From each age stratum (18-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, and >80 years), 40 pain-free women and 40 pain-free men were recruited. They rated the intensity of pressure of ten Newtons over ten seconds on an analogue zero to ten rating scale. The pressure was applied on their middle fingers and ear lobes with a threshold algometer. Centile curves visualized the sex- and age-dependent fluctuation of pressure sensitivity. Results Over the entire age range from 20 to 80 years, the median curves fluctuated within the interval of less than two points. The distance between the median curves of men and women was also less than two points. On the average, the median difference was half a point on the finger (p = 0.249) and the ear lobe (p = 0.083). Conclusion Less than two points is below the minimal clinically important difference for a zero to ten analogue pain rating scale; differences smaller than one point are even below the resolution of the scale.

We took a hermeneutic approach in our analysis of the 206 included articles, which resulted in the development of a conceptual framework surfacing the underlying logics by which technology-supported epilepsy care is organised. Each of these logics enacts different techno-scientific futures and carries specific assumptions about how (often imagined) 'users' and their bodies become co-constituted. Our review shows that studies in this area remain primarily deterministic and technology-focused. Few draw phenomenological insights on lived experiences with epilepsy or use social theory to problematise the role of technology.

In some patients, biopsies have revealed collapsing glomerulopathy, a distinct form of glomerular injury that has been associated with other viruses, including HIV. Previous patient reports have described patients of African ancestry who developed nephrotic-range proteinuria and AKI early in the course of disease. METHODS In this patient series, we identified six patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), AKI, and nephrotic-range proteinuria. COVID-19 was diagnosed by a positive nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We examined biopsy specimens from one transplanted kidney and five native kidneys. Three of the six patients underwent genetic analysis of APOL1, the gene encoding the APOL1 protein, from DNA extracted from peripheral blood. In addition, we purified genomic DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue and performed APOL1 genotype analysis of one of the native biopsies and the donor kidney graft. RESULTS All six patients were of recent African ancestry. They developed COVID-19-associated AKI with podocytopathy, collapsing glomerulopathy, or both. Patients exhibited generally mild respiratory symptoms, and no patient required ventilator support. Genetic testing performed in three patients confirmed high-risk APOL1 genotypes. One APOL1 high-risk patient developed collapsing glomerulopathy in the engrafted kidney, which was transplanted from a donor who carried a low-risk APOL1 genotype; this contradicts current models of APOL1-mediated kidney injury, and suggests that intrinsic renal expression of APOL1 may not be the driver of nephrotoxicity and specifically, of podocyte injury. CONCLUSIONS Glomerular disease presenting as proteinuria with or without AKI is an important presentation of COVID-19 infection and may be associated with a high-risk APOL1 genotype.","Shetty, Aneesha A; Tawhari, Ibrahim; Safar-Boueri, Luisa; Seif, Nay; Alahmadi, Ameen; Gargiulo, Richard; Aggarwal, Vikram; Usman, Irtaza; Kisselev, Sergey; Gharavi, Ali G; Kanwar, Yahspal; Quaggin, Susan E",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,14,1

Those compensatory mutants isolated in bacteria and yeast with altered tRNA or protein factors are reviewed here and are considered to primarily cause altered P-site realignment and not altered translocation. Though the first sequenced tRNA mutant which suppressed a +1 frameshift mutation had an extra base in its anticodon loop and led to a textbook ""yardstick"" model in which the number of anticodon bases determines codon size, this model has long been discounted, although not by all. Accordingly, the reviewed data suggest that reading frame maintenance and translocation are two distinct features of the ribosome. None of the -1 tRNA suppressors have anticodon loops with fewer than the standard seven nucleotides. Many of the tRNA mutants potentially affect tRNA bending and/or stability and can be used for functional assays, and one has the conserved C74 of the 3' CCA substituted. The effect of tRNA modification deficiencies on framing has been particularly informative. The properties of some mutants suggest the use of alternative tRNA anticodon loop stack conformations by individual tRNAs in one translation cycle. The mutant proteins range from defective release factors with delayed decoding of A-site stop codons facilitating P-site frameshifting to altered EF-Tu/EF1alpha to mutant ribosomal large- and small-subunit proteins L9 and S9.

METHODS A multidisciplinary committee developed an EVALI algorithm on the basis of guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients diagnosed with EVALI. Descriptive analyses included sociodemographic characteristics, clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging results, pulmonary function testing, oxygen requirements, and clinic follow-up. RESULTS Thirteen hospitalized adolescents were diagnosed with confirmed or probable EVALI. The majority were female (54%) with a mean age of 15.9 years. Sixty-nine percent of patients presented with respiratory symptoms, whereas gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent in 85% of patients. Vaping Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol was reported in 92% of patients, and vaping nicotine was reported in 62% of patients. All had bilateral ground-glass opacities on the chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Treatment with glucocorticoids led to clinical improvement in 11 of 12 patients.

DESIGN a population-based retrospective cohort study on prospectively collected data was conducted. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS the cohort included all swab positive cases aged 40 years older (No. 18,286) among residents in the territory of the Milan's Agency for Health Protection (ATS-MI) up to 27.04.2020. Data on comorbidities were obtained from the ATS administrative database of chronic conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES to predict 30-day mortality risk, a multivariable logistic regression model, including age, gender, and the selected conditions, was developed following the TRIPOD guidelines. Discrimination and calibration of the model were assessed. RESULTS after age and gender, the most important predictors of 30-day mortality were diabetes, tumour in first-line treatment, chronic heart failure, and complicated diabetes. The bootstrap-validated c-index was 0.78, which suggests that this model is useful in predicting death after COVID-19 infection in swab positive cases. The model had good discrimination (Brier score 0.13) and was well calibrated (Index of prediction accuracy of 14.8%). CONCLUSIONS a risk prediction model for 30-day mortality in a large COVID-19 cohort aged 40 years or older was developed.

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional research. METHODS Data were taken from the Hamburg survey of homeless individuals (n = 151). HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D tool. More precisely, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire was used to quantify problems in five health dimensions (i.e. mobility, self-care, usually activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), and its visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) was used to record the according self-rated health status. Explanatory variables include sex, age, education, marital status, country of origin, health insurance, and chronic alcohol consumption. RESULTS With regard to HRQoL, most frequently, problems were reported as pain/discomfort (47.3%), followed by anxiety/depression (32.4%), mobility (29.7%), usual activities (20.7%) and self-care (4.6%). The mean EQ-VAS score was 75.34 (SD 22.23; range 1-100), and the mean EQ-5D-5L index was 0.84 (SD 0.23; range 0.32-1). Regressions showed increasing problems in mobility and self-care with higher age, whereas EQ-VAS was positively associated with younger age. Furthermore, EQ-5D-5L index was positively associated with younger age and higher education. Summarized, among this cohort, a higher age is associated with a lower HRQoL. CONCLUSION Remarkably high EQ-VAS values and rather few problems in the five dimensions investigated here were reported among the homeless individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic particularly compared with the general population. Moreover, study findings particularly stress the link between higher age and lower HRQoL among homeless individuals. This knowledge is important to address homeless individuals at risk of poor HRQoL. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm the given findings.","van Rüth, V; König, H-H; Bertram, F; Schmiedel, P; Ondruschka, B; Püschel, K; Heinrich, F; Hajek, A",Public health,14,1

By binding to the corresponding receptors, IFNs trigger different pathways to block intracellular replication and growth of pathogens and to impede the infection of surrounding cells. Due to their key role in host defense against viral infections, as well as for clinical therapies, the IFN responses and regulation mechanisms are well studied. However, studies of type I IFNs have mainly focused on alpha interferon (IFN-α) and IFN-β subtypes. Knowledge of IFN-κ and IFN-ω is limited. Moreover, most studies are performed in humans or mouse models but not in the original host of zoonotic pathogens. Bats are important reservoirs and transmitters of zoonotic viruses such as lyssaviruses. A few studies have shown an antiviral activity of IFNs in fruit bats. However, the function of type I IFNs against lyssaviruses in bats has not been studied yet. Here, IFN-κ and IFN-ω genes from the European serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, were cloned and functionally characterized. E. serotinus IFN-κ and IFN-ω genes are intronless and well conserved between microchiropteran species. The promoter regions of both genes contain essential regulatory elements for transcription factors. In vitro studies indicated a strong activation of IFN signaling by recombinant IFN-ω, whereas IFN-κ displayed weaker activation. Noticeably, both IFNs inhibit to different extents the replication of different lyssaviruses in susceptible bat cell lines. The present study provides functional data on the innate host defense against lyssaviruses in endangered European bats. IMPORTANCE We describe here for the first time the molecular and functional characterization of two type I interferons (IFN-κ and -ω) from European serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus). The importance of this study is mainly based on the fact that very limited information about the early innate immune response against bat lyssaviruses in their natural host serotine bats is yet available. Generally, whereas the antiviral activity of other type I interferons is well studied, the functional involvement of IFN-κ and -ω has not yet been investigated.","He, Xiaocui; Korytař, Tomaš; Schatz, Juliane; Freuling, Conrad M; Müller, Thomas; Köllner, Bernd",Journal of virology,14,29

Laparotomy in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) is associated with an increased risk of morbidity. Furthermore, standard protocol recommends removal of the PD catheter when surgery on the intestine is required. As far as we are aware, this is the first case report of laparoscopic right hemicolectomy in a patient on automated PD where the PD catheter was left in situ. Case Report. A 61-year-old man man on APD who presented with a caecal carcinoma was stabilised on temporary haemodialysis (HD) prior to undergoing a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy without removal of the PD catheter. He made an uneventful recovery and APD was resumed successfully 2 weeks after surgery. Discussion. PD patients undergoing intra-abdominal surgery are at increased risk of complications. While the benefits of laparoscopic surgery in the standard surgical population are well established, there is limited experience of the technique in PD patients. Possible advantages could theoretically be early resumption of PD as well as less PD failure due to the formation of adhesions. Conclusion. Our experience with this case indicates that laparoscopic right hemicolectomy in a background of PD can be undertaken without removal of the PD catheter and is associated with early resumption of PD.","Attard, Joseph A; Attard, Alexander",Case reports in surgery,14,1

ABCB4 is an ATP-dependent transporter that reduces the harsh detergent effect of the bile salts by counteracting self-digestion. To do so ABCB4 provides PC-lipids for extraction into bile. PC-lipids account for 40% of the entire pool of lipids in the canalicular membrane with an unknown distribution over both leaflets. Extracted PC lipids end up in so-called mixed micelles. Mixed micelles are composed of phospholipids, bile salts and cholesterol. 90-95% of the phospholipids are member of the of the PC family, but only a subset of mainly 16.0-18:1 PC and 16:0-18:2 PC variants are present. To elucidate if ABCB4 is the key discriminator in this enrichment of specific PC-lipids, we used in vitro studies to identify crucial determinants substrate selection. We demonstrate PC-lipid moieties alone are insufficient for stimulating ABCB4 ATPase activity, and that at least two acyl chains and the backbone itself are required for a productive interaction. The nature of the fatty acids like length or saturation, has a quantitative impact on the ATPase activity.

The impact of splenomegaly on the feasibility of laparoscopic splenectomy is still debated. We hypothesized that splenic volumetry may accurately estimate splenic volume preoperatively and be used by surgeons to select patients for laparoscopic splenectomy. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 88 patients seen at a tertiary referral center undergoing laparoscopic or open splenectomy between 2001 and 2010. Patients included in the study underwent elective splenectomy without associated procedures and had preoperative imaging available at our institution. We evaluated clinical, demographic characteristics and perioperative imaging as predictors of outcome. Study endpoints included conversion to open splenectomy, operating time, estimated blood loss (EBL), length of stay (LOS), postoperative complications, and mortality. RESULTS In all, 53 procedures were started laparoscopically. Among them, 7 (13.2 %) were converted to open splenectomy and 7 (13.2 %) to hand-assisted laparoscopic splenectomy. The conversion group was matched with 35 patients who underwent open splenectomy to determine differences in outcomes between these groups. There were no conversions in spleens measuring <1100 cc, whereas spleens of 1100 to 2700 cc had a conversion rate of 41 %. Spleen volume >2700 cc was associated with an 87.5 % conversion rate. Spleen 3D volumetry >2700 cc was the only independent predictor of surgical conversion on multivariate analysis (odds ratio 38.0, confidence interval 4.02-358.75, p = 0.001). Patients who underwent open splenectomy had shorter operating times (160.3 vs. 253.0 min, p = 0.001) than those converted from laparoscopic to open splenectomy. CONCLUSIONS A 3D reconstructed splenic volume of >2700 cc is a predictor of conversion from laparoscopic to open splenectomy. For spleens measuring <2700 cc, laparoscopic splenectomy may be performed by experienced surgeons with low to moderate rates of conversion. For spleens with a 3D reconstructed volume >2700 cc, laparoscopic splenectomy is associated with high rates of conversion to open surgery.","Filicori, Filippo; Stock, Cameron; Schweitzer, Andrew D; Keutgen, Xavier M; Lagratta, Maria D; Zarnegar, Rasa; Fahey, Thomas J",World journal of surgery,14,1

CONCLUSIONS In older patients, typical clinical symptoms and blood test changes were often absent; however, CT always contained typical findings of COVID-19, suggesting that CT may be a useful diagnostic tool. Our report illustrates that appropriate treatment, taking patient background into consideration, may improve their condition regardless of age.

Little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms regulating muscle protein homeostasis during the recovery or convalescence phase. We adapted a sepsis-recovery mouse model that uses cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), followed 24 h later by cecal resection and antibiotic treatment, to identify putative cellular pathways regulating protein synthesis and breakdown in skeletal muscle. Ten days after CLP, body weight and food consumption did not differ between control and sepsis-recovery mice, but gastrocnemius weight was reduced. During sepsis-recovery, muscle protein synthesis was increased 2-fold and associated with enhanced mTOR kinase activity (4E-BP1 and S6K1 phosphorylation). The sepsis-induced increase in 4E-BP1 was associated with enhanced formation of the eIF4E-eIF4G active cap-dependent complex, while the increased S6K1 was associated with increased phosphorylation of downstream targets S6 and eIF4B. Proximal to mTOR, sepsis-recovery increased Akt and TSC2 phosphorylation, did not alter AMPK phosphorylation, and decreased REDD1 protein content. Despite the decreased mRNA content for the E3 ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1 and muscle RING-finger 1, proteasomal activity was increased 50%. In contrast, sepsis-recovery was associated with an apparent decrease in autophagy (e.g., increased ULK-1 phosphorylation, decreased LCB3-II, and increased p62). The mRNA content for IL-1β, IL-18, TNFα, and IL-6 in muscle was elevated in sepsis-recovery. During recovery after sepsis skeletal muscle responds with an increase in Akt-TSC2-mTOR-dependent protein synthesis and decreased autophagy, but full restoration of muscle protein content may be slowed by the continued stimulation of ubiquitin-proteasome activity.","Crowell, Kristen T; Soybel, David I; Lang, Charles H",Shock,14,31

We set out to design, implement, and evaluate a mobile diagnostic laboratory accompanying a type 2 emergency medical team (EMT) field hospital. METHODS Available diagnostic platforms were reviewed and selected against in field need. Platforms included HemoCue301/WBC DIFF, i-STAT, BIOFIRE FILMARRAY multiplex rt-PCR, Olympus BX53 microscopy, ABO/Rh grouping, and specific rapid diagnostic tests. This equipment was trialed in Katherine, Australia, and Dili, Timor-Leste. RESULTS During the initial deployment, an evaluation of FilmArray tests was successful using blood culture identification, gastrointestinal, and respiratory panels. HemoCue301 (n = 20) hemoglobin values were compared on Sysmex XN 550 (r = 0.94). HemoCue WBC DIFF had some variation, dependent on the cell, when compared with Sysmex XN 550 (r = 0.88-0.16). i-STAT showed nonsignificant differences against Vitros 250. Further evaluation of FilmArray in Dili, Timor-Leste, diagnosed 117 pathogens on 168 FilmArray pouches, including 25 separate organisms on blood culture and 4 separate cerebrospinal fluid pathogens. CONCLUSION This mobile laboratory represents a major advance in sudden onset disaster. Setup of the service was quick (< 24 hr) and transport to site rapid. Future deployment in fragmented health systems after sudden onset disasters with EMT2 will now allow broader diagnostic capability.","Marr, Ian; Francis, Joshua R; Stephens, Dianne P; Marshall, Kristy; Read, David J; Baird, Rob W; Coatsworth, Nicholas",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,14,17

These consequences include infertility, cancers of male organs, transmission to the embryo/fetal development abnormalities and sexual dissemination of major viral pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Lately, two emerging viruses, Zika and Ebola, have additionally revealed that the human MGT can constitute a reservoir for viruses cleared from peripheral circulation by the immune system, leading to their sexual transmission by cured men. This represents a concern for future epidemics and further underlines the need for a better understanding of the interplay between viruses and the MGT. We review here how viruses, from ancient viruses that integrated the germ line during evolution through old viruses (e.g. papillomaviruses originating from Neanderthals) and more modern sexually-transmitted infections (e.g. simian zoonotic HIV) to emerging viruses (e.g. Ebola and Zika) take advantage of genital tract colonization for horizontal dissemination, viral persistence, vertical transmission and endogenization. The MGT immune responses to viruses and the impact of these infections are discussed. We summarize the latest data regarding the sources of viruses in semen and the complex role of this body fluid in sexual transmission. Finally, we introduce key animal findings that are relevant for our understanding of viral infection and persistence in the human MGT and suggest future research directions.","Le Tortorec, Anna; Matusali, Giulia; Mahé, Dominique; Aubry, Florence; Mazaud-Guittot, Severine; Houzet, Laurent; Dejucq-Rainsford, Nathalie",Physiological reviews,14,16

The purpose of this study was to present an initial experience with a fill and tunnel technique for reconstructive endovascular treatment of these conditions. METHODS A total of 13 patients, 11 men and 2 women, each with a fusiform vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm not amenable to internal trapping of the parent artery, underwent reconstructive endovascular treatment using a fill and tunnel technique between January 2012 and December 2015. The safety, feasibility, and clinical and angiographic outcomes of these procedures were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS The average maximum diameter of the fusiform aneurysms was 12.1 mm. Five were ruptured. Three aneurysms were treated with a single stent and the remaining 10 aneurysms required double-stent placement. Treatment was technically successful in all 13 patients, achieving complete occlusion ( n = 10, 76.9%) and near-complete occlusion ( n = 3, 23.1%). No procedure-related complications occurred in any patient. There were no delayed thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications during the follow-up period (mean, 19.0 months). Angiographic follow-ups (mean, 9.1 months) showed stable occlusion in 90.9% (10/11) and asymptomatic in-stent occlusion in one patient (9.1%, 1/11). At the end of the observation period (mean, 19.0 months), all patients had excellent clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0, 92.3%, 12/13), except one (mRS 4), resulting from poor preoperative status. CONCLUSIONS This retrospective study demonstrated that endovascular reconstruction using a fill-and-tunnel technique was a technically safe, feasible, and clinically effective treatment method for fusiform vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms with ipsilateral dominance.","Kyeung Ko, Jun; Weon Lee, Sang; Hwa Choi, Chang; Lee, Tae Hong","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",14,16

Artificial nutrition and hydration are a medical intervention, requiring an indication, a therapeutic goal and the will (consent) of the competent patient. METHODS The guideline was developed by an international multidisciplinary working group based on the main aspects of the Guideline on ""Ethical and Legal Aspects of Artificial Nutrition"" published 2013 by the German Society for Nutritional Medicine (DGEM) after conducting a review of specific current literature. The text was extended and introduced a broader view in particular on the impact of culture and religion. The results were discussed at the ESPEN Congress in Lisbon 2015 and accepted in an online survey among ESPEN members. RESULTS The ESPEN Guideline on Ethical Aspects of Artificial Nutrition and Hydration is focused on the adult patient and provides a critical summary for physicians and caregivers. Special consideration is given to end of life issues and palliative medicine; to dementia and to specific situations like nursing care or the intensive care unit. The respect for autonomy is an important focus of the guideline as well as the careful wording to be used in the communication with patients and families. The other principles of Bioethics like beneficence, non-maleficence and justice are presented in the context of artificial nutrition and hydration. In this respect the withholding and withdrawing of artificial nutrition and/or hydration is discussed. Due to increasingly multicultural societies and the need for awareness of different values and beliefs an elaborated chapter is dedicated to cultural and religious issues and nutrition. Last but not least topics like voluntary refusal of nutrition and fluids, and forced feeding of competent persons (persons on hunger strike) is included in the guideline.","Druml, Christiane; Ballmer, Peter E; Druml, Wilfred; Oehmichen, Frank; Shenkin, Alan; Singer, Pierre; Soeters, Peter; Weimann, Arved; Bischoff, Stephan C",Clinical nutrition,14,8

The mechanisms of the effect of process parameters on primary granule properties (size and density) were proposed. Water amount showed significant effect on granule size and density. The effect of impeller speed was dependent on the granule mechanical properties and efficiency of liquid distribution in the granulator. Blend density was found to increase rapidly during wet massing. Liquid addition rate was the least consequential factor and showed minimal impact on granule density and growth.

Monocytes, M1 and M2 macrophages are mononuclear phagocytes. Studies suggest that M2 macrophages are profibrotic and might contribute to HTS formation. Our lab has established a human HTS-like nude mouse model, in which the grafted human skin develops red, raised, and firm scarring, resembling HTS seen in humans. In this study, we observed the natural behavior of mononuclear phagocyte system in this nude mouse model of dermal fibrosis at multiple time points. Thirty athymic nude mice received human skin grafts and an equal number of mice received mouse skin grafts as controls. The grafted skin and blood were harvested at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 weeks. Wound area, thickness, collagen morphology and level, the cell number of myofibroblasts, M1- and M2-like macrophages in the grafted skin, as well as monocyte fraction in the blood were investigated at each time points. Xenografted mice developed contracted and thickened scars grossly. The xenografted skin resembled human HTS tissue based on enhanced thickness, fibrotic orientation of collagen bundles, increased collagen level, and infiltration of myofibroblasts. In the blood, monocytes dramatically decreased at 1 week postgrafting and gradually returned to normal in the following 8 weeks. In the xenografted skin, M1-like macrophages were found predominantly at 1-2 weeks postgrafting; whereas, M2-like macrophages were abundant at later time points, 3-4 weeks postgrafting coincident with the development of fibrosis in the human skin tissues. This understanding of the natural behavior of mononuclear phagocytes in vivo in our mouse model provides evidence for the role of M2-like macrophages in fibrosis of human skin and suggests that macrophage depletion in the subacute phases of wound healing might reduce or prevent HTS formation.","Zhu, Zhensen; Ding, Jie; Ma, Zengshuan; Iwashina, Takashi; Tredget, Edward E",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,14,24

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of staple line reinforcement (SLR) in reducing leaks and bleeding after LSG. METHODS A total of 1162 patients underwent LSG (305 males, 857 females). The mean age was 43.7 years and the mean body mass index was 48 kg/m(2). The patients were divided into 6 groups based on the type of SLR, including a no-SLR control group, with evaluation of leaking and bleeding risk and correlation of patients' characteristics with complications. RESULTS A total of 189 patients underwent LSG without reinforcement. The SLR method was oversewing in 476 patients, bovine pericardium in 312, synthetic polyester in 76, glycolide/trimethylene copolymer in 63, and thrombin matrix in 46. The overall leak frequency was 2.8%; higher with synthetic polyester (7.8%), 4.8% with no reinforcement, and lower with bovine pericardium strips (.3%; P<.01). Postoperative hemorrhage occurred in 35 patients (3%), with a higher frequency being observed without SLR (13.7%; P = .02). Only diabetes was a risk-factor for a leak (P< .01). CONCLUSION SLR with bovine pericardium strips significantly reduced the leak risk. Postoperative bleeding was significantly lower with all SLR-methods, although there was no significant difference among the various techniques. Patients with type II diabetes had a higher risk of staple line leak after LSG.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This study, which had Animal Care and Use Committee approval, was performed in healthy, growing swine (weight range, 40-45 kg; n = 10). GACE was performed in five swine with the infusion of sodium morrhuate (125 mug) selectively into the gastric arteries that supply the fundus. Five control animals underwent a sham procedure with 5 mL of saline. Weight and fasting plasma ghrelin levels were obtained in animals at baseline and in weeks 1-4. Statistical testing for substantial differences in ghrelin blood levels over time and between treated and untreated animals was performed by using a cross-sectional time-series linear model with feasibility generalized least squares. RESULTS The pattern of the change in ghrelin levels over time was significantly different between control and treated animals (P < .004). In treated animals, ghrelin levels were significantly reduced at week 1 (mean, 664.1 pg/mL +/- 103.1 [standard error of the mean], P < .02), week 2 (mean, 618.1 pg/mL +/- 180.4, P < .001), week 3 (mean, 578.4 pg/mL +/- 214.9, P < .001), and week 4 (mean, 876.6 pg/mL +/- 228.6, P < .03) relative to baseline (mean, 1006.3 pg/mL +/- 190.1). The percentage change in serum ghrelin values in swine treated with GACE decreased from baseline to -34%, -38.6%, -42.5%, and -12.9% during weeks 1-4, respectively. In control swine, percentage change in serum ghrelin was -1.7%, -9.7%, +2.6%, and +18.2% during weeks 1-4, respectively. At the end of 4 weeks, control swine continued to gain weight, with a 15.1% increase from their original weight, while the weight in swine treated with GACE plateaued at an increase of 7.8% from the original weight. CONCLUSION Catheter-directed GACE can suppress the appetite hormone ghrelin and affect weight gain.","Arepally, Aravind; Barnett, Brad P; Patel, Tarak H; Howland, Valerie; Boston, Ray C; Kraitchman, Dara L; Malayeri, Ashkan A",Radiology,14,19

Here we describe the synthesis and application of a clickable nitro-fatty acid probe for the detection and first global identification of mammalian proteins that are susceptible to nitro-alkylation. 184 high confidence nitro-alkylated proteins were identified in human macrophages, majority of which are novel targets of nitro-fatty acids, including Extended synaptotagmin 2 (ESYT2), Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), Retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) and Glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1). In particular, we showed that 9-nitro-oleate covalently modified and inhibited dexamethasone binding to NR3C1. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that nitro-alkylated proteins are highly enriched in endoplasmic reticulum and transmembrane proteins, and are overrepresented in lipid metabolism and transport pathways.

The COVID-19 outbreak affected the whole world during the spring of 2020. Governments reacted by locking down countries and telling people to stay at home, and the university asked the students to work from home. Little previous research was found on managing virtual student teams, especially when not as initially planned. In this situation, many management tasks proved to require more effort than usual, such as managing team members, helping maintain work/home-balance for team members with families or focusing when working from home, and ensuring motivation and on-time project deliveries. The lock-down resulted in an increase of GitHub traffic on the software product. Reasons for this include (a) needing to commit software before the CDR, (b) strengthening of feeling that Github is a platform to work together in when the offices were closed, or (c) maturity of design in general increased contributions to code. All hardware integration efforts were put on hold, but team members expressed that they had time to focus on documentation. In a non-lockdown situation, they would not have done this because of prioritizing 'hands-on' work. This may be beneficial in the long run, especially for onboarding new members to the team. Management of a team during lockdown includes evaluating and improving the technical infrastructure necessary for digital collaboration, managing the diversity of situations and other soft issues of a team, and managing schedule impacts both in the short-term and long-term. We found that project managers must make explicit efforts to maintain the project culture and motivation. For example, make efforts to replace the informal interfaces that take place in a co-located team with questions and round-the-table off-topic discussions in stand-ups and meetings. Furthermore, when large changes such as a pandemic happen, it is important to adapt and reinforce the team culture and norms. We also found that having an agile culture made the team more responsive to the change in working norms, such that there was a high willingness to 'try out' the best way to lockdown-work. © 2021 IEEE.","Honore-Livermore, E.; Birkeland, R.","2021 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2021",14,26

The experimental method is used where students in the experimental and the control groups respond to the same survey at three different times (240 students);the focus group method is used with a group of nine students from the experimental group to obtain a deeper understanding of the results of the statistical analysis. The findings suggest a positive and significant effect of the cross-cultural management courses on the cultural intelligence level and the conflict management styles of students with obvious differences between male and female students. The findings confirm the importance of these courses and recommend making cross-cultural management courses core for all students to support their future global employability. Furthermore, experiential and blended learning techniques can replace international exposure, which is timely considering the constraints imposed on international travel due to COVID19. The study suggests a helpful insight to international business educators that can support the process of developing their programs through introducing specific courses and complementary teaching techniques that are effective and timely.","Fakhreldin, Hadia Youssef Noha Anis Marwa",Journal of Teaching in International Business,14,1

Patients received 16 mg/d of dexamethasone intravenously for five days followed by 8 mg/d of dexamethasone for five days, or 6 mg/d of dexamethasone intravenously for 10 days. Results: Data from 98 patients who received at least one dose of dexamethasone were analyzed. At 28 days after randomization, there was no difference between high and low-dose dexamethasone groups in VFD (median, 0 d [interquartile range (IQR) 0-14 d] versus 0 d [IQR 0-1 d]; P=0.231).

Design/methodology/approach: A randomized pretest-posttest control group field experiment was designed to assess participants’ self-efficacy and learning outcome of an online training program - territory business management plan, under three conditions: instructor accessibility, active learning, and controlled. Participants (N=87) were medical sales representatives from a Fortune-Global 500 pharmaceutical company’s subsidiary office in China. Data was analyzed with 2 (time) x 3 (group) MANOVA with time (pretest and posttest) as a repeated measure to investigate differences in changes in self-efficacy and learning outcome between three groups. Findings: Overall, participants’ self-efficacy and learning outcome were significantly improved via the online training program for all three groups. Specifically, the impact of the training on learning outcome was the strongest for the active learning group, less strong for the instructor accessibility group, and the least strong for the control group. Originality/value: Our research contributes towards understandings of the effectiveness of online talent training programs by examining two critical instructional design factors during a time of crisis. Our findings suggest that active learning (interactions with the training materials by purposeful self-reflection) might be a stronger predictor for increasing learning outcome than instructor accessibility (receiving feedback and tutoring sessions from the instructor) for online training programs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Wang, X.; Lin, W.; Jiang, Y.; Wu, Y.; Liu, Y.; Zhou, W.

Although it can reveal the specimen's size and shape information, the chemical composition is inaccessible in interferometric measurements. Infrared spectroscopic imaging provides chemical specificity based on inherent chemical bond vibrations of specimens but lacks the ability to image and resolve individual nanoparticles due to long infrared wavelengths. Here, we describe a bond-selective interferometric scattering microscope where the mid-infrared induced photothermal signal is detected by a visible beam in a wide-field common-path interferometry configuration. A thin film layered substrate is utilized to reduce the reflected light and provide a reference field for the interferometric detection of the weakly scattered field. A pulsed mid-IR laser is employed to modulate the interferometric signal. Subsequent demodulation via a virtual lock-in camera offers simultaneous chemical information about tens of micro- or nano-particles. The chemical contrast arises from a minute change in the particle's scattered field in consequence of the vibrational absorption at the target molecule. We characterize the system with sub-wavelength polymer beads and highlight biological applications by chemically imaging several microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. A theoretical framework is established to extend bond-selective interferometric scattering microscopy to a broad range of biological micro- and nano-particles.","Yurdakul, Celalettin; Zong, Haonan; Bai, Yeran; Cheng, Ji-Xin; Unlu, M.

Using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrate that a dominant negative rab1a mutant, rab1a(N124I), defective for guanine nucleotide binding in vitro, leads to the accumulation of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) in numerous pre-cis-Golgi vesicles and vesicular-tubular clusters containing rab1 and beta-COP, a subunit of the coatomer complex. Similar to previous observations (Balch et al. 1994. Cell. 76:841-852), VSV-G was concentrated nearly 5-10-fold in vesicular carriers that accumulate in the presence of the rab1a(N124I) mutant. VSV-G containing vesicles and vesicular-tubular clusters were also found to accumulate in the presence of a rab1a effector domain peptide mimetic that inhibits endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport, as well as in the absence of Ca2+.

OBJECTIVE The objective of this investigation is to assess trends of expenditures and utilization of facet joint interventions in FFS Medicare population from 2009 to 2018. STUDY DESIGN The study was designed to analyze trends of expenditures and utilization of facet joint interventions in FFS Medicare population from 2009-2018 in the United States. In this manuscript: • A patient was considered as undergoing facet joint interventions throughout the year. • A visit included all regions treated during the visit. • An episode was considered as one per region utilizing primary codes only. • Services or procedures were considered all procedures (multiple levels). Data for the analysis was obtained from the standard 5% national sample of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) physician outpatient billing claims for those enrolled in the FFS Medicare program from 2009 to 2018. All the expenditures were presented with allowed costs and also were inflation adjusted to 2018 US dollars. RESULTS This analysis showed expenditures increased by 79% from 2009 to 2018 in the form of total cost for facet joint interventions, at an annual rate of 6.7%. Cervical and lumbar radiofrequency neurotomy procedures increased 185% and 169%. However, inflation-adjusted expenditures with 2018 US dollars showed an overall increase of 53% with an annual increase of 4.9%. In addition, using inflation-adjusted expenditures per procedures increased, the overall 6% with an annual increase of 0.7%. Overall, per patient costs, with inflation adjustment, decreased from $1,925 to $1,785 with a decline of 7% and an annual decline of 0.8%. Allowed charges per visit also declined after inflation adjustment from $951.76 to $849.86 with an overall decline of 11% and an annual decline of 1.3%. Staged episodes of radiofrequency neurotomy were performed in 23.9% of patients and more than 2 episodes for radiofrequency neurotomy in 6.9%, in lumbar spine and 19.6% staged and 5.1% more than 2 episodes in cervical spine of patients in 2018. LIMITATIONS This analysis is limited by inclusion of only the FFS Medicare population, without adding utilization patterns of Medicare Advantage plans, which constitutes almost 30% of the Medicare population. CONCLUSIONS Even after adjusting for inflation, there was a significant increase for the expenditures of facet joint interventions with an overall 53% increase. Costs per patient and cost per visit declined. Inflation-adjusted cost per year declined 7% overall and 0.8% annually from $1,925 to $1,785, and inflation-adjusted cost per visit also declined 11% annually and 1.3% per year from $952 in 2009 to $850 in 2018.

METHODS This retrospective study was conducted on 31 patients diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia and 21 patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia from January 2011 to December 2012 in the Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey. We investigated the clinical characteristics, radiological, and laboratory findings of patients from their medical records. RESULTS The female/male ratio of patients with bacterial was 1.0/1.8, and with viral pneumonias was 1.0/2.0. The mean patient age was 59+/-51 months. There was a statistically significant difference in the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (2.7 versus 0.6, p<0.001) and CRP/MPV ratio (11.0 versus 9.3, p<0.001) in the cases with bacterial pneumonia versus those who had viral pneumonia. Nine of the patients were identified as having complications. There was a statistically significant difference in the N/L ratio (3.5 versus 1.2, p=0.01) and CRP/MPV ratio (11.1 versus 3.9, p=0.001) in the cases that developed complications compared with those that did not. When the neutrophil/lymphocyte and CRP/MPV ratios were used jointly, the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia could be correctly estimated in 28 (90.3%) cases (odds ratio [OR]=0.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-0.29, p<0.001) and pneumonia-related complications were predicted in 8 (88.9%) cases (OR=13.5, 95% CI: 1.5-118.1, p=0.005). CONCLUSION It was observed that the combined use of N/L and CRP/MPV ratios might be used in both the differential diagnosis of bacterial versus viral pneumonia, and the prediction of complications.","Bekdas, Mervan; Goksugur, Sevil B; Sarac, Esma G; Erkocoglu, Mustafa; Demircioglu, Fatih",Saudi medical journal,14,1

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A multicenter, single-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a larger RCT to determine the effect of the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration on bleeding risk. Patients with acute leukemia receiving induction chemotherapy or those undergoing stem cell transplantation were assigned to one of two treatment groups: standard transfusion strategy (transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells [RBCs] when their Hb level was less than 80 g/L) or an augmented transfusion strategy (transfusion of 2 units of RBCs when their Hb level was less than 120 g/L). RESULTS Sixty patients were enrolled: 29 in the control group and 31 in the experimental group. The proportions of patients experiencing clinically significant bleeding and the time to first bleed were not significantly different between the control and experimental groups. The experimental group received more RBC transfusions (transfusions/patient-day) than the control group (0.233 vs. 0.151; relative risk, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.10; p = 0.003). The proportion of patient-days with platelet (PLT) transfusions was not different between the experimental and control groups. The mean number of donor exposures (PLT and RBC transfusions) was not different between experimental and control groups. Bleeding symptoms were systematically documented. CONCLUSION This pilot study thus indicated that it would be feasible to enroll the required number of patients to enable the performance of a large RCT to investigate the effect of Hb on bleeding risk in thrombocytopenic patients.","Webert, Kathryn E; Cook, Richard J; Couban, Stephen; Carruthers, Julie; Lee, Ker-Ai; Blajchman, Morris A; Lipton, Jeffrey H; Brandwein, Joseph M; Heddle, Nancy M",Transfusion,14,1

Four major structural proteins were characterized in the present study: two glycosylated proteins with estimated molecular masses of 42 and 50 kDa, one 66-kDa phosphoprotein, and one 22-kDa protein. Examination of lysed virions revealed the two glycoproteins and the 22-kDa protein in the soluble fraction, while the 66-kDa phosphoprotein and a minor part of the 22-kDa protein were found in the pelleted fraction. Immunofluorescence staining of infected cells demonstrated that the 22-kDa protein was a late protein accumulating in the nucleus. We conclude that the 66-kDa protein is the nucleoprotein, the 22-kDa protein is the matrix protein, and the 42- and 50-kDa proteins are the surface proteins. Radioimmunoprecipitation analysis of the 42-kDa glycoprotein, which was previously shown to represent the ISAV hemagglutinin, indicated that this protein exists at least as dimers. Further, by labeling of purified ISAV with [1,3-(3)H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate, it was also demonstrated that the viral esterase is located with the hemagglutinin. This finding was confirmed by demonstration of acetylesterase activity in affinity-purified hemagglutinin preparations. Finally, the active-site serine residue could be tentatively identified at position 32 within the amino acid sequence of the hemagglutinin of ISAV strain Glesvaer/2/90. It is proposed that the ISAV vp66 protein be termed nucleoprotein, the gp42 protein be termed HE protein, and the vp22 protein be termed matrix protein.","Falk, Knut; Aspehaug, Vidar; Vlasak, Reinhard; Endresen, Curt",Journal of virology,14,19

Nonpathogenic Bacillus subtilis var. niger was chosen as a surrogate for Bacillus anthracis. Three animal viruses; transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), avian pneumovirus (APV), and fowlpox virus were chosen as surrogates for three human viruses; SARS coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and smallpox virus; respectively. These bacteria and viruses were nebulized in separate tests and injected into the test duct of the test facility upstream of a MERV 14 filter. SKC Biosamplers upstream and downstream of the test filter served as reference samplers. The collection efficiency of the filter media was calculated to be 96.5 +/- 1.5% for B. subtilis, however no collection efficiency was measured for the viruses as no live virus was ever recovered from the downstream samplers. Filter samples were cut from the test filter and eluted by hand-shaking. An extraction efficiency of 105 +/- 19% was calculated for B. subtilis. The viruses were extracted at much lower efficiencies (0.7-20%).

Although rare, these hernias can go undetected due to preservation of the skin overlying the hernia defect. Open repairs can be challenging and unsuccessful due to avulsion of muscle directly from the iliac crest, with or without bone loss. A laparoscopic approach to traumatic abdominal wall hernia can aid in the delineation of the hernia and allow for a safe and effective repair. CASE DESCRIPTION A 36-year-old female was admitted to our Level 1 trauma center with a traumatic abdominal wall hernia located in the right flank near the iliac crest after being involved in a high-impact motor vehicle collision. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen revealed the presence of an abdominal wall defect that was unapparent on physical examination. The traumatic abdominal wall hernia in the right flank was successfully repaired laparoscopically. One-year follow-up has shown no sign of recurrence. DISCUSSION A traumatic abdominal wall hernia rarely presents following blunt trauma, but should be suspected following a high-impact motor vehicle collision. Frequently, repair is complicated by the need to have fixation of mesh to bony landmarks (eg, iliac crest). In spite of this challenge, the laparoscopic approach with tension-free mesh repair of a traumatic abdominal wall hernia can be accomplished successfully using an approach similar to that taken for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.","Wilson, Kenneth L; Davis, Mustafa K; Rosser, James C",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,14,17

In the present study, a DI cDNA containing one UCUAAAC consensus sequence in the middle of the 0.3-kb-long intergenic region located between genes 6 and 7 was constructed. From this DI cDNA clone, 21 mutant DI RNAs were constructed so that each of the seven consensus sequence nucleotides was changed individually to the three alternative bases. These mutants were used to define how changes in the integrity of MHV transcription consensus sequence UCUAAAC affected mRNA transcription. Except for two mutants with the sequences UGUAAAC and UCGAAAC, all of the mutants supported efficient subgenomic DI RNA transcription. This indicated that MHV transcription regulation was sufficiently flexible to recognize altered consensus sequences. Next, these and other mutants were used to examine the leader-body fusion site on the subgenomic DI RNAs. Sequence analysis demonstrated that all subgenomic DI RNAs analyzed contained two pentanucleotide sequences; the first sequence seemed to be contributed by the leader, and the leader-body fusion most likely took place at either the first or the second nucleotide of the second sequence. This observation was not consistent with the proposed coronavirus transcription model (S. C. Baker and M. M. C. Lai, EMBO J. 9:4173-4179, 1990) which states that nucleotide mismatch can be corrected by RNA polymerase proofreading activity.","Joo, M; Makino, S",Journal of virology,14,7

Influenza A viruses of subtype H5N1 also caused severe respiratory disease in humans in Hong Kong in 1997 and 2003, including at least seven fatal cases, posing a serious human pandemic threat. Between the end of February and the end of May 2003, a fowl plague outbreak occurred in The Netherlands. A highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of subtype H7N7, closely related to low pathogenic virus isolates obtained from wild ducks, was isolated from chickens. The same virus was detected subsequently in 86 humans who handled affected poultry and in three of their family members. Of these 89 patients, 78 presented with conjunctivitis, 5 presented with conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness, 2 presented with influenza-like illness, and 4 did not fit the case definitions. Influenza-like illnesses were generally mild, but a fatal case of pneumonia in combination with acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred also. Most virus isolates obtained from humans, including probable secondary cases, had not accumulated significant mutations. However, the virus isolated from the fatal case displayed 14 amino acid substitutions, some of which may be associated with enhanced disease in this case. Because H7N7 viruses have caused disease in mammals, including horses, seals, and humans, on several occasions in the past, they may be unusual in their zoonotic potential and, thus, form a pandemic threat to humans.","Fouchier, Ron A M; Schneeberger, Peter M; Rozendaal, Frans W; Broekman, Jan M; Kemink, Stiena A G; Munster, Vincent; Kuiken, Thijs; Rimmelzwaan, Guus F; Schutten, Martin; Van Doornum, Gerard J J; Koch, Guus; Bosman, Arnold; Koopmans, Marion; Osterhaus, Albert D M E",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,14,17

Moving beyond typical settings in the exponential distribution family, it is usually challenging to prove the existence and further construct such UMVUE in finite samples. For example in the ongoing Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT), it is hard to characterize the complete sufficient statistics of the underlying treatment effect due to pre-planned modifications to design aspects based on accumulated unblinded data. As an alternative solution, we propose a Deep Neural Networks (DNN) guided ensemble learning framework to construct an improved estimator from existing ones. We show that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically reaches the minimal variance within the class of linearly combined estimators. Simulation studies are further performed to demonstrate that our proposed estimator has considerable finite-sample efficiency gain. In the ACTT on COVID-19 as an important application, our method essentially contributes to a more ethical and efficient adaptive clinical trial with fewer patients enrolled.","Zhan, Tianyu; Fu, Haoda; Kang, Jian",ArXiv,14,19

A new regimen of cocktail therapy that consists of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) and oral alendronate was utilized in four patients with eight hips. This study evaluated the outcomes of cocktail therapy with a 4-year followup. METHODS There were 3 women and 1 man with an average age of 26 +/- 3.8 years. Each hip was treated with 6000 impulses of ESWT at 0.62 mJ/mm2 energy flux density in a single session. Each patient received HBO treatment for 100 sessions and oral alendronate for one year. The evaluations included pain score and Harris hip score, radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the affected hips. RESULTS At the 4-year follow-up, significant improvements in pain score and Harris hip score were observed in all cases (p < 0.001). All patients returned to work as healthcare providers. None required surgical intervention including hip replacement. MRI showed a trend of reduction in bone marrow edema and the size of the lesion, but no changes in the stage of the lesion. CONCLUSION Cocktail therapy seems promising in delaying the disease progression of SARS-associated femoral head necrosis in the short-term.","Wong, To; Wang, Ching-Jen; Hsu, Shan-Lin; Chou, Wen-Yi; Lin, Po-Chun; Huang, Chung-Cheng",Chang Gung medical journal,14,9

Receptors for many animal viruses have been identified. The specificity of virus-receptor interactions clearly affects the species specificity of virus infection, and in some instances may be an important determinant of viral tissue tropism. In this paper, the specificity of coronavirus-receptor interactions is summarized. Porcine and human coronaviruses utilize aminopeptidase N as their receptors, but in a species-specific manner. Mouse hepatitis virus uses several rodent glycoproteins in the carcinoembryonic antigen family as receptors. In addition, some coronaviruses can interact with carbohydrate moieties on the cell surface. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of virus-receptor interactions may lead to development of novel strategies for the control of enteric viral diseases.","Holmes, K V; Tresnan, D B; Zelus, B D",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,14,8

This paper measures the influence on the intention to get vaccinated of three usual variables in studies on consumer behavior: the perception of the efficiency and risk of the vaccine and the social influence. METHODS It was used a survey of 600 residents in Spain that was answered during September 2020 has been used. That survey was conveniently stratified by age and monthly income. The impact of the explanatory variables on the intention to use the vaccine was measured with generalized linear models: logistic regression and truncated negative binomial regression. Contro variables were gender, age and monthly income. RESULTS We have observed a positive (negative) influence of the variables efficacy perception and social influence (perception of risk), i.e. a ratio of rate use above (below) 1 that is statistically significant (p<0.01 in the case of the first two variables and p<0.05 in the third). Their importance follows the order described above. Neither gender nor age were significant in the intention to get vaccinated, but the income level was. We identified that at the highest income levels there was a greater propensity to reject the vaccine (p<0.1). CONCLUSIONS The results may be useful to guide the information policy that health authorities should carry out in order to induce the population to use the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","de Andrés Sánchez, Jorge; Arias-Oliva, Mario; Pelegrín-Borondo, Jorge; Lima Rua, Orlando",Revista espanola de salud publica,14,1

Using mouse-feline APN chimeras, we identified three small, discontinuous regions, amino acids (aa) 288 to 290, aa 732 to 746 (called R1), and aa 764 to 788 (called R2) in fAPN that determined the host ranges of these coronaviruses. Blockade of infection with anti-fAPN monoclonal antibody RG4 suggested that these three regions lie close together on the fAPN surface. Different residues in fAPN were required for infection with each coronavirus. HCoV-229E infection was blocked by an N-glycosylation sequon present between aa 288 to 290 in murine APN. TGEV required R1 of fAPN, while FCoV and CCoV required both R1 and R2 for entry. N740 and T742 in fAPN and the homologous R741 in human APN (hAPN) were key determinants of host range for FCoV, TGEV, and CCoV. Residue N740 in fAPN was essential only for CCoV receptor activity. A conservative T742V substitution or a T742R substitution in fAPN destroyed receptor activity for the pig, dog, and cat coronaviruses, while a T742S substitution retained these receptor activities. Thus, the hydroxyl on T742 is required for the coronavirus receptor activity of fAPN. In hAPN an R741T substitution caused a gain of receptor activity for TGEV but not for FCoV or CCoV. Therefore, entry and host range of these group 1 coronaviruses depend on the ability of the viral spike glycoproteins to recognize small, species-specific amino acid differences in the APN proteins of different species.","Tusell, Sonia M; Schittone, Stephanie A; Holmes, Kathryn V",Journal of virology,14,16

Treatment-acquired resistance to ENF highlights the need to create FI therapeutics with activity against ENF-resistant viruses and improved durability. Using rational design, we have made a series of oligomeric HR2 peptides with increased helical structure and with exceptionally high HR1/HR2 bundle stability. The engineered peptides are found to be as much as 3,600-fold more active than ENF against viruses that are resistant to the HR2 peptides ENF, T-1249, or T-651. Passaging experiments using one of these peptides could not generate virus with decreased sensitivity, even after >70 days in culture, suggesting superior durability as compared with ENF. In addition, the pharmacokinetic properties of the engineered peptides were improved up to 100-fold. The potent antiviral activity against resistant viruses, the difficulty in generating resistant virus, and the extended half-life in vivo make this class of fusion inhibitor peptide attractive for further development.","Dwyer, John J; Wilson, Karen L; Davison, Donna K; Freel, Stephanie A; Seedorff, Jennifer E; Wring, Stephen A; Tvermoes, Nicolai A; Matthews, Thomas J; Greenberg, Michael L; Delmedico, Mary K",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,14,1

METHODS: In this national multicentric prospective case series, data of subjects with NIU receiving corticosteroids, systemic IMT and/or biological agents were analysed. The data collection was performed from 1 March 2020 to 25 June 2020. Main outcome measures included change in the ongoing treatments with corticosteroids, IMT and biological agents, use of alternate therapies and rates of uveitis relapse. RESULTS: In this study, 176 patients (284 eyes) with NIU (mean age: 33±17.1 years; males: 68) were included. A total of 121 eyes (90 patients) were deemed to have active NIU. Of these, seven subjects (7.8%) did not receive intravenous methylprednisolone despite need felt by the treating uveitis experts. In addition, 35 subjects (57.4%) received a rapid tapering dosage of oral corticosteroids despite active disease. A total of 161 (91.5%) subjects were receiving systemic IMT and 25 (14.2%) were on biological therapies. Overall, IMT was altered in 29/161 (18.0%) subjects.

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were characterized by spike-protein IgG/IgM/IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent and live-virus neutralization assays. RESULTS: Spike-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies increased after the first pandemic wave in HCW with COVID-19-patient exposure, but not in HCW without patient exposure. Thirty-two HCW (5.3%) had spike-specific antibodies (11 seroconverted with &#8805;4-fold increase, 21 were seropositive at baseline). Neutralizing antibodies were found in 11 HCW that seroconverted, of whom 4 (36.4%) were asymptomatic. Ninety-seven HCW were tested by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during follow-up, 8 were positive (7 seroconverted and 1 had undetectable antibodies). CONCLUSIONS: We found increases in SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in infected HCW, especially after COVID-19-patient exposure. Our data show a low number of SARS-CoV-2-seropositive HCW in a low prevalence setting, however, the proportion of seropositivity was higher than RT-PCR positivity, highlighting the importance of antibody testing.","Trieu, Mai-Chi; Bansal, Amit; Madsen, Anders; Zhou, Fan; Sævik, Marianne; Vahokoski, Juha; Brokstad, Karl Albert; Krammer, Florian; Tøndel, Camilla; Mohn, Kristin G I; Blomberg, Bjørn; Langeland, Nina; Cox, Rebecca J",J. infect. dis,14,0

METHODS AND RESULTS: The specificity of the GPS&#8482; CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test by analysis of sequence alignments was approached and compared with other RT-qPCR designs. The GPS&#8482; CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test was validated following criteria of UNE/EN ISO 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189:2012. Diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, (Madrid, Spain), the Public Health England (Colindale, London, UK), and received the label CE-IVD. The GPS design showed the highest exclusivity and passed all parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference laboratories 100% correlated with these obtained by using reference methods and showed 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The CE-IVD GPS&#8482; CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test, available worldwide with full analytical and diagnostic validation, is the more exclusive for SARS-CoV-2 by far. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Considering the CoVID-19 pandemic status, the exclusivity of RT-qPCR tests is crucial to avoid false positives due to related coronaviruses. This work provides of a highly specific and validated RT-qPCR method for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which represents a case of efficient transfer of technology successfully used since the pandemic was declared.","Martínez-Murcia, A; Bru, G; Navarro, A; Ros-Tárraga, P; García-Sirera, A; Pérez, L",J. appl. microbiol,14,25

Strong selective pressure has caused a serious concern for a rise in resistance to praziquantel leading to the necessity for additional pharmaceuticals, with a distinctly different mechanism of action, to be used in combination therapy with praziquantel. Previous treatment of Schistosoma mansoni included the use of oxamniquine (OXA), a prodrug that is enzymatically activated in S. mansoni but is ineffective against S. haematobium and S. japonicum. The oxamniquine activating enzyme was identified as a S. mansoni sulfotransferase (SmSULT-OR). Structural data have allowed for directed drug development in reengineering oxamniquine to be effective against S. haematobium and S. japonicum. Guided by data from X-ray crystallographic studies and Schistosoma worm killing assays on oxamniquine, our structure-based drug design approach produced a robust SAR program that tested over 300 derivatives and identified several new lead compounds with effective worm killing in vitro. Previous studies resulted in the discovery of compound CIDD-0066790, which demonstrated broad-species activity in killing of schistosome species. As these compounds are racemic mixtures, we tested and demonstrate that the R enantiomer CIDD-007229 kills S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum better than the parent drug (CIDD-0066790). The search for derivatives that kill better than CIDD-0066790 has resulted in a derivative (CIDD- 149830) that kills 100% of S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum adult worms within 7 days. We hypothesize that the difference in activation and thus killing by the derivatives is due to the ability of the derivative to fit in the binding pocket of each sulfotransferase (SmSULT-OR, ShSULT-OR, SjSULT-OR) and to be efficiently sulfated. The purpose of this research is to develop a second drug to be used in conjunction with praziquantel to treat the major human species of Schistosoma. Collectively, our findings show that CIDD-00149830 and CIDD-0072229 are promising novel drugs for the treatment of human schistosomiasis and strongly support further development and in vivo testing.","Guzman, Meghan A; Rugel, Anastasia R; Tarpley, Reid S; Alwan, Sevan N; Chevalier, Frédéric D; Kovalskyy, Dmytro P; Cao, Xiaohang; Holloway, Stephen P; Anderson, Timothy J C; Taylor, Alexander B; McHardy, Stanton F; LoVerde, Philip T",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,14,16

Although previous research has assessed pharmacists' workload, this study is the first to describe pharmacist occupational fatigue-a characteristic of excessive workload that inhibits workers' abilities to function at normal capacity. OBJECTIVE: (s): The purpose of this study was to describe occupational fatigue in pharmacists using exploratory factor analysis (EFA)-assessing whether dimensional structures used to describe occupational fatigue in other health professions fit pharmacist perceptions. METHODS: A model was created to conceptualize two ""fatigue"" domains found in the literature-physical fatigue (ex. Physical discomfort) and mental fatigue (ex. trouble thinking clearly). These domains were operationalized and used to create a survey that was distributed to licensed pharmacists at a conference. An EFA was conducted to identify the key domains underlying pharmacist perceptions of fatigue. RESULTS: A total of 283 surveys were distributed, and 115 were returned and useable. Respondents were primarily white, female, and worked 9.5 h-per-day on average. The EFA suggested a statistically significant two-factor model (&#935;2 9.73, p = 0.28), which included physical fatigue (&#945; = 0.87) and mental fatigue (&#945; = 0.82) dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: The EFA yielded a structure similar to what was anticipated from the literature. While working, pharmacists may not be aware of fatigue related short-cuts or lapses that pose risks to patient safety. This study is just the first step in promoting systematic interventions to prevent or cope with fatigue and prevent the patient, pharmacist, and institutional outcomes.","Watterson, Taylor L; Look, Kevin A; Steege, Linsey; Chui, Michelle A",Res. soc. adm. pharm,14,7

Due to the mortality of this virus, scientists from all over the world have been trying to employ different strategies to tackle down this concern. This virus enters cells via phagocytosis through binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor. After invading the body, it can stay hidden in there for a period of up to 24 days (incubation period). Experimental approach: In this report, by the use of in silico studies we selected several FDA-approved compounds that possess antiviral properties. We chose the viral Spike protein as the target of drug compounds and carried out the screening process for the FDA databank in order to find the most effective ligand. Findings/Results: The results from dock and MD revealed 10 compounds with high affinity to the receptor-binding domain motif of S protein. The best inhibitors were the ingredients of Depinar, which managed to effectively block the interactions between cells and virus. Conclusion and implication: The results of this study were approved by in silico studies and due to the lack of time;we did not test the efficiency of these compounds through in vitro and in vivo studies. However, the selected compounds are all FDA approved and some are supplements like vitamin B12 and don't cause any side effects for patients.

In absence of any valid and appropriate vaccines to combat this newly evolved agent, there is need of novel resource molecules for treatment and prophylaxis. To this effect, flavonol morin which is found in fruits, vegetables and various medicinal herbs has been evaluated for its antiviral potential in the present study. PASS analysis of morin versus reference antiviral drugs baricitinib, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine revealed that morin displayed no violations of Lipinski's rule of five and other druglikeness filters. Morin also displayed no tumorigenic, reproductive or irritant effects and exhibited good absorption and permeation through GI (clogP <5). In principal component analysis, morin appeared closest to baricitinib in 3D space. Morin displayed potent binding to spike glycoprotein, main protease 3CLPro and papain-like protease PLPro of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV using molecular docking and significant binding to three viral-specific host proteins viz. human ACE2, importin-&#945; and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1, further lending support to its antiviral efficacy. Additionally, morin displayed potent binding to pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, 8 and 10 also supporting its anti-inflammatory activity.

The possible mechanism of protection through their immunoregulatory and paracrine action has been reviewed extensively. However, the importance of process control in achieving consistent cell quality, maximum safety and efficacy-for which the three key questions are which, when and how much-remains unaddressed. Any commonality, if it exists, in ongoing clinical trials has yet to be analyzed and reviewed. In this review, the authors have therefore compiled study design data from ongoing clinical trials to address the key questions of ""which"" with regard to tissue source, donor profile, isolation technique, culture conditions, long-term culture and cryopreservation of MSCs; ""when"" with regard to defining the transplantation window by identifying and staging patients based on their pro-inflammatory profile; and ""how much"" with regard to the number of cells in a single administration, number of doses and route of transplantation. To homogenize MSC therapy for COVID-19 on a global scale and to make it readily available in large numbers, a shared understanding and uniform agreement with respect to these fundamental issues are essential.","Shahani, Pradnya; Datta, Indrani",Cytotherapy,14,30

Although used as the standard method to screen patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection, real-time PCR has challenges in dealing with asymptomatic patients and those with an undetectable viral load. Serological tests are therefore considered potent diagnostic tools to complement real-time PCR-based diagnosis and are used for surveillance of seroprevalence in populations. However, the dynamics of the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 currently remain to be investigated. Here, through analysis of plasma samples from 84 patients with COVID-19, we observed that the response of virus-specific antibodies against three important antigens, RBD, N and S, dynamically changed over time and reached a peak 5-8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The antibody responses were irrespective of sex. Severe cases were found to have higher levels of antibody response, larger numbers of inflammatory cells and C-reactive protein levels. Within the mild/moderate cases, pairwise comparison indicated moderate association between anti-RBD vs. anti-N, anti-RBD vs. anti-S1S2, and anti-N vs. anti-S1S2. Furthermore, the majority of cases could achieve IgM and IgG seroconversion at 2 weeks since the disease onset. Analysis of neutralizing antibodies indicated that these responses were able to last for more than 112 days but decline significantly after the peak. In summary, our findings demonstrate the longitudinally dynamic changes in antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, which can contribute to the knowledge of humoral immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection and are informative for future development of vaccine and antibody-based therapies.","Feng, Xia; Yin, Jiming; Zhang, Jiaying; Hu, Yaling; Ouyang, Yabo; Qiao, Shubin; Zhao, Hong; Zhang, Tong; Li, Xuemei; Zhang, Lili; Zhang, Jie; Jin, Ronghua; Feng, Yingmei; Su, Bin",Front Immunol,14,14

Methods: We assessed placental histology, ACE2 expression, and viral and immune dynamics at the term placenta in pregnant women with and without respiratory severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Findings: The majority (13 of 15) of placentas analyzed had no detectable viral RNA. ACE2 was detected by immunohistochemistry in syncytiotrophoblast cells of the normal placenta during early pregnancy but was rarely seen in healthy placentas at full term, suggesting that low ACE2 expression may protect the term placenta from viral infection. Using immortalized cell lines and primary isolated placental cells, we found that cytotrophoblasts, the trophoblast stem cells and precursors to syncytiotrophoblasts, rather than syncytiotrophoblasts or Hofbauer cells, are most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. To better understand potential immune mechanisms shielding placental cells from infection in vivo, we performed bulk and single-cell transcriptomics analyses and found that the maternal-fetal interface of SARS-CoV-2-infected women exhibited robust immune responses, including increased activation of natural killer (NK) and T cells, increased expression of interferon-related genes, as well as markers associated with pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection in late pregnancy is associated with immune activation at the maternal-fetal interface even in the absence of detectable local viral invasion.

Few studies have evaluated RDV in patients with SRI due to theoretical toxicity concerns. METHODS: Hospitalized patients receiving RDV for COVID-19 between 5/1/2020-10/31/2020 were analyzed in a retrospective chart review. We compared incident adverse events (AEs) following RDV in patients with and without SRI, including hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, any reported AE, mortality and length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 135 patients received RDV, 20 patients had SRI. Patients with SRI were significantly older (70 vs. 54 years, p=0.0001). The incidence of possible AEs following RDV was 20% among those with SRI versus 11% without (p=0.26). LFT elevations occurred in 10% vs. 4% (p=0.28), and SCr elevations occurred in 20% vs. 6% (p=0.06) of patients with SRI versus those without, respectively. The LFT and SCr elevations were not attributed to RDV in either group. Mortality and length of stay were comparable and consistent with historical controls. CONCLUSION: RDV AEs occurred infrequently with low severity and were not significantly different between those with and without SRI. While a higher percentage of patients with SRI experienced SCr elevations, 3 (75%) patients were in AKI prior to RDV. Overall, the use of RDV in this small series of patients with SRI appeared to be relatively safe, and the potential benefit outweighed the theoretical risk of liver or renal toxicity; however, additional studies are needed to confirm this finding.","Pettit, Natasha N; Pisano, Jennifer; Nguyen, Cynthia T; Lew, Alison K; Hazra, Aniruddha; Sherer, Renslow; Mullane, Kathleen",Clin. infect. dis,14,13

This review addresses this issue and examines the fate of coronaviruses (CoVs) in water systems, with particular attention to the recently available information on the novel SARS-CoV-2. The methods for the determination of viable virus particles and quantification of CoVs and, in particular, of SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater are discussed with particular regard to the methods of concentration and to the emerging methods of detection. The analysis of the environmental stability of CoVs, with particular regard of SARS-CoV-2, and the efficacy of the disinfection methods are extensively reviewed as well. This information provides a broad view of the state-of-the-art for researchers involved in the investigation of CoVs in aquatic systems, and poses the basis for further analyses and discussions on the risk associated to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in water media. The examined data indicates that detection of the virus in wastewater and natural water bodies provides a potentially powerful tool for quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) and for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for the evaluation of the level of circulation of the virus in a population. Assays of the viable virions in water media provide information on the integrity, capability of replication (in suitable host species) and on the potential infectivity. Challenges and critical issues relevant to the detection of coronaviruses in different water matrixes with both direct and surrogate methods as well as in the implementation of epidemiological tools are presented and critically discussed.","Buonerba, Antonio; Corpuz, Mary Vermi Aizza; Ballesteros, Florencio; Choo, Kwang-Ho; Hasan, Shadi W; Korshin, Gregory V; Belgiorno, Vincenzo; Barceló, Damià; Naddeo, Vincenzo",J Hazard Mater,14,6

This study explored the influence of altruism on negative affect and mental health (anxiety and depressive symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic while people self-isolated at home in China. METHOD: University students were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Self-reported perceived risk, altruism, negative affect, anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the Self-Report Altruism Scale (SRA scale), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-9). A structural equation model was used to analyse the mediating and moderating effects on mental health. RESULTS: The final sample comprised 1346 Chinese participants (Mage = 19.76 ± 2.23 years, 73% female). Overall, the higher the risk the participants perceived, the more negative affect they exhibited (ß = 0.16, p < .001), and thus, the more anxious and depressed they felt (ß = 0.134, p < .001); however, this relationship between risk perception and negative affect was moderated by altruism. In contrast to previous studies, the increase in negative affect associated with the increased perceived risk was pronounced among individuals with high altruism (t = 7.68, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with high altruism exhibited more negative affect than those with low altruism, which indirectly increased their anxiety and depressive symptoms. These findings enrich theories of altruism and provide valuable insight into the influence of altruism on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Feng, Yi; Zong, Min; Yang, Zhizun; Gu, Wen; Dong, Dan; Qiao, Zhihong",Global Health,14,1

DD1 was optimized in gas phase, aqueous and DMSO solutions using hybrid B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) method. Comparisons between experimental and theoretical infrared spectra, 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts and electronic spectrum in DMSO solution evidence good concordances. Higher solvation energy was observed in aqueous solution than in DMSO, showing in aqueous solution a higher value than antiviral brincidofovir and chloroquine. on Bond orders, atomic charges and topological studies suggest that imidazole ring play a very important role in the properties of DD1. NBO and AIM analyses support the intra-molecular O15-H16â¢â¢â¢N17 bonds of DD1 in the three media. Low gap value supports the higher reactivity of DD1 than chloroquine justified by the higher electrophilicity and low nucleophilicity. Complete vibrational assignments of DD1 in gas phase and aqueous solution are reported together with the scaled force constants. In addition, better intermolecular interactions were observed by Hirshfeld surface analysis. Finally, the molecular docking mechanism between DD1 ligand and COVID-19/6WCF and COVID-19/6Y84 receptors were studied to explore the binding modes of these compounds at the active sites.

Adults accounted for 88% and children for 12% of people with TB. The WHO regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (25%), and the Western Pacific (18%) had the most people with TB. Eight countries accounted for two thirds of the global total: India (26%), Indonesia (8.5%), China (8.4%), the Philippines (6.0%), Pakistan (5.7%), Nigeria (4.4%), Bangladesh (3.6%) and South Africa (3.6%).

PARTICIPANT AND METHODS: A 30-year-old man with confirmed COVID-19 and bilateral acute conjunctivitis which occurred 13 days after illness onset. Based on detailed ophthalmic examination, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in conjunctival swabs. The ocular characteristics, presence of viral RNA and viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival specimens were evaluated. RESULTS: Slit lamp examination showed bilateral acute follicular conjunctivitis. RT-PCR assay demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in conjunctival specimen 13 days after onset (cycle threshold value: 31). The conjunctival swab specimens remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 14 and 17 days after onset. On day 19, RT-PCR result was negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is capable of causing ocular complications such as viral conjunctivitis in the middle phase of illness. Precautionary measures are recommended when examining infected patients throughout the clinical course of the infection.

The participants were 400 older adults (mean age = 68.04, SD = 6.41), who were administered the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Revised Mental Health Inventory-5, Patient Health Questionnaire-2 items, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 2 items. Structural equation models were estimated, specifically confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), bifactor CFA, and structural models with latent variables (SEM). Internal consistency was estimated with composite reliability indexes (CRI) and omega coefficients. A bifactor model with both a general factor underlying all items plus a specific factor underlying items 1, 2, 4, and 5 representing the emotional response to COVID better represents the factor structure of the scale. This structure had adequate fit and good reliability, and additionally fear of COVID had a large effect on mental health. In general, women had more fear than men, having more information on COVID was associated to more fear, while having family or friends affected by COVID did not related to fear of the virus. The Spanish version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale presents evidence of validity and reliability to assess fear of COVID-19 in the Peruvian older adult population.","Caycho-Rodríguez, Tomás; Tomás, José M; Barboza-Palomino, Miguel; Ventura-León, José; Gallegos, Miguel; Reyes-Bossio, Mario; Vilca, Lindsey W",Int J Ment Health Addict,14,20

The ability of this agent to be transmitted by blood transfusion has not been documented, although viral RNA has been detected in serum. Exposure to treatment with riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R + UV) reduces blood-borne pathogens while maintaining blood product quality. Here, we report on the efficacy of R + UV in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity when tested in human plasma and whole blood products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020) was used to inoculate plasma and whole blood units that then underwent treatment with riboflavin and UV light (Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology System, Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO). The infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the samples before and after R + UV treatment were determined by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Each plasma pool (n = 9) underwent R + UV treatment performed in triplicate using individual units of plasma and then repeated using individual whole blood donations (n = 3). RESULTS: Riboflavin and UV light reduced the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 below the limit of detection for plasma products at 60-100% of the recommended energy dose. At the UV light dose recommended by the manufacturer, the mean log reductions in the viral titers were &#8805; 4.79 ± 0.15 Logs in plasma and 3.30 ± 0.26 in whole blood units. CONCLUSION: Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 to the limit of detection in human plasma and by 3.30 ± 0.26 on average in whole blood. Two clades of SARS-CoV-2 have been described and questions remain about whether exposure to one strain confers strong immunity to the other. Pathogen-reduced blood products may be a safer option for critically ill patients with COVID-19, particularly those in high-risk categories.","Ragan, Izabela; Hartson, Lindsay; Pidcoke, Heather; Bowen, Richard; Goodrich, Raymond",PLoS One,14,29

OBJECTIVE: This study documented and characterized COVID-19 cases reported in individuals receiving treatment with Pfizer pharmaceutical products and cases that reported use of Pfizer pharmaceutical products for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: This retrospective observational review leveraged the Pfizer safety database containing adverse event data collected in association with use of Pfizer products between 1 October, 2019, and 25 June, 2020; the database includes worldwide adverse event data from various sources. Selected Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) Preferred Terms and subsequent clinical review were used to characterize COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Over 1500 relevant cases were identified over an 8-month period. In cases that reported COVID-19, immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents, followed by anticoagulant/antithrombic agents and corticosteroids, were the most frequently reported agents. The frequent reporting of immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents among cases of COVID-19 suggests increased vulnerability to infection among treated patients, either because of immunosuppressive effects of certain agents or the nature of the underlying treated condition. In cases involving off-label pharmacotherapy use for the treatment of COVID-19-related conditions, the most frequently reported therapeutic classes included antibiotics, antimalarial agents, antivirals/antiretroviral agents, immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and immunoglobulin/interferons. The most frequently reported pharmacotherapeutic agents were azithromycin and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, followed by lopinavir-ritonavir, ceftriaxone, and tofacitinib. The most frequently reported clinical adverse events associated with azithromycin (as sole therapy or combined with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine) include electrocardiogram QT prolonged, drug interaction, hepatitis, diarrhea, and hepatitis acute. Regarding cardiac-related events, 19% (120/645) of azithromycin cases reported events associated with QT prolongation/torsade de pointes (which included seven fatal cardiac events). The most frequently reported clinical adverse events associated with other commonly used agents are also presented. CONCLUSIONS: This pharmacovigilance surveillance study provides a unique characterization of cases in which a broad range of pharmaceutical products was reported in relation to COVID-19.","Beyzarov, Elena; Chen, Yan; Julg, Rob; Naim, Karen; Shah, Jigna; Gregory, William W; Ayoub, Ayman; Caubel, Patrick",Drug Saf,14,29

We quantified excess mortality in regions of England and Wales during the pandemic, for all causes and for non-COVID-19-associated deaths. METHODS: Weekly mortality data for 1 January 2010 to 1 May 2020 for England and Wales were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Mean-dispersion negative binomial regressions were used to model death counts based on pre-pandemic trends and exponentiated linear predictions were subtracted from: (i) all-cause deaths and (ii) all-cause deaths minus COVID-19 related deaths for the pandemic period (week starting 7 March, to week ending 8 May). FINDINGS: Between 7 March and 8 May 2020, there were 47 243 (95% CI: 46 671 to 47 815) excess deaths in England and Wales, of which 9948 (95% CI: 9376 to 10 520) were not associated with COVID-19. Overall excess mortality rates varied from 49 per 100 000 (95% CI: 49 to 50) in the South West to 102 per 100 000 (95% CI: 102 to 103) in London. Non-COVID-19 associated excess mortality rates ranged from -1 per 100 000 (95% CI: -1 to 0) in Wales (ie, mortality rates were no higher than expected) to 26 per 100 000 (95% CI: 25 to 26) in the West Midlands.

OBJECTIVES: To find out the effective treatment as an antiviral agent for COVID-19, to determine the correlation between sociodemography with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment, and to determine the relationship between comorbidities with clinical outcomes and duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in this study. This study included only confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the hospital during April-May 2020. Convenience sampling was used to select 103 patients, but only 72 patients were suitable for inclusion. RESULTS: The survival analysis for COVID-19 patients using the Kaplan Meier method showed that patients receiving Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine had an average survival rate of about 83% after undergoing treatment of about ten days. Gender (p = 0.450) and age (p = 0.226) did not have a significant correlation with the duration of treatment for COVID-19 patients. Gender (p = 0.174) and age (p = 0.065) also did not have a significant correlation with clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. Comorbidities showed a significant correlation with duration of treatment (p = 0.002) and clinical outcome (p = 0.014) of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The most effective antiviral agent in this study based on treatment duration was the combination of Oseltamivir + Hydroxychloroquine.

This study examines health inequality by SES amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its underlying mechanisms in Wuhan, China's epicenter. Using survey data collected in the city during the lockdown period from February 20 to March 6, 2020, we identify two ways in which SES shapes health inequalities-vulnerability and resilience to COVID-19. First, higher SES is associated with a lower risk of infection for both survey respondents and their family members. Second, higher SES reduces mental distress during the pandemic, and this protective effect is particularly strong for individuals who contract the virus or who have family members infected with the disease. Mediation analysis further illustrates that SES shapes the risk of infection and mental distress primarily through three channels: access to daily essential and protective supplies, employment status, and the community environment. These findings lend support to the fundamental cause theory that links socioeconomic differentials to health inequality in a unique context.

However, little is known about how public health measures may improve people's positive attitudes during a pandemic. We investigated the potential mechanism underlying the association between individuals' perceived effectiveness of public health measures and positive attitudes towards the success of pandemic control during the COVID-19 pandemic, by examining the parallel mediating effects of three types of threat appraisals: concerns about contracting the virus, perceived impact of the pandemic on life and estimated duration of the pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In February 2020 when the COVID-19 infection was spreading rapidly in China, a large cross-sectional survey was conducted among 132 054 adults from the 16 districts in Shanghai, China. OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceived effectiveness of the public health measures, positive attitudes towards the success of pandemic control and threat appraisals. RESULTS: Results of structural equation modelling supported the hypothesised mediation model: perceived effectiveness of public health measures was associated with lower levels of concerns about contracting the virus (ß=-0.20), perceived impact of the pandemic (ß=-0.13) and perceived duration of the pandemic (ß=-0.20), which were then associated with higher levels of positive attitudes towards the success of pandemic control (ßs=-0.12 to -0.25). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that threat appraisals may be important pathways through which individuals' evaluations of prevention strategies may influence their attitudes towards the success of pandemic control. The health authorities should consider reducing people's inappropriate threat appraisals when designing public health policies to facilitate people's positive attitudes during a pandemic.","Chu, Qiao; Gu, Tian; Li, Anqi; Chen, Junjie; Wang, Hui; Liu, Ningning; Wu, Ruijun; He, Yaping",BMJ Open,14,33

The first clinical trials have been testing repurposed drugs that show promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in cultured cells. Although more than 2400 clinical trials are already under way, the actual number of tested compounds is still limited to approximately 20, alone or in combination. In addition, knowledge on their mode of action (MoA) is currently insufficient. Their first results reveal some inconsistencies and contradictory results and suggest that cohort size and quality of the control arm are two key issues for obtaining rigorous and conclusive results. Moreover, the observed discrepancies might also result from differences in the clinical inclusion criteria, including the possibility of early treatment that may be essential for therapy efficacy in patients with Covid-19. Importantly, efforts should also be made to test new compounds with a documented MoA against SARS-CoV-2 in clinical trials. Successful treatment will probably be based on multitherapies with antiviral compounds that target different steps of the virus life cycle. Moreover, a multidisciplinary approach that combines artificial intelligence, compound docking, and robust in vitro and in vivo assays will accelerate the development of new antiviral molecules. Finally, large retrospective studies on hospitalized patients are needed to evaluate the different treatments with robust statistical tools and to identify the best treatment for each Covid-19 stage.

The COVID-19 pandemic is threatening the gains made in the fight against both diseases. DISCUSSION: Although crucial guidance has been released on how to maintain TB and HIV services during the pandemic, it is acknowledged that what was considered normal service pre-pandemic needs to improve to ensure that we rebuild person-centred, inclusive and quality healthcare services. The threat that the pandemic may reverse gains in the response to TB and HIV may be turned into an opportunity by pivoting to using proven differentiated service delivery approaches and innovative technologies that can be used to maintain care during the pandemic and accelerate improved service delivery in the long term. Models of care should be convenient, supportive and sufficiently differentiated to avoid burdensome clinic visits for medication pick-ups or directly observed treatments. Additionally, the pandemic has highlighted the chronic and short-sighted lack of investment in health systems and the need to prioritize research and development to close the gaps in TB diagnosis, treatment and prevention, especially for children and people with HIV. Most importantly, TB-affected communities and civil society must be supported to lead the planning, implementation and monitoring of TB and HIV services, especially in the time of COVID-19 where services have been disrupted, and to report on legal, policy and gender-related barriers to access experienced by affected people. This will help to ensure that TB services are held accountable by affected communities for delivering equitable access to quality, affordable and non-discriminatory services during and beyond the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Successfully reaching the related targets of ending TB and AIDS as public health threats by 2030 requires rebuilding of stronger, more inclusive health systems by advancing equitable access to quality TB services, including for people with HIV, both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, services must be rights-based, community-led and community-based, to ensure that no one is left behind.","Roberts, Teri; Sahu, Suvanand; Malar, James; Abdullaev, Timur; Vandevelde, Wim; Pillay, Yogan G; Fujiwara, Paula I; Reid, Alasdair; Hader, Shannon; Singh, Satvinder; Kamarulzaman, Adeeba; Ahmedov, Sevim",J Int AIDS Soc,14,1

Four isoforms of the p38 MAPK family (α, β, γ, δ) have been identified. p38α is activated by many inflammatory stimuli, and it plays a key role in regulating the biosynthesis of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin 1β (IL‐1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). For this reason, p38 MAPK is an important target to be studied for the treatment of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, COVID‐19 and acute coronary syndrome. The characteristics of p38 MAPK, the different modes of inhibition, and its involvement in inflammatory diseases are summarized in this review.

It can facilitate medical care delivery while reducing unnecessary office visits. The COVID-19 outbreak has caused an abrupt change in our daily urological practice, where teleconsultations play a crucial role. OBJECTIVE: To provide practical recommendations for the effective use of technological tools in telemedicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Medline until April 2020. We selected the most relevant articles related to «telemedicine¼ and «smart working¼ that could provide valuable information. RESULTS: Telemedicine refers to the use of electronic information and telecommunication tools to provide remote clinical health care support. Smart working is a working approach that uses new or existing technologies to improve performance. Telemedicine is becoming a useful and fundamental tool during the COVID-19 pandemic and will be even more in the future. It is time for us to officially give telemedicine the place it deserves in clinical practice, and it is our responsibility to adapt and familiarize with all the tools and possible strategies for its optimal implementation. We must guarantee that the quality of care received by patients and perceived by them and their families is of the highest standard.

When R0>1, the disease spread will potentially lead to an outbreak, such that of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics. During the evolution of an outbreak, various non-pharmaceutical interventions are employed, the impact of which is frequently assessed by the reduction that they introduce to the effective reproduction number Rt; reduction below 1 is an indication of eventual dying out of the disease spread. Motivated by the fact that R0 essentially expresses the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, in this work, Rt was examined in the view of timescale analysis. It was shown that during the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, when various interventions were in place, Rt had a clear relation with the explosive timescale characterizing the dynamics of the outbreak. In particular, it is shown that the existence of an explosive timescale during the progression of the epidemics implies Rt>1, while its absence implies Rt<1. In addition, as this timescale converges/diverges with the immediately slowest one, Rt approaches to/withdraws from its threshold value 1. These results suggest that timescale analysis can be utilized for the assessment of the impact of various interventions, since it reflects the insight provided by the effective reproduction number, without being hindered by the selection of the population model, nor the parameter estimation process followed for model calibration.","Patsatzis, Dimitrios G.",,14,7

There is insufficient data comparing the impact of intubation versus NIV on patient-centered outcomes of these patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare all-cause 30-day mortality for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure who underwent intubation first, intubation after NIV, or NIV only. DESIGN: Retrospective study of patients admitted in March and April of 2020. SETTING: A teaching hospital in Brooklyn, New York City. PARTICIPANTS: Adult COVID-19 confirmed patients who required ventilator support (non-invasive ventilation and/or endotracheal intubation) at discretion of treating physician, were included. EXPOSURES: Patients were categorized into three exposure groups: intubation-first, intubation after NIV, or NIV-only. PRIMARY OUTCOME: 30-day all-cause mortality, a predetermined outcome measured by multivariable logistic regression. Data are presented with medians and interquartile ranges, or percentages with 95% confidence intervals, for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Covariates for the model were age, sex, qSOFA score &gt;= 2, presenting oxygen saturation, vasopressor use, and greater than three comorbidities. A secondary multivariable model compared mortality of all patients that received NIV (intubation after NIV and NIV-only) with the intubation-first group. RESULTS: A total of 222 were enrolled. Overall mortality was 77.5% (95%CI, 72-83%). Mortality for intubation-first group was 82% (95%CI, 73-89%;75/91), for Intubation after NIV was 84% (95%CI, 70-92%;37/44), and for NIV-only was 69% (95%CI, 59-78%;60/87). In multivariable analysis, NIV-only was associated with decreased all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.30, 95%CI, 0.13-0.69). No difference in mortality was observed between intubation-first and intubation after NIV. Secondary analysis found all patients who received NIV to have lower mortality than patients who were intubated only (OR: 0.44, 95%CI, 0.21-0.95). CONCLUSIONS & RELEVANCE: Utilization of NIV as the initial intervention in COVID-19 patients requiring ventilatory support is associated with significant survival benefit.

However, population mobility differs across locations, which could reduce the effectiveness of pandemic control measures. Here we assess the extent to which socioeconomic factors are associated with reductions in population mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic, at both the city level in China and at the country level worldwide. METHODS: In this retrospective, observational study, we obtained anonymised daily mobile phone location data for 358 Chinese cities from Baidu, and for 121 countries from Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. We assessed the intra-city movement intensity, inflow intensity, and outflow intensity of each Chinese city between Jan 25 (when the national emergency response was implemented) and Feb 18, 2020 (when population mobility was lowest) and compared these data to the corresponding lunar calendar period from the previous year (Feb 5 to March 1, 2019). Chinese cities were classified into four socioeconomic index (SEI) groups (high SEI, high-middle SEI, middle SEI, and low SEI) and the association between socioeconomic factors and changes in population mobility were assessed using univariate and multivariable linear regression. At the country level, we compared six types of mobility (residential, transit stations, workplaces, retail and recreation, parks, and groceries and pharmacies) 35 days after the implementation of the national emergency response in each country and compared these to data from the same day of the week in the baseline period (Jan 3 to Feb 6, 2020). We assessed associations between changes in the six types of mobility and the country's sociodemographic index using univariate and multivariable linear regression. FINDINGS: The reduction in intra-city movement intensity in China was stronger in cities with a higher SEI than in those with a lower SEI (r=-0·47, p<0·0001). However, reductions in inter-city movement flow (both inflow and outflow intensity) were not associated with SEI and were only associated with government control measures. In the country-level analysis, countries with higher sociodemographic and Universal Health Coverage indexes had greater reductions in population mobility (ie, in transit stations, workplaces, and retail and recreation) following national emergency declarations than those with lower sociodemographic and Universal Health Coverage indexes. A higher sociodemographic index showed a greater reduction in mobility in transit stations (r=-0·27, p=0·0028), workplaces (r=-0·34, p=0·0002), and areas retail and recreation (rxs=-0·30, p=0·0012) than those with a lower sociodemographic index. INTERPRETATION: Although COVID-19 outbreaks are more frequently reported in larger cities, our analysis shows that future policies should prioritise the reduction of risks in areas with a low socioeconomic level-eg, by providing financial assistance and improving public health messaging. However, our study design only allows us to assess associations, and a long-term study is needed to decipher causality.

Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, medications, and outcomes (including length of stay, discharge, and mortality) were collected. Two hundred and seventy-nine patients were assessed. These patients were predominantly female (62%) with a median age of 50 years (SD 16.9). Nineteen (6.8%) patients had SARS-CoV-2 detected.

Spreading across all regions of the world, this corona virus disease has disrupted even some of the most advanced economies and healthcare systems. With an increasing global death toll and no near end in sight, questions on the efficacy of global response mechanisms, including the role and relevancy of global health institutions, have emerged. Using a reflexive content analytic approach, this study sheds light on some of these questions, underscoring the disconnect between science, policymaking, and society. Global health funding approaches; politicization of the pandemic, including political blame gaming; mistrust of government and other institutions; and a lack of robust accountability measures are some of the pandemic response obstacles. However, COVID-19 has also presented an opportunity for a collaboration that may potentially solidify global solidarity. A pandemic response built on strategic global health diplomacy, vaccine diplomacy, and science diplomacy can spur both political and economic benefits, advancing development, health security, and justice. The virus thrives and flourishes in face of political divisions and lack of cooperation. While the current global crisis has exacerbated the existing social injustices in societies, national unity and global solidarity is essential to winning the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","AlKhaldi, Mohammed; James, Nigel; Chattu, Vijay Kumar; Ahmed, Sara; Meghari, Hamza; Kaiser, Kirsty; IJsselmuiden, Carel; Tanner, Marcel",Glob Health Res Policy,14,16

We sought to evaluate how breast surgeons are adapting their surgical activity to limit viral spread and spare hospital resources. METHODS: A panel of 12 breast surgeons from the most affected regions of the world convened a virtual meeting on April 7, 2020, to discuss the changes in their local surgical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, a Web-based poll based was created to evaluate changes in surgical practice among breast surgeons from several countries. RESULTS: The virtual meeting showed that distinct countries and regions were experiencing different phases of the pandemic. Surgical priority was given to patients with aggressive disease not candidate for primary systemic therapy, those with progressive disease under neoadjuvant systemic therapy, and patients who have finished neoadjuvant therapy. One hundred breast surgeons filled out the poll. The trend showed reductions in operating room schedules, indications for surgery, and consultations, with an increasingly restrictive approach to elective surgery with worsening of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 emergency should not compromise treatment of a potentially lethal disease such as breast cancer. Our results reveal that physicians are instinctively reluctant to abandon conventional standards of care when possible. However, as the situation deteriorates, alternative strategies of de-escalation are being adopted. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study aimed to characterize how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting breast cancer surgery and which strategies are being adopted to cope with the situation.","Rocco, Nicola; Montagna, Giacomo; Di Micco, Rosa; Benson, John; Criscitiello, Carmen; Chen, Li; Di Pace, Bruno; Esgueva Colmenarejo, Antonio Jesus; Harder, Yves; Karakatsanis, Andreas; Maglia, Anna; Mele, Marco; Nafissi, Nahid; Ferreira, Pedro Santos; Taher, Wafa; Tejerina, Antonio; Vinci, Alessio; Nava, Maurizio; Catanuto, Giuseppe",Oncologist,14,15

Our method plans in the space of object subgoals and frees the planner from reasoning about robot-object interaction dynamics by relying on a set of generalizable manipulation primitives. We show that for rigid bodies, this abstraction can be realized using low-level manipulation skills that maintain sticking contact with the object and represent subgoals as 3D transformations. To enable generalization to unseen objects and improve planning performance, we propose a novel way of representing subgoals for rigid-body manipulation and a graph-attention based neural network architecture for processing point-cloud inputs. We experimentally validate these choices using simulated and real-world experiments on the YuMi robot. Results demonstrate that our method can successfully manipulate new objects into target configurations requiring long-term planning. Overall, our framework realizes the best of the worlds of task-and-motion planning (TAMP) and learning-based approaches.

This included developing a technique to perform mobile chest X-ray imaging through glass, allowing the X-ray unit to remain outside of the patient's room, effectively reducing the cleaning time associated with disinfecting equipment. The technique also reduced the infection risk of radiographers. We assessed the attenuation of different types of glass in the hospital and the technique parameters required to account for the glass filtration and additional source to image distance (SID). Radiation measurements were undertaken in a simulated set-up to determine the appropriate position for staff inside and outside the room to ensure occupational doses were kept as low as reasonably achievable. Image quality was scored and technical parameter information collated. The alternative to imaging through glass is the standard portable chest X-ray within the room. The radiation safety requirements for this standard technique were also assessed. Image quality was found to be acceptable or borderline in 90% of the images taken through glass and the average patient dose was 0.02 millisieverts (mSv) per image. The majority (67%) of images were acquired at 110 kV, with an average 5.5 mAs and with SID ranging from 180 to 300 cm.

This study included patients with coronavirus disease-2019, who were hospitalized between February 9, 2020, and March 30, 2020. Univariate Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) were used to select variables. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was applied to identify independent risk factors in coronavirus disease-2019. A total of 1135 patients were analyzed during the study period. A total of 35 variables were considered to be risk factors after the univariate regression analysis of the clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters (p < .05), and LASSO regression analysis screened out seven risk factors for further study. The six independent risk factors revealed by multivariate Cox regression were myoglobin (HR, 5.353; 95% CI, 2.633-10.882; p < .001), C-reactive protein (HR, 2.063; 95% CI, 1.036-4.109; p = .039), neutrophil count (HR, 2.015; 95% CI, 1.154-3.518; p = .014), interleukin 6 (Il-6; HR, 9.753; 95% CI, 2.952-32.218; p < .001), age (HR, 2.016; 95% CI, 1.077-3.773; p = .028), and international normalized ratio (HR, 2.595; 95% CI, 1.412-4.769; p = .002). Our results suggested that inflammation-associated factors were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in coronavirus disease-2019 patients. C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, and interleukin 6 were independent factors for predicting in-hospital mortality and had a better independent predictive ability.

In addition to the direct effect (e.g., being infected with the virus), this pandemic has negatively ravaged many industries, particularly food retail, food services, and hospitality. Given the novelty of the disease, the true impact of COVID-19 remains to be determined. Because of the nature of their work, and the characteristics of the workers, individuals in the food retail, food service, and hospitality industries are a group whose vulnerability is at its most fragile state during this pandemic. Through this qualitative study, we explored workers' perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health and coping, including screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder symptoms. Twenty-seven individual interviews were conducted, audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Four key themes emerged: being infected and infecting others, the unknown, isolation, and work and customer demands. Considering the many uncertainties of COVID-19, workers in these three industries were experiencing heightened levels of mental distress because of where they worked and the already existing disparities they faced on a daily basis before the pandemic started. Yet they remained hopeful for a better future. More studies are needed to fully understand the magnitude, short-term, and long-term effects of COVID-19. Based on this study's findings, programs are critically needed to promote positive coping behaviors among at-risk and distressed workers. Recommendations for employers, occupational health and safety professionals, and policy stakeholders to further support these service workers are discussed.","Rosemberg, Marie-Anne S; Adams, Mackenzie; Polick, Carri; Li, Wei V; Dang, Jenny; Tsai, Jenny Hsin-Chun",J Occup Environ Hyg,14,1

A variety of machine learning models have been applied to related data to predict important factors such as the severity of the disease, infection rate and discover important prognostic factors. Often the usefulness of the findings from the use of these techniques is reduced due to lack of method interpretability. Some recent progress made on the interpretability of machine learning models has the potential to unravel more insights while using conventional machine learning models. In this work, we analyze COVID-19 blood work data with some of the popular machine learning models; then we employ state-of-the-art post-hoc local interpretability techniques(e.g.- SHAP, LIME), and global interpretability techniques(e.g. - symbolic metamodeling) to the trained black-box models to draw interpretable conclusions. In the gamut of machine learning algorithms, regressions remain one of the simplest and most explainable models with clear mathematical formulation. We explore one of the most recent techniques called symbolic metamodeling to find the mathematical expression of the machine learning models for COVID-19. We identify Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), initial Albumin level (ALBI), Aspartate aminotransferase (ASTI), Total Bilirubin initial(TBILI) and D-Dimer initial (DIMER) as major prognostic factors of the disease severity. Our contributions are- (i) uncover the underlying mathematical expression for the black-box models on COVID-19 severity prediction task (ii) we are the first to apply symbolic metamodeling to this task, and (iii) discover important features and feature interactions.","Jana, Ananya; Minacapelli, Carlos D.; Rustgi, Vinod; Metaxas, Dimitris",,14,1

In this single-centered, retrospective cohort study, we consecutively enrolled 37 RT-PCR confirmed positive severe or critical patients from January 28 to February 16, 2020 in a tertiary hospital. Outcomes were followed up until 28-day mortality. Fifteen severe and 22 critical adult patients with the COVID-19 infection were included. Twenty-six (68.4%) were men. Echocardiography data results suggest that normal or increased cardiac output and diastolic dysfunction are the most common manifestations. Compared with severe patients, critical patients were older, more likely to exhibit low platelet counts and high blood urea nitrogen, and were in hospital for longer. Most patients had organ dysfunction during hospitalization, including 11 (29.7%) with ARDS, 8 (21.6%) with acute kidney injury, 17 (45.9%) with acute cardiac injury, and 33 (89.2%) with acute liver dysfunction. Eighteen (48.6%) patients were treated with high-flow ventilation, 9 (13.8%) with non-invasive ventilation, 10 (15.4%) with invasive mechanical ventilation, 7 (18.9%) with prone position ventilation, 6 (16.2%) with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and 3 (8.1%) with renal replacement therapy. Only 1 (2.7%) patient had died in the 28-day follow up in our study. All patients had bilateral infiltrates on their chest CT scan. Twenty-one (32.3%) patients presented ground glass opacity (GGO) with critical patients more localized in the periphery and the center. The mortality of critical patients with the COVID-19 infection is low in our study. Cardiac function was enhanced in the early stage and less likely to develop into acute cardiac injury, but most patients suffered with acute liver injury.

Therefore, it is imperative that clinicians and laboratory professionals be familiar with issues underlying disparities in STI incidence and barriers to reliable diagnostic testing. In this mini-review, we will summarize contributors to racial/ethnic disparity in STI, highlight current epidemiologic trends for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, discuss policy issues that affect laboratory and public health funding, and identify specific analytic challenges for diagnostic laboratories. SUMMARY: Racial and ethnic disparities in STI in the US are striking and are due to complex interactions of myriad social determinants of health. Budgetary cuts for laboratory and public health services and competition for resources during the COVID-19 pandemic are major challenges.

They include emerging technologies that yield the advantage of tracking asthma symptoms and medications, setting drug reminders, improving inhaler technique and delivering asthma education, such as serious games (video games designed for medical- or health-related purposes), electronic monitoring devices, speech recognition calls, text messaging, mobile apps and interactive websites. Some of the proposed digital interventions have used multiple components, including educational and behavioural strategies and interactions with medical professionals. Overall, the implementation of such interventions may offer the opportunity to improve adherence and asthma control.

The control measures adopted in several countries aim at isolating individuals once diagnosed, limiting their social interactions and consequently their transmission probability. These interventions, which have a strong impact on the disease dynamics, can affect the inference of the epidemiological quantities. We first present a theoretical explanation of the effect caused by non-pharmaceutical intervention measures on the mean serial and generation intervals. Then, in a simulation study, we vary the assumed efficacy of control measures and quantify the effect on the mean and variance of realized generation and serial intervals. The simulation results show that the realized serial and generation intervals both depend on control measures and their values contract according to the efficacy of the intervention strategies. Interestingly, the mean serial interval differs from the mean generation interval. The deviation between these two values depends on two factors. First, the number of undiagnosed infectious individuals. Second, the relationship between infectiousness, symptom onset and timing of isolation. Similarly, the standard deviations of realized serial and generation intervals do not coincide, with the former shorter than the latter on average. The findings of this study are directly relevant to estimates performed for the current COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the effective reproduction number is often inferred using both daily incidence data and the generation interval. Failing to account for either contraction or mis-specification by using the serial interval could lead to biased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Consequently, this might affect the choices made by decision makers when deciding which control measures to apply based on the value of the quantity thereof.","Torneri, Andrea; Libin, Pieter; Scalia Tomba, Gianpaolo; Faes, Christel; Wood, James G; Hens, Niel",PLoS Comput Biol,14,17

The OAM nature of magnons is uncovered by showing that the spin-wave eigenmode is also the eigenstate of the OAM operator in the confined geometry. Inspired by optical tweezers, we predict an exotic ""magnetic tweezer"" effect by showing skyrmion gyrations under twisted magnons in the exchange-coupled nanocylinder-nanodisk heterostructure, as a practical demonstration of magnonic OAM transfer to manipulate topological spin defects.

Our aim was to assess attitudes regarding accreditation implementation by conducting a survey in three Croatian accredited medical laboratories. Materials and methods: An anonymous survey consisting of 34 questions was distributed either electronically or in a paper form a week prior to scheduled annual audits. Distributions of answers regarding age, work experience, laboratory workplace, and education level and according to the respective laboratory were compared. Results: The overall response rate was 76% (225/297). Preference towards working in an accredited laboratory and a positive attitude were revealed by 70% and 56% participants, respectively, with better process documentation as the main advantage. Only 14% of responders considered themselves completely familiar with ISO 15189:2012. Total of 68% of responders felt that accreditation increases the usual workload, with excessive paperwork as the main contributor. Half of the responders declared partial agreement that accreditation requirements and expectations were clearly explained and claimed that their suggestions were taken into account only occasionally, which was especially emphasized by technical staff. The vast majority (89%) completely follow the prescribed protocols. Only 27% consider turnaround time monitoring useful. Competence assessment is considered efficient by 41% of responders. The majority (73%) prefer an online audit in times of COVID-19. Conclusions: Despite an overall positive attitude towards accreditation, further efforts are needed in providing better education about ISO 15189:2012 for technical staff and modifying formats of competence assessment, in order to achieve better adherence to ISO 15189:2012 requirements.","Lapic, Ivana; Rogic, Dunja; Ivic, Matea; Tomicevic, Marina; Kardum Paro, Mirjana Mariana; Derek, Lovorka; Alpeza Viman, Ines",Biochem Med (Zagreb),14,26

Computational methods for imputing the missing values using RNA expression data usually allow only for imputations of proteins measured in at least some of the samples. In silico methods for comprehensively estimating abundances across all proteins are still missing. RESULTS: We propose a novel method using deep learning to extrapolate the observed protein expression values in label-free MS experiments to all proteins, leveraging gene functional annotations and RNA measurements as key predictive attributes. We tested our method on four datasets, including human cell lines and human and mouse tissues. Our method predicts the protein expression values with average R2 scores between 0.46 and 0.54, which is significantly better than predictions based on correlations using the RNA expression data alone. Moreover, we demonstrate that the derived models can be ""transferred"" across experiments and species. For instance, the model derived from human tissues gave a R2 = 0.51 when applied to mouse tissue data. We conclude that protein abundances generated in label free MS experiments can be computationally predicted using functional annotated attributes and can be used to highlight aberrant protein abundance values.

Several pharmacists working in the Pharmacy and Medical Devices Department of the Madrid Regional Health Service were called to manage the Pharmacy Department of the abovementioned hospital. Required permissions to set up a PD were here authorized urgently. Tackling human and material resources, and computer systems for drug purchase and electronic prescription, were some of the initial issues that hindered the pharmaceutical provision required for patients from the very day one. Once the purchase was assured, mainly by direct purchase from suppliers, drug dispensing up to 1,250 hospitalized patients (25 nursing units) and 8 ICU patients was taken on. Dispensing was carried out through either drug stocks in the nursing units or individual patient dispensing for certain drugs. Moreover, safety issues related to prescription were considered, and as the electronic prescription was implemented we attained 100% prescriptions review and validation. The constitution of a multidisciplinary Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee let agree to a pharmacotherapy guide, pres cription protocols, therapeutic equivalences, interactions, and drug dispensing circuits. The Pharmacy Department strategy was to ensure a very quick response to basic tasks keeping the aim to offer a pharmaceutical care of the highest quality whenever possible. Working under a health emergency situation, with many uncertainties and continuous pressure was a plight. However, the spirit of collaboration in and out of the Pharmacy Department was aligned with the whole hospital motivation to offer the highest quality of healthcare. These were possibly the keys to allow caring for almost 4,000 patients during the 42 days that the hospital lasted.","Aranguren-Oyarzábal, Ainhoa; Segura-Bedmar, María; Calvo-Alcántara, María José",Farm Hosp,14,7

But after White moves first in chess, if Black has a double move followed by a double move of White and then alternating play, play is more balanced because White does not always tie or lead in moves. Symbolically, Balanced Alternation gives the following move sequence: After White's (W) initial move, first Black (B) and then White each have two moves in a row (BBWW), followed by the alternating sequence, beginning with W, which altogether can be written as WB/BW/WB/WB/WB... (the slashes separate alternating pairs of moves). Except for reversal of the 3rd and 4th moves from WB to BW, this is the standard chess sequence. Because Balanced Alternation lies between the standard sequence, which favors White, and a comparable sequence that favors Black, it is highly likely to produce a draw with optimal play, rendering chess fairer. This conclusion is supported by a computer analysis of chess openings and how they would play out under Balanced Alternation.","Brams, Steven J.; Ismail, Mehmet S.",,14,16

A similar event is experienced by some healthcare systems regularly, due to for instance seasonal spikes in the number of patients. We model this as a queueing system in heavy traffic (where the arrival rate is approaching the service rate from below) or in overload (where the arrival rate exceeds the service rate). In both cases we assume that customers (patients) may have different priorities and we consider two popular service disciplines: static priorities and accumulating priorities. It has been shown that the latter allows for patients of all classes to be seen in a timely manner as long as the system is stable. We demonstrate however that if accumulating priorities are used in the heavy traffic or overload regime, then all patients, including those with the highest priority, will experience very long waiting times. If on the other hand static priorities are applied, then one can ensure that the highest-priority patients will be seen in a timely manner even in overloaded systems.","Oz, Binyamin; Shneer, Seva; Ziedins, Ilze",,14,24

Using a plaque reduction assay, we compare inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by heparin, pentosan sulfate, linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS) and hyperbranched polyglycerol sulfate (HPGS). Highly sulfated LPGS is the optimal inhibitor, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 67 µg/mL (approx. 1.6 µM). This synthetic polysulfate exhibits more than 60-fold higher virus inhibitory activity than heparin (IC 50 : 4084 µg/mL), along with much lower anticoagulant activity. Furthermore, in molecular dynamics simulations, we verified that LPGS can bind stronger to the spike protein than heparin, and that LPGS can interact even more with the spike protein of the new N501Y and E484K variants. Our study demonstrates that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells can be blocked via electrostatic interactions, therefore LPGS can serve as a blueprint for the design of novel viral inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.","Nie, Chuanxiong; Pouyan, Paria; Lauster, Daniel; Trimpert, Jakob; Kerkhoff, Yannic; Szekeres, Gergo Peter; Wallert, Matthias; Block, Stephan; Sahoo, Anil Kumar; Dernedde, Jens; Pagel, Kevin; Kaufer, Benedikt B; Netz, Roland R; Ballauff, Matthias; Haag, Rainer",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,14,20

Aim: The present study aimed to evaluate the anxiety related to contracting COVID-19 infection in the public. Methodology: An online survey was conducted using the SurveyMonkey (R) platform-generated link in which a COVID-19 anxiety-specific questionnaire was used to assess anxiety and worry related to contracting COVID-19. A total of 462 responses were analyzed. About one-sixth (18.8%) of the responders reported anxiety in at least one domain and worry in at least one domain related to contracting COVID-19 infection. While 42.2% of the responders had anxiety in at least one domain, highest being in the domain of anxiety related to behaviors of others, about one-fourth of the responders (26.6%) expressed worry in at least one domain, more in the domain of worry related to family members going out to buy something or for work. Males and people of younger age group had significantly greater anxiety score, and those with a chronic physical illness had significantly greater worry score. Conclusion: The present study suggests that there is a heightened level of anxiety in the society due to COVID-19 and about 18.8% of the people may be having anxiety severe enough to require clinical attention. However, the survey findings should be interpreted well with regard to its limitations being circulated in few social media platforms and, therefore, may not be generalized to the entire country.","Grover, S.; Sahoo, S.; Mehra, A.; Nehra, R.",Journal of Mental Health and Human Behaviour,14,24

Neutrophil infiltration was also noted on the pathological findings from autopsies. It is urgent to clarify the pathogenesis of neutrophils leading to severe pneumonia in COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 55 COVID-19 patients classified as mild (n = 22), moderate (n = 25), and severe (n = 8) according to the Guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China. Trends relating leukocyte counts and lungs examined by chest CT scan were quantified by Bayesian inference. Transcriptional signatures of host immune cells of four COVID19 patients were analyzed by RNA sequencing of lung specimens and BALF. Results: Neutrophilia occurred in 6 of 8 severe patients at 7-19 days after symptom onset, coinciding with lesion progression. Increasing neutrophil counts paralleled lesion CT values (slope: 0.8 and 0.3-1.2), reflecting neutrophilia-induced lung injury in severe patients. Transcriptome analysis revealed that neutrophil activation was correlated with 17 neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)-associated genes in COVID-19 patients, which was related to innate immunity and interacted with T/NK/B cells, as supported by a protein-protein interaction network analysis.

The aim of this study was to assess the test performance of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test. The performance of the Accula test was assessed by comparing results of 100 nasopharyngeal swab samples previously characterized by the Stanford Health Care EUA laboratory-developed test (SHC-LDT), targeting the envelope (E) gene. Assay concordance was assessed by overall percent agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and Cohen's kappa coefficient. Overall percent agreement between the assays was 84.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.3 to 90.6%), PPA was 68.0% (95% CI, 53.3 to 80.5%), and the kappa coefficient was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.82). Sixteen specimens detected by the SHC-LDT were not detected by the Accula test and showed low viral load burden, with a median cycle threshold value of 37.7. NPA was 100% (95% CI, 94.2 to 100%).

A survey based on public attitudes,19.849403,0.65748453,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, COVID-19 has dominated headlines around the world and researchers have generated thousands of scientific articles about the disease. The fast speed of publication has challenged researchers and other stakeholders to keep up with the volume of published articles. To search the literature effectively, researchers use databases such as PubMed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of different searches for COVID-19 records in PubMed and to assess the complexity of searches required. METHODS: We tested PubMed searches for COVID-19 to identify which search string performed best according to standard metrics (sensitivity, precision, and F-score). We evaluated the performance of 8 different searches in PubMed during the first 10 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic to investigate how complex a search string is needed. We also tested omitting hyphens and space characters as well as applying quotation marks. RESULTS: The two most comprehensive search strings combining several free-text and indexed search terms performed best in terms of sensitivity (98.4%/98.7%) and F-score (96.5%/95.7%), but the single-term search COVID-19 performed best in terms of precision (95.3%) and well in terms of sensitivity (94.4%) and F-score (94.8%). The term Wuhan virus performed the worst: 7.7% for sensitivity, 78.1% for precision, and 14.0% for F-score. We found that deleting a hyphen or space character could omit a substantial number of records, especially when searching with SARS-CoV-2 as a single term. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive search strings combining free-text and indexed search terms performed better than single-term searches in PubMed, but not by a large margin compared to the single term COVID-19. For everyday searches, certain single-term searches that are entered correctly are probably sufficient, whereas more comprehensive searches should be used for systematic reviews. Still, we suggest additional measures that the US National Library of Medicine could take to support all PubMed users in searching the COVID-19 literature.","Lazarus, Jeffrey V; Palayew, Adam; Rasmussen, Lauge Neimann; Andersen, Tue Helms; Nicholson, Joey; Norgaard, Ole",J Med Internet Res,14,21

This temporal difference was established from early birthdating studies based on DRG soma cell size. However, distinctions in birthdates between molecular subtypes of sensory neurons, particularly nociceptors, is unknown. Here, we assess the birthdate of lumbar DRG neurons in mice using a thymidine analog, EdU, to label developing neurons exiting mitosis combined with co-labeling of known sensory neuron markers. We find that different nociceptor subtypes are born on similar timescales, with continuous births between E9.5 to E13.5, and peak births from E10.5 to E11.5. Notably, we find that thinly myelinated AÎ´-fiber nociceptors and peptidergic C-fibers are born more broadly between E10.5 and E11.5 than previously thought and that non-peptidergic C-fibers and C-LTMRs are born with a peak birth date of E11.5. Moreover, we find that the percentages of nociceptor subtypes born at a particular timepoint are the same for any given nociceptor cell type marker, indicating that intrinsic or extrinsic influences on cell type diversity are occurring similarly across developmental time. Overall, the patterns of birth still fit within the classical ""two wave"" description, as touch and proprioceptive fibers are born primarily at E10.5, but suggest that nociceptors have a slightly broader wave of birthdates with different nociceptor subtypes continually differentiating throughout sensory neurogenesis irrespective of myelination.","Landy, Mark A; Goyal, Megan; Lai, Helen C",Dev Biol,14,20

Oncologists must balance plausible risks of COVID-19 infection with the recognized consequences of delaying cancer treatment, keeping in mind the capacity of the health care system. We sought to investigate treatment patterns in gynecologic cancer care during the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic at three affiliated New York City hospitals located in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens. METHODS: A prospective registry of patients with active or presumed gynecologic cancers receiving inpatient and/or outpatient care at three affiliated New York City hospitals was maintained between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Clinical and demographic data were abstracted from the electronic medical record with a focus on oncologic treatment. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was explored to evaluate the independent effect of hospital location, race, age, medical comorbidities, cancer status and COVID-19 status on treatment modifications. RESULTS: Among 302 patients with gynecologic cancer, 117 (38.7%) experienced a COVID-19-related treatment modification (delay, change or cancellation) during the first two months of the pandemic in New York. Sixty-four patients (67.4% of those scheduled for surgery) had a COVID-19-related modification in their surgical plan, 45 (21.5% of those scheduled for systemic treatment) a modification in systemic treatment and 12 (18.8% of those scheduled for radiation) a modification in radiation. Nineteen patients (6.3%) had positive COVID-19 testing. On univariate analysis, hospital location in Queens or Brooklyn, age &#8804;65 years, treatment for a new cancer diagnosis versus recurrence and COVID-19 positivity were associated with treatment modifications. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, hospital location in Queens and COVID-19 positive testing were independently associated with treatment modifications. CONCLUSIONS: More than one third of patients with gynecologic cancer at three affiliated New York City hospitals experienced a treatment delay, change or cancellation during the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the three New York City boroughs represented in this study, likelihood of gynecologic oncology treatment modifications correlated with the case burden of COVID-19.","Frey, Melissa K; Fowlkes, Rana K; Badiner, Nora M; Fishman, David; Kanis, Margaux; Thomas, Charlene; Christos, Paul J; Martin, Peter; Gamble, Charlotte; Balogun, Onyinye D; Cardenes, Higinia; Gorelick, Constantine; Pua, Tara; Nguyen, Long; Holcomb, Kevin; Chapman-Davis, Eloise",Gynecol Oncol,14,24

As we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, scientists are struggling to understand how it resembles and differs from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) at the genomic and transcriptomic level. In a short time following the outbreak, it has been shown that, similar to SARS-CoV, COVID-19 virus exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the cells. This finding raises the curiosity of investigating the expression of ACE2 in neurological tissue and determining the possible contribution of neurological tissue damage to the morbidity and mortality caused by COIVD-19. Here, we investigate the density of the expression levels of ACE2 in the CNS, the host–virus interaction and relate it to the pathogenesis and complications seen in the recent cases resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. Also, we debate the need for a model for staging COVID-19 based on neurological tissue involvement.","Baig, Abdul Mannan; Khaleeq, Areeba; Ali, Usman; Syeda, Hira",ACS Chem Neurosci,14,33

Seafarers may bear an excess pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with depression symptoms among Chinese seafarers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: This field survey-based study was conducted at Rongcheng Port, Shandong Province, China, from 10 June 2020 to 25 July 2020. Sociodemographic and occupational characteristics and health-related behaviours were collected through a face-to-face questionnaire. The Self-Rating Depression Scale was used to evaluate depression status during the preceding week. Logistic regression models were used to explore factors related to depression. RESULTS: 441 male Chinese seafarers were enrolled. Overall, the proportions of seafarers with low, moderate and severe depression symptoms were 23.35%, 9.30% and 9.07%, respectively. Compared with those with good self-rated health (SRH), seafarers with poor SRH had higher odds of depression (OR, 2.24, 95% CI 1.22 to 4.11). Less leisure time or physical exercise was associated with more severe self-reported depression symptoms (1–3 per week vs ≥4 per week: OR, 1.72, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.14; none vs ≥4 per week: OR, 3.93, 95% CI 1.67 to 9.26). Poor sleep quality was associated with higher likelihood of reporting severe depression (fair vs good: OR, 2.78, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.01; poor vs good: OR, 4.30, 95% CI 1.65 to 11.24). The more frequent seafarers worked overtime a week, the higher the likelihood of reporting severe depression symptoms (1–2 per week vs none: OR, 1.82, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.18; ≥3 per week vs none: OR, 2.49, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.92). Also, high perceived work stress was linked to higher odds of being depressed (intermediate vs low: OR, 2.06, 95% CI 0.78 to 5.46; high vs low: OR, 3.83, 95% CI 1.35 to 10.90). CONCLUSIONS: There is a high burden of depression associated with COVID-19 among seafarers.

While Open Tracheostomy (OT) is the preferred technique due to the excellent visualization of the surgical field and structures, Percutaneous Tracheostomy (PT) has proven to be a feasible minimally invasive alternative. However, PT's limitation relates to the inability to precisely enter the cervical trachea at the exact spot since the puncture is often performed based on crude estimation from anatomical laryngeal surface landmarks. Besides, there is no absolute control of the trajectory and force required to make the percutaneous puncture into the trachea, resulting in inadvertent injury to the cricoid ring, cervical esophagus, and vessels in the neck. Therefore, we hypothesize that a flexible mini-robotic system, incorporating the robotic needling technology, can overcome these challenges by allowing the trans-oral robotic instrument of the cervical trachea. This approach promises to improve current PT technology by making the initial trachea puncture from an “inside-out” approach, rather than an “outside-in” manner, fraught with several technical uncertainties.","Xiao, Xiao; Poon, Howard; Lim, Chwee Ming; Meng, Max Q.-H.; Ren, Hongliang",Front Robot AI,14,16

Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig domain proteins. Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts.","Tan, Yongjun; Schneider, Theresa; Leong, Matthew; Aravind, L; Zhang, Dapeng",bioRxiv,14,20

The aim of the present study was to determine the function and phenotype of T cell populations associated with survival or death of patients with COVID-19 in intensive care as a result of phenotypic and functional profiling by mass cytometry. Increased frequencies of circulating, polyfunctional CD4(+)CXCR5(+)HLA-DR(+) stem cell memory T cells (Tscms) and decreased proportions of granzyme B–expressing and perforin-expressing effector memory T cells were detected in recovered and deceased patients, respectively. The higher abundance of polyfunctional PD-L1(+)CXCR3(+)CD8(+) effector T cells (Teffs), CXCR5(+)HLA-DR(+) Tscms, and anti-nucleocapsid (anti-NC) cytokine-producing T cells permitted us to differentiate between recovered and deceased patients. The results from a principal component analysis show an imbalance in the T cell compartment that allowed for the separation of recovered and deceased patients. The paucity of circulating PD-L1(+)CXCR3(+)CD8(+) Teffs and NC-specific CD8(+) T cells accurately forecasts fatal disease outcome.

METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort of pediatric SOT recipients (January 2010 to June 2013) was assembled from 9 US pediatric transplant centers. Charts were reviewed for RVI events associated with hospitalization within 1 year after the transplant. An RVI diagnosis required respiratory symptoms and detection of a virus (ie, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and/or respiratory syncytial virus). The incidence of RVI was calculated, and the association of baseline SOT factors with subsequent pulmonary complications and death was assessed. RESULTS: Of 1096 pediatric SOT recipients (448 liver, 289 kidney, 251 heart, 66 lung, 42 intestine/multivisceral), 159 (14.5%) developed RVI associated with hospitalization within 12 months after their transplant. RVI occurred at the highest rates in intestine/abdominal multivisceral (38%), thoracic (heart/lung) (18.6%), and liver (15.6%) transplant recipients and a lower rate in kidney (5.5%) transplant recipients. RVI was associated with younger median age at transplant (1.72 vs 7.89 years; P < .001) and among liver or kidney transplant recipients with the receipt of a deceased-donor graft compared to a living donor (P = .01). The all-cause and attributable case-fatality rates within 3 months of RVI onset were 4% and 0%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models revealed that age was independently associated with increased risk for a pulmonary complication (odds ratio, 1.24 [95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.51]) and that receipt of an intestine/multivisceral transplant was associated with increased risk of all-cause death (odds ratio, 24.54 [95% confidence interval, 1.69–327.96]). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, hospital-associated RVI was common in the first year after pediatric SOT and associated with younger age at transplant.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: MEDLINE, Cochrane, Web of Sciences, and SCOPUS were searched for retrospective or prospective observational studies reporting data on cardiovascular risk factors and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Univariable and multivariable age-adjusted analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between cardiovascular risk factors and the occurrence of in-hospital death. RESULTS: The analysis included 45 studies enrolling 18,300 patients. The pooled estimate of in-hospital mortality was 12% (95% CI 9–15%). The univariable meta-regression analysis showed a significant association between age (coefficient: 1.06; 95% CI 1.04–1.09; p < 0.001), diabetes (coefficient: 1.04; 95% CI 1.02–1.07; p < 0.001) and hypertension (coefficient: 1.01; 95% CI 1.01–1.03; p = 0.013) with in-hospital death. Male sex and smoking did not significantly affect mortality. At multivariable age-adjusted meta-regression analysis, diabetes was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (coefficient: 1.02; 95% CI 1.01–1.05; p = 0.043); conversely, hypertension was no longer significant after adjustment for age (coefficient: 1.00; 95% CI 0.99–1.01; p = 0.820). A significant association between age and in-hospital mortality was confirmed in all multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that older age and diabetes are associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, male sex, hypertension, and smoking did not independently correlate with fatal outcome.","Silverio, Angelo; Di Maio, Marco; Citro, Rodolfo; Esposito, Luca; Iuliano, Giuseppe; Bellino, Michele; Baldi, Cesare; De Luca, Giuseppe; Ciccarelli, Michele; Vecchione, Carmine; Galasso, Gennaro",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,14,16

Recent studies from Spain and France have indicated that underlying phenotypes may exist among patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. Whether those same phenotypes exist in the United States (US) remains unclear. Using latent class analysis (LCA), we sought to determine whether clinical phenotypes exist among patients admitted for COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of adult patients who were hospitalized primarily for COVID-19 at Greenwich Hospital and performed LCA using variables based on patient demographics and comorbidities. To further examine the reliability and replicability of the clustering results, we repeated LCA on the cohort of patients who died during hospitalization for COVID-19. RESULTS: Two phenotypes were identified in patients admitted for COVID-19 (N = 483). According to phenotype, patients were designated as cluster 1 (C1) or cluster 2 (C2). C1 (n = 193) consisted of older individuals with more comorbidities and a higher mortality rate (25.4% vs 8.97%, p < 0.001) than patients in C2. C2 (n = 290) consisted of younger individuals who were more likely to be obese, male, and nonwhite, with higher levels of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein and alanine aminotransferase. When we performed LCA on the cohort of patients who died during hospitalization for COVID-19 (n = 75), we found that the distribution of patient baseline characteristics and comorbidities was similar to that of the entire cohort of patients admitted for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Using LCA, we identified two clinical phenotypes of patients who were admitted to our hospital for COVID-19. These findings may reflect different pathophysiologic processes that lead to moderate to severe COVID-19 and may be useful for identifying treatment targets and selecting patients with severe COVID-19 disease for future clinical trials.","Teng, Catherine; Thampy, Unnikrishna; Bae, Ju Young; Cai, Peng; Dixon, Richard A F; Liu, Qi; Li, Pengyang",Infect Drug Resist,14,30

OBJECTIVE: To determine the COVID-19 infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate among the non-congregate population in Connecticut between March 1 and June 1, 2020. METHODS: The infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate were calculated for adults residing in non-congregate settings in Connecticut before June 2020. Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were estimated using the seroprevalence estimates from the recently conducted Post-Infection Prevalence study. Information on total hospitalizations and deaths was obtained from the Connecticut Hospital Association and the Connecticut Department of Public Health. RESULTS: Before June 1, 2020, nearly 113,515 (90% CI 56,758–170,273) individuals were estimated to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and there were 7792 hospitalizations and 1079 deaths among the non-congregate population. The overall COVID-19 infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate was 6.86% (90% CI, 4.58%–13.72%) and 0.95% (90% CI, 0.63%–1.90%) and there was variation in these rate estimates across subgroups; older individuals, men, non-Hispanic Black individuals, and those belonging to 2 of the counties had a higher burden of adverse outcomes, though the differences between most subgroups were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Using representative seroprevalence estimates, the overall COVID-19 infection hospitalization rate and infection fatality rate were estimated to be 6.86% and 0.95%, respectively, among community residents in Connecticut.","Mahajan, Shiwani; Caraballo, César; Li, Shu-Xia; Dong, Yike; Chen, Lian; Huston, Sara K.; Srinivasan, Rajesh; Redlich, Carrie A.; Ko, Albert I.; Faust, Jeremy S.; Forman, Howard P.; Krumholz, Harlan M.",Am J Med,14,30

Children had mild symptoms and hardly infected other children or adults. It is worth considering that children are the most vulnerable to respiratory pathogens, but fatal SARS-like virus had not caused severe cases among them. According to the pathological studies of COVID-19 and SARS, a sharp decrease in T lymphocytes leads to the breakdown of the immune system. The cellular immune system of children differs from that of adults may be the keystone of atypical clinical manifestations or even covert infection. The frequent childhood vaccinations and repeated pathogens infections might be resulting in trained immunity of innate immune cells, immune fitness of adaptive immune cells or cross-protection of antibodies in the children. Therefore, due to lack of specific vaccine, some vaccines for tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia may have certain application potential for the front-line health workers in the prevention and control of COVID-19. However, for high-risk susceptible populations, such as the elderly with basic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, it is necessary to explore the acclimatization effect of the planned immune process on their immunity to achieve the trained immunity or immune fitness, so as to improve their own antiviral ability.","Lyu, Jinglu; Miao, Tianyu; Dong, Jiajia; Cao, Ranran; Li, Yan; Chen, Qianming",Med Hypotheses,14,10

After a month, it was declared a global threat to public health. The effects of the pandemic could be socio-economic, undermining the health system and risking livelihoods. Vulnerability to this infection has been associated with underlying comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, and compromised immune systems. Co-morbidity has been common to the elderly, the disabled, and the homeless. In addition, more severe coronavirus disease outcomes have been reported in older males than females. Nonetheless, multiple variables are related to the concept of cultural gender that should be taken into account as women in more affected sectors are economically disadvantageous and over-represented. Similarly, although children are not the face of this pandemic, calamity has a profound effect on their welfare, especially for those living in poor and inconvenient situations. Moreover, the economic influence could be profound and universal when viewed through a migration lens as it is exacerbating xenophobic and discriminatory treatment.

The effective number of codons (ENC) ranged from 54.51 to 55.54 with an average of 54.87 ± 0.285, which reveals a relatively stable nucleotide composition. We found that codon usage bias of the SVA was low. Mutational pressure acted as an increasingly dominant factor for the evolution of the virus compared with the natural selection. Notably, codon usage bias was also affected by the geographic distribution and isolated time. The first systemic analysis on the codon usage bias of the SVA provides important information for the understanding of the evolution of the SVA and has fundamental and theoretical benefits.","Chen, Ye; Xu, Quanming; Tan, Chen; Li, Xinxin; Chi, Xiaojuan; Cai, Binxiang; Yu, Ziding; Ma, Yanmei; Chen, Ji-Long",Microbial Pathogenesis,14,33

This study aimed to identify the clinical value of PET/CT scans in IIM-ILD patients and to construct a predictive model for RP-ILD. METHODS: Adult IIM-ILD patients who were hospitalized at four divisions of the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (FAHZJU), from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2020 were reviewed. PET/CT scans and other characteristics of patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were collected and analysed. RESULTS: A total of 61 IIM-ILD patients were enrolled in this study. Twenty-one patients (34.4%) developed RP-ILD, and 24 patients (39.3%) died during follow-up. After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, the percent-predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO%, P = 0.014), bilateral lung mean standard uptake value (SUVmean, P = 0.014) and abnormal mediastinal lymph node (P = 0.045) were significantly different between the RP-ILD and non-RP-ILD groups. The subsequent univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses verified our findings. A “DLM” model was established by including the above three values to predict RP-ILD with a cut-off value of ≥ 2 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.905. Higher bilateral lung SUVmean (P = 0.019) and spleen SUVmean (P = 0.011) were observed in IIM-ILD patients who died within 3 months, and a moderate correlation was recognized between the two values. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated bilateral lung SUVmean, abnormal mediastinal lymph nodes and decreased DLCO% were significantly associated with RP-ILD in IIM-ILD patients.

The aims of the study were: (1) to examine the trajectories of anxiety, depression, and pandemic-related stress factors (PRSF) of COVID-19 hospitalized patients one-month following hospitalization; (2) to assess the presence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) a month after hospitalization; (3) to identify baseline risk and protective factors that would predict PTSS one month after hospitalization. METHODS: We contacted hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 64) by phone, at three time-points: during the first days after admission to the hospital (T1); after ~two weeks from the beginning of hospitalization (T2), and one month after hospitalization (T3). At all time-points we assessed the levels of anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as PRSF. At T3, PTSS were assessed. RESULTS: The levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms decreased one-month following hospitalization.

This preliminary study is justified by the primary immunodeficiency of children with DS and the opportunistic nature of the parasite, considering the vague situation of anti-Toxoplasma IgG seroprevalence among children with DS because of neglecting its study on local and global scales. METHODS: This descriptive, facility-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among 107 children with DS hosted in six randomly selected rehabilitation centers for children with special needs in Sana’a city. Demographics of children and their mothers’ knowledge of toxoplasmosis were collected using a pre-designed, structured questionnaire. Anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies were measured in the sera of children using electrochemiluminescence assay. RESULTS: Of 107 children with DS, 3 (2.8%) were seropositive for anti-Toxoplasma IgG. Approximately two-thirds (71/106) of the mothers of children with DS were aware of toxoplasmosis. Of whom, 83.1% (59/71) were aware of its congenital complications. CONCLUSION: The majority of children with DS in Sana’a city are seronegative for anti-Toxoplasma IgG, where the seropositivity rate is lower than 3.0%. Therefore, children with DS are non-immune and susceptible to the acquisition of primary infections during their life. Further analytical studies are recommended to determine whether the defective immune response of children with DS is associated with false seronegativity, to assess the role of their mothers’ knowledge in reducing their exposure to infection if they were confirmed truly seronegative and to identify the predictors of infection among them.","Al-Awadi, Asmaa A.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This observational cohort study involved consecutively diagnosed COVID-19 patients tested between March the 3rd 2020 and March the 24th 2020, in a geographically defined cohort area. All COVID-19 patients were evaluated in a University Hospital. The primary outcome of interest is the prevalence of smell and taste alterations, factors associated and recovery rate. Univariate and multivariate analysis by logistic regression was performed to detect factors associated to these symptoms. RESULTS: 151 patients were included and 99 (65.3%) reported olfactory or gustatory symptoms. Olfactory dysfunction was reported by 75 patients (49.7%). Isolated anosmia was found in 2 patients (1.3%). Gustatory dysfunction was reported by 91 patients (60.3%). Factors associated with higher prevalence of smell dysfunction included age, sex, and comorbidities. The time to smell disruption development was significantly shorter in mild to moderate patients than in severe patients (p = 0.043).

Millions of people are infected, and the death rate is also quite high in different countries. So, there is an urgent requirement of the invention of some effective and efficient drugs that can be effective against this deadly viral infection. The invention of new drugs and vaccine has become a matter of utmost importance to stop the mayhem of coronavirus pandemic. In the middle of such a deadly pandemic, the necessity of development of a vaccine is of high importance in this context. Among all the popular methods of vaccine development, the mRNA vaccines turned out to be the one of the most versatile vaccine with quick responses. However, in this review, we have explained all the possible types of vaccines available including DNA vaccines, RNA vaccines, and live and attenuated vaccines. Their effectiveness, importance, and application of the vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been discussed. Research is also being conducted in the field of gene silencing, and one of the best possible ways to combat the virus at the molecular level is by applying RNAi technology. The modified siRNA molecules can be used to silence the gene expression of the virus. A summarization of the virus’s behavior, characteristics, and the methods by which RNAi technology can be administered to control the virus is depicted in this study.","Talukder, Pratik; Chanda, Sounak",Appl Biochem Biotechnol,14,12

RECENT FINDINGS: SoMe has been critical in fostering education, outreach, awareness, collaboration, dissemination of information, and advocacy in cardio-oncology. This has become increasingly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which SoMe has helped share best practices, community, and research focused on the impact of COVID-19 in cardiology and hematology/oncology, with cardio-oncology at the interface of these two subspecialty fields. SUMMARY: A strength of SoMe is the ability to amplify a message in real-time, globally, with minimal investment of resources. This has been particularly beneficial for the emerging field of cardio-hematology/cardio-oncology, a field focused on the interplay of cancer and cardiovascular disease.

It has been shown that the nucleolus structure, formed around nucleolus organiser regions (NORs) and attributed Cajal bodies, is prone to disassembly and reassembly correlated to various physiological and pathological stimuli. To evaluate the effect of parasite stimulus on the structure of the leukocyte nucleolus, we exposed rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to the crude extract of the nematode A. pegreffii (Anisakidae), and compared the observed changes to the effect of control (RPMI-1640 media), immunosuppressive (MPA) and immunostimulant treatment (bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and viral analogue polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)) by confocal microscopy. Poly I:C triggered the most accentuated changes such as nucleolar fragmentation and structural unravelling, LPS induced nucleolus thickening reminiscent of cell activation, while MPA induced disassembly of dense fibrillar and granular components. A. pegreffii crude extract triggered nucleolar segregation, expectedly more enhanced in treatment with a higher dose. This is the first evidence that leukocyte nucleoli already undergo structural changes 12 h post-parasitic stimuli, although these are likely to subside after successful cell activation.","Mladineo, Ivona; Hrabar, Jerko",Genes (Basel),14,23

Materials and Methods: We distributed an anonymous online questionnaire via RedCap(®) to all emergency health care workers who could be involved in patient care after a nuclear or radiation disaster. It comprised 18 questions divided into three parts—theoretical knowledge and practical assessment, stress assessment, and sociodemographic criteria. Results: We analyzed 107 responses. There was a significant 11-point increase in stress levels between work and home regarding nuclear or radiation disaster risks (p = 0.01). Less than 25% of emergency health care workers surveyed benefited from annual training. Conclusion: The stress levels of emergency health care workers regarding nuclear or radiation disaster were higher at work than at home and increased without annual training.

The study aimed to assess global COVID-19 vaccination intention, vaccine characteristics influencing vaccination acceptance and desirable vaccine characteristics influencing the choice of vaccines. METHODS: An anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted between 4 January and 5 March 2021 in 17 countries worldwide. Proportions and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and vaccine characteristics influencing vaccination acceptance were generated and compared across countries and regions. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Of the 19,714 responses received, 90.4% (95% CI 81.8–95.3) reported likely or extremely likely to receive COVID-19 vaccine. A high proportion of likely or extremely likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was reported in Australia (96.4%), China (95.3%) and Norway (95.3%), while a high proportion reported being unlikely or extremely unlikely to receive the vaccine in Japan (34.6%), the U.S. (29.4%) and Iran (27.9%). Males, those with a lower educational level and those of older age expressed a higher level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Less than two-thirds (59.7%; 95% CI 58.4–61.0) reported only being willing to accept a vaccine with an effectiveness of more than 90%, and 74.5% (95% CI 73.4–75.5) said they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine with minor adverse reactions. A total of 21.0% (95% CI 20.0–22.0) reported not accepting an mRNA vaccine and 51.8% (95% CI 50.3–53.1) reported that they would only accept a COVID-19 vaccine from a specific country‐of‐origin. Countries from the Southeast Asia region reported the highest proportion of not accepting mRNA technology. The highest proportion from Europe and the Americas would only accept a vaccine produced by certain countries. The foremost important vaccine characteristic influencing vaccine choice is adverse reactions (40.6%; 95% CI 39.3–41.9) of a vaccine and effectiveness threshold (35.1%; 95% CI 33.9–36.4). CONCLUSIONS: The inter-regional and individual country disparities in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy highlight the importance of designing an efficient plan for the delivery of interventions dynamically tailored to the local population.

However, psychophysical olfactory tests performed by an examiner are very difficult in these highly infectious patients. This study aimed to develop and validate a questionnaire for olfactory function that can be readily used to evaluate olfactory loss. METHODS: Fourteen smell-related questions were created based on smells familiar to Koreans. Among them, questions with a κ value of 0.6 or higher were finally selected through a test-retest reliability analysis. The correlations between the scores of the olfactory questionnaire and those of olfactory function tests (Butanol Threshold Test [BTT] and Cross Cultural Smell Identification Test [CCSIT]) were analyzed. To evaluate the predictive ability of the questionnaire and elicit cutoff values, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated. RESULTS: Out of the 14 questions in the questionnaire, 11 (κ > 0.6) were selected for the olfactory questionnaire. We analyzed 2,273 subjects, and there was a significant correlation between the total score of the olfactory questionnaire and the BTT (r = 0.643, P < 0.001) or CCSIT (r = 0.615, P < 0.001) scores. ROC curves for the olfactory questionnaire, BTT, and CCSIT all demonstrated high predictive power to discriminate anosmia and severe hyposmia from normosmia. Regarding mild to moderate hyposmia, however, ROC curve for the olfactory questionnaire alone showed high predictive power of discrimination from normosmia. Based on the results of ROC curves among the subclasses, we suggest the classification of the total score of the questionnaire as 0–4, 5–17, 18–27, 28–41, and 42–44, for anosmia, severe hyposmia, moderate hyposmia, mild hyposmia, and normosmia, respectively. CONCLUSION: The total scores of the questionnaires correlated with the BTT and CCSIT scores.

Unless the patient has bacteraemia or pleural empyema, aetiological diagnostics are limited and antibiotic treatment is empirical. Published data on expected response to therapy are scarce. To determine the clinical response to antibiotic treatment in a developed country in otherwise healthy children with community-acquired pneumonia, we conducted a prospective study of 153 hospitalised children with pneumonia. The role of 17 microbes as potential causative agents was evaluated. The duration of fever (>37.5°C) and hospitalisation were studied as objective measures of recovery. A potential aetiology was found in 83% of 153 patients: 29% of the patients had sole viral and 26% sole bacterial and 29% mixed viral-bacterial infections. The median duration of fever after the onset of antibiotic treatment (mainly penicillin G) was 14 h and the median duration of hospitalisation was 48 h. Patients with mixed viral-bacterial infection became afebrile more slowly than those with either sole viral or sole bacterial infections. Conclusion: the findings indicate that in a developed country, children with pneumonia make a rapid, uneventful recovery needing only a short hospital stay.

The HRV pathogenic role in four groups of hospitalized patients (pediatric immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, and adult immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients) was investigated by quantifying HRV load in nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage samples by real‐time reverse transcription PCR (RT‐PCR). Real‐time RT‐PCR was performed in duplicate on all respiratory samples resulting positive by qualitative RT‐PCR. In addition, molecular typing allowed detection of all known HRV species (A, B, and C). In immunocompetent pediatric patients HRVs were mostly associated with lower respiratory tract infections (in the absence of other viral agents) and wheezing, when viral load was ≥10(6) RNA copies/ml. In young immunocompromised patients (stem cell transplantation recipients), an inverse correlation between HRV persistence over time and time at which the infection occurred after transplantation was observed, whereas in adult immunocompromised patients (lung transplant recipients) HRVs could be detected at a medium–low level (<10(5) RNA copies/ml) in bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken routinely from asymptomatic patients. In conclusion, when detected at high viral load, HRVs may cause severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections, whereas when detected at a medium–low viral load, an event more frequent in immunocompromised subjects, they may represent only bystander viruses.

One barrier to widespread testing has been a paucity of traditional respiratory viral swab collection kits relative to the demand. Whether other sample collection kits, such as widely available MRSA nasal swabs can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. METHODS: We compared simultaneous nasal MRSA swabs (COPAN ESwabs (®) 480C flocked nasal swab in 1mL of liquid Amies medium) and virals wabs (BD H192(07) flexible mini-tip flocked nasopharyngeal swabs in 3mL Universal Transport Medium) for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing using Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay on patients over a 4-day period. When the results were discordant, the viral swab sample was run again on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress (®) SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: Of the 81 included samples, there were 19 positives and 62 negatives in viral media and 18 positives and 63 negative in the MRSA swabs.

In this stressful situation, the question arises as to what mechanisms distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive self-regulation. The theory of Motivated Cue-Integration (MCI) is a novel theory of self-regulation that provides a new perspective on the effect of COVID-19 on self-regulation deficiency as an example of psychological distress. Inspired by predictive coding, social cognition, embodied cognition, and experiential approach, MCI suggests that self-regulation is based on interaction between (1) high-level values and goals, (2) low-level interoceptive and exteroceptive signals, and (3) trust in epistemic authority or a significant other. Motivated Cue-Integration posits that individuals create meaning by making moment-to-moment predictions that affect their interpretation of the experience of ambiguity influenced by their relationship with epistemic authority. According to MCI, deficiency in self-regulation during COVID-19 could result either from over-sensitivity or under-sensitivity to low-level interoceptive and exteroceptive cues; rigidity or ambiguity of high-level goals, poor integration between the two levels of processing as well as distrust in epistemic authority. According to MCI, variations of these deficiencies may occur in various clinical phenomena such as alexithymia and somatization, as well as in social phenomena such as goal radicalization. Based on this reasoning, MCI claims that the mentalization of the relationship between interoceptive cues, exteroceptive cues, goals, and psychological needs of the person, as well as the improvement of confidence in epistemic authority, can promote adaptive self-regulation. Psychological intervention can foster trust in epistemic authority, increase the mentalization of interoceptive and exteroceptive cues, and their association with adaptive goals. As such, the integration of these elements in a way that facilitates incentives pathways and insight fosters a more integrated subjective experience, higher clarity of emotion, and positive internal dialogue which promotes action tendency.","Shalev, Idit",Front Psychiatry,14,24

Its symptoms usually show up in the developmental stages, i.e., within the first two years after birth, and it impacts around 1% of the population globally [https://www.autism-society.org/whatis/facts-and-statistics/. Accessed 25 Dec 2019]. ASD is mainly caused by genetics or by environmental factors; however, its conditions can be improved by detecting and treating it at earlier stages. In the current times, clinical standardized tests are the only methods which are being used, to diagnose ASD. This not only requires prolonged diagnostic time but also faces a steep increase in medical costs. To improve the precision and time required for diagnosis, machine learning techniques are being used to complement the conventional methods. We have applied models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Naïve Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), and KNN to our dataset and constructed predictive models based on the outcome. The main objective of our paper is to thus determine if the child is susceptible to ASD in its nascent stages, which would help streamline the diagnosis process. Based on our results, Logistic Regression gives the highest accuracy for our selected dataset.","Vakadkar, Kaushik; Purkayastha, Diya; Krishnan, Deepa",SN Comput Sci,14,28

Thus, this study assessed health department websites (N = 50) to determine if CWF content existed, the ease of finding it, and if it was written in plain language and for a consumer audience. We used the web component of the HLE2: The Health Literacy Environment of Hospitals and Health Centers (HLE2) to assess how easy or difficult it was to the navigate a website and find information. Forty-one websites had CWF information; 37 states had content written for a consumer audience. HLE2 scores ranged from 0 to 54 points (60 possible). Only five states had websites with a HLE2 score of 50 or higher. SHDs with higher HLE2 scores were easy to navigate and their content was written for a consumer audience. Study findings suggest most SHDs should improve their website’s CWF content and its accessibility to better promote the role of fluoridated water in preventing dental caries.","Maybury, Catherine; Jacob, Matt; Flanders, Jessica M.; Horowitz, Alice M.",PLoS One,14,1

We aimed to study the association between obesity, co-morbidities and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Methods Clinical data from 417 patients were collected retrospectively from the Al Kuwait Hospital, Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP), Dubai, United Arab Emirates, who were admitted between March and June 2020. Patients were divided according to their body mass index (BMI). Various clinical outcomes were examined: presenting symptoms, severity, major co-morbidities, ICU admission, death, ventilation, ARDS, septic shock and laboratory parameters. Results The average BMI was 29 ± 6.2 kg/m2. BMI alone was not associated with the outcomes examined. However, class II obese patients had more co-morbidities compared to other groups. Hypertension was the most significant co-morbidity associated with obesity. Patients with BMI above the average BMI (29 kg/m2) and presence of underlying co-morbidities showed significant increase in admission to ICU compared to patients below 29 kg/m2 and underlying co-morbidities (21.7% Vs. 9.2%), ARDS development (21.7% Vs. 10.53%), need for ventilation (8.3% Vs. 1.3%), and mortality (10% Vs. 1.3%). Conclusions Our data suggests that presence of underlying co-morbidities and high BMI work synergistically to affect the clinical outcomes of COVID-19.","Al Heialy, Saba; Yaseen Hachim, Mahmood; Yaseen Hachim, Ibrahim; Bin Naeem, Kashif; Hannawi, Haifa; Al Salmi, Issa; Hannawi, Suad",Saudi J Biol Sci,14,1

The aerosol size was measured using an Andersen sampler. Eight first stage HEPA filters (numbered 1–8) were distributed in contaminated labs and exhausts from each of the first stage HEPA filters were aggregated and filtered through one second stage HEPA filter before being released to the environment. In total, 8 first-stage and 1 second-stage HEPA filters from the BSL-3 air purification system were analyzed. No S. marcescens was detected in first stage filters 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 and the second stage HEPA filter. The filtration efficiencies against aerosolized S. marcescens were >99.9999%. First stage filter numbers 3 and 6 had filtration efficiencies of 99.9825% and 99.9906%, respectively. When filter number 3 was replaced by a new filter and the bracket for filter number 6 was sealed, no aerosolized S. marcescens was detected in the filtered air. Our work suggests that the BSL-3 laboratory HEPA filter air purification system is effective against bacterial aerosols, with little to no bacterial leakage into the environment.","Wen, Zhanbo; Yang, Wenhui; Li, Na; Wang, Jie; Hu, Lingfei; Li, Jinsong; Yin, Zhe; Zhang, Ke; Dong, Xiaokai",Particuology,14,11

Ecological evidence indicates that countries with national universal BCG vaccination programs for tuberculosis (TB) prevention have a much lower incidence of severe COVID-19 and mortality compared with those that do not have such programs. BCG is a century old vaccine used for TB prevention via infant/childhood vaccination in lowto middle-income countries with high infection prevalence rate and is known to reduce all-cause neonatal mortality. BCG remains the standard immunotherapy treatment for patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer globally for more than 44 years. Several trials are, therefore, investigating BCG as a prophylactic against COVID-19 in healthcare workers and the elderly. In this commentary, we discuss the potential mechanisms that may underlie BCG associated heterologous protection with a focus on tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) organogenesis. Given the significance of TLSs in mucosal immunity, their association with positive prognosis and response to immune checkpoint blockade with a critical role of Type I interferon (IFN-1) in inducing these, we also discuss potentiating TLS formation as a promising approach to enhance anti-tumor immunity. We propose that lessons learned from BCG immunotherapy success could be applied to not only augment such microbe-based therapeutics but also lead to similar adjunctive IFN-1 activating approaches to improve response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in cancer.","Koti, Madhuri; Morales, Alvaro; Graham, Charles H; Siemens, David Robert",J Immunother Cancer,14,10

DESIGN AND SETTING: The authors sent an anonymous survey to all obstetrics and gynecology applicants registered through the Electronic Residency Application Service in February 2020 asking respondents to share demographics and number of interview offers received and completed. Based on prior estimates that 12 interviews are needed to match in obstetrics and gynecology, respondents were divided into Group 12+ (those receiving ≥12 interview offers) and Group <12 (those receiving <12 offers). Model assumptions were (1) applicants can complete all interviews they are offered because they are virtual; (2) interview offers that applicants in Group 12+ decline are subsequently offered to applicants in Group <12; (3) the proportions of interviews offered to Group 12+ and Group <12 will remain the same if programs chose to increase their total number of interview spots. PARTICIPANTS: Among 2508 applicants, 750 (30%) provided the number of interview offers received and completed: 417 (56%) in Group 12+ and 333 (44%) in Group <12. RESULTS: In models where applicants are uncapped in the number of interviews, Group <12 applicants receive <1 interview offer, even if programs increase the number of interviews offered and performed. If applicants are capped at 12 interviews, Group <12 applicants will receive 9 interview offers on average and will reach 12 if programs increase the number of interviews offered by 20%. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights how current inefficiencies may lead to negative consequences with virtual interviews. Interview caps and preference signaling systems need to be urgently considered.","Morgan, Helen Kang; Winkel, Abigail F.; Standiford, Taylor; Muñoz, Rodrigo; Strand, Eric A.; Marzano, David A.; Ogburn, Tony; Major, Carol A.; Cox, Susan; Hammoud, Maya M.",J Surg Educ,14,20
