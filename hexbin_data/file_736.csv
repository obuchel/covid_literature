23888,The Experimental Pathology at Ancona: 50 Years of Exciting and Pioneering Research on Human Pathology,2020-01-03,"Successful treatment of HIV with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in an aging HIV-infected population. As HIV-infected patients are living longer, noninfectious pulmonary diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent with a proportional decline in the incidence of opportunistic infections (OIs). Pulmonary OIs such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and tuberculosis are still responsible for a significant proportion of pulmonary diseases in HIV-infected patients. However, bacterial pneumonia (BP) and noninfectious pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and interstitial lung disease (ILD) account for a growing number of pulmonary diseases in aging HIV-infected patients. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the spectrum and management of pulmonary diseases in aging HIV-infected patients, although limited data exists to guide management of many noninfectious pulmonary diseases in HIV-infected patients. In the absence of such data, treatment of lung diseases in HIV-infected patients should generally follow guidelines for management established in HIV-uninfected patients.","Akgün, Kathleen M.; Crothers, Kristina",Aging and Lung Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120014/,736

The species considered for modified products include beef and dairy cattle, sheep, goats, poultry, and a wide variety of fishes. Moreover, the discussion includes the importance of animal food, nongenetically engineered animal modified food products, genetically engineered animal modified food items primarily for meat, milk, or egg and genetically engineered animal food along the transgenic approach for animal welfare. Modern biotechnology can improve productivity, consistency, and quality of alter animal food, fiber, and medical products. The transgenic technology is potentially valuable to alter characters of economic importance in a rapid and precise way. The food safety issue related to genetic engineering is also included in this chapter. The harm of such modified food and transgenic strategy should also be understood by the reader along with its advantages. In this context, transgenic approaches in animal biotechnology are under discussion that ranges from animal food production to their adverse effects.","Saeed, Ali; Abubakar, Muhammad; Kul, Oguz",The Role of Biotechnology in Improvement of Livestock,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121827/,736

Much of the knowledge on pathologic conditions of pinnipeds comes from necropsies of stranded animals and those housed in captivity. As such, disease knowledge is biased toward species frequently housed in zoos and aquaria, those that strand more commonly, or those in which free-ranging populations are more easily accessible. Though historically systematic evaluations of wild populations have rarely been accomplished, in the past 10 years, with advances in marine mammal medicine and anesthesia, biologists and veterinarians more frequently completed live animal health field investigations to evaluate health and disease in free-ranging pinniped populations.","Colegrove, Kathleen M.; Burek-Huntington, Kathy A.; Roe, Wendi; Siebert, Ursula",Pathology of Wildlife and Zoo Animals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150363/,736

Presently, only the virus subtypes of H1N1 and H3N2 still spread from human to human. The viruses spread and replicate under the following conditions: (1) the viruses enter the human body and duplicate there; (2) the viruses cause diseases; and (3) the viruses can easily spread from person to person. The H1N1 influenza viruses replicate is within only respiratory epithelial cells. The virus entering into the cells causes complex pathological changes of the cells. The columnar epithelial cells stop the self-synthesis of cellular component proteins.

47972,The Role of Parent Concrete in Recycled Aggregate Concrete,2020-08-26,"Video representation learning has recently attracted attention in computer vision due to its applications for activity and scene forecasting or vision-based planning and control. Video prediction models often learn a latent representation of video which is encoded from input frames and decoded back into images. Even when conditioned on actions, purely deep learning based architectures typically lack a physically interpretable latent space. In this study, we use a differentiable physics engine within an action-conditional video representation network to learn a physical latent representation. We propose supervised and self-supervised learning methods to train our network and identify physical properties. The latter uses spatial transformers to decode physical states back into images. The simulation scenarios in our experiments comprise pushing, sliding and colliding objects, for which we also analyze the observability of the physical properties. In experiments we demonstrate that our network can learn to encode images and identify physical properties like mass and friction from videos and action sequences in the simulated scenarios. We evaluate the accuracy of our supervised and self-supervised methods and compare it with a system identification baseline which directly learns from state trajectories. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to predict future video frames from input images and actions.

47975,On-Board Comfort of Different Age Passengers and Bus-Lane Characteristics,2020-08-26,"Camera calibration is a prerequisite for many computer vision applications. While a good calibration can turn a camera into a measurement device, it can also deteriorate a system’s performance if not done correctly. In the recent past, there have been great efforts to simplify the calibration process. Yet, inspection and evaluation of calibration results typically still requires expert knowledge. In this work, we introduce two novel methods to capture the fundamental error sources in camera calibration: systematic errors (biases) and remaining uncertainty (variance). Importantly, the proposed methods do not require capturing additional images and are independent of the camera model. We evaluate the methods on simulated and real data and demonstrate how a state-of-the-art system for guided calibration can be improved. In combination, the methods allow novice users to perform camera calibration and verify both the accuracy and precision.

Due to tissue-dependent speckle noise, the elaboration of automated segmentation models has become an important task in the field of medical image processing. We propose a novel, purely data driven geometric approach to order-constrained 3D OCT retinal cell layer segmentation which takes as input data in any metric space. This makes it unbiased and therefore amenable for the detection of local anatomical changes of retinal tissue structure. To demonstrate robustness of the proposed approach we compare four different choices of features on a data set of manually annotated 3D OCT volumes of healthy human retina. The quality of computed segmentations is compared to the state of the art in terms of mean absolute error and Dice similarity coefficient.","Sitenko, Dmitrij; Boll, Bastian; Schnörr, Christoph",Pattern Recognition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972721/,736

47980,Tanger MED SEZs: A Logistic and Industrial Hub in the Western Mediterranean,2020-08-26,"The problem of feature selection has been an area of considerable research in machine learning. Feature selection is known to be particularly difficult in unsupervised learning because different subgroups of features can yield useful insights into the same dataset. In other words, many theoretically-right answers may exist for the same problem. Furthermore, designing algorithms for unsupervised feature selection is technically harder than designing algorithms for supervised feature selection because unsupervised feature selection algorithms cannot be guided by class labels. As a result, previous work attempts to discover intrinsic structures of data with heavy computation such as matrix decomposition, and require significant time to find even a single solution. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, named Explainability-based Unsupervised Feature Value Selection (EUFVS), which enables a paradigm shift in feature selection, and solves all of these problems. EUFVS requires only a few tens of milliseconds for datasets with thousands of features and instances, allowing the generation of a large number of possible solutions and select the solution with the best fit. Another important advantage of EUFVS is that it selects feature values instead of features, which can better explain phenomena in data than features. EUFVS enables a paradigm shift in feature selection. This paper explains its theoretical advantage, and also shows its applications in real experiments. In our experiments with labeled datasets, EUFVS found feature value sets that explain labels, and also detected useful relationships between feature value sets not detectable from given class labels.","Shin, Kilho; Okumoto, Kenta; Shepard, David Lawrence; Kusaba, Akira; Hashimoto, Takako; Amari, Jorge; Murota, Keisuke; Takai, Junnosuke; Kuboyama, Tetsuji; Ohshima, Hiroaki",Agents and Artificial Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972724/,736

Based on our evaluation we observe six recurring problems in these use cases. These problems either relate to the utility of blockchain in the use case, or to how well-documented a use case description is. We point out four red flags that, whenever they occur in a use case description, signal that blockchain may be a sub-optimal solution for that use case. Notably, one of these red flags indicates that there are no clear requirements in the use case descriptions that warrant the use of blockchain.

Therefore, to investigate assignment submission of the student in advance before the end of course is an important problem. The assignment submission prediction is the advantage of the e-learning system because it allows the instructor to find students’ problems on time. Additionally, online learning mostly depends on demographic characteristics such as region, age, and education level. This study uses machine learning (ML) methods to detect students who do not submit assignments on time and then also find which demographic factors affects online assignment submission. The data is publicly available and was collected from an open university of U.K. The result shows that Random Forest is an optimal option for predicting students who do not submit an assignment on time.

Under interactive settings, one should achieve good segmentations while minimizing user input. Current deep learning-based interactive segmentation approaches use early fusion and incorporate user cues at the image input layer. Since segmentation CNNs have many layers, early fusion may weaken the influence of user interactions on the final prediction results. As such, we propose a new multi-stage guidance framework for interactive segmentation. By incorporating user cues at different stages of the network, we allow user interactions to impact the final segmentation output in a more direct way. Our proposed framework has a negligible increase in parameter count compared to early-fusion frameworks. We perform extensive experimentation on the standard interactive instance segmentation and one-click segmentation benchmarks and report state-of-the-art performance.","Majumder, Soumajit; Khurana, Ansh; Rai, Abhinav; Yao, Angela",Pattern Recognition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972736/,736

The Case Study of Sardinia (Italy),2020-08-26,"Scientific workflows are increasingly important for complex scientific applications. Recently, Function as a Service (FaaS) has emerged as a platform for processing non-interactive tasks. FaaS (such as AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions) can play an important role in processing scientific workflows. A number of works have demonstrated their ability to process these workflows. However, some issues were identified when workflows executed on cloud functions due to their limits (e.g., stateless behaviour). A major issue is the additional data transfer during the execution between object storage and the FaaS invocation environment. This leads to increased communication costs. DEWE v3 is one of the Workflow Management Systems (WMSs) that already had foundations for processing workflows with cloud functions. In this paper, we have modified the job dispatch algorithm of DEWE v3 on a function environment to reduce data dependency transfers. Our modified algorithm schedules jobs with precedence constraints to be executed in a single function invocation. Therefore, later jobs can utilise output files generated from their predecessor job in the same invocation. This reduces the makespan of workflow execution. We have evaluated the improved scheduling algorithm and the original with small- and large-scale Montage workflows. The experimental results show that our algorithm can reduce the overall makespan in contrast to the original DEWE v3 by about 10%.","Al-Haboobi, Ali; Kecskemeti, Gabor",Euro-Par 2020: Parallel Processing Workshops,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972751/,736

There are various Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models worldwide that are run on either a local or a global scale to predict future weather. NWP models typically take hours to finish a complete run, however, depending on the input parameters and the size of the forecast domain. Provenance information is of central importance for detecting unexpected events that may develop during model execution, and also for taking necessary action as early as possible. Besides, the need to share scientific data and results between researchers or scientists also highlights the importance of data quality and reliability. In this study, we develop a framework for tracking The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and for generating, storing, and analyzing provenance data. We develop a machine-learning-based log parser to enable the proposed system to be dynamic and adaptive so that it can adapt to different data and rules. The proposed system enables easy management and understanding of numerical weather forecast workflows by providing provenance graphs. By analyzing these graphs, potential faulty situations that may occur during the execution of WRF can be traced to their root causes.

It constitutes generally the final step in a more complex chain of high quality spectral clustering. However this chain suffers from lack of scalability when addressing large datasets. This can be overcome by applying also the k-means algorithm as a pre-processing task to reduce the input data instances. We describe parallel optimization techniques for the k-means algorithm on CPU and GPU.

The blockchain technology application to the financial industry is giving birth to Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The transition is studied through a cross-chain analysis that allows to compare different blockchain ecosystems characterized by diverse evolution courses. The results show a path dependency linked to the first-mover advantage of the Ethereum blockchain. The analysis also highlights the emergence of new players that propose higher scalability opportunities (e.g., Eos, Tezos) and different design choices in terms of governance. This exploratory study also emphasizes the potential complementarity between the standard financial system and DeFi, discussing the main differences among the financial services provided on-chain and off-chain.","Moncada, Roberto; Ferro, Enrico; Favenza, Alfredo; Freni, Pierluigi",Euro-Par 2020: Parallel Processing Workshops,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972766/,736

The amount of information is huge, and it is often difficult to distinguish normal news and comments from unreliable information. In this regard, the issue of detecting fake news and countering its spread becomes urgent. This task is not trivial for the following reasons: firstly, the volume of content that is created every day on the Internet is enormous; secondly, the detection system requires news plots that are obviously true; thirdly, the system must be able to analyze information in close to real time. The article presents a new approach to detecting the spread of false information on the Internet based on the use of data science algorithms. The concept of a fake news detection system includes 4 components and a data storage system. The article presents an experimental evaluation of methods implemented in the framework of the neural network training component and the detection of false information.","Vitkova, L.; Valieva, K.; Kozlov, D.",Advances in Automation II,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972767/,736

Recent technological advances in microscopy (FISH, STORM) and sequencing approaches (Hi-C, GAM, SPRITE) enabled to collect quantitative data about chromatin 3D architecture, revealing a non-random and highly specific organization. To transform such tremendous amount of data into valuable insights on genome folding, heavy computational analyses are required. Here, we study the performances of PRISMR, a computational tool based on Machine Learning strategies and Polymer Physics principles, to explore genome 3D structure from Genome Architecture Mapping (GAM) data. Using such data, we show that PRISMR can successfully reconstruct the 3D structure of real genomic regions at various length scales, from mega-base sized loci to whole chromosomes. Importantly, the inferred structures are validated against independent Hi-C data. Finally, we show how PRISMR can be effectively employed to explore differences between experimental methods.","Fiorillo, Luca; Conte, Mattia; Esposito, Andrea; Musella, Francesco; Flora, Francesco; Chiariello, Andrea M.; Bianco, Simona",Euro-Par 2020: Parallel Processing Workshops,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972770/,736

The Two Cases of Milan and Cagliari,2020-08-26,"In spite of dramatic progress in economic development and governance in Asia, major challenges to human security endure. In some cases, these have been exacerbated by national security and development policymaking. Among the most serious challenges are conflict, poverty, environmental degradation, and “natural” or “nature-induced” disasters. Each of these threatens human security. Through interaction with each other, however, they can also serve as insecurity multipliers. This chapter will focus on the intersections of these variables, using case material from several Asian countries. The first part of the chapter will consider conflict as a direct threat to human security, as a poverty multiplier, as a contaminator of the environment, and as a stimulus for state security policy prioritization that directly impacts upon the human security of the most vulnerable, as well as indirectly through resource allocation. Case material for this section will be drawn from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Myanmar, and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The second part of the chapter will examine how insecurity at a state level can lead to a focus on national security and development models, which not only leads to environmental degradation but can also increase disaster vulnerability. It will further evaluate how mega-development practices can pose a direct threat to the most vulnerable, as well as indirectly through impact on the environment. The major case studies here will be Myanmar leading up to the devastating impact of Cyclone Nargis in 2008 and hydroelectric dams in Lao PDR and Malaysia.","Howe, Brendan","Climate Change, Disaster Risks, and Human Security",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972771/,736

In order to analyze these datasets efficiently and present on-the-fly intelligent tutoring to online learners, it is necessary to improve existing learning analytics tools in a parallel and automatic way. We introduce Automatic Temporal Cognitive (ATC) model to describe temporal progress of online learners and evaluate their mastery of course knowledge. As a complex dynamic Bayesian network model, it often causes high computational overhead of training the ATC model via Probabilistic Programming tools. The time-consuming Monte Carlo sampling adopted by the mainstream implementations renders parameter fitting for the model a slow execution process. To address the issue, this paper proposes to transform the ATC model into the form of nonlinear Kalman filter and presents a new parallel ATC tool based on the Spark framework with the method of Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). This tool improves the ATC model by using a parallel UKF method with the capability of automatically estimating the parameters in the whole sequential process. Experimental results demonstrate that this tool can achieve the fast execution speed and greatly improve the robustness of training parameters on different sizes of real educational data sets.","Jiang, Tianrui; Wu, Wenjun; Pu, Yanjun",Euro-Par 2020: Parallel Processing Workshops,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972774/,736

The United Nations finds itself at the juncture of two concepts of justice: natural (heavenly/divine) and that created in cyberspace, recently through artificial intelligence. The right to justice sets the foundations for the entire system of human rights in the world. These rights have been and are being developed by the United Nations, most recently via the implementation of the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda. Justice fulfils and will increasingly play the role of a regulator of social development as the best fit for this function among the fundamental values of the human civilization—the love, the good, the beauty, the truth and the justice. Owing to the United Nations position on the crossroads, the Organization may be ecumenical in its own terms. Yet sooner or later it will have to measure up to effects of human development geared towards artificial intelligence and cyberspaces (as there are more than one), which may result in the emergence of Homo deus. The eventual effect of such an approach may be the building of a global civilization with succeeding generations of “hereditary intelligence” driven by artificial intelligence. Understanding the importance of the creation (or sub-creation) of artificial intelligence and cyberspaces by humanity gives it “legitimacy” to shape these based on commensurate values (criteria): love, good, beauty, truth, and justice, as if they were ‘divine’. Three conclusions follow. First, paraphrasing the famous “If you want peace, prepare for war” we have to“... aim for e-respect.” Second, as there is science related to law, it may be opportune to pursue research and develop separate science related to this form of delivering justice, which I would call “justology.” Third, the post-2030 UN Agenda for sustainable development, with the horizon reaching mid twenty-first century, must face the threats associated with the development of artificial intelligence and cyberspace, considering the emerging opportunities for humanity.","Rutkowski, Karol",Crime Prevention and Justice in 2030,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972777/,736

This framework includes a coarse-segmentation stage to identify the region of interest (ROI) of targets and a fine-segmentation stage to iteratively refine the segmentation. In the coarse-segmentation stage, the F-loss is proposed to keep the high recall rate of the ROI. In the fine segmentation, the ROI of target will be first cropped according to the ROI obtained by coarse-segmentation and be fed into a 3D-Unet to get the initial results.

These computation are a bottleneck that limits the throughput of the system. The paper reports on two implementations of ATLAS’s main signal-processing algorithms, one for CPUs and the other for GPUs, and carefully evaluates their performance. The evaluations indicates that the GPU implementation dramatically improves performance and power-performance relative to our baseline, a high-end desktop CPU typical of the computers in current base stations. Performance improves by more than 50X on a high-end GPU and more than 4X with a GPU platform that consumes almost 5 times less power than the CPU platform.

From those interviews, many important themes emerged and we focused this paper on people’s experiences with privacy violations. We used the Communication Privacy Management Theory (CPM) to analyze distancing behaviors (avoidance or withdrawal) resulting from Boundary Turbulence (privacy violations) with people’s voice-activated phones and Google Search. Through this analysis, we found evidence that distancing behaviors may 1.) be able to transfer from one device to another; and 2.) not depend on the trustworthiness of a particular device or application company. This paper concludes with recommendations for applying the CPM framework more intentionally and rigorously to people’s experiences with voice-activated systems.","Walters, Kristin; Markazi, Daniela M.","Diversity, Divergence, Dialogue",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972919/,736

We obtained 1,584,175 AI related publications during 1950–2019 from the Microsoft Academic Graph. Three latitude-and-longitude-based indicators were employed to quantify the geographic distance of collaborations in AI over time at domestic and international levels. The results show team collaborations in AI has been more popular in the field over time with around 42,000 (38.4%) multiple-affiliation AI publications in 2019. The changes in geographic distances of team collaborations indicate the increase of breadth and density for both domestic and international collaborations in AI over time. In addition, the United States produced the largest number of single-country and internationally collaborated AI publications, and China has played an important role in international collaborations in AI after 2010.","Tang, Xuli; Li, Xin; Ding, Ying; Ma, Feicheng","Diversity, Divergence, Dialogue",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972922/,736

One of the most remarkable disasters of rain-induced rapid long-travelling landslides (RRLL) in Sri Lanka took place at Aranayake, 70 km east of Colombo in 2016 (JICA Survey Team 2016) (JICA Survey Team in Survey results of Aranayake Disaster, 2016). The fluidized landslide mass ran over an about 2 km distance claiming the lives of 125 people. This tragic event has thus highlighted the importance of sophisticated early warning and disaster management mechanism even more than ever, because the presence of these hidden unstable soil masses as well as their run-out distances are very difficult to predict, and once they start sliding, it is almost impossible to stop them. Both the National Building Research Organisation, Sri Lanka (NBRO) and the International Consortium on Landslides (ICL) have jointly compiled a research proposal within the framework of SATREPS, standing for “Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development,” a Japanese government program that promotes international joint researches, and it passed the final round of selection on May 16, 2019. Thus, the new 5-years SATREPS project for Sri Lanka with regard to “Development of early warning technology of Rain-induced Rapid and Long-travelling Landslides (Project RRLL)”, starts in 2020.

Ecological (equivalent CO(2)) and economic costs of each examined retrofitting solution are evaluated and compared. In this way the structural and thermal capacity of the masonry walls is represented by an iso-cost mapping. The environmental demand considering both thermal and seismic load of the construction site is represented by an equivalent function that is used to find the optimal retrofitting solution for each considered cost. In this case study the masonry walls of a school located in Vittoria (RG - Italy) are considered.

A literature review shows a statistical relationship between acceleration level and passenger features, such as age and gender. A large number of onboard interviews have been collected and correlated to bus-lane geometry parameters, to evaluate the vibrational comfort of different passengers. Passenger’s judgments are related to the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical shake. At the same time, a geometric investigation on bus-lane corridors, traveled during interviews, in the city of Cagliari in Italy allowed to extract infrastructure parameters in terms of numbers and density of turns, horizontal curvature radius, speed design, and acceleration variance. The paper analyzed the correlation between some geometric and cinematics road parameters that may affect the comfort and the different passenger’s judgments on the three acceleration components by age classes and hourly day. The results generally show weak correlations between the selected parameters and passenger judgments. Conversely, travel speeds have significant correlation values. There is a moderate inverse correlation between the vibrational level and the age of the passengers. The younger age groups tend to have more severe judgments, attributable to their higher demand for comfort. The presence of preferential lanes increases the onboard comfort quality in terms of speed regularity, without private cars interferences.","Coni, Mauro; Maltinti, Francesca; Pinna, Francesco; Rassu, Nicoletta; Garau, Chiara; Barabino, Benedetto; Maternini, Giulio",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974194/,736
48137,A Methodological Proposal to Support Estimation of Damages from Hailstorms Based on Copernicus Sentinel 2 Data Times Series,2020-08-19,"The problem of the presence of waste in the marine environment has recently taken on the dimensions of a complex and global challenge. In an effort to reduce both the economic and environmental costs of managing port waste, many ports are looking for sustainable solutions for marine waste management. Plasma-assisted gasification (PAG) is an innovative combination of two technologies, namely plasma treatment and gasification, which can be used to efficiently convert carbon-containing wastes to a clean syngas (H2 + CO). The latter can be used to generate electricity directly in gas engines, dual-fuel generators, gas turbines or fuel cells. PAG provides several key benefits which allow removing all the environmental, regulatory and commercial risks typically associated with the potential eco-toxicity of leachable bottom ash produced by incinerators or other thermal processes. PAG does not produce any waste (zero waste), reduces the need for landfilling of waste, and produces a high-value construction material (Plasmarok) which is recognized as a product. All these reasons make PAG a technology capable of optimally solving waste management in ports in line with a circular economy logic. This study is based upon the IMPATTI-NO Project (Interreg IT-FR Maritime Program 2014–2020) which implements several laboratory applications aimed at the chemical-physical treatment of the non-recyclable waste containing plastics deriving from the collection of beached waste and wastes collected by fishermen’s trawls and passenger ships. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PAG for the treatment of port waste, IMPATTI-NO performs experimental tests that simulate PAG pilot plants using artificial samples representative of port waste. This paper describes the research path developed so far and the preparatory elements that led to the definition of specifications for the sampling and collection of port waste.","Fadda, Paolo; Viola, Antonio; Carta, Michele; Secci, Debora; Fancello, Gianfranco; Serra, Patrizia",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974195/,736

Pedestrian accidents are thus an urgent issue for safety improvement, particularly in urban area. Furthermore, recent sustainable mobility oriented policies are boosting walking in urban areas. In order to cope with this increase in pedestrian flows, European municipal authorities, responsible for road safety, traffic management and mobility, need reliable engineering methods to plan urban road safety and protect vulnerable users. Road safety management systems are usually developed to identify hazardous sites and to find suitable countermeasures. Risk exposure assessment is required to identify sites with high accident potential. This assessment requires the knowledge, on one side, of the known vehicular flows and, on the other, of the pedestrian flows, which are not normally known to road operators. In this paper a methodology to develop and calibrate forecasting model aimed at evaluating pedestrian exposure is presented. The model is based on original approach that integrates the Space Syntax modelling framework with pedestrian mobility aspects and a calibration procedure was proposed that use counts on a limited number of roads. Preliminary results derived from a case study in an urban environment seem promising and confirm the model's good ability to predict pedestrian flows.","D’Apuzzo, Mauro; Santilli, Daniela; Evangelisti, Azzurra; Pelagalli, Vincenzo; Montanaro, Orlando; Nicolosi, Vittorio",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974198/,736

The problem of identifying an unknown pollution source in polluted aquifers, based on known contaminant concentrations measurement in the studied areas, is part of the broader group of issues, called inverse problems. In this field, often pollution may result from contaminations whose origins are generated in different times and places where these contaminations have been actually found. To address such scenarios, it is necessary to develop specific techniques that allow to identify time and space features of unknown contaminant sources. The characterization of the contaminant source is of utmost importance for the planning of subsurface remediation in the polluted site. In this work, such identification is solved as an inverse problem in two stages. Firstly a Multi Layer Perceptron neural network is trained on a set of numerical simulations, and then the case under study is reconstructed by inverting the neural model.","Foddis, Maria Laura; Montisci, Augusto",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974200/,736

The paper explores the context of UCH in the Mediterranean and elaborates on the value attached to Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for reaping this opportunity by means of surveying, geolocating, preserving, sustainably exploiting and marketing this heritage. Based on this exploration, but also on the authors’ experience from a specific (U)CH-related cultural planning endeavor, conducted in Leros Island Greece, ICT and non-ICT related barriers for planning heritage-led future trails of insular regions are delineated.","Dionisia, Koutsi; Stratigea, Anastasia",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974208/,736

48153,Combined Photogrammetric and Laser Scanning Survey to Support Fluvial Sediment Transport Analyses,2020-08-19,"The 2011 UNESCO Recommendation defines the Historic Urban Landscape (HUL) as a stratification of historical, cultural and natural values, which broadens the notion of “historic centre” to include the social, environmental and economic components of the urban and geographical context. Italian urban planning has so far adopted a conservative and binding approach to the protection and valorisation of historic settlements. Regulatory planning tools have often failed to combine the protection of physical heritage with the general improvement of urban quality and socio-economic conditions. The limitations of traditional planning can be identified in the difficulty to interpret the urban complexity and in the lack of projects and actions monitoring. The paper investigates the critical issues arising from the application of the traditional planning models for the historic centre, focusing on the case study of the Sardinia Region. The objective of the study is to identify some fields of innovation in the use of planning tools, that take into consideration the characteristics of local contexts and the needs of communities, as recommended by UNESCO. New technologies can contribute to a regularly updated knowledge framework and to the involvement of private actors in regeneration projects. The study shows that the continuous evolution of socio-economic conditions in cities requires open and flexible decision-making based on the principles of sustainability, social inclusion and innovation. The conclusions highlight the need for a review of approaches and tools to give more dynamism and effectiveness to the planning process, including the integration of innovative methods and technologies.","Colavitti, Anna Maria; Floris, Alessio; Serra, Sergio",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974211/,736
48156,A Cloud VM Migration Control Mechanism Using Blockchain,2020-08-19,"In the context of the challenges posed by development models based on overconsumption of natural resources, the paradigm of sustainability defines a new orientation for territorial planning and design. In this regard, greenways play a key role, contributing to safeguard the environment, rehabilitate the fragmented habitats, connect urban and rural areas, revitalize peripheral and degraded areas, and balancing economic growth needs with equal distribution of opportunities and resources. However, the prevailing technical and sectoral approach with which these issues are still addressed – reflecting the fragmentation of instruments and expertises involved in the territorial project – hinder the intervention’s long-term effectiveness. Starting from the critical analysis of the most significant experiences of greenways, this paper highlights the prevailing strategies and actions, in order to build a catalog of good practices transferable to the Sardinian regional context. Sardinia, in fact, represents a potential laboratory for the study of an innovative approach to sustainable territorial regeneration, conceived as an opportunity for local development starting from the networking of the resources – environmental, cultural, economic and social – that compose its complex landscape palimpsest.","Saiu, Valeria; Pinna, Francesco",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974214/,736
48157,Constructing Geo-Referenced Virtual City Models from Point Cloud Primitives,2020-08-19,"The aim of polycentrism, as a policy, is to promote balanced territorial development between urban centres and its hinterland by creating functional integration. In this view, polycentric urban systems are a mean to achieve a more efficient and more sustainable territorial organization than single-centric systems and small dispersed settlements. At regional/local level, an operational objective could be to move from one or two dominant regional centres (polarization) to a network of small and medium-sized centres providing regional services. This process has to be finalized through strategic alliances between cities, particularly where critical mass is lacking, and rural partnerships urban exploring common potential and joint development projects. The idea is to deliver a territorial schema to organize the connection of cities, metropolitan regions and their hinterland through infrastructures and effective services supply distribution. The negative part of this schema represents the territorial insularity effect: it is the case of those in-land areas, considered as the extreme periphery of the polycentric structure, that are not connected, in facts, with any center belonging to the top-level hierarchy adopted in the model. The study for the identification of territorial structures in Basilicata was carried out through the analysis of various variables: the demographic structure, the infrastructure endowment and organizational models that condition the territorial accessibility. In Basilicata three levels of polycentric hierarchy have been identified, according to different levels of concentration of high and medium-level functions. The insularity effect had been mapped. The calculations reveal a large gap between the outermost and the innermost centres of the Region (referring to their geographical position).","Curatella, Laura; Scorza, Francesco",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974215/,736

The data sample is analyzed with focus on elderly people. Some statements are reported to show how much and how these passenger use public transport and related technological services.

48161,Road Infrastructure Monitoring: An Experimental Geomatic Integrated System,2020-08-19,"Strategic planning has recently focused its attention on the elements that characterize the spaces through which the agents move, paying particular attention on the way in which they incorporate them. Spatial environments are currently studied from different perspectives, from the cognitivist point of view they represent knowledge-intensive, significant spatial entities to which human agents need to relate adaptively. The way in which humans use the surrounding space is influenced by a series of implicit factors, such as perceptions, emotions, sensations. These elements, being often tacit, are difficult to identify although they strongly characterize these spaces. For this reason, these characteristics become basic for effective strategic planning at urban and regional level and for environmental decision-making processes. This study presents a method for quantitatively measuring the reactions of visitors to scenes they encounter in spaces with an extremely small population. We conducted an experiment that required participants to take photographs of elements that caught their attention in poorly structured rural areas. In this way, the photographed features and the related comments have made it possible to better grasp perceptions, sensations, emotions that can represent crucial spatial variables for structuring and interpreting spaces.","Mastrodonato, Giulia; Camarda, Domenico",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974219/,736
48162,Using Market Basket Analysis to Find Semantic Duplicates in Ontology,2020-08-19,"The theme of accessibility has assumed considerable importance for the fruition of cultural heritage, evolving into the more extensive and sensitive concept of “extended accessibility”. In this way it is possible to overcome the concept of “architectural barrier” intended in the reductive sense of physical obstacle, giving the same importance to all those barriers that are still neglected or even ignored today, such as psycho - cognitive, sensory and communicative ones. Therefore, designing the extended accessibility means putting the human being with all his/her needs and requirements at the centre of attention. From this point of view, five main declinations can be identified, physical, cognitive, alternative accessibility, sensoriality and visibility catalysts, each of which has a fundamental role for the usability and enhancement of cultural sites. For each declination, a case study was analysed in which the topic was addressed by proposing different solutions able to give a concrete answer to these various problems. Finally, a case study has been examined, the Nuragic Sanctuary of Santa Vittoria di Serri, highlighting the main problems in terms of accessibility and studying a series of solutions that could improve the usability of the archaeological area. What has been analysed clearly highlights how there is no contrast between accessibility and usability and protection of cultural heritage, but how these aspects can coexist and indeed contribute to the improvement of the cultural opportunities.","Pinna, Francesco; Cogoni, Mattia; Pinna, Andrea; Cocco, Giovanni Battista; Giannattasio, Caterina",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974220/,736

To this end, the authors want to demonstrate how some key points of these theories are still relevant all the more if applied to geographically closed contexts, such as an island. Starting from these premises, this paper begins with a literature revision on the most important theories on central places with particular reference to the theories closest to contemporary world. Therefore, the authors study the attraction and aggregation potential of the Sardinian case study, defined by the most suitable localization theories for studying island contexts. This allowed not only to study the analysis of flows through a territorial-hierarchical model, under the theoretical assumptions of the Central Places Theories (CPTs), but also to develop a model and a reticular system on several levels, starting from the population data.

This tendency elicits the issue of the ways in which the built environment affects human behaviour. In particular, walking emerges as a central topic. Walking, in fact, is conceptualized as a vector for engaging with the world, and as a conduit to physical activity, social contact and optional practices. Consequently, a vast body of literature exists, related to the concept of walkability. The latter can be defined as the built environment potential to affect people’s propensity to walk to different destinations and for different purposes. This study, through a comprehensive literature review investigates four concepts: capability; affordance; configuration and Urban ethics. These concepts embody four central dimensions of the research on walkability: arguments for investigating walkability; conceptualization of person-environment transactions; methodologies and ethical implications. The aim of this study, thus, is to individuate the theoretical framework for a precise understanding of the impact of the built environment on human behaviour and to underline perspectives for the further development of the research on walkability.","Annunziata, Alfonso; Garau, Chiara",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974225/,736

Its dehydration reaction, which could take place during the Archean Era, leads to the production of HCN, the fundamental brick of DNA/RNA nitrogenous bases. Mineral surfaces could have played a crucial role in activating biological processes which in gas phase would have too high activation barriers to occur, thus allowing the event cascade, which finally led to the formation of biological macromolecules. In the present work we studied the dehydration process of formamide (NH(2)CHO → HCN + H(2)O) as catalyzed by a surface of acid montmorillonite. In this surface, a silicon atom has been substituted by an aluminium one, thus generating a negative charge that is compensated by an acidic proton on the top of the surface. This proton should, in principle, help the formamide dehydration. However, our results indicate that this particular acidic surface does not exert an efficient catalytic behavior in the decomposition of formamide.

Indeed, among the variants of hyperspherical coordinates, the so called “symmetric” ones are “democratic” with respect to the asymptotic channels and so are the corresponding basis sets, since basis functions can be symmetrized with respect to particle exchange, acting on just a reduced subset of coordinates. Applications to scattering problems are limited to few-atom systems, due to computational cost. An extension of the representation to many-body classical dynamics is possible and has been proposed in a series of papers, where different aspects have been investigated. Here we recall the possibility of defining shape coordinates invariant with respect to the remaining degrees of freedom, which are suitable for systematic classification of structures of clusters and large biomolecules.

The gas uptake capacity, permeability as well as selectivity of the layers were simulated based on an improved formulation of force fields tested on accurate ab initio calculations on specific systems for mixture separation in post-combustion process. The effect of pressure and temperature on the separation performances of graphtriyne layers was investigated. Compared with the single layer graphtriyne, bilayer graphtriyne can adsorb more molecules with relatively good selectivity, due to the action of the interlayer region as an adsorption site. The interlayer adsorption selectivity of CO(2)/N(2) and CO(2)/H(2)O at a temperature of 333 K and a pressure of 4 atm have been found to be equal to about 20.23 and 1.85, respectively. We also observed that the bilayer graphtriyne membrane has high CO(2) and H(2)O permeances compared to N(2), with permeance selectivity ranging from 4.8 to 6.5. Moreover, we found that permeation and adsorption depend on the applied temperature; at high temperatures, permeation and adsorption tend to decrease for all molecules.","Faginas-Lago, Noelia; Apriliyanto, Yusuf Bramastya; Lombardi, Andrea",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974232/,736

The integrated approach consists in the use of both contact and remote sensors to acquire ambient vibration data. The measurements of vibration were carried out with a high-sensitive tri-axial seismometer (Tromino) and a coherent radar system (Image By Interferometry System, IBIS-S). Five asynchronous velocimetric stations were arranged over a profile on the external side of the structure to acquire ambient vibration time-series on radial, tangential and vertical directions. In order to detect the displacements of the internal surface of the dome, the radar interferometer was positioned inside the church using three station points of measure along the main axis of the structure, with different geometric configurations for each station. With this technique, synchronous signals coming from the structure were simultaneously acquired and analyzed. Both seismic time-series and microwave signals were processed to derive the experimental vibration properties of the structure, mainly concerning the dynamic behavior of the circular dome. In addition, to evaluate the capabilities of the radar system in the indoor configuration, a Finite Element model of the structure was built, and the experimental results were compared to the numerical outputs.","Piroddi, Luca; Calcina, Sergio Vincenzo",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974262/,736

The study investigates the use of a Multicriteria Decision Analysis technique (MCDA), namely the Analytic Network Process (ANP), with the aim to support the definition of the best sustainable scenario. The ANP model evaluates a protocol of objectives and strategies in order to explore their complex relations and to guide the evaluation of alternative planning scenarios. The paper shows how the ANP model may be considered a suitable support to aid the decision-making process in better understanding the full range of impacts generated by mining activities on the territory, thus supporting the creation of integrated and sustainable planning policies at regional scale.","Assumma, Vanessa; Bottero, Marta; Mondini, Giulio; Zanetta, Elisa",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974336/,736
48207,Yet Another E-Voting Scheme Implemented Using Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain,2020-08-20,"Ecosystem services are defined as benefits obtained by humans from ecosystem functions and processes. Although the different types of ecosystem services are well defined, their measurement and quantification has remained controversial despite long last research efforts. A particularly elusive and often neglected aspect of ecosystem services quantification has been a proper identification of the beneficiaries. We argue that a clear-cut distinction between locally-provided and globally-relevant ecosystem services are necessary in order to manage a meaningful debate about ecosystem services quantification. Using a detailed spatial analysis of land-use change and residential location in The Netherlands over almost two decades, we operationalize the distinction between two types of services provided by “green” land uses (protected natural areas, agricultural areas and parks). Recreational services available to nearby dwellers are used as an example of locally-provided ecosystem services, while carbon sequestration exemplifies the globally-relevant category. The conclusion is that while monetary value can be justified as a proxy measure of globally-relevant ecosystem services, non-monetary approaches are appropriate for locally-provided ecosystem services. The distinction between both types of ecosystem services is useful also for policy-making purposes: Quantification of locally-provided services is well suited for spatial planning in general and urban planning in particular, but globally-relevant services assessment (specially its monetary approach) is more informative at national and supranational levels.","Broitman, Dani",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974338/,736

A Computational Study,2020-08-20,"Hypertension-related conditions are the most prevalent complications of pregnancy worldwide. They manifest in up to 8% of cases and if left untreated, can lead to serious detrimental effects. Early detection of their sudden onset can help physicians alleviate the condition and improve outcomes for both would-be mother and baby. Today’s prevalence of smartphones and cost-effective wearable technology provide new opportunities for individualized medicine. Existing devices promote heart health, they monitor and encourage physical activity and measure sleep quality. This builds interest and encourages users to require more advanced features. We believe these aspects form suitable conditions to create and market specialized wearable devices. The present paper details a cyber-physical system built around an intelligent bracelet for monitoring hypertension-related conditions tailored to pregnant women. The bracelet uses a microfluidic layer that is compressed by the blood pressing against the arterial wall. Integrated sensors register the waveform and send it to the user’s smartphone, where the systolic and diastolic values are determined. The system is currently developed under European Union research funding, and includes a software server where data is stored and further processing is carried out through machine learning.","Marin, Iuliana; Bocicor, Maria Iuliana; Molnar, Arthur-Jozsef",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974339/,736

However several factors contribute to soil degradation, including climatic characteristics, lithological and morphological features and transformation processes. Only the last ones can be governed and that is the reason why spatial planning needs tools and analyses to interpret the role of land use changes in complex dynamics such as the erosive phenomena. This work presents the results obtained from the implementation of the InVEST SDR module on the territory of Basilicata Region and considering the evolution occurred between 1990 and 2018. Our outcomes show an intensification of erosion phenomena mainly along the Apennine chain and the coastal area of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Although this area corresponds to the higher average rainfall erosivity over the entire period, the most significant soil loss occurs in correspondence with unfavorable land use changes. The negative connotation typically associated with deforestation, conversion of agricultural soils to arable lands and thinning or total loss of vegetation becomes a measurable quantity, at least from one of several points of view.","Pilogallo, Angela; Saganeiti, Lucia; Scorza, Francesco; Murgante, Beniamino",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974341/,736
48211,Impact of OVL Variation on AUC Bias Estimated by Non-parametric Methods,2020-08-20,"In cold and dense regions of the interstellar medium, such as molecular clouds, more than 200 gas-phase molecular species have been observed by means of infra-red and rotational spectroscopy techniques alongside solid sub-micrometer sized particles called dust grains. These grains are of uttermost importance because their surfaces serve as meeting points for chemical species that adsorb from the gas phase, diffuse and possibly react to form more complex molecules. These grains consist of a silicate or carbonaceous cores covered in layers of water dominated ices that contain other small volatile molecules such as CO, CO(2), NH(3), CH(3)OH. Most of the ice components originate from the adsorption and reaction of bare atoms, e.g., H, C, N and O, on the grain surfaces. An important challenge in Astrochemistry is to characterize the thermodynamics and kinetics of the main reaction steps of the bare atoms forming the ice components on the grain surfaces. As a first step previous to the reaction of these atomic species, in this paper we present results based on quantum chemistry methods on the adsorption of atomic carbon, nitrogen and oxygen on a crystalline water ice surface model mimicking the icy grain surfaces.","Ferrero, Stefano; Martínez-Bachs, Berta; Enrique-Romero, Joan; Rimola, Albert",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974342/,736

To address this topic, the project Designetz develops approaches to test how decentralized renewable energy sources and the need for electrical energy can affect the respective network infrastructure levels and how an intelligent information communication technology (ICT) infrastructure can look like, to meet the demands of the energy network of the future, also in the context of smart cities. First results indicate that a transformation towards an increasingly decentralized energy supply is necessary and, particularly in view of the volatility, demands corresponding requirements of the ICT infrastructure. It will be shown how the classic producer-consumer constellation is changed and a multitude of prosumers, i.e. actors, who are both producers and consumers of electricity, arise, and how they can be integrated into the grid structure. Core functionalities will be demonstrated with an integrated data and service platform which also allows the possible integration of supplementary services.

Specifically, a static analysis model proposed in a previous paper, whose objective is to establish the optimal amount to invest in sponsorship to maximize business profit, is integrated with an innovative model that allows the company to assess the degree of financial efficiency of the investment, i.e. its productivity [Formula: see text]. The latter depends on a series of variables that characterize both the monument to be enhanced, the location in which it is located, and the sponsorship strategy adopted by the company. However, in the case of sponsorship of recovery/restoration work, the critical variable that most affects the efficiency of the investment is the number of visitors to the location where the monument is located (direct audience). This is because as the number of visitors increases, the level of exposure to the sponsorship message increases. Therefore, we assume two functional relationships, one linear and the other logarithmic, which correlate financial efficiency to the average number of visitors. In this way, the advantage of the company is twofold. On the one hand, it has the opportunity to maximize profits by investing the optimal amount of sponsorship. On the other hand, it can choose the level of productivity of the investment by deciding to finance the monument of a specific location according to its degree of exposure.","Dolores, Luigi; Macchiaroli, Maria; De Mare, Gianluigi; Nesticò, Antonio; Maselli, Gabriella; Gómez, Elena Merino",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974347/,736

The study of these iCOMs formation and their binding energy to the ASW, using computational chemistry, depends strongly on the ASW models used, as different models may exhibit sites with different adsorbing features. ASW extended models are rare in the literature because large sizes require very large computational resources when quantum mechanical methods based on DFT are used. To circumvent this problem, we propose to use the newly developed GFN-xTB Semi-empirical Quantum Mechanical (SQM) methods from the Grimme’s group. These methods are, at least, two orders of magnitude faster than conventional DFT, only require modest central memory, and in this paper we aim to benchmark their accuracy against rigorous and resource hungry quantum mechanical methods. We focused on 38 water structures studied by MP2 and CCSD(T) approaches comparing energetic and structures with three levels of GFN-xTB parametrization (GFN0, GFN1, GFN2) methods. The extremely good results obtained at the very cheap GFN-xTB level for both water cluster structures and energetic paved the way towards the modeling of very large AWS models of astrochemical interest.","Germain, Aurèle; Ugliengo, Piero",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974350/,736

Field recorded sensor data together with co-located reference data allow to build suitable datasets that are more representative of the complexity of real world conditions. In this work a co-location experiment is presented, in which four multisensor devices are co-located with a mobile ARPAC (Campania Regional Agency for Environmental Protection) reference analyzer station. Two types of calibration models, linear and nonlinear have been tested on the recorded datasets, in order to determine the best calibration strategy to use to optimize the calibration procedure time in the real world operative phase.

Constructing the abnormal subspace of PCA (i.e., the subspace spanned by the least significant principal components (PCs)), with sparse and orthogonal loading vectors provides a means of anomaly interpretation. However, solving all abnormal sparse PCs one by one through semi-definite programming is time consuming. In this paper, we derive an adapted projection deflation method for extracting least significant PCs and propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) solution for constructing the sparse abnormal subspace. Our experiments on two real world datasets showed that the proposed ADMM solution achieved comparable detection accuracy and sparsity as the SDP solution and is 10 times more efficient, which makes it more suitable for application domains with higher dimensions.","Jiang, Wenmin; Zhao, Ying; Adnan, Kazi Abir",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974355/,736

As part of the MESARIP project (in agreement with the Regional Civil Protection) in order to implement the analyses of soil erosion pre and post fire event, using Sentinel 2 data and with the RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) method in a GIS open source environment, a graphical model has been developed. The application of the RUSLE requires a series of consequential spatial analysis elaborations and, according to this scheme, the model has been developed with the Graphical Modeler. QGIS contains in a single environment a multiplicity of tools and algorithms native to other open source GIS software, such as, for example, SAGA GIS and GRASS GIS. The user interface is very simple and requires basic and thematic input data such as DEM, MASK areas or vegetation indices etc. The advantages in the construction of the model can be identified in the standardization of map algebra operations and also in the speed of execution of the steps.

The challenging aspect here involves deciding when an object can be placed on top of another object. Here only defining standard planning operators would not suffice. For instance, using these operators we can come up with actions that may be performed at a state but it should not be performed. So we introduce the notion of safe actions whose outcomes are consistent with the laws of physics, commonsense, and common practice. A safe action can be performed if a robot performing the action knows the knowledge of the situation. We developed a knowledge engine using a supervised learning technique. However, unlike the common task of learning functions, our approach is to learn predicates–that evaluate to binary values. By learning such a predicate a robot would be able to decide whether or not an object A can be placed on top of another object B. We give a method to handle new objects for which the predicates have not been learned. We suggest a nondeterministic planning algorithm to synthesize plans that contain only safe actions. Experimental results show the efficacy of our approach.","Niyogi, Rajdeep; Sharma, Saurabh; Vavrecka, Michal; Milani, Alfredo",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974359/,736

We use Docker Volumes to circumvent the volatility of containers, allowing files stored in the cache to be available when a new container is instantiated. Our experimental results from the execution of two real-world bioinformatics workflows (Blast and Hecil) show that using our cache system effectively decreases execution times.

Three of the proposed methodologies use a potential evapotranspiration approach (Penman, Priestley-Taylor and Blaney-Criddle models) while the additional three an actual evapotranspiration approach (the Advection-Aridity, the Granger and Gray and the Antecedent Precipation Index method). The results show that models efficiency varies from site to site, even though land cover and climate features appear to have some influence. It is difficult to comment on a general accuracy, but an overall moderate better performance of the Advection-Aridity model can be reported within a context where model calibration is not accounted for. If model calibration is further taken into consideration, the Granger and Gray model appears the best performing method but, at the same time, it is also the approach which is mostly affected by the calibration process, and therefore less suited to evapotranspiration prediction tools dealing with a data scarcity context.","Mobilia, Mirka; Longobardi, Antonia",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974395/,736

We quantified how 109 LNPs containing “constrained phospholipids” delivered mRNA to 16 cell types in mice, then using a DNA barcoding‐based analytical pipeline, related phospholipid structure to in vivo delivery. By analyzing delivery mediated by constrained phospholipids, we identified a novel LNP that delivers mRNA to immune cells at 0.5 mg/kg. Unlike many previous LNPs, these (a) did not preferentially target hepatocytes and (b) delivered mRNA to immune cells without targeting ligands. These data suggest constrained phospholipids may be useful LNP components.","Gan, Zubao; Lokugamage, Melissa P.; Hatit, Marine Z.

48265,Evolving Principles of Big Data Virtualization,2020-08-24,"Winter cereals yield tracking is a common practice since decision support systems can greatly benefit from the integration of these data. However, scientific literature highlights that many systematic errors occur during yield data collection. An efficient and easy to automatize protocol to clean collected field data is still missing despite its development is essential to integrate this useful tool in a smart-farming platform. This paper focuses on the development of a yield data cleaning procedure, easy to industrialize and performant in different contexts. This method is based on both empirical cleaning steps and statistical analysis on the “moving windows”. The developed cleaning procedure enabled the mixing of data coming from different combine harvesters and considered yield data measurements from the farmers to strengthen the results. In order to create readable and complete maps, an interpolation method concludes the procedure. The developed method is applied on a case study on real farm data.","Natale, Antonio; Antognelli, Sara; Ranieri, Emanuele; Cruciani, Andrea; Boggia, Antonio",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974404/,736

The focus is on smart specialisation strategies and partnerships between agri-food business and research organisations, established under the open innovation paradigm. An exploratory study is carried out on recent (2010–19) agri-food R&I activity in Puglia (Italy), covering both projects and patents carried out by 47 research centres (affiliated to any of 11 research institutions) and 40 agri-food enterprises. Beside project data analysis based on categorisation, the methodology applied social network analysis to partnerships. Findings point to Sustainable Manufacturing and Human and Environmental Health being the prevalent target areas of innovation activity, thus resulting in some form of sustainable agricultural intensification, with a bias towards Industrial Biotechnology, Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology. Open innovation approaches seem to be still phasing in, and the innovation potential of agri-food enterprises appears to be largely untapped. Future research may address the friction between industry-driven smart specialisation strategies and place-based innovation patterns that harness the intangible potential of social and relational capital.","Persia, Manuela; Balena, Pasquale; Bonifazi, Alessandro; Marzulli, Maria Immacolata; Orlando, Antonio; Torre, Carmelo M.",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974408/,736

To execute collaborative tasks successfully, robots may need to be present at the location of the task. However, the required robots may not be present at the location of the task. A distributed algorithm has been proposed recently for such task execution. A model checker can analyze the behavior of the algorithm. In this paper, we formally model the algorithm using the PRISM model checker.

Several techniques of such an inspiration have recently shown promising results in automatically designing neural network architectures. However, apart from back-propagation, only a few applications of other learning techniques are used for these purposes. The back-propagation process takes advantage of specific optimization techniques that are best suited to specific application domains (e.g., Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing). Hence, the need for a more general learning approach, namely, a basic algorithm able to make inference in different contexts with distinct properties. In this paper, we deal with the problem from a scientific and epistemological point of view. We believe that this is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and dynamics underlying human learning. To this aim, we define some elementary inference operations and show how modern architectures can be built by a combination of those elementary methods. We analyze each method in different settings and find the best-suited application context for each learning algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss experimental findings and compare them with human learning. The discrepancy is particularly evident between supervised and unsupervised learning. Then, we determine which elementary learning rules are best suited for unsupervised systems, and, finally, we propose some improvements in reinforcement learning architectures.","Vaccaro, Lorenzo; Sansonetti, Giuseppe; Micarelli, Alessandro",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974644/,736

In this way, it is possible to mitigate and contain the catastrophic effects of floods, which become more frequent in the last decades. These events result in losses of both human lives and assets. In addition, the growing availability of high-resolution topographic data (i.e. Digital Terrain Models - DTM), due to new technologies for measuring surface elevation, gave a strong impulse to the development of new techniques capable of providing rapid and reliable identification of flood susceptibility. In this study, two methodologies for mapping flood-prone areas in karst ephemeral streams in Puglia region (Southern Italy) are compared, highlighting how DTM-based technologies are a precious source of information in data-poor environments.

Researchers thus suggest that the street segment might be better suited than areal units for carrying out such a task. Furthermore, the street segment has recently become one of the most prominent spatial units, for example, to study street network centrality, retail density, and urban form. In this paper, we thus propose to use the street segment as unit of analysis for calculating the residential valorisation of urban space. To be more specific, we define a protocol that characterises street segments through a measure of central tendency and one of dispersion of prices. Moreover, through Bayesian clustering, it classifies street segments according to the most probable combination house type-valuation to provide a picture of local submarkets. We apply this methodology to the housing transactions exchanged in the French Riviera, in the period 2008–2017, and observe that outputs seem to align with local specificities of the housing market of that region.

Although existing vulnerability prediction models have demonstrated sufficient accuracy in predicting the occurrence of vulnerabilities in the software projects with which they have been trained, they have failed to demonstrate sufficient accuracy in cross-project prediction. To this end, in the present paper we investigate whether the adoption of deep learning along with software metrics may lead to more accurate cross-project vulnerability prediction. For this purpose, several machine learning (including deep learning) models are constructed, evaluated, and compared based on a dataset of popular real-world PHP software applications. Feature selection is also applied with the purpose to examine whether it has an impact on cross-project prediction. The results of our analysis indicate that the adoption of software metrics and deep learning may result in vulnerability prediction models with sufficient performance in cross-project vulnerability prediction.

Random backoff timers for avoidance of collisions among RTS control messages provides equally opportunities to transmit data messages to neighbor wireless nodes since the value of the backoff timer monotonically decreases. In usual wireless ad-hoc networks, wireless nodes are not equally distributed and frequency of transmission requests in wireless nodes is also not the same. Thus, especially in a region with high density of transmissions and receipts requests for data messages, it is not always possible to receive a response CTS control message even though a wireless node has an opportunity to transmit an RTS control message. Hence, the equal opportunities to transmit an RTS control message is not enough to realize the equal opportunities to transmit a data message. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel RTS/CTS control to equally provide opportunities to transmit data messages whose receiver node is hard to transmit a CTS control message on response to an RTS control message. Here, a transmission of a CTS control message precedes a transmission of an RTS control message in cases that transmissions of a CTS control message fail repeatedly.","Hara, Momoka; Higaki, Hiroaki",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974657/,736

The points of strength of the framework are the following: It is an iterative and participatory process; It is scenario-based and model-based; It uses a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) as enabling infrastructure; The SDSS is “powered” by open data and data systematically updated by public bodies. The theoretical starting point is ICZM requires decision support tools to cope with knowledge from multiple sources, interdisciplinarity and multiple scales (e.g., spatial, temporal or organizational) [1]. The 2007 Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union [2] is a key document to understand the relationship between coastal and marine information and policy implementation. It shows that it is necessary to develop a marine-coastal Decision Support System [3, 4] based on indicators and indices (aggregations of indicators into a synthetic representation), use of Geographic Information Systems, models and multicriteria assessment of scenarios [5, 6]. The system of indices is used to describe the complexity of a coastal system: geo-ecological level, land processes, human society, economy, and coastal uses at multiple scales [5, 7]. Multicriteria assessment is a tool to support social and environmental decisions in the perspective of sustainability and strategic planning [8–11].

In this work a prototype of service based on remotely sensed data is presented aimed at supporting evaluation of hail impacts on crops by mapping and qualifying areas damaged by hail. Further, a comparison was done testing effectiveness of approaches based on short term (i.e. with reference to images acquired immediately after the event) and long term (i.e. with reference to images acquired close to crop harvest) analysis. Investigation was solicited by the Reale Mutua insurance company and focused on a strong hailstorm occurred on 6(th) July 2019 in the Vercelli province (Piemonte - NW Italy). The analysis was based on Copernicus Sentinel-2 level 2A imagery. A times series made of 29 NDVI maps was generated for the growing season 2019 (from March to October) and analyzed at pixel level looking for NDVI trend anomalies possibly related to crop damages. Phenological behavior of damaged crops (NDVI local temporal profile) was compared with those of unharmed fields to verify and assess the impact of the phenomenon. Results showed evident anomalies along the local NDVI temporal profile of damaged cropped pixels, permitting a fine mapping of the affected areas. Surprisingly, short and long term approaches led to different conclusions: some areas, appearing significantly damaged immediately after the event, showed a vegetative recover with the proceeding of the growing season (temporary damages). Differently, some others showed that damages detected after the events never turned into a better situation (permanent damages). This new information could drive to considered a revision of the ordinary insurance procedures that are currently used by companies to certify and quantify damages of crops after adverse events. It can therefore said that, the high temporal resolution of the Copernicus Sentinel 2 mission can significantly contribute to improve evaluating procedures in the insurance sector by introducing temporal variables.","Sarvia, F.; De Petris, S.; Borgogno-Mondino, E.",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974673/,736

The union of these aspects is particularly evident in the territory and in the urban centers of Salento, Murgia and the surroundings in the coastal territory. The conservation and sustainability of these places, however, often confronts the most invasive terms of hydrogeological instability (earthquakes, floods, landslides, etc.). It is true that sometimes in the Apulian urban centers geological phenomena of instability are observed much less evident than those mentioned but more subtle and equally invasive and harmful: for example subsidence, sink holes, karst. In order to avoid the aforementioned effects, when planning and growing an urban environment, it is necessary for decision-makers, engineers, planners and managers to take into account the physical parameters of the urban area, as well as susceptibility to dangers natural. The geology and geomorphology of an area are crucial to guarantee the sustainable management of the territory and consequently in the protection of human life in urban areas.

The aim is to create predictive models able to minimize or reduce the hydrogeological hazard, especially before or during critical meteorological events. The case study is the Caldone stream, a watercourse located in the municipality of Lecco (Italy). Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning techniques were used to collect metric data about the morphology of the riverbed. Data acquisition was carried out to create a digital model of visible and submerged parts of the riverbed. Then, a second area with a sedimentation pool was selected to monitor the variation of the depth induced by progressive accumulation of sediments.

48317,Software Visualization Tool for Evaluating API Usage in the Context of Software Ecosystems: A Proof of Concept,2020-08-24,"In the current cloud, VM migration that moves VMs between physical host machines is indispensable. For cloud providers, before shutting down the physical host machines for maintenance, migration is used to temporarily save VMs to other physical host machine. For the cloud user, migration is used to move a VM to a location which is geographically close to the end user. These VM migrations can be performed very easily and are only limited by the scope of the VM administrator’s contract. However, the problem lies on the permission of the data in VM. In recent years, with the widespread use of IoT, various types of data can be stored in cloud’s VMs through web services. The huge amount of data collected by IoT devices requires close attention to manage because it could be very closely related to the information of an individual. However, there is no mechanism for checking data permission in VM during VM migration, and there is concern that inappropriate data movement may occur. This includes the unintended risky movement of inappropriate data which could be malicious data. Therefore, we proposed a mechanism to ensure compliance with the conditions granted by the data owner, the country regulations, and the organization regulations during VM migration. By constructing the proposed mechanism in blockchain, we can prevent malicious tampering and thus enable robust VM migration control.","Uchibayashi, Toshihiro; Apduhan, Bernady; Suganuma, Takuo; Hiji, Masahiro",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974692/,736

A multidimensional point cloud is an unstructured array of single, irregular points in a spatial 3D coordinate system plus time stamp. If geospatial reference points are available, a point cloud is geo-referenced. Geo-referenced point clouds contain a high-precision reference dataset. Point clouds can be utilised in a variety of applications. They are particularly suitable for the representation of surfaces, structures, terrain and objects. Point clouds are used here to generate a virtual 3D city model representing the complex, granular cityscape of Jerusalem and its centre, the Old City. The generation of point clouds is based on two data acquisition methods: active data capture by laser scanning and passive data collection by photogrammetric methods. In our case, very high-resolution stereo imagery in visible light and near infrared bands have been systematically acquired an aerial flight campaign. The spatio-temporal data gathered necessitate further processing to extract the geographical reference and semantic features required in a specific resolution and scale. An insight is given into the processing of an unstructured point cloud to extract and classify the 3D urban fabric and reconstruct its objects. Eventually, customised, precise and up-to-date geographical datasets can be made available for a defined region at a defined resolution and scale.","Fricke, Andreas; Asche, Hartmut",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974693/,736
48319,Virtual Testbed: Simulation of Air Flow Around Ship Hull and Its Effect on Ship Motions,2020-08-24,"In ad-hoc networks, data messages are transmitted from a source wireless node to a destination one along a wireless multihop transmission route consisting of a sequence of intermediate wireless nodes. Each intermediate wireless node forwards data messages to its next-hop wireless node. Here, a wireless signal carrying the data message is broadcasted by using an omni directional antenna and it is not difficult for an eavesdropper wireless node to overhear the wireless signal to get the data message. Some researches show that it is useful to transmit a noise wireless signal which collides to the data message wireless signal in order for interfering the overhearing. However, some special devices such as directional antennas and/or high computation power for complicated signal processing are required. For wireless multihop networks with huge number of wireless nodes, small and cheap wireless nodes without such special devices are mandatory for construction of the network. This paper proposes a novel method for interfering the overhearing by the eavesdropper wireless nodes by a routing protocol and a data message transmission protocol with cooperative noise signal transmissions by 1-hop and 2-hop neighbor wireless nodes of each intermediate wireless node. The results of simulation experiments show that the proposed intentional collision method provides enough coverage of noise wireless signals especially by help of part of 2-hop neighbor wireless nodes.","Amano, Hinano; Higaki, Hiroaki",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974694/,736

Different approaches have been designed in order to detect anomalies: statistics-based, isolation-based, clustering-based. In this paper, we present a quick survey of the existing anomaly detection methods for data streams. We focus on Isolation Forest (iForest), a state-of-the-art method for anomaly detection. We provide the implementation of IForestASD, a variant of iForest for data streams. This implementation is built on top of scikit-multiflow, an open source machine learning framework for data streams. In fact, few anomalies detection methods are provided in the well-known data streams mining frameworks such as MOA or StreamDM. Hence, we extend scikit-multiflow providing an additional tool. We performed experiments on 3 real-world data sets to evaluate predictive performance and resource consumption (memory and time) of IForestASD and compare it with a well known and state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithm for data streams called Half-Space Trees.","Togbe, Maurras Ulbricht; Barry, Mariam; Boly, Aliou; Chabchoub, Yousra; Chiky, Raja; Montiel, Jacob; Tran, Vinh-Thuy",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974696/,736
48322,Development of a Plastics and Paper Waste Management System for a University Community,2020-08-24,"Road infrastructures systems are critical in many regions of Italy, counting thousands of bridges and viaducts that were built over several decades. A monitoring system is therefore necessary to monitor the health of these bridges and to indicate whether they need maintenance. Different parameters affect the health of an infrastructure, but it would be very difficult to install a network of sensors of various kinds on each viaduct. For this purpose, we want to finalize the use of geomatics technologies to monitor infrastructures for early warning issues and introducing automations in the data acquisition and processing phases. This study describes an experimental sensor network system, based on long term monitoring in real-time while an adaptive neuro-fuzzy system is used to predict the deformations of GPS-bridge monitoring points. The proposed system integrates different data (used to describe the various behaviour scenarios on the structural model), and then it reworks them through machine learning techniques, in order to train the network so that, once only the monitored parameters (displacements) have been entered as input data, it can return an alert parameter. So, the purpose is to develop a real-time risk predictive system that can replicate various scenarios and capable to alert, in case of imminent hazards. The experimentation conducted in relation to the possibility of transmitting an alert parameter in real time (transmitted through the help of an experimental control unit) obtained by predicting the behavior of the structure using only displacement data during monitoring is particularly interesting.","Barrile, Vincenzo; Fotia, Antonino; Bernardo, Ernesto; Bilotta, Giuliana; Modafferi, Antonino",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974697/,736

The possibility of sensing and classifying vehicles and march conditions by means of simple physical sensors may support both real time applications and studies on traffic dynamics, e.g. support and assistance for car crashes and prevention of accidents, and maintenance planning or support to trials in case of litigation. Optical fibers technology is well known for its wide adoption in data transmissions as a commodity component of computer networks: its popularity led to large availability on the market of high quality fiber at affordable price. As a purely physical application, its optical properties may be exploited to monitor in real time mechanical solicitations the fiber undergoes. In this paper we present a novel approach to using optical fibers as road sensors. As quite popular in literature, fiber is used to sense the vibrations caused by vehicles on the road: in our case, signals are processed by functional classification techniques to obtain a higher quality and a larger flexibility for the reuse of results. Classification aims at enabling profiling of road traffic. Moreover in our approach we would like to optimise the analysis and classification computations by splitting the process among edge nodes and cloud nodes according to the available computation capacity.

Due to all the inherent changes that occur during this period, quality care is crucial during this period to enhance the wellbeing of the mothers and the newborns. In Morocco, the neglection of postnatal care services are often associated to poor communication, financial difficulties and cultural barriers. Mobile technology constitutes therefore a promising approach to bridge this gap and promote postnatal care. In order to improve the effectiveness of mobile technology, gamification has become a powerful feature to boost motivation and induce fun and interactivity into the mobile solutions’ tasks. Based on a previous review on mobile applications for postnatal care available in app repositories, a set of requirements have been identified to build a comprehensive mobile solution that cater the needs of both the mothers and the newborns. These requirements have, then, been enriched with real needs elicited at maternity Les orangers that belongs to the University Hospital Avicenne of Rabat. Along with the functional and non-functional requirements, gamification aspects have been also analyzed. After the analysis and design phases, a pilot version of the solution called ‘Mamma&Baby’ has been implemented using android framework. ‘Mamma&Baby’ is a mobile solution dedicated to assist new mothers during their postnatal period. As future work, it is expected to fully integrate the gamification elements into the solution and conduct an empirical evaluation of the overall quality and the potential of the solution with real puerperal women.","Sardi, Lamyae; Idri, Ali; Rachad, Taoufik; Redman, Leanne; Alami, Hassan",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974702/,736

In order to assure uniform levels of safety and reduce the social and economic impact of medium to high earthquakes costly seismic intervention plans have been proposed. But their application, in order to define which building should primarily be retrofitted, requires adequate vulnerability assessment methodologies, able to model the effective non-linear response and to identify the relevant failure modes of the structure. In the case of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings, due to the lack of application of capacity design principles and the aging effects due to exposition to an aggressive environment, existing structures can exhibit premature failures with a reduction of available strength and ductility. In the last couple of decades some state-of-the-art simplified models aiming at capturing the complex interaction between shear and flexural damage mechanisms as well as behavior of rebar corrosion have been proposed in specialized literature and, in some cases, implemented in regulatory building codes and guidelines.

In Italy, public buildings often boast ‘special’ architectural features (interfloor distance, layout, finishings, type of wiring/heating systems, etc.) that render them ‘extra-ordinary’ assets; in some cases, these features also confer grand and/or historical importance to such buildings. Thus when carrying out valuation work in Italy, it is necessary to adopt suitable valuation methods designed for buildings boasting special features prior to drafting any administration plans, enhancement projects or even plans for the sale of public building stock. Given the lack of comparable examples or income-based parameters specifically concerning buildings with special features, the Cost Approach is the only method that can be used to estimate the market value of such properties. This paper aims to identify the ways the Cost Approach can be applied when estimating the market value of properties with special features that fall into the ‘extra-ordinary’ category. The theoretical part will be supported by a practical section where the Cost Approach will be used to estimate the market value of an extra-ordinary landmark building in the EUR district: the “Palazzo della Scienza Universale”, previously owned by the EUR S.p.A. company (formerly known as the Ente EUR), which was recently sold (2015).","Battisti, Fabrizio; Campo, Orazio",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974837/,736

Saudi Arabia will be taken as an in-depth case study, because of its size and fiscal situation. The chapter will argue that the rentier economic model explains why the block as a whole began deploying renewable energy relatively late, considering its resources. An argument will be made that rents do not explain the variation we now observe in ambition, strategy, and execution of renewable energy projects.

48379,A Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm for Bandwidth Reduction,2020-08-24,"Territorial attractiveness to production activities is a determining factor for the revitalization of degraded, abandoned, and impoverished territories and urban areas from an economic, social and environmental point of view. A competitive territory is capable of producing wealth and economic prosperity for its citizens and, at the same time, enhancing the environment, guaranteeing the protection of natural resources and cultural heritage and encourage the joint intervention of different subjects and institutional levels. New experiences in industrial plants planning concretely demonstrate how it is possible to create production plants capable of integrating sustainable principles in planning, design and management phases. It is well recognized the possibility to pursue (according to principles and sustainability objectives) the competitiveness of the production system through localization choices capable of guaranteeing economic development, environmental protection and the involvement of different public and private subjects. Authors, in accordance to the new Lombardy Region Law (LR 18/2019) on urban regeneration, develop a Planning Support System (PSS) that leads to the study and definition of key elements for the planning of complex production-industrial system. In particular, the logical framework summarizes every steps of the planning process of productive activities on a territory.

This study explores the opportunity to apply a circular economy model to culture-led regeneration processes oriented to cultural heritage valorisation. The methodological process identified tries to structure an integrated approach, able to combine the tools of building renovation and that of multidimensional evaluation to define a circular enhancement strategy for cultural heritage. Starting from the local cultural values and the changing uses of urban spaces related to the case study of the municipality of Ercolano (Italy), the structured decision-making process analyse how to optimise tangible/intangible cultural resources for local and sustainable development; to generate values and activate the engagement of communities through new sustainable uses; to build widespread and capillary complex networks among people, values, and spaces. In this interdisciplinary approach, the role of cultural and creative industries (CCI) is ever more significant, with the ability to create communication between management models, sustainability assessments, deliberative approaches and conservation strategies, regeneration and enhancement of cultural heritage.","Cerreta, Maria; Savino, Valentina",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974906/,736

The DD method is a two-scale nonlinear model for convection-dominated transport problems, obtained by incorporating to the multiscale formulation a nonlinear dissipative operator acting isotropically in both scales of the discretization. The standard finite element spaces are enriched with bubble functions in order to add stability properties to the numerical model. The DD method for two dimensional problems results in good solutions compared to other known methods. We analyze the impact of this methodology on three dimensional domains comparing its numerical results with those obtained using the Consistent Approximate Upwind (CAU) method.","Azevedo, Ramoni Z.

48383,GPU Memory Access Optimization for 2D Electrical Wave Propagation Through Cardiac Tissue and Karma Model Using Time and Space Blocking,2020-08-24,"Cartography has traditionally been the privileged key to reading an urban territory. The form “map”, in fact, translates in two-dimensionally and with an abstract language the complexity of the space that we perceived and interact with through our physicality. In this process of conceptualisation many of our visceral abilities must be distilled into a form of representation that elects vision as a privileged channel. The possibility of using mobile devices has widened the range of expression and the ways in which we orient people in the environment. But, well beyond this instrumental function, the use of the acoustic channel, for example, opens up design scenarios for the construction of an identity of places that involves users from the point of view of experiential richness. Generally used to give procedural indications and free the user in movements, the sound interface has in itself further potential for exploring the communicative design and reading of the anthropic environment. The paper proposes an interpretation of the urban landscape of the city of Milan and its historical transformation through the narrative key of one of the major Italian novels and the construction of soundscapes that gives back the emotional richness of reality. Based on a holophonic recording, the prototype of the mobile app explores the possibility of extending a space-contextual experience through a multimodal storytelling that generates “sound vision”.","Bollini, Letizia; Fazia, Irene Della",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974908/,736

48386,A New Library of Bio-Inspired Algorithms,2020-08-24,"Data processing (or the transformation of data into knowledge and/or information) has become an indispensable tool for decision-making in many areas of engineering. Engineering optimization problems with many objectives are common. However, the decision-making process for these problems is complicated since there are many trade-offs that are difficult to identify. Thus, in this work, multivariate statistical methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA), have been studied and applied to analyze the results of many objective engineering optimization problems. PCA reduces the number of objectives to a very small number, CA through the similarities and dissimilarities, creates groups of solutions, i.e., bringing together in the same group solutions with the same characteristics and behaviors. Two engineering optimization problems with many objectives are solved: a mechanical problem consisting in the optimal design of laminated plates, with four objectives and a problem of optimization of the radar waveform, with nine objectives. For the problem of the design of laminated plates through PCA allowed to reduce to two objectives and through CA it was possible to create three distinct groups of solutions. For the problem of optimization of the radar waveform, it was possible to reduce the objectives from nine to two objectives representing the greatest variability of the data, and CA defined three distinct groups of solutions. These results demonstrate that these tools are effective to assist the decision-making processes in the presence of a large number of solutions and/or objectives.","Santos, Francisco; Costa, Lino",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974911/,736
48389,Efficient Speed-Up of Radial Basis Functions Approximation and Interpolation Formula Evaluation,2020-08-24,"Dense estimation of depth from stereo pinhole image pair is a well known problem and seems to be easily solvable by both classical as well as machine learning algorithms. However, dense depth estimation from stereo fisheye image pair is apparently a more challenging problem. There are two main factors adding to the complexity of the problem: (I) owing to the wider field of view, the fisheye lenses are inherently nonlinear thus making the estimation problem harder. (II) because we want to estimate depth for every pixel coordinate from just two images, i.e. a calibrated stereo pair, the data is statistically insufficient thus greatly complexifying the problem. To alleviate (II) many depth estimation algorithms enlarge their parameter space by incorporating pose parameters and work on image sequence (esp. videos). Here we stick to the stereo camera setting and provide a novel estimation technique and quantify its uncertainty. We use the technique of variational calculus to derive a (noisy) pde for which wellposedness is proved and then solved in the least square sense using proximal algorithms. This setting enables us to invoke the standard machinery of nonlinear least squares for generating the covariance estimates. Most state of the art algorithms that are based on deep learning (nonlinear regression) technique fail to say anything about the uncertainty of the outputs which is of paramount importance in safety critical applications for e.g. arising in automotive domain. Lastly, our methodology has the advantage of being massively parallelizable for hardware implementation thereby offering lesser runtime.","Hiremath, Sandesh Athni",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974914/,736

In this paper, we use the formal language Event-B to model the humoral immunity process on the development tool called Rodin. Humoral immunity process is abstract and has complexity in system design. Accidentally, the formal method is used to verify the correctness and consistency of the complex systems, which is an appropriate approach to model this immunity process by stepwise refinements and validation. We also present an instance to demonstrate the differences between the immunity responses after the invasion of influenza viruses and coronavirus respectively in the last refinement and validate it using proof obligations.

WMLs, which have extensively been associated with gait impairment, justify further investigation of its implication in FD. This study aims to identify a set of gait characteristics to discriminate FD patients with/without WMLs and healthy controls. Seventy-six subjects walked through a predefined circuit using gait sensors that continuously acquired different stride features. Data were normalized using multiple regression normalization taking into account the subject physical properties, with the assessment of 32 kinematic gait variables. A filter method (Mann Whitney U test and Pearson correlation) followed by a wrapper method (recursive feature elimination (RFE) for Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and information gain for Random Forest (RF)) were used for feature selection. Then, five different classifiers (LR, SVM Linear and RBF kernel, RF, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)) based on different selected set features were evaluated. For FD patients with WMLs versus controls the highest accuracy of 72% was obtained using LR based on 3 gait variables: pushing, foot flat, and maximum toe clearance 2. For FD patients without WMLs versus controls, the best performance was observed using LR and SVM RBF kernel based on loading, foot flat, minimum toe clearance, stride length variability, loading variability, and lift-off angle variability with an accuracy of 83%. These findings are the first step to demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques based on gait variables as a complementary tool to understand the role of WMLs in the gait impairment of FD.","Braga, José; Ferreira, Flora; Fernandes, Carlos; Gago, Miguel F.; Azevedo, Olga; Sousa, Nuno; Erlhagen, Wolfram; Bicho, Estela",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974917/,736

Different approaches are tested and compared using real data. Out of sample results are very good, even with very challenging out-of-sample sets composed only of churners, that truly test the ability to predict when a customer will churn. The best results are obtained by stochastic boosting, and the most important variables for predicting churn in a 1–2 months horizon are the total value of bank products held in recent months and the existence of debit or credit cards in another bank.

One of these initiatives is the reduction of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 60% below their 1990 level, by 2050. As the transport sector is responsible for more than 22% of those emissions some strategies need to be taken towards a more sustainable mobility, as the ones proposed in 2011 White Paper on transport. Under this context, this study aims to evaluate the environmental performance of the transport sector in the 28 EU countries towards these goals, from 2015 to 2017. The transport environmental performance is measured through the composite indicator derived from the Benefit of the Doubt (BoD) model. The country transport environmental performance is assessed through the aggregation of multiple sub-indicators using the composite indicator derived from the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model. The results indicate that the EU countries slightly improved their transport environmental performance, on average 2.8%.

Yet both have struggled to adopt low-carbon energy on a large scale. The underlying reasons, however, are quite different. Iran’s pursuit of nuclear power has been driven by domestic security and nationalist interests. Its buildout of hydroelectric dams has been encouraged by local politics and insider business. Non-hydro renewables have suffered from turf wars, lack of institutional support, fossil fuel and electricity subsidies, and barriers to international finance, exacerbated by sanctions. In Iraq, by contrast, the period following the 2003 invasion, when alternative energy has advanced worldwide, has been marked by pervasive corruption, insecurity and mismanagement which have prevented realisation of most large-scale projects outside the upstream oil and gas sector. Despite severe electricity shortages and some targets for renewable energy installation, little progress has been made due to an unattractive investment model and rent-seeking political interests. Nevertheless, the economics of renewables is very good in both countries, neither has any fundamental opposition to them, and progress should occur over the next few years, even though halting and well behind potential.","Mills, Robin",Low Carbon Energy in the Middle East and North Africa,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974931/,736

Among these cryptographic techniques, Data Encryption Standard (DES) has been widely employed, however, it suffers from key and differential attacks. To overcome these attacks, several DES modifications have been proposed in literatures. Most modifications have focused on enhancing DES encryption key; however, the strength of a cryptographic technique is determined by the encryption key used and the number of encryption rounds. It is a known fact that Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptographic technique with 14 encryption rounds is stronger than AES with 12 rounds while AES with 12 rounds is stronger than AES with 10 rounds. Therefore, this study proposed a DES cryptographic technique whose number of rounds is dynamic. Users are expected to specify the number of encryption and decryption rounds to be employed at run time. Moreover, a predefined number of shifting operations which is left circular shift 2 was chosen for each encryption round. As, a trade-off in complexity, the number of Substitution box (S-box) was also reduced to 4, so that the input to the S-boxes would be arranged in four 12-bit blocks for the X-OR operation and not six 8-bit blocks as in the traditional DES. Finally, three keys were used to encrypt, decrypt and encrypt the plaintext ciphertext as in triple DES.

48472,Conditionality Analysis of the Radial Basis Function Matrix,2020-08-19,"In the era of Industry 4.0, commoditized services (such as electricity, healthcare, etc.), require accuracy, availability, security and Quality of service (QoS) in the Cloud space. This paper presents cloud advanced metering infrastructure (CAMI) using Zynq UltraScale+ device field programmable gate array (FPGA). The architectural layout for energy tracking and profile measurement is discussed. Unlike existing systems with digital signal processors, it uses precision-based meter reading with encryption driven demand side management (DSM) to protect end-users. An energy service application with supporting hardware prototype is designed. Cryptographic algorithms, dynamic auto-scaling and predictive QoS provisioning are introduced as features of its backend cloud virtualization Infrastructure controller (CVIC). Process integration is achieved with CVIC synthesis for energy analytics and DSM. For the use case scenario, the CAMI prototype runs on Zynq UltraScale+ device with support for end-to-end dataset captures. The system provides on-demand visualization of energy consumption patterns for the end-users. In the experimental setup, two case scenarios demonstrate how the metering system executes fast edge computing profiling. Optimal performance is achieved for latency, utilization, and throughput under CVIC overhead constraint. It was observed that resource utilization responses for heterogeneous and non heterogeneous CVIC are 71.43% and 28.57% respectively. Latency profiles gave 71.43% and 28.57% respectively. With the VM controller, FPGA CAMI offered 47.36% while without VM controller, 52.63% throughput is observed. Consequently, the results highlights how FPGA hardware acceleration can significantly improve request distribution as well as workload processing for cloud based metering systems.","Okafor, K.

In the network construction phase, a weight vector is needed to define the importance of each element in the feature set, which consists of color and location information of the corresponding pixels, thus demanding a specialist’s intervention. The present paper proposes the elimination of the weight vector through modifications in the network construction phase. The proposed model and the reference model, without the use of a weight vector, were compared using 151 images extracted from the Grabcut dataset, the PASCAL VOC dataset and the Alpha matting dataset. Each model was applied 30 times to each image to obtain an error average. These simulations resulted in an error rate of only 0.49% when classifying pixels with the proposed model while the reference model had an error rate of 3.14%. The proposed method also presented less error variation in the diversity of the evaluated images, when compared to the reference model.","Passerini, Jefferson Antonio Ribeiro; Breve, Fabricio",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7975379/,736

Classification tasks within social network structures remain crucial research problems in SNA. Inherent and latent facts about social graphs can be effectively exploited for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in a bid to categorize actors/nodes as well as identify clusters with respect to a given social network. Thus, important factors such as the individual attributes of spatial social actors and the underlying patterns of relationship binding these social actors must be taken into consideration. These factors are relevant to understanding the nature and dynamics of a given social graph. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid model: Representation Learning via Knowledge-Graph Embeddings and Convolution Operations (RLVECO) which has been modelled for studying and extracting meaningful facts from social network structures to aid in node classification and community detection problems. RLVECO utilizes an edge sampling approach for exploiting features of a social graph, via learning the context of each actor with respect to its neighboring actors, with the aim of generating vector-space embeddings per actor which are further exploited for unexpressed representations via a sequence of convolution operations. Successively, these relatively low-dimensional representations are fed as input features to a downstream classifier for solving community detection and node classification problems about a given social network.","Molokwu, Bonaventure C.; Shuvo, Shaon Bhatta; Kar, Narayan C.; Kobti, Ziad",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7975381/,736

Here, we investigate, from a graph-based clustering perspective, the Quantum QM9 dataset. This dataset is one of the most used datasets in this scenario. Our investigation is two-fold: 1) understand whether the QM9 samples are organized in clusters, and 2) if the clustering structure might provide us with some insights regarding anomalous molecules, or molecules that jeopardize the accuracy of supervised property prediction methods. Our results show that the QM9 is indeed structured into clusters. These clusters, for instance, might suggest better approaches for splitting the dataset when using cross-correlation approaches in supervised learning. However, regarding our second question, our finds indicate that the clustering structure, obtained via Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) representation, cannot be used to filter anomalous samples in property prediction.

However, in the space Internet environment, since the contact times are limited, reliability cannot be guaranteed for the interaction between the server and the client used in the existing SMTP. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel mail transfer protocol, DTN-SMTP for space Internet over DTN. To minimize the interaction of the existing SMTP, it relies on one-way transmission and optionally performs retransmission mechanisms.

Soon after Asia, Europe was seriously affected. Many countries, including Romania, adopted lockdown measures to limit the outbreak. AIM: We performed a molecular epidemiology analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral strains circulating in Romania during the first two months of the epidemic in order to detect mutation profiles and phylogenetic relatedness. METHODS: Respiratory samples were directly used for shotgun sequencing. RESULTS: All Romanian sequences belonged to lineage B, with a different subtype distribution between northern and southern regions (subtype B.1.5 and B.1.1). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the Romanian epidemic started with multiple introduction events from other European countries followed by local transmission. Phylogenetic links between northern Romania and Spain, Austria, Scotland and Russia were observed, as well as between southern Romania and Switzerland, Italy, France and Turkey. One viral strain presented a previously unreported mutation in the Nsp2 gene, namely K489E. Epidemiologically-defined clusters displayed specific mutations, suggesting molecular signatures for strains coming from areas that were isolated during the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Romanian epidemic was initiated by multiple introductions from European countries followed by local transmissions. Different subtype distribution between northern and southern Romania was observed after two months of the pandemic.","Surleac, Marius; Banica, Leontina; Casangiu, Corina; Cotic, Marius; Florea, Dragos; Sandulescu, Oana; Milu, Petre; Streinu-Cercel, Anca; Vlaicu, Ovidiu; Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Paraschiv, Simona; Otelea, Dan",,,736
433891,Angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 as a molecular mediator for infection of cells with sars-cov and sars-cov-2 viruses,2021,"Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus is a re-emergent zoonotic pathogen with a 30% fatality rate in humans The MERS positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome is translated into two polyproteins that must be processed by two viral cysteine proteases (3CLpro and PLpro) into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) before viral replication can occur Attempts to drug either of these cysteine proteases have proven difficult MERS 3CLpro functions as dimer and is unique among all of the coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes studied to date because competitive inhibitors activate the wild-type MERS 3CLpro enzyme at low inhibitor concentrations and inhibit at higher concentrations This mechanism of substrate/inhibitor-induced dimerization seems to be mediated by non-conserved residues in structural regions distal to the catalytic site We have identified unique residues that are involved in the inhibitor-induced dimerization mechanism and we show that these ?competitive? inhibitors activate and inhibit in a dose-dependent manner In an attempt to provide a structural basis for this mechanism, we crystallized the apo and inhibitor-bound forms of this enzyme and diffracted them to 1 5 ? 2 2 Å We also show that residues in distinct structural regions synergize to modulate the intrinsic kinetic parameters of this family of enzymes These parameters include increased turnover (kcat) and a lower dimer dissociation constant (KD) Additionally, a rapid-equilibrium kinetic mechanism was developed to model the kinetic response of MERS 3CLpro to inhibitors that act via substrate/inhibitor induced activation/inhibition mechanisms Support or Funding Information This project has been funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contracts No HHSN272200700058C, HHSN272201200026C, and HHSN272201700060C This research used resources of the Advanced Photon Source, a U S Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory under Contract No DE-AC02-06CH11357 Use of the Lilly Research Laboratories Collaborative Access Team (LRL-CAT) beamline at Sector 31 of the Advanced Photon Source was provided by Eli Lilly Company, which operates the facility","Anson, Brandon James; Daczkowski, Courtney Marie; Mesecar, Andrew David",The FASEB Journal,,736
434489,How vets are helping,2020,"PURPOSE: This paper describes the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequent shift from in-person to virtual (video-based) home visiting, had on the Los Angeles County Welcome Baby Home Visiting Program. DESCRIPTION: The Welcome Baby (WB) Program is a voluntary, universal home visiting program for expectant women and women with infants in Los Angeles County implemented in 14 hospitals in Los Angeles County. Oversight of the program is managed by LA Best Babies Network (LABBN) and funded by First 5 LA. The COVID-19 pandemic forced Welcome Baby Home visitors to shift from in-person home visits to virtual visits, which had an impact on programmatic outcomes. ASSESSMENT: LABBN manages a database utilized by WB sites. In assessing data trends before and during the pandemic, shifting to virtual visits resulted in an increase in both missed visits and completed visits, and a decrease in overall visit length. Completion of required assessments and overall client program completion were not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The Welcome Baby sites across Los Angeles County were able to successfully migrate in-person visits to a virtual platform, proving that virtual visits are possible and do provide some programmatic benefits. However, the long-term efficacy of virtual visits remains to be seen, and further research is warranted.","Bock, Martha J; Kakavand, Kayla; Careaga, Diana; Gozalians, Sharlene",Matern. child health j,,736
445042,Aleutian mink disease: spatio-temporal variation of prevalence and influence on the feral American mink,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The rapid emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in an increased mortality rate across the globe However, the underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 altering human immune response is still elusive The existing literature on miRNA mediated pathogenesis of RNA virus viz Dengue virus, West Nile virus, etc raises a suspicion that miRNA encoded by SARS-CoV-2 might facilitate virus replication and regulate the host's gene expression at the post-transcriptional level METHODS: We investigated this possibility via computational prediction of putative miRNAs encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome using a novel systematic pipeline that predicts putative mature-miRNA and their targeted genes transcripts To trace down if viral-miRNAs targeted the genes critical to the immune pathway, we assessed whether mature miRNA transcripts exhibit effective hybridization with the 3'UTR region of human gene transcripts Conversely, we also tried to study human miRNA-mediated viral gene regulation to get insight into the miRNA mediated offense and defense mechanism of viruses and their host organisms in too RESULTS: Our analysis led us to shortlist six putative miRNAs that target, majorly, genes related to cell proliferation/differentiation/signaling, and senescence Nonetheless, they also target immune-related genes that directly/indirectly orchestrate immune pathways like TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways putatively serving as the nucleus to cytokine storms CONCLUSION: Besides, these six miRNAs were found to conserved so far across 80 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 (NCBI Virus, last assessed 12 April 2020) including Indian strains that are also targeted by 7 human miRNAs and can, therefore, be exploited to develop MicroRNA-Attenuated Vaccines","Satyam, R.; Bhardwaj, T.; Goel, S.; Jha, N.

482542,Remote yet engaging: Expanding learning opportunities through virtual platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"During the global outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, ""cytokine storm"" conditions are regarded as the fatal step resulting in most mortality. Hemoperfusion is widely used to remove cytokines from the blood of severely ill patients to prevent uncontrolled inflammation induced by a cytokine storm. This article discoveres, for the first time, that 2D Ti3C2T x MXene sheet demonstrates an ultrahigh removal capability for typical cytokine interleukin-6. In particular, MXene shows a 13.4 times higher removal efficiency over traditional activated carbon absorbents. Molecular-level investigations reveal that MXene exhibits a strong chemisorption mechanism for immobilizing cytokine interleukin-6 molecules, which is different from activated carbon absorbents. MXene sheet also demonstrates excellent blood compatibility without any deleterious side influence on the composition of human blood. This work can open a new avenue to use MXene sheets as an ultraefficient hemoperfusion absorbent to eliminate the cytokine storm syndrome in treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Tianyi; Sun, Xiaoyu; Guo, Xin; Zhang, Jinqiang; Yang, Jian; Tao, Shouxuan; Guan, Jun; Zhou, Lin; Han, Jie; Wang, Chengyin; Yao, Hang; Wang, Guoxiu",Small Methods,,736
627609,"SARS-COV-2 ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION CAN CAUSE ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION: HISTOPATHOLOGICAL, IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL AND ULTRASTRUCTURAL STUDY OF THE HUMAN PENIS",2021-09-30,"Background: Health care workers (HCWs) represent a high risk population for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Aim: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs, and to find out the factors that are associated with this seroprevalence. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were applied for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases including PubMed/MEDLINE and pre-print services (medR{chi}iv and bioR{chi}iv) were searched from inception up to August 24, 2020. Findings: Fifty studies, including 184,898 HCWs met the inclusion criteria. The estimated overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs was 8.4% (95% CI: 6.1-11.1%). Seroprevalence was higher in studies that were conducted in North America (12.7%) compared to those in Africa (8.2), Europe (8.1%) and Asia (4%). Meta-regression showed that increased sensitivity of antibodies test was associated with increased seroprevalence. The following factors were associated with seropositivity: male gender, Black, Asian, and Hispanic HCWs, work in a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) unit, patient-related work, frontline health care workers, health care assistants, personal protective equipment shortage, self-reported belief for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, previous positive polymerase chain reaction test, and household contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs is high. Excellent adherence to infection prevention and control measures, sufficient and adequate personal protective equipment, and early recognition, identification and isolation of HCWs that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 are imperative to decrease the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Galanis, P.
