The encounters between a healthcare professional (HCP) and patient could influence how connections and relations emerge between the caregiver and the patient. OBJECTIVES To better understand caring aspects, this study explores significant encounters in forensic psychiatric care from the perspective of HCPs. METHOD This study is based on 34 written narratives from HCPs from two forensic psychiatric hospitals in Sweden. The narratives concern significant encounters with a patient. These narratives were analysed according to methodologies developed by phenomenological and reflective lifeworld research. FINDINGS The essence of a significant encounter is a temporal extended phenomenon that both precedes as well as is a consequence of the actual encounter as it occurs. The encounter is unforeseeable and being open to an encounter also means to be vulnerable as it is not predetermined how someone will respond. The significant encounter is an act of sharing, and HCPs may come to understand more about their patients as well as about themselves. Moreover, these encounters seem to create repercussions and hope for the future care. CONCLUSIONS The everyday activities of forensic psychiatric care are not trivial activities. Rather, they are important aspects of health care as these everyday encounters can deepen the relationship between the HCPs and their patients and help both the HCPs and their patients develop a sense of hope for the future.","Rytterström, Patrik; Rydenlund, Kenneth; Ranheim, Albertine",Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,522,14

Results of a prospective study.,19.453093,-0.6447803,2011,"BACKGROUND Standard therapy for loco-regionally advanced, resectable oesophageal carcinoma is trimodality therapy (TMT) consisting of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and oesophagectomy. Evidence of survival advantage of TMT over organ-preserving definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) is inconclusive. The aim of this study is to compare survival between TMT and dCRT. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies on resectable, curatively treated, oesophageal carcinoma patients above 18 years were included. Three online databases were searched for studies comparing TMT with dCRT. Primary outcomes were 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tools for RCTs and cohort studies. Quality of evidence was evaluated according to Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation. RESULTS Thirty-two studies described in 35 articles were included in this systematic review, and 33 were included in the meta-analyses. Two-, three- and five-year overall survival was significantly lower in dCRT compared to TMT, with relative risks (RRs) of 0.69 (95% CI 0.57-0.83), 0.76 (95% CI 0.63-0.92) and 0.57 (95% CI 0.47-0.71), respectively. When only analysing studies with equal patient groups at baseline, no significant differences for 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival were found with RRs of 0.83 (95% CI 0.62-1.10), 0.81 (95% CI 0.57-1.14) and 0.63 (95% CI 0.36-1.12). CONCLUSION These meta-analyses do not show clear survival advantage for TMT over dCRT. Only a non-significant trend towards better survival was seen, assuming comparable patient groups at baseline. Non-operative management of oesophageal carcinoma patients might be part of a personalised and tailored treatment approach in future. However, to date hard evidence proving its non-inferiority compared to operative management is lacking.","Voeten, Daan M; den Bakker, Chantal M; Heineman, David J; Ket, Johannes C F; Daams, Freek; van der Peet, Donald L",World journal of surgery,522,1

CLINICAL FINDINGS On initial evaluation, the mare had mild signs of abdominal discomfort. A full-thickness rectal tear located 30 cm cranial to the anus and extending approximately 15 cm longitudinally along the surface of the small colon between the 4 and 6 o'clock positions, when viewed from behind, was diagnosed on examination per rectum. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Laparoscopic evaluation of the abdomen was performed to assess the tear and extent of peritoneal contamination. A hand-assisted repair via a flank incision was performed. The tear was closed in a single-layer, simple continuous pattern with size-0 polydioxanone with a handheld needle holder. Subsequently, a ventral midline celiotomy was performed, and intestinal contents were evacuated via a pelvic flexure enterotomy and a typhlotomy. Following surgery, the mare was managed with IV fluid therapy, partial parenteral nutrition, antimicrobials, and NSAIDs for 5 to 7 days before being gradually reintroduced to a complete pelleted feed and alfalfa hay. Prior to discharge, examination per rectum revealed no stricture formation associated with repair. The mare was discharged from the hospital and performed successfully as a broodmare, with the delivery of a live foal 1 year after surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Successful repair with an excellent outcome was achieved in this mare. Hand-assisted laparoscopic repair should be considered as a possible treatment option in horses with grade IV rectal tears.","Stewart, Suzanne G; Johnston, Janet K; Parente, Eric J",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,522,24

In this work, by incorporating RhNCs, the near-band-edge emission of a single ZnO microwire is considerably enhanced. When optically pumped by a fs pulsed laser at room temperature, RhNCs-plasmon enhanced high-performance whispering gallery mode (WGM) lasing characteristics, including lower lasing threshold, higher Q-factor, and lasing output enhancement, can be achieved from a single ZnO microwire covered by RhNCs. To further probe the modulation effect of RhNCs plasmons on the lasing characteristics of the ZnO microwires, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and electromagnetic simulation analyses were also performed. Based on our results, it can be concluded that size-controlled RhNCs with ultraviolet energy-tunable plasmons have the potential for use in optoelectronic devices requiring stable and high-performance in the short wavelength spectrum band owing to their unique ultraviolet plasmonic features.","Miao, Changzong; Xu, Haiying; Jiang, Mingming; Liu, Yang; Wan, Peng; Kan, Caixia",Optics express,522,12

MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed the surgical videos and medical charts of 31 patients who had undergone RALPN with the SLT renorrhaphy performed by two surgeons (CWJ and CK) between January 2014 and October 2014. SLT renorrhaphy was performed after tumor excision and renal parenchymal defect repair. Assessed outcomes included renorrhaphy time (RT), warm ischemic time, perioperative complications, and perioperative renal function change. RT was defined as interval from the end of bed suture to the renal artery declamping. RESULTS In all patients, sliding loop renorrhaphy was successfully conducted without conversions to radical nephrectomy or open approaches. Mean renorrhaphy and warm ischemic time were 9.0 and 22.6 minutes, respectively. After completing renorrhaphy, there were no adverse events such as dehiscence of approximated renal parenchyma, renal parenchymal tearing, or significant bleeding. Furthermore, no postoperative complications or significant renal function decline were observed as of the last follow-up for all patients. The limitations of this study include the small volume case series, the retrospective nature of the study, and the heterogeneity of surgeons. CONCLUSIONS From our initial clinical experience, SLT may be an efficient and safe renorrhaphy method in real clinical practice. Further large scale, prospective, long-term follow-up, and direct comparative studies with other techniques are required to confirm the clinical applicability of SLT.","Kim, Hyung Suk; Lee, Young Ju; Ku, Ja Hyeon; Kwak, Cheol; Kim, Hyeon Hoe; Jeong, Chang Wook",Korean journal of urology,522,30

Also for total MIE several groups have reported benefits for patients in terms of morbidity and quality of life.1 5 However, different approaches and experiences of different esophageal surgery groups are hardly comparable and thus do not allow a simple answer in favor of a specific total MIE technique. To enlighten the field of total MIE, we present the technique as we perform this procedure nearly weekly in our department. The described MIE technique is safe and feasible.

Transanal (TaTME) is a new natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery modality in which the rectum is mobilized transanally using endoscopic techniques with or without laparoscopic assistance. We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of publications on this new technique in PubMed and Embase databases from January, 2008, to July, 2014. Experimental and clinical studies written in English were included. Experimental research with TaTME was done on pigs with and without survival models and on human cadavers. In these studies, laparoscopic or transgastric assistance was frequently used resulting in an easier upper rectal dissection and in a longer rectal specimen. To date, 150 patients in 16 clinical studies have undergone TaTME. In all but 15 cases, transabdominal assistance was used. A rigid transanal endoscopic operations/transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEO/TEM) platform was used in 37 patients. Rectal adenocarcinoma was the indication in all except for nine cases of benign diseases. Operative times ranged from 90 to 460 min. TME quality was deemed intact, satisfactory, or complete. Involvement in circumferential resection margins was detected in 16 (11.8 %) patients. The mean lymph node harvest was equal or greater than 12 in all studies. Regarding morbidity, pneumoretroperitoneum, damage to the urethra, and air embolism were reported intraoperatively. Mean hospital stay varied from 4 to 14 days. Postoperative complications occurred in 34 (22.7 %) patients. TaTME with TEM is feasible in selected cases. Oncologic safety parameters seem to be adequate although the evidence relies on small retrospective series conducted by highly trained surgeons.

Recently, we unveiled that ZNF554 regulates trophoblast invasion during placentation and its decreased expression leads to the early pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Since ZNF proteins are immensely implicated in the development of several tumors including malignant tumors of the brain, here we explored the pathological role of ZNF554 in gliomas. We examined the expression of ZNF554 at mRNA and protein levels in normal brain and gliomas, and then we searched for genome-wide transcriptomic changes in U87 glioblastoma cells transiently overexpressing ZNF554. Immunohistochemistry of brain tissues in our cohort (n = 62) and analysis of large TCGA RNA-Seq data (n = 687) of control, oligodendroglioma, and astrocytoma tissues both revealed decreased expression of ZNF554 towards higher glioma grades. Furthermore, low ZNF554 expression was associated with shorter survival of grade III and IV astrocytoma patients. Overexpression of ZNF554 in U87 cells resulted in differential expression, mostly downregulation of 899 genes. The ""PI3K-Akt signaling pathway"", known to be activated during glioma development, was the most impacted among 116 dysregulated pathways. Most affected pathways were cancer-related and/or immune-related. Congruently, cell proliferation was decreased and cell cycle was arrested in ZNF554-transfected glioma cells. These data collectively suggest that ZNF554 is a potential tumor suppressor and its decreased expression may lead to the loss of oncogene suppression, activation of tumor pathways, and shorter survival of patients with malignant glioma.","Balogh, Andrea; Reiniger, Lilla; Hetey, Szabolcs; Kiraly, Peter; Toth, Eszter; Karaszi, Katalin; Juhasz, Kata; Gelencser, Zsolt; Zvara, Agnes; Szilagyi, Andras; Puskas, Laszlo G; Matko, Janos; Papp, Zoltan; Kovalszky, Ilona; Juhasz, Csaba; Than, Nandor Gabor",International journal of molecular sciences,522,1

This inconsistency is reflected in public policy, with governments using the term 'public health approach' in contradictory ways. This aim of this study is to clarify what is meant and understood when the term 'public health approach' is used in the context of substance use. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic search of Medline, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts and PAIS Index. Eligible articles will be from peer-reviewed journals, in English, with full text available. There will be no limits on year of publication. Substance use must be the primary topic of the article. Editorials, commentaries and letters to the editor will be included, but not commentaries on other articles, unless the definition of a public health approach is central to the commentary. Data selection and collection will be conducted independently by two researchers, with a third separately resolving any disagreement. To answer the research question, we will extract authors' definitions of a public health approach to substance use as well as any descriptions of the central principles, characteristics and components of such an approach. To synthesise the data, we will employ thematic synthesis. Coding will be conducted by one researcher and verified by a second; two researchers will then group the codes into themes using an inductive process. Finally, the full research team will develop a set of analytic themes, which will be presented as a narrative.

A monocentric prospective analysis was performed to assess epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes of infections during the peri-transplant period. METHODS Data were recorded prospectively using a predefined questionnaire. RESULTS In 2015, 163 consecutive patients, 37.4% female, median age 59 (range 18-79) years received 166 allo-SCT. Median duration of leukopenia <109 /L was 14.5 days (range 4-43 days). Fever of unknown origin (FUO) occurred in 118/166 patients (71.1%). Severe sepsis developed in 95, septic shock in 26 patients. Intensive diagnostic workup helped to identify causative microorganisms only in a small number of infectious courses. All but 13 patients needed antibiotic therapy, each according to the standard operating procedures of the department. Cumulative incidence of death by infection after one year was 16.6% (95%CI 11.3-22.7%). The only risk factor for FUO in neutropenia was duration of neutropenia </≥14 days (55.4% vs 85.5%, p<.001). CONCLUSION Results of an elaborate diagnostic workup of infections in the peri-transplant period are scarce. Attention to risk factors might help to identify patients at risk for severe infections.","Samek, Markus; Iversen, Katharina; Belmar-Campos, Cristina; Berneking, Laura; Langebrake, Claudia; Wolschke, Christine; Ayuk, Francis; Kröger, Nicolaus; Christopeit, Maximilian",European journal of haematology,522,1

This study aimed to investigate the effect of a 3D passive polarizing display (3DPPD) and a novel 3D head-mounted display (3DHMD; HMS-3000MT) on the performance of the first laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair by novices and compare both systems with standard high-definition 2D (HD2D) laparoscopy. METHODS Patients with symptomatic inguinal hernia underwent transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) approach hernia repair using 3DHMD, 3DPPD, or a conventional HD2D laparoscopic system. All surgeries were performed for the first time by three laparoscopically novice surgeons. Operative performance was compared in terms of the time taken for mesh placement and peritoneal suturing under standardized conditions. Additionally, visual perception parameters and adverse effects were assessed. RESULTS The use of both 3D techniques shortened the time required for mesh placement and peritoneal suturing compared with the conventional HD2D approach. Generally, 3D laparoscopy was superior to HD2D laparoscopy in terms of visual perception parameters such as depth perception, sharpness, ghosting, and contrast. However, compared with the use of HD2D laparoscopy, the use of 3DHMD significantly impaired a surgeon's comfort, with the greatest impairment caused by ear discomfort, headaches, and facial and physical discomforts. CONCLUSIONS The 3DHMD and 3DPPD systems showed clear improvement in first hernia repair laparoscopy by novice surgeons in terms of surgical performance, as well as visual perception; however, the 3DHMD system was not superior to the 3DPPD system. The reduction in training time for new surgeons is obviously advantageous. In this respect, the 3D equipment may be a worthwhile investment.","Hanani, M; Cernat, V; Beyer, K; Walschus, U; Schulze, T; Heidecke, C D; Patrzyk, M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,522,8

A main drawback of using IEX for NOM removal is the production of spent IEX regeneration brine, a polluting waste that is expensive to discharge. In this work, we studied ceramic nanofiltration as a treatment for the spent NOM-rich brine, with the aim to reduce the volume of this waste and to recycle salt. Compared to polymeric nanofiltration, the fouling was limited. When NOM is rejected and concentrated, a clean permeate with the regeneration salt (NaCl) could be produced and reused in the IEX regeneration process. Bench scale studies revealed that NOM could be effectively separated from the NaCl solution by steric effects. However, the separation of NaCl from other salts present in the brine, such as Na2SO4, was not sufficient for reuse purposes. The low sulphate rejection was mainly due to the low zeta potential of the membrane at the high ionic strength of the brine. The permeate of the ceramic nanofiltration should be treated further to obtain a sodium chloride quality that can be recycled as a regenerant solution for ion exchange. Further treatment steps will benefit from the removal of NOM from the brine.","Caltran, I; Rietveld, L C; Shorney-Darby, H L; Heijman, S G J",Water research,522,12

Tanshinone II A is a main lipid-soluble monomer derivative from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) and tanshinone II A possess a variety of biological activities through redox signaling pathway. Here we investigated the effect of tanshinone II A on Tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation and the redox signaling pathway involved in it. As the results were shown, tanshinone II A reversed Tat-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and down-regulation of glutathione (GSH) levels in TZM-bl cells through up-regulation of Nrf2 expression. Tanshinone II A reversed Tat-induced inhibition of SIRT1 activity but not SIRT1 protein expression. Tanshinone II A reversed Tat-induced inhibition of Nampt protein expression and depletion of NAD(+) levels in TZM-bl cells in a dose-dependent manner.

We created a risk prediction model for AN to help decide which test might be preferred, a use not considered for existing models. DESIGN Average-risk 50-to-80-year olds undergoing first-time screening colonoscopy were recruited from endoscopy units in Indiana. We measured sociodemographic and physical features, medical and family history and lifestyle factors and linked these to the most advanced finding. We derived a risk equation on two-thirds of the sample and assigned points to each variable to create a risk score. Scores with comparable risks were collapsed into risk categories. The model and score were tested on the remaining sample. RESULTS Among 3025 subjects in the derivation set (mean age 57.3 (6.5) years; 52% women), AN prevalence was 9.4%. The 13-variable model (c-statistic=0.77) produced three risk groups with AN risks of 1.5% (95% CI 0.72% to 2.74%), 7.06% (CI 5.89% to 8.38%) and 27.26% (CI 23.47% to 31.30%) in low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk groups (p value <0.001), containing 23%, 59% and 18% of subjects, respectively. In the validation set of 1475 subjects (AN prevalence of 8.4%), model performance was comparable (c-statistic=0.78), with AN risks of 2.73% (CI 1.25% to 5.11%), 5.57% (CI 4.12% to 7.34%) and 25.79% (CI 20.51% to 31.66%) in low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk subgroups, respectively (p<0.001), containing proportions of 23%, 59% and 18%. CONCLUSION Among average-risk persons, this model estimates AN risk with high discrimination, identifying a lower risk subgroup that may be screened non-invasively and a higher risk subgroup for which colonoscopy may be preferred. The model could help guide patient-provider discussions of screening options, may increase screening adherence and conserve colonoscopy resources.","Imperiale, Thomas F; Monahan, Patrick O; Stump, Timothy E; Ransohoff, David F",Gut,522,17

Furthermore, we examined how these variables influence judgments regarding suspected maltreatment and intentions to consult and report child-maltreatment. We used an experimental survey design including vignettes manipulating the child's characteristics. Data was collected from 412 professionals employed at various community-health-service-clinics of the largest health-management organization in northern Israel. Findings show that all subjective factors have a significant effect on suspected child-maltreatment assessment, which appears as a significant predictor of later decisions regarding consultation and reporting. This study lends support to prior research indicating that healthcare-professionals' decisions may incorporate biases, and suggests how the effects of these biases' are mediated through a sequence of decisions.

Elderly population with gastric cancer has increased in East Asia, including in Japan. METHODS We examined 1131 patients with gastric cancer who underwent laparoscopic and open standard surgeries (OG). A total of 921 patients of age < 75 years (non-E group) and 210 patients of age ≥ 75 years (E group) underwent surgery for gastric cancer. The mortality, morbidity, and prognosis of LG and OG were compared by propensity score-matched analysis. RESULTS Mortality and morbidity in the E group were significantly higher than those in the non-E group (p < 0.05). Propensity score-matching revealed that the incidence of postoperative complications of grade ≥ 2 in the OG subgroup was significantly higher than that in the LG subgroup in the E group (p < 0.05). The overall survival rate of the LG subgroup was significantly higher than that of the OG subgroup in both the non-E and E groups (p < 0.05). The depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and the number of dissected lymph nodes were dependent factors for survival in the non-E group, whereas the depth of tumor invasion was the only dependent factor for survival in the E group in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION The survival rate of patients who underwent LG showed significantly good prognosis in both the non-E and E groups, although the E group patients who underwent OG subgroup showed higher severe complication incidences than those who underwent LG subgroup.","Yamamoto, Manabu; Shimokawa, Mototsugu; Kawano, Hiroyuki; Ohta, Mitsuhiko; Yoshida, Daisuke; Minami, Kazuhito; Ikebe, Masahiko; Morita, Masaru; Toh, Yasushi",Surgical endoscopy,522,1

This ribonucleoprotein structure becomes packaged into virions through association with the carboxy-terminal endodomain of the membrane protein (M), which is the principal constituent of the virion envelope. Previous work with the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has shown that a major determinant of the N-M interaction maps to the carboxy-terminal domain 3 of the N protein. To explore other domain interactions of the MHV N protein, we expressed a series of segments of the MHV N protein as fusions with green fluorescent protein (GFP) during the course of viral infection. We found that two of these GFP-N-domain fusion proteins were selectively packaged into virions as the result of tight binding to the N protein in the viral nucleocapsid, in a manner that did not involve association with either M protein or RNA. The nature of each type of binding was further explored through genetic analysis. Our results defined two strongly interacting regions of the N protein. One is the same domain 3 that is critical for M protein recognition during assembly. The other is domain N1b, which corresponds to the N-terminal domain that has been structurally characterized in detail for two other coronaviruses, infectious bronchitis virus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.","Hurst, Kelley R; Koetzner, Cheri A; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,522,8

Methods The literature concerning medial support augmentation of plate osteosynthesis for proximal humeral fractures in recent years was extensively reviewed, as well as the biomechanical benefit and clinical advantage were analyzed thoroughly. Results Medial support augmentation of plate osteosynthesis for proximal humeral fractures is very important, especially in osteoporotic and/or comminuted fractures. Many medial support augmentation methods have been proposed which can be divided into extramedullary support and intramedullary support. It can also be divided into autogenous bone support and allogenic bone support according to the material and source, divided into medial column support, calcar support, and humeral head support according to the support site, and divided into fibular shaft support, femoral head support, anatomic fibula support according to the shape of the augmented fixation. At present, clinical and biomechanical researches show that medial support augmentation is an effective treatment for proximal humeral fractures. Conclusion As an important treatment strategy for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures, the medial support augmentation of plate osteosynthesis gets the focus from the biomechanical studies and clinical treatment. However, there are still widespread controversies among orthopedic surgeons regarding the support mode, site, implant shape, and material of medial column support for augmentation of proximal humeral fractures. More high-quality clinical trials and biomechanical researches as well as multi-disciplinary integration, are needed to provide better strategy treatment for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures.","Chang, Zuhao; Zhang, Wei; Tang, Peifu; Chen, Hua",Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery,522,33

The diverse flexible active site conformations identified in the dataset were clustered into six protease pharmacophore clusters (PPCs). For the PPCs with distinct flexible protease active sites and diverse interaction environments, we identified pharmacophore anchor hotspots. A total of 11 ""PPC consensus anchors"" (a distinct set observed in each PPC) were observed, of which three ""PPC core anchors"" EHV2, HV1, and V3 are strongly conserved across PPCs. The six PPC cavities were then applied in virtual screening of 2122 FDA drugs for repurposing, using core anchor-derived ""PPC scoring S"" to yield seven drug candidates.

An Empirical Investigation.,19.515177,5.817138,2020-09-24,"BACKGROUND The implementation of eHealth applications in primary care remains challenging. Enhancing knowledge and awareness of implementation determinants is critical to build evidence-based implementation strategies and optimise uptake and sustainability. OBJECTIVES We consider how evidence-based implementation strategies can be built to support eHealth implementation. DISCUSSION What implementation strategies to consider depends on (potential) barriers and facilitators to eHealth implementation in a given situation. Therefore, we first discuss key barriers and facilitators following the five domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Cost is identified as a critical barrier to eHealth implementation. Privacy, security problems, and a lack of recognised standards for eHealth applications also hinder implementation. Engagement of key stakeholders in the implementation process, planning the implementation of the intervention, and the availability of training and support are important facilitators. To support care professionals and researchers, we provide a stepwise approach to develop and apply evidence-based implementation strategies for eHealth in primary care. It includes the following steps: (1) specify the eHealth application, (2) define problem, (3) specify desired implementation behaviour, and (4) choose and (5) evaluate the implementation strategy. To improve the fit of the implementation strategy with the setting, the stepwise approach considers the phase of the implementation process and the specific context. CONCLUSION Applying an approach, as provided here, may help to improve the implementation of eHealth applications in primary care.","Versluis, Anke; van Luenen, Sanne; Meijer, Eline; Honkoop, Persijn J; Pinnock, Hilary; Mohr, David C; Neves, Ana Luisa; Chavannes, Niels H; van der Kleij, Rianne M J J",The European journal of general practice,522,1

OBJECTIVES To determine the total direct costs of publicly funded health care utilization for the three fiscal years 2003/04 to 2005/06 (1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 to 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006), from the time of initial hospitalization to 1 year after initial acute discharge among individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING Ontario, Canada. METHODS Health system costs were calculated for 559 individuals with traumatic SCI (C1-T12 AIS A-D) for acute inpatient, emergency department, inpatient rehabilitation (that is, short-stay inpatient rehabilitation), complex continuing care (CCC) (i.e., long-stay inpatient rehabilitation), home care services, and physician visits in the year after index hospitalization. All care costs were calculated from the government payer's perspective, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. RESULTS Total direct costs of health care utilization in this traumatic SCI population (including the acute care costs of the index event and inpatient readmission in the following year after the index discharge) were substantial: $102 900 per person in 2003/04, $100 476 in 2004/05 and $123 674 in 2005/06 Canadian Dollars (2005 CDN $). The largest cost driver to the health care system was inpatient rehabilitation care. From 2003/04 to 2005/06, the average per person cost of rehabilitation was approximately three times the average per person costs of inpatient acute care. CONCLUSION The high costs and long length of stay in inpatient rehabilitation are important system cost drivers, emphasizing the need to evaluate treatment efficacy and subsequent health outcomes in the inpatient rehabilitation setting.","Munce, S E P; Wodchis, W P; Guilcher, S J T; Couris, C M; Verrier, M; Fung, K; Craven, B C; Jaglal, S B",Spinal cord,522,31

Previously, we revealed that gene expression analysis of peripheral blood cells is a useful approach for assessing diseases such as diabetes mellitus and cancer because the altered gene expression profiles of peripheral blood cells can reflect the presence and state of diseases. However, no chronological assessment of whole gene expression profiles has been conducted. In the present study, we collected whole blood RNA from 61 individuals (average age at registration, 50 years) every 4 years for 8 years and analyzed gene expression profiles using a complementary DNA microarray to examine whether these profiles were stable or changed over time. We found that the genes with very stable expression were related mostly to immune system pathways, including antigen cell presentation and interferon-related signaling. Genes whose expression was altered over the 8-year study period were principally involved in cellular machinery pathways, including development, signal transduction, cell cycle, apoptosis, and survival. Thus, this chronological examination study showed that the gene expression profiles of whole blood can reveal unmanifested physiological changes.","Sakai, Yoshio; Nasti, Alessandro; Takeshita, Yumie; Okumura, Miki; Kitajima, Shinji; Honda, Masao; Wada, Takashi; Nakamura, Seiji; Takamura, Toshinari; Tamura, Takuro; Matsubara, Kenichi; Kaneko, Shuichi",Scientific reports,522,4

For these patients, the only alternative is to assume TKI continuously, lifelong. METHODS The Italian phase III multicentric randomized OPTkIMA study started in 2015, with the aim to evaluate if a progressive de-escalation of TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib) is able to maintain the molecular response (MR3.0 ) and to improve Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). RESULTS Up to December 2018, 166/185 (90%) elderly CML patients in stable MR3.0 /MR4.0 completed the first year of any TKI intermittent schedule 1 month ON and 1 month OFF. The first year probability of maintaining the MR3.0 was 81% and 23.5% of the patients who lost the molecular response regained the MR3.0 after resuming TKI continuously. Patients' HRQoL at baseline was better than that of matched peers from healthy population. Women was the only factor independently associated with worse baseline HRQoL (p > 0.0001). Overall, global HRQoL worsened at 6 (p < 0.001) but returned to the baseline value at 12 months and it was statistically significantly worse in women (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS De-escalation of any TKI by 1 month ON/OFF schedule maintains the MR3.0 /MR4.0 in 81% of the patients during the first 12-24 months. No patients progressed to accelerated/blastic phase, all the patients (23.5%) losing MR3.0 regained the MR3.0 and none suffered from TKI withdrawn syndrome.

Astroglial cells are involved in several functions to maintain brain homeostasis, actively participating in the inflammatory response and antioxidant defense systems. We, herein, investigated the potential mechanisms involved in the glioprotective effects of sulforaphane in the C6 astrocyte cell line, when challenged with the inflammogen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Sulforaphane prevented the LPS-induced increase in the expression and/or release of pro-inflammatory mediators, possibly due to nuclear factor κB and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α activation. Sulforaphane also modulated the expressions of the Toll-like and adenosine receptors, which often mediate inflammatory processes induced by LPS. Additionally, sulforaphane increased the mRNA levels of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO1), both of which mediate several cytoprotective responses. Sulforaphane also prevented the increase in NADPH oxidase activity and the elevations of superoxide and 3-nitrotyrosine that were stimulated by LPS. In addition, sulforaphane and LPS modulated superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione metabolism. Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of sulforaphane were blocked by HO1 pharmacological inhibition, suggesting its dependence on HO1 activity. Finally, in support of a glioprotective role, sulforaphane prevented the LPS-induced decrease in glutamate uptake, glutamine synthetase activity, and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) levels, as well as the augmentations in S100B release and Na+, K+ ATPase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has comprehensively explored the glioprotective effects of sulforaphane on astroglial cells, reinforcing the beneficial effects of sulforaphane on astroglial functionality.","Bobermin, Larissa Daniele; Weber, Fernanda Becker; Dos Santos, Tiago Marcon; Belló-Klein, Adriane; Wyse, Angela T S; Gonçalves, Carlos-Alberto; Quincozes-Santos, André",Cellular and molecular neurobiology,522,0

METHODS Twelve participants (mean ± SD; 25 ± 4 years) exercised for 180 min at 3 METs in 40.1 ± 0.6 °C, 40.4 ± 2.1%RH four times: (i) consuming 20 °C water ad libitum (AL20); (ii) consuming 4 °C water ad libitum (AL4); (iii) replacing no fluids (NOFR); (iv) replacing sweat losses (FULLFR). Fluid consumption (FC), dehydration (%DEH), rectal temperature (Tre), rate-pressure product (RPP), forearm blood flow (FBF), mean skin temperature (Tsk), and local sweat rate (LSR) were measured/determined. RESULTS FC was greater in AL20 (1.30 ± 0.41 L) than AL4 (1.03 ± 0.32 L; P = 0.003). %DEH was lower (P < 0.001) in AL20 (0.11 ± 0.76%), AL4 (0.43 ± 0.64%), and FULLFR (0.01 ± 0.12%) compared to NOFR (1.93 ± 0.28%). %DEH was lower in AL20 than AL4 (P = 0.003). In NOFR, end-trial changes in Tre were greater (P < 0.001) (1.05 ± 0.27 °C) compared to all other trials, but similar among AL20 (0.72 ± 0.30 °C), AL4 (0.76 ± 0.25 °C) and FULLFR (0.74 ± 0.35 °C). End-trial RPP was higher (P < 0.001) in NOFR (12,389 ± 1578 mmHg·bpm) compared to all other trials, but similar among FULLFR (11,067 ± 1292 mmHg·bpm), AL20 (11,214 ± 2078 mmHg·bpm) and AL4 (11,089 ± 1795 mmHg·bpm). No differences in Tsk or LSR were observed among trials, but FBF was lower in NOFR compared to FULLFR (2.84 ± 0.69 vs. 3.52 ± 0.96 ml/100 ml/min; P = 0.029). CONCLUSION 4 °C or 20 °C ad libitum water ingestion prevented dehydration levels that exacerbate thermal/cardiovascular strain, despite blunted fluid intake with 4 °C water. Higher core temperatures with NOFR are attributed to impaired internal heat distribution secondary to a lower FBF.","Graham, Connor; Morris, Nathan B; Harwood, Amy E; Jay, Ollie",European journal of applied physiology,522,1

By contrast, the interactivity of promoters per se, while equally critical to understanding transcriptional control, has been largely unexplored, particularly in a cell type-specific manner for blood lineage cell types. In this study, we leverage promoter capture Hi-C data across a compendium of blood lineage cell types to identify and characterize cell type-specific super-interactive promoters (SIPs). Notably, promoter-interacting regions (PIRs) of SIPs are more likely to overlap with cell type-specific ATAC-seq peaks and GWAS variants for relevant blood cell traits than PIRs of non-SIPs. Further, SIP genes tend to express at a higher level in the corresponding cell type, and show enriched heritability of relevant blood cell trait(s). Importantly, this analysis shows the potential of using promoter-centric analyses of chromatin spatial organization data to identify biologically important genes and their regulatory regions.","Lagler, Taylor M.; Yang, Yuchen; Harigaya, Yuriko; Sankaran, Vijay G.; Hu, Ming; Reiner, Alexander P.; Raffield, Laura M.; Wen, Jia; Li, Yun",bioRxiv,522,20

To address the influence of physical distancing, universal masking, and ventilation on very fine respiratory droplets and aerosol particle exposure, a simulator that coughed and exhaled aerosols (the source) and a second breathing simulator (the recipient) were placed in an exposure chamber. When controlling for the other two mitigation strategies, universal masking with 3-ply cotton masks reduced exposure to 0.3-3 m coughed and exhaled aerosol particles by > 77% compared to unmasked tests, whereas physical distancing (0.9 or 1.8 m) significantly changed exposure to cough but not exhaled aerosols.

Spleen cells or thioglycolate elicited peritoneal exudate cells can transfer resistance from 12-week-old to 6-week-old recipients. Removal of the adherent cells from either spleen or peritoneal cells ablated protection. Adherent cells from 12-week-old mice were protective even after depletion of Ia- and Thy-1-bearing cells. Antiviral antibody, thioglycolate injection into 6-week-old animals, and nylon wool-purified T cells were ineffective in mediating resistance.

The poults were observed daily for clinical signs, and their growth response, pathology, and pathogen shedding were examined at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 days postinoculation (DPI). Body weights of eight poults in each group were recorded at each of these intervals followed by euthanasia. Dullness, depression, and diarrhea were observed in birds inoculated with supernatant or sediment suspension. All three treatments significantly reduced body weight gain of poults compared with the control group; average weight loss was 14%. Gross pathologic changes consisted of pale distended intestines with watery contents and distended ceca with frothy and watery contents.

These findings suggest a role for bacteria in increasing the severity of PES. Lower weight gain in treated poults (compared with controls) at 9 wk of age also indicates that PES-affected poults may not reach normal weight at marketing, leading to economic losses for the producer.","Jindal, Naresh; Patnayak, Devi P; Ziegler, Andre F; Lago, Alfonso; Goyal, Sagar M",Avian diseases,522,33

Data regarding clinical profile of hospitalised elderly with COVID-19 in Indonesia were still lacking. Older people are at-risk population in the pandemic, whom we should pay attention to.MethodsThis single centre descriptive study utilised complete data of elderly inpatients with COVID-19 in Indonesia's national general hospital from April to late August 2020. The data consisted of clinical characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, multimorbidity, and mortality outcome.ResultsAmong elderly patients (n=44), a majority of patients were aged 60-69 years (68%), were male (66%), and had no history of close contact with COVID-19 patient (86%). The most common symptoms were fever, cough and shortness of breath (classic symptoms of COVID-19), whereas the most common chronic diseases were diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and malignancy. Multimorbidity was only found in 14% of patients, all of whom remained alive following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death rate among elderly inpatients with COVID-19 in this study was 23%, and male older adults contributed to 90% of death cases.ConclusionMale patients dominated both confirmed cases and death cases among elderly with COVID-19. Classic symptoms of COVID-19 were only found in about half of the study patients. Non-survivors had higher percentage of the classic symptoms of COVID-19 than survivors. Atypical COVID-19 presentations are possible in older adults.

A full-length cDNA clone of satBaMV was used to examine the sequences required for the synthesis of potexvirus subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs). Subgenomic promoter-like sequences (SGPs), 107 nucleotides (nt) upstream from the capsid protein (CP) gene of BaMV-V, were inserted upstream of the start codon of the P20 gene of satBaMV. Insertion of SGPs gave rise to the synthesis of sgRNA of satBaMV in protoplasts of Nicotiana benthamiana and leaves of Chenopodium quinoa when coinoculated with BaMV-V genomic RNA. Moreover, both the satBaMV cassette and its sgRNA were encapsidated. From analysis of the SGPs by deletion mutation, we concluded that an SGP contains one core promoterlike sequence (nt -30 through +16), two upstream enhancers (nt -59 through -31 and -91 through -60), and one downstream enhancer (nt +17 through +52), when the transcription initiation site is taken as +1. Site-directed mutagenesis and compensatory mutation to disrupt and restore potential base pairing in the core promoter-like sequence suggest that the stem-loop structure is important for the function of SGP in vivo. Likewise, the insertion of a putative SGP of the BaMV open reading frame 2 gene or a heterologous SGP of potato virus X resulted in generation of an sgRNA. The satBaMV cassette should be a useful tool to gain insight into sequences required for the synthesis of potexvirus sgRNAs.","Lee, Y S; Hsu, Y H; Lin, N S",Journal of virology,522,9

Lessons learned from current vaccine studies, coupled with our increasing knowledge of the host and viral factors involved in viral pathogenesis, will help to increase the speed with which efficacious vaccines targeting newly emerging viral pathogens can be developed.","Gillim-Ross, Laura; Subbarao, Kanta",Clinical microbiology reviews,522,5

On admission, antipsychotic therapy was set up which had the role to reduced delusional and hallucinatory symptoms but the suspiciousness, the presence of magical thought and the closure towards surrounding world that characterize it, combined with the presence of intrusive images, consequently increased the anxiety experiences and negatively affects the establishment of a therapeutic relationship with the operators. During the hospitalization, daily support interviews were carried out: G.B. showed clear difficulty in expressing his own thought contents in presence of more than two operators emerged jointly with the tendency to project different emotional experiences based on the gender of the operator. Following these observations, with the aim to carrying out an intervention that could integrate a psychological approach to the pharmacological therapy in place, a specific personalized support setting was set up, consisting of a female and a male operator. This setting was structured coherently with the therapeutic goals to be achieved: creation of a therapeutic alliance, the integration of the patient's emotional experiences and containing the splitting through the transference analysis. By means of this setting, the patient has obtained a substantial improvement of the splitting framework allowing a better integration of his emotional experiences. At the end of the sessions, G.B. showed more confidence with the medical staff and showed himself to be more aware of his pathological and non-pathological mental states and consequently more adherent to taking drug therapy and to the continuation of post-discharge psychological therapy.","Bachetti, Massimo C; Cirimbilli, Federica; Pierotti, Valentina; Menculini, Giulia; Tortorella, Alfonso; Moretti, Patrizia",Psychiatria Danubina,522,33

To the authors' knowledge, no study has compared these 2 ETTs with each other when the anesthesia provider uses the GlideScope video laryngoscope (Verathon) for intubation. The purpose of the study was to determine if there are differences related to ease of intubation reported by anesthesia providers who use the PFT tube compared with the standard tube while using the GlideScope. The study was a randomized block intervention design. The sample consisted of 58 observed intubations in an operating room setting. Data analysis was completed with a 2-factor analysis of covariance using 2 covariates. The PFT tube in suboptimal conditions demonstrated a significantly greater ease of intubation, as measured by decreased time for ETT insertion and greater ease of ETT insertion score. The number of redirections at the glottis to intubate the trachea once the glottis was visualized was not statistically different. Based on the findings from this study, anesthesia providers may want to consider the use of the PFT tube when using the GlideScope to promote ease of intubation.","Radesic, Brian P; Winkelman, Chris; Einsporn, Richard; Kless, Jack",AANA journal,522,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS The procedure was performed on 2 human cadavers. Retroperitoneal endoscopic left nephrectomy was performed. An extraperitoneal space was established by inflation of a balloon dilator. The external iliac artery and vein were exposed. A Pfannenstiel incision (6 cm) was made and a hand-access device was used. The renal artery was anastomosed to the external iliac artery (end-to-side anastomosis); the renal vein was anastomosed to the external iliac vein (end-to-side anastomosis). The ureter was anastomosed to the bladder with an extravesical tunnelling technique. RESULTS The donor kidney grafts were obtained successfully. The preparation of the external iliac artery and vein was satisfactory. The entire procedure for the renal artery, renal vein, and ureteral anastomoses was performed with laparoscopic technique without any difficulty. CONCLUSIONS The present model on human cadavers may provide a feasible approach for training surgeons to perform human laparoscopic kidney transplant. The present technique may be applied to clinical human kidney transplant.","He, Bulang; Mou, Lingjun; Delriviere, Luc; Hamdorf, Jeffrey",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,522,1

In this video, we describe a novel technique to repair pediatric inguinal hernia using an Endo Close™ suturing device by percutaneous puncture with a single incision. METHODS With a transumbilical approach, a 5-mm trocar is inserted for a 30° laparoscope. A 3-mm incision is made, and the Endo Close™ suturing device (Covidien, Minneapolis, MN, USA), with a 2-0 polypropylene suture retained by the stylet, is inserted perpendicularly to the skin. An extraperitoneal dissection is made on a side the inguinal ring and the needle of the device penetrates the peritoneum through the inferior border. Then, the stylet mechanism is pushed to free the lasso inside the cavity. At the same incision site, the needle of the Endo Close™ is inserted again, but an extraperitoneal dissection is made on the other side of the ring, ensuring that the needle penetrates at the same exit orifice. Now, the suture lasso is recovered and retracted to close the ring. Finally, the suture is extracted and knots are tied extracorporeally at the level of the skin. RESULTS A total of 34 patients (20 females and 14 males) underwent surgery with this procedure. Operative time for unilateral repair was 10-15 and 25-30 min for the bilateral repair (29 unilateral/5 bilateral). The patients experienced minimal postoperative pain. The follow-up period was 12 months with no complications, no recurrence and without cases of postoperative hydrocele. There were no injuries to the structures as vessels or vas deferens, and the esthetic outcome was excellent. CONCLUSIONS The technique presents a simple, safe and reliable method to repair inguinal hernias in children. The long-term results of this novel technique will be evaluated in future studies.","Ordorica-Flores, Ricardo; Figueroa-Portillo, Rubén; Pérez-Escamirosa, Fernando; Lorias-Espinoza, Daniel; Minor-Martínez, Arturo; Olivares-Clavijo, Héctor; Zalles-Vidal, Cristian; Nieto-Zermeño, Jaime",Surgical endoscopy,522,33

Innate immunity can be affected by stressful physiologic events related to hatching and to environmental factors during the first week of life. Exposure to environmental ammonia, foodborne mycotoxins, and suboptimal nutrition can diminish innate immunity. Infectious bursal disease (IBD), chicken infectious anemia (CIA), and Marek's disease (MD) are major infectious diseases that increase susceptibility to viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases and interfere with acquired vaccinal immunity. A shared feature is lymphocytolytic infection capable of suppressing both humoral and cell-mediated immune functions. Enteric viral infections can be accompanied by atrophic and depleted lymphoid organs, but the immunosuppressive features are modestly characterized. Some reoviruses cause atrophy of lymphoid organs and replicate in blood monocytes. Enteric parvoviruses of chickens and turkeys merit further study for immunosuppression. Hemorrhagic enteritis of turkeys has immunosuppressive features similar to IBD. Other virulent fowl adenoviruses have immunosuppressive capabilities. Newcastle disease can damage lymphoid tissues and macrophages. Avian pneumovirus infections impair the mucociliary functions of the upper respiratory tract and augment deeper bacterial infections. Recognition of immunosuppression involves detection of specific diseases using diagnostic tests such as serology, etiologic agent detection, and pathology. Broader measurements of immunosuppression by combined noninfectious and infectious causes have not found general application. Microarray technology to detect genetic expression of immunologic mediators and receptors offers potential advances but is currently at the developmental state. Control methods for immunosuppressive diseases rely largely on minimizing stress, reducing exposure to infectious agents through biosecurity, and increasing host resistance to infectious immunosuppressive diseases by vaccination. A longer-term approach involves genetic selection for resistance to immunosuppressive diseases, which has shown promising results for MD but equivocal results for IBD and CIA.","Hoerr, Frederic J",Avian diseases,522,1

At 48 h PI, short intestinal villi and hypertrophic crypts were noted. In the GALT, complete necrosis of the M cells as well as necrosis of the enterocytes lining the villi above the lymphoid follicules with hypertrophy of the corresponding crypts were observed in all the animals. Five inoculated rabbits had diarrhea three days PI. The presence of RECV particles in the feces of the sick animals and the microscopic lesions observed in the small intestine suggested that the virus was responsible for the clinical signs.

In particular, in the case of patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), concern about SARS-CoV-2 infection added to the burden of symptoms (BS) which already weights on the QoL of these patients. We designed a cross-sectional survey in order to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on status of anxiety, BS and QoL in MPN patients. Methods: We analyzed the anxiety levels using the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS);BS modifications were studied using the 18 items of the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form [MPN-SAF]. Results: 132 people answered to the survey: 27 (20.4%) patients achieved a moderate to marked anxiety index value: this group described a greater worsening of symptoms than the rest of the cohort (p &lt;0.0001). Women showed a higher level of anxiety than men (p = 0.01). A trend for lower level of anxiety was reported by patients who performed habitual physical activity (p = 0.06). A total of 98 (74.2%) patients described worsening of their symptoms during the quarantine period;94 (71.2%) patients had postponed appointments or visits: they showed a significant worsening of their BS (p =0.01). Conclusion: This study first showed that the COVID-19 quarantine had a significant negative impact on the level of anxiety and BS in MPN patients. We identified female gender, absence of physical activity, the need for frequent visit to the hospital and the absence of a direct access to healthcare staff as the main factors associated to a higher anxiety index and worst BS.","Cavalca, F.; Renso, R.; Zambrotta, G.

Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 became available in December, 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing in the UK to gain insights about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era. METHODS: We used an age-structured dynamic transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of UK mass immunisation programmes over 10 years. We compared vaccinating 75% of individuals aged 15 years or older (and annually revaccinating 50% of individuals aged 15-64 years and 75% of individuals aged 65 years or older) to no vaccination. We assumed either 50% vaccine efficacy against disease and 45-week protection (worst-case scenario) or 95% vaccine efficacy against infection and 3-year protection (best-case scenario). Natural immunity was assumed to wane within 45 weeks. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing on vaccination by assuming either an initial lockdown followed by voluntary physical distancing, or an initial lockdown followed by increased physical distancing mandated above a certain threshold of incident daily infections. We considered benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs, both to the health-care payer and the national economy. We discounted future costs and QALYs at 3·5% annually and assumed a monetary value per QALY of £20 000 and a conservative long-run cost per vaccine dose of £15. We explored and varied these parameters in sensitivity analyses. We expressed the health and economic benefits of each scenario with the net monetary value: QALYs × (monetary value per QALY) - costs. FINDINGS: Without the initial lockdown, vaccination, and increased physical distancing, we estimated 148·0 million (95% uncertainty interval 48·5-198·8) COVID-19 cases and 3·1 million (0·84-4·5) deaths would occur in the UK over 10 years. In the best-case scenario, vaccination minimises community transmission without future periods of increased physical distancing, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic with biannual epidemics in the worst-case scenario. Ongoing transmission is also expected in intermediate scenarios with vaccine efficacy similar to published clinical trial data. From a health-care perspective, introducing vaccination leads to incremental net monetary values ranging from £12·0 billion to £334·7 billion in the best-case scenario and from -£1·1 billion to £56·9 billion in the worst-case scenario. Incremental net monetary values of increased physical distancing might be negative from a societal perspective if national economy losses are persistent and large. INTERPRETATION: Our model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Smaller outbreaks could continue even with vaccines, but population-wide implementation of increased physical distancing might no longer be justifiable. Our study provides early insights about possible future post-vaccination scenarios from an economic and epidemiological perspective.

Hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are under discussion as important factors affecting the severity of disease. Air pollution has been considered to play a role in the diffusion of the virus, in the propagation of the contagion, in the severity of symptoms, and in the poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that environmental particulate matter (PM) can trigger inflammatory responses at molecular, cellular, and organ levels, sustaining respiratory, cardiovascular, and dysmetabolic diseases.To better understand the intricate relationships among pre-existing conditions, PM, and viral infection, we examined the response at the molecular level of T47D human breast adenocarcinoma cells exposed to different fractions of PM. T47D cells express several receptors, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and ACE2, the main - but not the only - receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry.PM samples were collected in an urban background site located in the Northern area of the City of Bologna (Emilia-Romagna Region, Northern Italy) during winter 2013. T47D cells were exposed to organic or aqueous (inorganic) extracts at the final concentration of 8 m3 for a 4-hour duration. Both the concentration and the exposure time were chosen to resemble an average outdoor exposure. RNA was extracted from cells, purified and hybridised on 66k microarray slides from Agilent.The lists of differentially expressed genes in PM organic extracts were evaluated by using Metacore, and an enrichment analysis was performed to identify pathways maps, process networks, and disease by biomarkers altered after T47D treatment.The analysis of the modulated genes gave evidence for the involvement of PM in dysmetabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity, and hypertension through the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) canonical pathway.On the basis of current knowledge, existing data, and exploratory experimental evidence, we tease out the likely molecular interplay that can ultimately tip the disease outcome into severity. Looking beyond ACE2, several additional key markers are identified. Disruption of these targets worsens pre-existing conditions and/or exacerbates the adverse effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whilst appropriately designed, epidemiological studies are very much needed to investigate these associations based on our hypothesis of investigation, by reviewing recent experimental and epidemiological evidence, here we speculate and provide new insights on the possible role of environmental pollution in the exacerbation of effects by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. This work is intended to assist in the development of appropriate investigative approaches to protect public health.","Colacci, Annamria; Bortone, Giuseppe; Maffei, Giangabriele; Marchesi, Stefano; Mescoli, Ada; Parmagnani, Federica; Pillo, Gelsomina; Ranzi, Andrea; Rotondo, Francesca; Serra, Stefania; Vaccari, Monica; Zauli Sajani, Stefano; Mascolo, Maria Grazia; Jacobs, Miriam Naomi",Epidemiol Prev,522,0

We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in daycare centres that remained open for key workers' children during a nationwide lockdown in France. METHODS: Children and staff who attended one of 22 daycare centres during a nationwide lockdown in France (between March 15 and May 9, 2020) were included in this cross-sectional, multicentre, seroprevalence study. Hospital staff not occupationally exposed to patients with COVID-19, or to children, were enrolled in a comparator group. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children, daycare centre staff, and the comparator group. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in capillary whole blood was measured with a rapid chromatographic immunoassay. We computed raw prevalence as the percentage of individuals with a positive IgG or IgM test, and used Bayesian smoothing to account for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the assay. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04413968. FINDINGS: Between June 4 and July 3, 2020, we enrolled 327 children (mean age 1·9 [SD 0·9] years; range 5 months to 4·4 years), 197 daycare centre staff (mean age 40 [12] years), and 164 adults in the comparator group (42 [12] years). Positive serological tests were observed for 14 children (raw seroprevalence 4·3%; 95% CI 2·6-7·1) and 14 daycare centre staff (7·7%; 4·2-11·6). After accounting for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the assay, we estimated that 3·7% (95% credible interval [95% CrI] 1·3-6·8) of the children and 6·8% (3·2-11·5) of daycare centre staff had SARS-CoV-2 infection. The comparator group fared similarly to the daycare centre staff; nine participants had a positive serological test (raw seroprevalence 5·5%; 95% CI 2·9-10·1), leading to a seroprevalence of 5·0% (95% CrI 1·6-9·8) after accounting for assay characteristics. An exploratory analysis suggested that seropositive children were more likely than seronegative children to have been exposed to an adult household member with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (six [43%] of 14 vs 19 [6%] of 307; relative risk 7·1 [95% CI 2·2-22·4]). INTERPRETATION: According to serological test results, the proportion of young children in our sample with SARS-CoV-2 infection was low. Intrafamily transmission seemed more plausible than transmission within daycare centres. Further epidemiological studies are needed to confirm this exploratory hypothesis.

Notably, research on the interaction of the two social forms (monogyne and polygyne) of the red imported fire ant (RIFA), Solenopsis invicta Buren, with microbes in its soil habitat is presently limited. In this study, we characterized bacterial microbiomes associated with RIFA nest soils and native (RIFA-negative) soils to better understand the effects of colonization of RIFA on soil microbial communities. Bacterial community fingerprints of 16S rRNA amplicons using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed significant differences in the structure of the bacterial communities between RIFA-positive and RIFA-negative soils at 0 and 10 cm depths. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons provided fine-scale analysis to test for effects of RIFA colonization, RIFA social form, and soil depth on the composition of the bacterial microbiomes of the soil and RIFA workers. Our results showed the bacterial community structure of RIFA-colonized soils to be significantly different from native soil communities and to evidence elevated abundances of several taxa, including Actinobacteria. Colony social form was not found to be a significant factor in nest or RIFA worker microbiome compositions. RIFA workers and nest soils were determined to have markedly different bacterial communities, with RIFA worker microbiomes being characterized by high abundances of a Bartonella-like endosymbiont and Entomoplasmataceae. Cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed the Bartonella sp. to be a novel bacterium.","Travanty, Nicholas V; Vargo, Edward L; Apperson, Charles S; Ponnusamy, Loganathan",,522,16

However, to be classified more favorably in such contexts, an agent may decide to strategically withhold some of her features, such as bad test scores. This is a missing data problem with a twist: which data is missing {\em depends on the chosen classifier}, because the specific classifier is what may create the incentive to withhold certain feature values. We address the problem of training classifiers that are robust to this behavior. We design three classification methods: {\sc Mincut}, {\sc Hill-Climbing} ({\sc HC}) and Incentive-Compatible Logistic Regression ({\sc IC-LR}). We show that {\sc Mincut} is optimal when the true distribution of data is fully known. However, it can produce complex decision boundaries, and hence be prone to overfitting in some cases. Based on a characterization of truthful classifiers (i.e., those that give no incentive to strategically hide features), we devise a simpler alternative called {\sc HC} which consists of a hierarchical ensemble of out-of-the-box classifiers, trained using a specialized hill-climbing procedure which we show to be convergent. For several reasons, {\sc Mincut} and {\sc HC} are not effective in utilizing a large number of complementarily informative features. To this end, we present {\sc IC-LR}, a modification of Logistic Regression that removes the incentive to strategically drop features. We also show that our algorithms perform well in experiments on real-world data sets, and present insights into their relative performance in different settings.","Krishnaswamy, Anilesh K.; Li, Haoming; Rein, David; Zhang, Hanrui; Conitzer, Vincent",,522,9

Ultrasensitive and early identification of infection is critical to prevent widespread COVID-19 infection by presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, especially in the community and in-home settings. We demonstrate a multiplexed, portable, wireless electrochemical platform for ultra-rapid detection of COVID-19: the SARS-CoV-2 RapidPlex. It detects viral antigen nucleocapsid protein, IgM and IgG antibodies, as well as the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein, based on our mass-producible laser-engraved graphene electrodes. We demonstrate ultrasensitive, highly selective, and rapid electrochemical detection in the physiologically relevant ranges. We successfully evaluated the applicability of our SARS-CoV-2 RapidPlex platform with COVID-19 positive and negative blood and saliva samples.

Artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods can be useful to predict the parameters, risks, and effects of such an epidemic. Such predictions can be helpful to control and prevent the spread of such diseases. The main challenges of applying AI is the small volume of data and the uncertain nature. Here, we propose a shallow Long short-term memory (LSTM) based neural network to predict the risk category of a country. We have used a Bayesian optimization framework to optimized and automatically design country-specific networks. We have combined the trend data and weather data together for the prediction. The results show that the proposed pipeline outperforms against state-of-the-art methods for 170 countries data and can be a useful tool for such risk categorization. The tool can be used to predict long-duration outbreak of such an epidemic such that we can take preventive steps earlier.","Pal, Ratnabali; Sekh, Arif Ahmed; Kar, Samarjit; Prasad, Dilip K.",,522,33

This study explored the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and its relationship with quality of life (QOL) in clinically stable patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was an online survey conducted in COVID-19 patients across five designated isolation hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China. Depression and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. RESULTS: A total of 770 participants were included. The prevalence of depression was 43.1% (95%CI: 39.6%-46.6%). Binary logistic regression analysis found that having a family member infected with COVID-19 (OR=1.51, Pâ¯=â¯0.01), suffering from severe COVID-19 infection (OR=1.67, Pâ¯=â¯0.03), male gender (OR=0.53, P<0.01), and frequent social media use to obtain COVID-19 related information (OR=0.65, P<0.01) were independently associated with depression. Patients with depression had lower QOL than those without. CONCLUSION: Depression is highly prevalent in clinically stable patients with COVID-19.

Research, including ours, has shown anti-inflammatory effects of milk-derived EVs, using human breast milk as well as bovine colostrum and store-bought pasteurized cow milk, in in vitro systems as well as therapeutically in animal models. Although it is not completely elucidated which proteins and miRNAs within the milk-derived EVs contribute to these immunosuppressive capacities, one proposed mechanism of action of the EVs is via the modulation of the crosstalk between the (intestinal) microbiome and their host health. There is increasing awareness that the gut plays an important role in many inflammatory diseases. Enhanced intestinal leakiness, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, and bowel inflammation are not only associated with intestinal diseases like colitis and Crohn's disease, but also characteristic for systemic inflammatory diseases such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Strategies to target the gut, and especially its microbiome, are under investigation and hold a promise as a therapeutic intervention for these diseases. The use of milk-derived EVs, either as stand-alone drug or as a drug carrier, is often suggested in recent years. Several research groups have studied the tolerance and safety of using milk-derived EVs in animal models. Due to its composition, milk-derived EVs are highly biocompatible and have limited immunogenicity even cross species. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that milk-derived EVs, when taken up in the gastro-intestinal tract, stay intact after absorption, indicating excellent stability. These characteristics make milk-derived EVs very suitable as drug carriers, but also by themselves, these EVs already have a substantial immunoregulatory function, and even without loading, these vesicles can act as therapeutics. In this review, we will address the immunomodulating capacity of milk-derived EVs and discuss their potential as therapy for RA patients. Review criteria: The search terms ""extracellular vesicles"", ""exosomes"", ""microvesicles"", ""rheumatoid arthritis"", ""gut-joint axis"", ""milk"", and ""experimental arthritis"" were used.

We develop a five-state model for COVID-19, taking into account the unique features of the novel coronavirus, with key parameters determined by the government reports and mathematical optimization. Tests using data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran indicate that the model is capable of generating accurate prediction of the daily accumulated number of confirmed cases and is entirely suitable for real-time prediction. The drastically disparate testing and diagnostic standards/policies among different countries lead to large variations in the estimated parameter values such as the duration of the outbreak, but such uncertainties have little effect on the occurrence time of the inflection point as predicted by the model, indicating its reliability and robustness. Model prediction for Italy suggests that insufficient government action leading to a large fraction of undocumented infection plays an important role in the abnormally high mortality in that country. With the data currently available from United Kingdom, our model predicts catastrophic epidemic scenarios in the country if the government did not impose strict travel and social distancing restrictions. A key finding is that, if the percentage of undocumented infection exceeds a threshold, a non-negligible hidden population can exist even after the the epidemic has been deemed over, implying the likelihood of future outbreaks should the currently imposed strict government actions be relaxed. This could make COVID-19 evolving into a long-term epidemic or a community disease a real possibility, suggesting the necessity to conduct universal testing and monitoring to identify the hidden individuals.","Long, Yong-Shang; Zhai, Zheng-Meng; Han, Li-Lei; Kang, Jie; Li, Yi-Lin; Lin, Zhao-Hua; Zeng, Lang; Wu, Da-Yu; Hao, Chang-Qing; Tang, Ming; Liu, Zonghua; Lai, Ying-Cheng",,522,23

In the primary analysis, we compared IS patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (IS-COVID) discharged April 1-July 31, 2020 to pre-COVID IS patients discharged in 2019 (IS controls). In a secondary analysis, we compared a matched cohort of IS-COVID patients to patients within the IS controls who had pneumonia (IS-PNA), created with inverse-probability-weighting (IPW). RESULTS: In the primary analysis, we included 166,586 IS controls and 2086 IS-COVID from 312 hospitals in 46 states. Compared to IS controls, IS-COVID were less likely to have hypertension, dyslipidemia, or be smokers, but more likely to be male, younger, have diabetes, obesity, acute renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, venous thromboembolism, intubation, and comorbid intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage (all p&lt;0.05).

METHODOLOGY: A qualitative study of phenomenological research design was used to describe the experiences of 10 Chinese nurses. Data were collected in February 2020 through in-depth interviews and analyzed by conventional content analysis methods. RESULTS: Chinese nurses experienced different psychological stages, work pressure, and challenges. New concepts of nursing also emerged during their clinical care for COVID-19 patients. DISCUSSION: The guidance synthesized from the Chinese nurse stories could give specific direction for a well-prepared global nursing workforce and high-quality patient care in the present and future epidemics. The worries about discrimination of COVID-19 patients' needs to be addressed culturally and emotionally as a priority by health care workers when they care for COVID-19 patients.","He, Qilian; Li, Ting; Su, Yunpeng; Luan, Yuquan",J Transcult Nurs,522,12

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic placed significant strain on hospital resources, and management has shifted towards an out-patient-centred approach. METHODS: A five-month single-centre retrospective study was undertaken of all epistaxis patients managed by the ENT department. A pre-coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic group was managed with pre-existing guidelines, compared to new guidelines for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic group. A telephone survey was performed on out-patients with non-dissolvable packs to assess patient comfort and satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 142 patients were seen. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic group had significantly more patients aged over 65 years (p = 0.004), an increased use of absorbable dressings and local haemostatic agents (Nasopore and Surgiflo), and fewer admissions (all p < 0.0005). Rates of re-presentation and morbidity, and length of hospital stay were similar. The telephone survey revealed out-patient management to be efficacious and feasible. CONCLUSION: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has shifted epistaxis management towards local haemostatic agents and out-patient management; this approach is as safe and effective as previously well-established regimens.","Devabalan, Y; Cereceda-Monteoliva, N; Lorenz, H; Magill, J C; Unadkat, S; Ferguson, M; Rennie, C",J Laryngol Otol,522,23

We retrospectively evaluated the clinical utility of this strategy to detect postpartum glucose intolerance evaluated by OGTT after delivery. Two hundred and seventy-five Japanese women with gestational diabetes were included in the present study. The specificity of 1-month postpartum random plasma glucose and HbA1c combined with pre-pregnancy body mass index to predict postpartum glucose intolerance was 98.0%, with a negative predictive value of 72.6%. However, sensitivity was 6.4%, with a positive predictive value of 55.6%.

Real-time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic errors in reporting. Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of empirical parameters, which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a master variable, and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic reproduction number, the size of the susceptible population, and the infection rate can be determined. In the SIR model, we derive an explicit single variable differential equation for the evolution of the cumulative number of fatalities. We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and Hubei Province, China follows this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship with the logistic growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the basic reproduction number is less than $2.3$. This condition is valid for the outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the separation policy of the infected. For more complex models, with more internal variables, such as the SEIR model, the equations derived from the SIR model remain valid approximately, due to the separation of timescales.","Vattay, Gabor",Phys. biol,522,16

We aimed to explore a refined stratification mode based on the integrated analysis of ctDNA tracking. METHODS: ctDNA was prospectively collected at baseline and every eight weeks in advanced treatment-naïve EGFR-mutant LUAD patients under gefitinib treatment enrolled in a phase II trial, and analyzed using next-generation sequencing of a 168-gene panel. RESULTS: Three subgroups categorized by baseline co-mutations: EGFR-sensitizing mutations (59, 32.8%), EGFR-sensitizing mutations with tumor suppressor mutations (97, 53.9%) and EGFR-sensitizing mutations with other driver mutations (24, 13.3%), exhibited distinct progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [PFS 13.2 (11.3-15.2) vs. 9.3 (7.6-10.5) vs. 4.0 (2.4-9.3) months; OS 32.0 (29.2-41.5) vs. 21.7 [(19.3-27.0) vs. 15.5 (10.5-33.7) months], providing evidence for initial stratification. 63.7% of the patients achieved week-8 ctDNA-clearance, with significant difference among three subgroups (74.5% vs. 64.0% vs. 29.4%, P=0.004, fisher's exact test). Patients without week-8 ctDNA-clearance had worse PFS [clearance vs. non-clearance 11.2 (9.9-13.2) vs. 7.4 (5.6-9.6) months, P=0.016, cox regression], especially in the second subgroup [5.8 (5.6-11.5) months], suggesting the necessity of adaptive stratification during treatment. During follow-up, 56.0% and 20.8% of the patients eventually harbored p.T790M and non-p.T790M mutations, with significant difference in non-p.T790M mutations among three subgroups (7.5% vs. 15.7% vs. 80.0%, P<0.001, fisher's exact test), giving clues to post-line treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The patients with baseline co-mutations and ctDNA non-clearance at first visit might require combined therapy due to limited survival benefit of EGFR-TKI monotherapy. We proposed a refined stratification mode for the whole-course management of EGFR-mutant LUAD.","Duan, Jianchun; Xu, JiaChen; Wang, Zhijie; Bai, Hua; Cheng, Ying; An, Tongtong; Gao, Hongjun; Wang, Kai; Zhou, Qing; Hu, Yanping; Song, Yong; Ding, Cuimin; Peng, Feng; Liang, Li; Hu, Yi; Huang, Cheng; Zhou, Caicun; Shi, Yuankai; Han, Jiefei; Wang, Di; Tian, Yanhua; Yang, Zhenlin; Zhang, Li; Chuai, Shaokun; Ye, Junyi; Zhu, Guanshan; Zhao, Junhui; Wu, Yi-Long; Wang, Jie",J. thorac. oncol,522,14

Data sources: We conducted searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), grey literature, and in a centralized repository in L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence). L·OVE is a platform that maps PICO questions to evidence from the Epistemonikos database. In response to the COVID-19 emergency, L·OVE was adapted to expand the range of evidence it covers and customized to group all COVID-19 evidence in one place. All the searches covered the period until 23 April 2020 (one day before submission). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods: We adapted an already published standard protocol for multiple parallel systematic reviews to the specificities of this question. We searched for randomized trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of cell-based therapies versus placebo or no treatment in patients with COVID-19. Anticipating the lack of randomized trials directly addressing this question, we also searched for trials evaluating other coronavirus infections, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and nonrandomized studies in COVID-19. Two reviewers independently screened each study for eligibility. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will resubmit this review to a peer-reviewed journal every time the conclusions change or whenever there are substantial updates. Results: We screened 1 043 records, but no study was considered eligible. We identified 61 ongoing studies, including 39 randomized trials evaluating different types of cell-based therapies in COVID-19. Conclusions: We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria, and hence there is no evidence to support or refute the use of cell-based therapies for treating patients with COVID-19. A substantial number of ongoing studies should provide valuable evidence to inform researchers and decision-makers in the near future.

This study explored the experiences and perspectives of volunteer contact tracers in order to identify facilitators, challenges, and novel solutions for implementing COVID-19 contact tracing. METHODS: As part of a study to evaluate an emergently established volunteer contact tracing program for COVID-19 in New Haven, Connecticut, April-June 2020, we conducted focus groups with 36 volunteer contact tracers, thematically analyzed the data, and synthesized the findings using the RE-AIM implementation framework. RESULTS: To successfully reach cases and contacts, participants recommended identifying clients' outreach preferences, engaging clients authentically, and addressing sources of mistrust. Participants felt that the effectiveness of successful isolation and quarantine was contingent on minimizing delays in reaching clients and on systematically assessing and addressing their nutritional, financial, and housing needs. They felt that successful adoption of a volunteer-driven contact tracing model depended on the ability to recruit self-motivated contact tracers and provide rapid training and consistent, supportive supervision. Participants noted that implementation could be enhanced with better management tools, such as more engaging interview scripts, user-friendly data management software, and protocols for special situations and populations. They also emphasized the value of coordinating outreach efforts with other involved providers and agencies. Finally, they believed that long-term maintenance of a volunteer-driven program requires monetary or educational incentives to sustain participation. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to qualitatively examine implementation of a volunteer-run COVID-19 contact tracing program. Participants identified facilitators, barriers, and potential solutions for improving implementation of COVID-19 contact tracing in this context. These included standardized communication skills training, supportive supervision, and peer networking to improve implementation, as well as greater cooperation with outside agencies, flexible scheduling, and volunteer incentives to promote sustainability.","Shelby, Tyler; Hennein, Rachel; Schenck, Christopher; Clark, Katie; Meyer, Amanda J; Goodwin, Justin; Weeks, Brian; Bond, Maritza; Niccolai, Linda; Davis, J Lucian; Grau, Lauretta E",PLoS One,522,1

In this study, we compared long-term oncologic outcomes after NSM between patients with a TND &#8804; 1 cm and those with a TND > 1 cm. METHODS: Overall, 1369 patients with primary breast cancer who underwent NSM with immediate reconstruction from March 2003 to December 2015 were included for analysis. After propensity score matching, 495 patients with a TND &#8804; 1 cm (group A) and 495 patients with a TND > 1 cm (group B) on imaging were selected to compare long-term oncologic outcomes. RESULTS: After matching, the median follow-up periods for surviving patients were 109 months and 112 months for groups A and B, respectively. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to the 5-year cumulative local recurrence (8.1% vs. 6.3%; p = 0.268), NAC recurrence (5.1% vs. 2.8%; p = 0.072), regional recurrence (2.0% vs. 3.6%; p = 0.125), or distant recurrence (5.9% vs. 4.8%; p = 0.480) rates.

We present a case of complications secondary to COVID 19 in a patient with BHD syndrome. A 55 year old male presented with fevers, chills and left sided pleuritic chest discomfort for 1 day. He was recently hospitalized for bacterial pneumonia and had COVID Pneumonia about 5 weeks ago. The patient was diagnosed with a lung bulla several months ago and is awaiting elective surgical resection. Vitals showed blood pressure 135/91 mmHg, temperature 36.5 Celsius, heart rate 74 and respiratory rate 18. Physical exam significant for decreased breath sounds of the left lower lobe. Labs showed white cell count 10.7 K/mcL, D-dimer 0.81 mcg/mL, lactic acid 0.7 mmol/L. SARS COV 2 PCR positive. Chest Xray showed left lower lobe multilobulated cavitary mass. CT Angiography Chest showed air-fluid level development within pre-existing large multiseptated bulla in the left lower lobe and dependently layering left pleural effusion (Figure 1). The patient was initiated on Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam on admission. Thoracentesis was unable to be done due to low amount of pleural fluid. Patient stabilized with antibiotic treatment and supportive care, with subsequent discharge on a 2 week course of Piperacillin-Tazobactam. Diagnosis of BHD involves one or more of the following: greater than 2 or more fibrofolliculomas or trichodiscomas, multiple bilateral pulmonary cysts in the basilar lung regions, bilateral multifocal renal carcinomas or oncocytic renal tumors, pathogenic FLCN gene variant or family history of the disease [4]. Initial presentation of these patients is often via spontaneous pneumothorax. 70%-80% of BHD patients develop numerous, bilateral pulmonary cysts with majority having normal pulmonary function or mild obstructive disease [3,4]. On imaging, these thin-walled, irregularly shaped cysts are seen in the medial basilar lung regions. This is in contrast to the apical region air blebs seen in those patients with pneumothorax due to COPD or primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Our patient is unique in that he had recently developed COVID 19 Pneumonia with a superimposed bacterial pneumonia. The patient's previously known bullae became infected with subsequent abscess formation. To our knowledge, this is the first known case of Birt Hogg Dube Syndrome complicated by pulmonary cyst infection and abscess formation.","Sunny, A.

The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Streptococcus pneumoniae u-Ag testing in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, in order to assess whether pneumococcal co-infection is associated with different mortality rate and hospital stay in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Charts, protocols, mortality, and hospitalization data of a consecutive series of COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in northern Italy during COVID-19 outbreak were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent Streptococcus pneumoniae u-Ag testing to detect an underlying pneumococcal co-infection. Covid19+/u-Ag+ and Covid19+/u-Ag- patients were compared in terms of overall survival and length of hospital stay using chi-square test and survival analysis. RESULTS: Out of 575 patients with documented pneumonia, 13% screened positive for the u-Ag test. All u-Ag+ patients underwent treatment with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin or Levofloxacin. Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Darunavir/Cobicistat were added in 44 patients, and hydroxychloroquine and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in 47 and 33 patients, respectively. All u-Ag+ patients were hospitalized. Mortality was 15.4% and 25.9% in u-Ag+ and u-Ag- patients, respectively (p = 0.09). Survival analysis showed a better prognosis, albeit not significant, in u-Ag+ patients. Median hospital stay did not differ among groups (10 vs. 9 days, p = 0.71). CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of Streptococcus pneumoniae u-Ag testing helped to better target antibiotic therapy with a final trend of reduction in mortality of u-Ag+ COVID-19 patients having a concomitant pneumococcal infection.

In April 2020, the US FDA exercised enforcement discretion for the temporary use of inpatient CGM during the pandemic, thus hospitals were presented the opportunity to implement this technology. METHODS: We sought to investigate the accuracy of CGM in hospitalized patients on general care floors and the intensive care unit (ICU) in attempts to decrease healthcare professional exposure to COVID-19 and ultimately improve glycemic management of patients affected by COVID-19. Point of care (POC) and laboratory (Lab) glucose values were matched with simultaneous CGM glucose values and measures of accuracy were performed to evaluate the safety and usability of CGM in this population. Our data are presented drawing a distinction between POC and Lab as reference glucose sources. RESULTS: In 808 paired samples obtained from 28 patients (10 ICU, 18 general floor), overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) for all patients using either POC or Lab as reference was 13.2%. When using POC as the reference glucose MARD was 13.9% and using Lab glucose as reference 10.9%. Using both POC and Lab reference glucose pairs the overall MARD for critical care patients was 12.1% and for general floor patients 14%. CONCLUSION: We determined, with proper protocols and safeguards in place, use of CGM in the hospitalized patient is a reasonable alternative to standard of care to achieve the goal of reducing healthcare professional exposure. Further study is necessary to validate safety, accuracy, and efficacy of this technology. Investigation and analysis are necessary for the development of protocols to utilize CGM trend arrows, alerts, and alarms.","Longo, Rebecca Rick; Elias, Heather; Khan, Mehvish; Seley, Jane Jefferie",J Diabetes Sci Technol,522,17

A compound library of 288 Schiff bases was designed based on compound 10, and a pharmacophore search was performed. Structural analysis of the top scoring hits and a docking study were used to select the best derivatives for the synthesis. Chemical synthesis and structural elucidation of compounds 16a–h were discussed. The antiproliferative activity of 16a–h was evaluated against three cancer (MCF7, A2780 and HT29, IC(50) = 0.01–40.50 μM) and one normal MRC5 (IC(50) = 1.27–24.06 μM) cell lines using the MTT assay. The results revealed the highest antiproliferative activity against MCF7 cells for 16g (IC(50) = 0.01 μM) with an exceptionally high selectivity index of (SI = 578). Cell cycle analysis of MCF7 cells treated with compound 16g revealed a cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M phase. In addition, compound 16g induced a dose-dependent increase in apoptotic events in MCF7 cells compared to the control. In silico target prediction of compound 16g showed six potential targets that could mediate these activities. Molecular docking analysis of compound 16g revealed high binding affinities toward COX-2, MAP P38α, EGFR, and CDK2. The results of the MD simulation revealed low RMSD values and high negative binding free energies for the two complexes formed between compound 16g with EGFR, and CDK2, while COX-2 was in the third order. These results highlighted a great potentiality for 16g to inhibit both CDK2 and EGFR.

Here, we report the results of a natural experiment where 29 ferrets in one home had prolonged, direct contact and constant environmental exposure to two humans with symptomatic COVID-19. We observed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to ferrets based on RT-PCR and ELISA. To better understand this discrepancy in experimental and natural infection in ferrets, we compared SARS-CoV-2 sequences from natural and experimental mustelid infections and identified two surface glycoprotein (Spike) mutations associated with mustelids. While we found evidence that ACE2 provides a weak host barrier, one mutation only seen in ferrets is located in the novel S1/S2 cleavage site and is computationally predicted to decrease furin activity. These data support that host factors interacting with the novel S1/S2 cleavage site may be a barrier in ferret SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and that domestic ferrets are at low risk of natural infection from currently circulating SARS-CoV-2. This may be overcome in laboratory settings using concentrated viral inoculum, but the effects of ferret host-adaptations require additional investigation.","Sawatzki, Kaitlin; Hill, Nichola; Puryear, Wendy; Foss, Alexa; Stone, Jonathon; Runstadler, Jonathan",bioRxiv,522,20

Clinical presentations and differential diagnosis for pneumonia in the solid organ transplant recipient are reviewed. A two‐tier approach is proposed based on the net state of immunosuppression and the severity of presentation. With a lower risk of opportunistic, hospital‐acquired, or exposure‐specific pathogens and a non‐severe presentation, empirical therapy may be initiated under close clinical observation. In all other patients, or those not responding to the initial therapy, a more aggressive diagnostic approach including sampling of tissue for microbiological and pathological testing is warranted. Given the broad range of potential pathogens, a microbiological diagnosis is often key for optimal care. Given the limited literature comparatively evaluating diagnostic approaches to pneumonia in the solid organ transplant recipient, much of the proposed diagnostic algorithm reflects clinical experience rather than evidence‐based data. It should serve as a template which may be modified according to local needs. The same holds true for the suggested empiric therapies, which need to be adapted to the local resistance patterns. Further study is needed to comparatively evaluate diagnostic and empiric treatment strategies in SOT recipients.","Dulek, Daniel E.; Mueller, Nicolas J.",Clin Transplant,522,21

So far, a systematic evaluation of death certificates of COVID-19-associated deaths of residents in inpatient nursing homes has not been presented. METHODS: Death certificates of all deaths in Munich in the death period from 1 March to 31 July 2020 were analyzed. Inclusion criteria were the presence of “Corona, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2” on the death certificates. Standardized, anonymized data entry was performed. The collected data were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 5840 persons died, 281 (4.8%) of whom died of confirmed COVID-19 disease. Of those, 72 deaths involved residents of Munich nursing facilities. The most frequent causes of death were respiratory insufficiency (54 cases) and multiple organ failure (9 cases). On the death certificates, an average of two preexisting diseases had been reported; the average age at death was 88 years. All deaths of nursing home residents occurred in association with nosocomial COVID-19 outbreaks, which affected one-third of the facilities. The vast majority of these homes did not have a COVID-19 hygiene plan in place at the time. DISCUSSION: One quarter of all COVID-19 deaths in Munich occurred in the context of nosocomial outbreaks in elderly, chronically ill residents of nursing facilities. Evidence of inadequate risk assessment and inadequate hygiene management emerged. In the opinion of the authors, the appropriate structures for adequate hygiene management must be created and a hygiene regulation must be issued in which the tasks and responsibilities of the facility operators are defined.","Gleich, Sabine; Turlik, Verena; Schmidt, Susann; Wohlrab, Doris",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,522,5

Its genome encodes accessory genes that differ significantly within coronaviruses and contribute to the virus pathogenicity. Among accessory genes, open reading frame 8 (ORF8) stands out by being highly variable and showing structural changes suspected to be related with the virus ability to spread. However, the function of ORF8 remains to be elucidated, making it less studied than other SARS-CoV-2 genes. Here I show that ORF8 is poorly conserved among related coronaviruses. The ORF8 phylogeny built using 11,113 SARS-CoV-2 sequences revealed traces of a typical expanding population with a small number of highly frequent lineages. Interestingly, I detected several nonsense mutations and three main deletions in the ORF8 gene that either remove or significantly change the ORF8 protein. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can persist without a functional ORF8 protein. Deletion breakpoints were found located in predicted hairpins suggesting a possible involvement of these elements in the rearrangement process. Although the function of ORF8 remains to be elucidated, its structural plasticity and high diversity suggest an important role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity.","Pereira, Filipe",Infect Genet Evol,522,1

Nevertheless, concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We introduce a complex extension of the model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to optimize vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage, vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only partial immunity, and—importantly—some develop antibody-dependent enhancement, which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes (associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications. The model is intended to facilitate decision making by exploring ranges of parameters rather than to be fitted by empirical data. We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer. Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer, disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A coverage of 75%–80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic contact reductions. CONCLUSIONS: With the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high levels of immunization need to be reached before next year’s flu season, and vaccination strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management.","Adil Mahmoud Yousif, Nessma; Tsoungui Obama, Henri Christian Junior; Ngucho Mbeutchou, Yvan Jordan; Kwamou Ngaha, Sandy Frank; Kayanula, Loyce; Kamanga, George; Ibrahim, Toheeb Babatunde; Bwanu Iliya, Patience; Iyanda, Sulyman; Alawam Nemer, Looli; Helle, Kristina Barbara; Teboh-Ewungkem, Miranda Ijang; Schneider, Kristan Alexander",PLoS One,522,0

There has been drug-repurposing research focusing on traditional medicines. Concomitantly, many researchers tried to find in silico evidence for traditional medicines. There is a great increase in article publication to commensurate the new-found research interests. This situation inspired the authors to have a comprehensive understanding of the multitude of publications related to the COVID-19 pandemic with a wish to get promising drug leads. MAIN BODY: This review article has been conceived and made as a hybrid of the review of the selected papers advertised recently and produced in the interest of the COVID-19 situation, and in silico work done by the authors. The outcome of the present review underscores a recommendation for thorough MDS analyses of the promising drug leads. The inclusion of in silico work as an addition to the review was motivated by a recently published article of Toelzer and colleagues. The in silico investigation of free fatty acids is novel to the field and it buttresses the further MDS analysis of drug leads for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The review performed threw light on the need for MDS analyses to be considered together with the application of other in silico methods of prediction of pharmacologic properties directing towards the sites of drug-receptor regulation.

These small membrane proteins assemble into oligomers that can permeabilize cellular lipid bilayers, disrupting the physiology of the host to the advantage of the virus. Consequently, efforts during the last few decades have been focused towards the discovery of viroporin channel inhibitors, but in general these have not been successful to produce licensed drugs. Viroporins are also involved in viral pathogenesis by engaging in critical interactions with viral proteins, or disrupting normal host cellular pathways through coordinated interactions with host proteins. These protein-protein interactions (PPIs) may become alternative attractive drug targets for the development of antivirals. In this sense, while thus far most antiviral molecules have targeted viral proteins, focus is moving towards targeting host proteins that are essential for virus replication. In principle, this largely would overcome the problem of resistance, with the possibility of using repositioned existing drugs. The precise role of these PPIs, their strain- and host- specificities, and the structural determination of the complexes involved, are areas that will keep the fields of virology and structural biology occupied for years to come.

METHODS: In-depth interviews (N = 21) were conducted with sex workers in Chicago. Transcripts of individual interviews were analyzed in Dedoose using rapid content analysis. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 32.7 years; 45% identified as White, 20% as Black, 15% as Latinx, and 20% as multiple races; 80% identified as Queer. A total of 52% of participants identified as cisgender women, 33% as transgender or gender fluid, 10% as cisgender men, and 5% declined to answer. Themes of self-management practices, stigmatizing and culturally unsafe experiences with healthcare providers, and the prohibitive cost of healthcare emerged as consistent barriers to routinely accessing healthcare. Despite identifying patient-centered care as a desired healthcare model, many participants did not report receiving care that was respectful or culturally responsive. Themes also included developing strategies to identify sex worker-safe care providers, creating false self-narratives and health histories in order to safely access care, and creating self-care routines that serve as alternatives to primary care. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate how patient-centered care for sex-workers in Chicago might include holistic wellness exercises, accessible pay scales for services, and destigmatizing healthcare praxis. Focus on culturally safe healthcare provision presents needs beyond individualized, or even community-level, interventions. Ongoing provider training and inbuilt, systemic responsivity to patient needs and contexts is crucial to patient-centered care.","Singer, Randi Beth; Johnson, Amy K.; Crooks, Natasha; Bruce, Douglas; Wesp, Linda; Karczmar, Alexa; Mkandawire-Valhmu, Lucy; Sherman, Susan",PLoS One,522,18

Healthcare workers with less than one year of work experience have been reported to cause the most incidents, and the most common incident is “drug-related”. However, few studies have comprehensively analyzed incidents in dentistry, and the characteristics of dental incidents have not been understood. In this study, to understand the characteristics of dental incidents, we comprehensively analyzed 1291 incident reports submitted to the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Dental Hospital from April 2014 to March 2019. As a result, dental outpatient and dental wards had different types of incidents. In outpatient wards, incidents included many dentistry-specific incidents related to “procedures”. Among them, “poor physical condition of the patient during dental treatment” was the most common incident. In contrast, the most common incident from subjects with less than one year of work experience was “damage to soft tissues around the teeth”. Thus, to improve the quality and safety in dentistry, it is was considered necessary to analyze and understand the characteristics of dentistry-specific incidents and to take appropriate measures and educate dental professionals.","Kimura, Yasuyuki; Tonami, Ken-ichi; Toyofuku, Akira; Nitta, Hiroshi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,522,28

Many patients need care in hospital wards and intensive care units (ICU). Head & neck cancers (HNC) are in a special condition in this pandemic. The main treatment in these patients is surgery. Most of these patients need care in the ICU, which is reduced in capacity in pandemic conditions. It's important to note that delays in the surgery of these patients make them non-operable and on the other hand increase mortality and morbidity. Numerous non-surgical alternative therapies have been proposed in these conditions, but there are fundamental questions about these suggestions. 1 How long should we look for alternative therapies? Because many countries are facing a second wave of the disease. 2 What's the effect of these alternative therapies and the delay in starting standard treatments in patients' survival? Different countries have different financial resources; many countries, patients face restrictions on receiving alternative therapies to standard treatments, and in non-pandemic conditions, long queues are given for non-surgical treatments such as chemo-radiotherapy. There are numerous guidelines to guide head and neck surgeons to the best choice in this situation. It seems that different countries have to make individual decisions based on the prevalence of COVID-19 and the financial resources and facilities of the health care system. In this review article, we have collected the opinions of world-renowned guidelines and institutions on how to treat HNCs during the pandemic.","Salari, Abolfazl; Jalaeefar, Amirmohsen; Shirkhoda, Mohammad",Am J Otolaryngol,522,16

Inefficient viral clearance at any stage is a hallmark of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Disease severity is associated with increases in peripheral blood cytokines among which interleukin 10 (IL-10) increases particularly early and independent of patient age, which is not seen in active SARS-CoV infection. Here, we consider the known multi-faceted immune regulatory role of IL-10, both in protecting the lung from injury and in defense against infections, as well as its potential cellular source. While the absence of an IL-10 response in SARS is thought to contribute to early deterioration, we suspect IL-10 to protect the lung from early immune-mediated damage and to interfere with viral clearance in COVID-19. This may further both viral spread and poor outcome in many high-risk patients. Identifying the features of the viral genotype, which specifically underlie the different IL-10 dynamics as an etiological endotype and the different viral load kinetics and outcomes as clinical phenotype, may unveil a new immune evasive strategy of SARS-CoV-2.","Lindner, Holger A.; Velásquez, Sonia Y.; Thiel, Manfred; Kirschning, Thomas",Front Immunol,522,30

Currently, no FDA-approved antiviral is available for the treatment of EV-A71 infections. The flavonoid silymarin was shown to exert virucidal effects, but the binding site on the capsid was unknown. In this study, the ligand interacting site of silymarin was determined in silico and validated in vitro. Moreover, the potential of EV-A71 to develop resistance against silymarin was further evaluated. Molecular docking of silymarin with the capsid of EV-A71 indicated that silymarin binds to viral protein 1 (VP1) of EV-A71, specifically at the GH loop of VP1. The in vitro binding of silymarin with VP1 of EV-A71 was validated using recombinant VP1 through ELISA competitive binding assay. Continuous passaging of EV-A71 in the presence of silymarin resulted in the emergence of a mutant carrying a substitution of isoleucine by threonine (I97T) at position 97 of the BC loop of EV-A71. The mutation was speculated to overcome the inhibitory effects of silymarin. This study provides functional insights into the underlying mechanism of EV-A71 inhibition by silymarin, but warrants further in vivo evaluation before being developed as a potential therapeutic agent.","Lalani, Salima; Masomian, Malihe; Poh, Chit Laa",Int J Mol Sci,522,20

Hence, innovative tools are needed to early detect health issues, including cognitive decline. Several clinical studies show that it is possible to identify cognitive impairment based on the locomotion patterns of the elderly. In this work, we investigate the use of sensor data and deep learning to recognize those patterns in instrumented smart-homes. In order to get rid of the noise introduced by indoor constraints and activity execution, we introduce novel visual feature extraction methods for locomotion data. Our solution relies on locomotion trace segmentation, image-based extraction of salient features from locomotion segments, and vision-based deep learning. We carried out extensive experiments with a large dataset acquired in a smart-home test bed from 153 seniors, including people with cognitive diseases. Results show that our system can accurately recognize the cognitive status of the senior, reaching a macro-[Formula: see text] score of 0.873 for the three categories that we target: cognitive health, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. Moreover, an experimental comparison shows that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","Zolfaghari, Samaneh; Khodabandehloo, Elham; Riboni, Daniele",Cognit Comput,522,8

This study uses a sample of 9581 vaccine-related tweets in the period 1 January 2019 to 5 April 2019. The time period is of the essence because during this time, a measles outbreak was prevalent throughout the United States and a public debate was raging. Sentiment analysis is applied to the sample, clustering the data into topics using the term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) technique. The analyses suggest that most (about 77%) of the tweets focused on the search for new/better vaccines for diseases such as the Ebola virus, human papillomavirus (HPV), and the flu. Of the remainder, about half concerned the recent measles outbreak in the United States, and about half were part of ongoing debates between supporters and opponents of vaccination against measles in particular. While these numbers currently suggest a relatively small role for vaccine misinformation, the concept of herd immunity puts that role in context. Nevertheless, going forward, health experts should consider the potential for the increasing spread of falsehoods that may get firmly entrenched in the public mind.","Raghupathi, Viju; Ren, Jie; Raghupathi, Wullianallur",Int J Environ Res Public Health,522,16

Acutely hospitalized persons in the days to weeks leading up to the general election are exceptionally vulnerable to voter disenfranchisement and not among the population typically discussed during election seasons. As residents in the Christiana Care Family Medicine Residency Program in Wilmington, Delaware, we organized an emergency ballot registration and absentee voting project for hospitalized patients in our community hospital during the days to weeks leading up to the 2020 general election. We experienced multiple challenges to registering and aiding patients with ballot applications, including but not limited to communication with an overworked New Castle County elections office and coordination of receiving and returning completed ballots. However, we did notice a positive trend in the number of patients acutely hospitalized in the days-weeks leading up to Election Day who had already cast their vote through the expanded mail-in voting campaign in the setting of the COVID19 pandemic. As physicians, we have a unique position and opportunity to not only educate patients and potential voters on voter registration, but also assist these members of our community in the registration process first-hand. In addition to these physician responsibilities, we feel strongly that the state of Delaware should continue the expansion of mail-in/absentee voting for all residents in addition to new initiatives such as extended voter registration period and early in-person voting.","Chamberlain, Carly; Jaime, Henrique; Wohler, Diana",Dela J Public Health,522,13
