170536,Quantitative monitoring of nucleotide sequence data from genetic resources in context of their citation in the scientific literature,2021-05-10,"A pandemic is capable of generating a great impact, not only from the point of view of health, but also socioeconomically. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that a new pandemic situation had arisen, due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, whose probable origin was zoonotic. The largest number of cases of this disease is concentrated in the United States of America (USA), India, and Brazil. The mortality rate is estimated at 3.4%, but regional differences may exist, and places with a high demographic density have become true epicentres and may be related to higher rates of transmission. In addition to the above, lower human development indexes (HDI) can be related to worse outcomes, especially in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil since they are the least developed places. The Northeast region is the second-most-affected place in the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazil. An analytical observational study of an ecological type was carried out from April to October 2020 to assess the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in the state of Sergipe and specifically to analyse the incidence of cases and deaths resulting from COVID-19 in the different health regions of the state of Sergipe, in relation to the values of the HDI and demographic density. During the study period, 84,325 cases of COVID-19 were identified, in which 2205 resulted in death. In most of the regions studied, there was a positive association between the number of cases and deaths and the greater the demographic density, but there was no increase in the risk of becoming ill, nor of dying the lower the HDI. Large and crowded cities are places of greatest vulnerability to illness, due to their greater capacity of transmitting the virus;however, further studies are needed to identify other factors that are decisive in the outcomes of this new disease.","Fonseca, Larissa M.; Sousa, Derijuli S. de Cardoso Juliana C.; Severino, Patricia Cano Amanda Souto Eliana B.; Lima, Sônia O.; Oliveira, Cristiane C.

This study aims to synthesize ecofriendly graphene oxide gold nanocomposites for sensing of ferritin biomarker, which is vital for diagnosing anemia as well as severe COVID conditions. Herein, an affordable and label free technique was proposed for detection of ferritin. The graphene oxide gold nanocomposites are synthesized by a simple one pot chemical reaction utilizing natural reducing agents. The alterations in the optical spectral characteristics of graphene gold nanocomposites upon interaction with the Fe3+ ions as well as ferritin protein are investigated. The proposed label free technique achieved a limit of detection of 1 μM for Fe3+ ions and 1 μg/ml for Ferritin protein.","Muthu Meenakshi, M.; Annasamy, Gowri Sankaranarayanan Mugesh",Materials Letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2021.130446,931
182860,New nucleotide sequence data on the EMBL File Server,1991-09-11,"Effectors are a key part of the arsenal of plant pathogenic fungi and promote pathogen virulence and disease. Effectors typically lack sequence similarity to proteins with known functional domains and motifs, limiting our ability to predict their functions and understand how they are recognised by plant hosts. As a result, cross-disciplinary approaches involving structural biology and protein biochemistry are often required to decipher and better characterise effector function. These approaches are reliant on high yields of relatively pure protein, which often requires protein production using a heterologous expression system. For some effectors, establishing an efficient production system can be difficult, particularly those that require multiple disulfide bonds to achieve their naturally folded structure. Here, we describe the use of a co-expression system within the heterologous host E. coli termed CyDisCo (cytoplasmic disulfide bond formation in E. coli) to produce disulfide bonded fungal effectors. We demonstrate that CyDisCo and a naturalised co-expression approach termed FunCyDisCo (Fungi-CyDisCo) can significantly improve the production yields of numerous disulfide bonded effectors from diverse fungal pathogens. The ability to produce large quantities of functional recombinant protein has facilitated functional studies and crystallisation of several of these reported fungal effectors. We suggest this approach could be useful when investigating the function and recognition of a broad range of disulfide-bond containing effectors.","Yu, Daniel S.; Outram, Megan A.; Crean, Emma; Smith, Ashley; Sung, Yi-Chang; Darma, Reynaldi; Sun, Xizhe; Ma, Lisong; Jones, David A.; Solomon, Peter S.; Williams, Simon J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.31.458447,931

Wearing face masks, sanitizing, and maintaining social distance has been the new normal since the outbreak. As the Corona virus enters our bodies through the mouth and nose, covering those areas can help us to protect ourselves from the virus to some extent. Although vaccination and medications are issued for this disease, WHO states that wearing masks and following Covid protocols should be continued. After the first wave has reached to a control and vaccination started, public has started neglecting face mask and social distancing. This resulted in a massive spread of the second wave, over which some populated countries are losing control. Henceforth, wearing a mask will highly help in preventing the transmission of the disease. This project helps the detection of faces with and without mask from live video streams. By making use of packages like TensorFlow, SciPy, OpenCV, Keras the implementation is done. The model used for face detection is MTCNN. The overall idea of developing this project is to implement an embedded model, which can detect faces from video streams and generate a valid classification of faces with/without mask. This model will be useful for the public surveillances and insist people to put on their masks and prevent the spread of dangerous corona virus.

182868,New nucleotide sequence data on the EMBL File Server,1990-02-11,"Epidemics are among the most costly and destructive natural hazards globally. To reduce the impacts of infectious disease outbreaks, the development of a risk index for infectious diseases can be effective, by shifting infectious disease control from emergency response to early detection and prevention. In this study, we introduce a methodology to construct and validate an epidemic risk index using only open data, with a specific focus on scalability. The external validation of our risk index makes use of distance sampling to correct for underreporting of infections, which is often a major source of biases, based on geographical accessibility to health facilities. We apply this methodology to assess the risk of dengue in the Philippines. The results show that the computed dengue risk correlates well with standard epidemiological metrics, i.e. dengue incidence (p = 0.002). Here, dengue risk constitutes of the two dimensions susceptibility and exposure. Susceptibility was particularly associated with dengue incidence (p = 0.047) and dengue case fatality rate (CFR) (p = 0.029). Exposure had lower correlations to dengue incidence (p = 0.211) and CFR (p = 0.163). Highest risk indices were seen in the south of the country, mainly among regions with relatively high susceptibility to dengue outbreaks. Our findings reflect that the modelled epidemic risk index is a strong indication of sub-national dengue disease patterns and has therefore proven suitability for disease risk assessments in the absence of timely epidemiological data. The presented methodology enables the construction of a practical, evidence-based tool to support public health and humanitarian decision-making processes with simple, understandable metrics. The index overcomes the main limitations of existing indices in terms of construction and actionability. Author summary Why Was This Study Done? – Epidemics are among the most costly and destructive natural hazards occurring globally; currently, the response to epidemics is still focused on reaction rather than prevention or preparedness. – The development of an epidemic risk index can support identifying high-risk areas and can guide prioritization of preventive action and humanitarian response. – While several frameworks for epidemic risk assessment exist, they suffer from several limitations, which resulted in limited uptake by local health actors - such as governments and humanitarian relief workers - in their decision-making processes What Did the Researchers Do and Find? – In this study, we present a methodology to develop epidemic risk indices, which overcomes the major limitations of previous work: strict data requirements, insufficient geographical granularity, validation against epidemiological data. – We take as a case study dengue in the Philippines and develop an epidemic risk index; we correct dengue incidence for underreporting based on accessibility to healthcare and show that it correlates well with the risk index (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.69, p-value 0.002). What Do These Findings Mean? – Our methodology enables the development of disease-specific epidemic risk indices at a sub-national level, even in countries with limited data availability; these indices can guide local actors in programming prevention and response activities. – Our findings on the case study show that the epidemic risk index is a strong indicator of sub-national dengue disease patterns and is therefore suitable for disease risk assessments in the absence of timely and complete epidemiological data.","Hierink, Fleur; Margutti, Jacopo; van den Homberg, Marc; Ray, Nicolas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.23.432447,931
182869,New nucleotide sequence data on the EMBL File Server.,1992-09-11,"Abstract Intelligent data-driven machinery health identification has been attracting increasing attention in the manufacturing industries, due to reduced maintenance cost and enhanced operation safety. Despite the successful development, the main limitation of most existing methods lies in the assumption that the training and testing data are collected from the same distribution, i.e. the same machine under identical condition. However, this assumption is difficult to be met in the real industries, since the diagnostic model is generally expected to be applied on new machines. In order to address this issue, a deep learning-based cross-machine health identification method is proposed for industrial vacuum pumps, which are of great importance in the manufacturing industry but have received far less research attention in the literature. Generalized diagnostic features can be learnt using the proposed domain adaptation technique with maximum mean discrepancy metric. The health identification model learnt from the training machines can be well applied on new machines. Experiments on a real-world vacuum pump dataset validate the proposed method, which is promising for industrial applications.","Ainapure, Abhijeet; Li, Xiang; Singh, Jaskaran; Yang, Qibo; Lee, Jay",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920316012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920316012,931

Here, pheophorbide a (Pba) was identified as a highly active antiviral molecule against HCoV-229E after bioguided fractionation of plant extracts. The antiviral activity of Pba was subsequently shown for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, and its mechanism of action was further assessed, showing that Pba is an inhibitor of coronavirus entry by directly targeting the viral particle. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of Pba depends on light exposure, and Pba was shown to inhibit virus-cell fusion by stiffening the viral membrane as demonstrated by cryo-electron microscopy. Moreover, Pba was shown to be broadly active against several other enveloped viruses, and reduced SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV replication in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Pba is the first described natural antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 with direct photosensitive virucidal activity that holds potential for COVID-19 therapy or disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces.","Meunier, Thomas; Desmarets, Lowiese; Bordage, Simon; Bamba, Moussa; Hervouet, Kévin; Rouillé, Yves; François, Nathan; Decossas, Marion; Bi, Fézan Honora Tra; Lambert, Olivier; Dubuisson, Jean; Belouzard, Sandrine; Sahpaz, Sevser; Séron, Karin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.09.451770,931

Methods In this interrupted time series of population-based nationwide cross-sectional studies, data from nasopharyngeal testing and questionnaires were used to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 RNA prevalence and factors associated with test positivity over the 1st year of the COVID-19 epidemic. The study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN10182320. Results Between April 23, 2020 and February 2, 2021, results were available from 34,915 individuals and 27,870 samples from 11 consecutive studies. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 decreased from 0.27% (95% CI 0.10% - 0.59%) in April to 0.04% (95% CI 0.00% - 0.22%) by the end of May and remained very low (0.01%, 95% CI 0.00% - 0.17%) until the end of August, followed by an increase since November (0.37%, 95% CI 0.18% - 0.68%) that escalated to 2.69% (95% CI 2.08% - 2.69%) in January 2021.

Due to critical illness, > 70% of patients with severe COVID-19 receive empiric antibacterial or antifungal therapy, along with standard anti-COVID-19 treatments. However, the frequency of proven or probable secondary infections is < 10%. To our knowledge, there are no studies evaluating co-infections in patients with cancer and COVID-19, a vulnerable group with multiple risk factors for co-infections. We aim to describe the prevalence of bacterial, viral, and fungal co-infections, identify risk factors for coinfection, and investigate the potential impact of co-infections on mortality, in patients with a history of cancer and COVID-19. Methods: The CCC19 registry (NCT04354701) includes patients with active or prior hematologic or invasive solid malignancies reported across academic and community sites. We captured bacterial, fungal, or viral coinfections diagnosed within ±2 weeks from diagnosis of COVID-19, identified factors associated with an increased risk of having a coinfection, and evaluated the association of coinfections with 30-day all-cause mortality. Results: We examined 6732 patients with a history of cancer and a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 reported to CCC19 by 82 sites between March 17, 2020 and February 3, 2021, with complete data on coinfection status. Median age was 65 (interquartile range: 55-75) years with 48% male, 52% non-Hispanic white, 19% non-Hispanic black, and 16% Hispanic. 5448 (81%) had solid tumors and 1466 (22%) had hematologic malignancies. Bacterial infections were reported in 823 patients (12%), including 296 Gram+ and 245 Gram- bacterial events. Documented viral (176 patients, 3%) and fungal (59 patients, 0.9%) co-infections were rare. The risk for co-infections increased with age, and they were more frequent among men, older patients, and those with diabetes, pulmonary or renal comorbid conditions, active progressive cancer, or hematologic malignancies (unadjusted P< 0.01). The frequency of reported co-infections decreased over the study period (divided into quartiles, Mantel-Haenszel P< 0.01). All-cause mortality rates were higher among those with bacterial (24% vs. 10%), viral (22% vs. 12%), and fungal (37% vs. 12%) coinfections compared to those without (unadjusted P< 0.01). Conclusions: The frequency of bacterial infections in patients with cancer and COVID-19 is relatively low. Viral and fungal co-infections are uncommon. Coinfections are associated with higher mortality rates. Several patient and tumor factors can be used for risk stratification and guide early empiric antimicrobial agent selection, which may improve clinical outcomes.

182899,New nucleotide sequence data on the EMBL File Server,1991-11-11,"Quarantining close contacts of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 10 to 14 days is a key strategy in reducing transmission. However, quarantine requirements are often unpopular, with low adherence, especially when a large fraction of the population has been vaccinated. Daily contact testing (DCT), in which contacts are required to isolate only if they test positive, is an alternative to quarantine for mitigating the risk of transmission from traced contacts. In this study, we developed an integrated model of COVID-19 transmission dynamics and compared the strategies of quarantine and DCT with regard to reduction in transmission and social/economic costs (days of quarantine/self-isolation). Specifically, we compared 10-day quarantine to 7 days of self-testing using rapid lateral flow antigen tests, starting 3 days after exposure to a case. We modelled both incomplete adherence to quarantine and incomplete adherence to DCT. We found that DCT reduces transmission from contacts with similar effectiveness, at much lower social/economic costs, especially for highly vaccinated populations. The findings were robust across a spectrum of scenarios with varying assumptions on the speed of contact tracing, sensitivity of lateral flow antigen tests, adherence to quarantine and uptake of testing. Daily tests would also allow rapid initiation of a new round of tracing from infected contacts.","Ferretti, L.; Wymant, C.; Nurtay, A.; Zhao, L.; Hinch, R.; Bonsall, D.; Kendall, M.; Masel, J.; Bell, J.; Hopkins, S.; Kilpatrick, A.

182901,New nucleotide sequence data on the EMBL File Server,1990-06-11,"Background: Minority ethnic groups and immigrants have been hit disproportionally hard by COVID-19 in many developed countries, including Norway. Most transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 occur in households. Methods: Using individual-level registry data of all Norwegian residents we compared infections across all multi-person households. A household with at least one member born abroad was defined as an immigrant household. For the subset of households where at least one person tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from August 1st 2020 to May 1st 2021, we calculated secondary attack rates (SARs) as the percent of other household members testing positive within 14 days after the first household member tested positive. Logistic regression model was used to adjust for sex, age, household composition and geography. Results: Among all multi-person households in Norway (n=1 421 642), immigrant households (n=341 604) comprised more members on average (3.2) than households with only Norwegian-born members (2.8). The share of immigrant households where at least one member had been tested, was 56% (vs 49% in the households with only Norwegian-born members), and the share where at least one member was infected was 3.7% (vs 1.4% in households with only Norwegian-born members). Secondary attack rates were higher in immigrant (32%) than Norwegian-born households (20%). Results differed considerably by country of birth, with secondary attack rates particularly high in households from Syria, Iraq, Turkey, and Pakistan, also after adjustment for sex, age, household composition and geography. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 is more frequently introduced into multi-person immigrant households than into households with only Norwegian-born members, and transmission within the household occurs more frequently in immigrant households. The results are likely related to living conditions, family composition or differences in social interaction, emphasizing the need to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into these vulnerable households.","Methi, F.; Hart, R.

In the light of current lockdowns and quarantines due to the COVID-19 telerehabilitation can be considered as the second-best option after rehab centers for stroke patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate the in-home telerehabilitation system prototype which introduces a state-of-the-art telerehabilitation solution with two extra features that are not currently available with other solutions;a communication module that connects the patient and the therapist remotely using a client-side application and an admin-side dashboard and the second feature is the variable motion-range setter, this option allows setting a certain percentage of a whole range of motion of an exercise based on the condition of the patient. The prototype application has 8 exercises targeting different parts of the body such as the ankle, hip, knee, and shoulder. With a controlled group of healthy male participants, a pilot study was designed to test the accuracy, error rate, recall, and other matrices of the developed system. The testing consisted of 50 repetitions of each exercise where 40 reps were performed as they should be performed, and the last 10 reps were performed to detect false positives. A confusion matrix was used to evaluate the performance of each exercise and the average of all the matrix is taken to get an overall performance result for the prototype. A sample of the results is included as the summary of results. The overall outcome is mostly positive and promising for most exercises, except for one exercise which was consistently on the lower spectrum of accuracy. After repositioning the Kinect to get the full body in the frame, the system performed consistently well on all exercises. © 2021 IEEE.","Islam, A.; Tsun, M. T. K.; Theng, L.

182904,New nucleotide sequence data on the EMBL File Server,1990-09-25,"Vaccination is a common and efficient means to reduce the mortality and morbidity of emerging infectious diseases. Among responders, injected antigen induces acquired immunity pathways and leads to the final production of antigen-specific antibodies. The whole process may take weeks to months, depending on the antigen. Typically, seroconversion to influenza vaccine is expected after one month with a responder rate of ~50%. An early biomarker to predict response is desirable. Peripheral blood gene expression (or transcript abundance, TA) datasets in the public domain were analyzed for early biomarkers among responders. As peripheral blood samples (such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC) are cell mixture samples containing various blood cell-types (leukocyte subpopulations, LS). We first develop a model that enables the determination of TA in B lymphocytes of certain genes directly in PBMC samples without the need of prior cell isolation. These genes are called B cell informative genes. Then a ratio of two B cell informative genes (a target gene and a stably expressed reference gene) measured in PBMC was used as a new biomarker to gauge the target gene expression in B lymphocytes. This method having an obvious advantage over conventional methods by eliminating the tedious procedure of cell sorting and enables directly determining TA of a leukocyte subpopulation in cell mixture samples is called Direct LS-TA method. By using a B lymphocyte-specific gene such as TNFRSF17 or TXNDC5 as target genes with either TNFRSF13C or FCRLA as reference genes, the B cell biomarkers were determined directly in PBMC which was highly correlated with TA of target genes in purified B lymphocytes. These Direct LS-TA biomarkers in PBMC increased significantly early after vaccination in both the discovery dataset and a meta-analysis of 7 datasets. Responders had almost a 2-fold higher Direct LS-TA biomarker level of TNFRSF17 (SMD=0.84, 95% CI=0.47-1.21 after log2). And Direct LS-TA biomarkers of TNFRSF17 and TXNDC5 measured at day 7 predict responder with sensitivity values of higher than 0.7. The Area-under curves (AUC) in receiver operation curve (ROC) analysis were over 0.8. Here, we report a straightforward approach to directly analyses B lymphocyte gene expression in PBMC, which could be used in a routine clinical setting as it avoids the labor-intensive procedures of B lymphocyte isolation. And the method allows the practice of precision medicine in the prediction of vaccination response. Furthermore, response to vaccination could be predicted as early as on day 7. As vaccination response is based on the similar acquired immunology pathway in the upcoming worldwide vaccination campaign against COVID-19, these biomarkers could also be useful to predict seroconversion for individuals.","Huang, Dan; Liu, Alex YN; Leung, K.S.; Tang, Nelson LS",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.29.424767,931
