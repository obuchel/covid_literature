106,106,106,DNA Vaccines against Protozoan Parasites: Advances and Challenges,12.449604,6.279516,2007-06-24,"Over the past 15 years, DNA vaccines have gone from a scientific curiosity to one of the most dynamic research field and may offer new alternatives for the control of parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. We review here some of the advances and challenges for the development of DNA vaccines against these diseases. Many studies have validated the concept of using DNA vaccines for both protection and therapy against these protozoan parasites in a variety of mouse models. The challenge now is to translate what has been achieved in these models into veterinary or human vaccines of comparable efficacy. Also, genome-mining and new antigen discovery strategies may provide new tools for a more rational search of novel vaccine candidates.","Dumonteil, Eric",J Biomed Biotechnol,71,1
304,304,304,The early diversification of influenza A/H1N1pdm,12.883876,6.624068,2009-11-12,"Background Since its initial detection in April 2009, the A/H1N1pdm influenza virus has spread rapidly in humans, with over 5,700 human deaths. However, little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of H1N1pdm and its geographic and temporal diversification. Methods Phylogenetic analysis was conducted upon the concatenated coding regions of whole-genome sequences from 290 H1N1pdm isolates sampled globally between April 1 – July 9, 2009, including relatively large samples from the US states of Wisconsin and New York. Results At least 7 phylogenetically distinct viral clades have disseminated globally and co-circulated in localities that experienced multiple introductions of H1N1pdm. The epidemics in New York and Wisconsin were dominated by two different clades, both phylogenetically distinct from the viruses first identified in California and Mexico, suggesting an important role for founder effects in determining local viral population structures. Conclusions Determining the global diversity of H1N1pdm is central to understanding the evolution and spatial spread of the current pandemic, and to predict its future impact on human populations. Our results indicate that H1N1pdm has already diversified into distinct viral lineages with defined spatial patterns.","Nelson, Martha; Spiro, David; Wentworth, David; Fan, Jiang; Beck, Eric; St. George, Kirsten; Ghedin, Elodie; Halpin, Rebecca; Bera, Jayati; Hine, Erin; Proudfoot, Kathleen; Stockwell, Tim; Lin, Xudong; Griesemer, Sara; Bose, Michael; Jurgens, Lisa; Kumar, Swati; Viboud, Cecile; Holmes, Edward; Henrickson, Kelly",PLoS Curr,71,1
369,369,369,DNA Vaccines: Developing New Strategies against Cancer,12.613835,6.288676,2010-03-28,"Due to their rapid and widespread development, DNA vaccines have entered into a variety of human clinical trials for vaccines against various diseases including cancer. Evidence that DNA vaccines are well tolerated and have an excellent safety profile proved to be of advantage as many clinical trials combines the first phase with the second, saving both time and money. It is clear from the results obtained in clinical trials that such DNA vaccines require much improvement in antigen expression and delivery methods to make them sufficiently effective in the clinic. Similarly, it is clear that additional strategies are required to activate effective immunity against poorly immunogenic tumor antigens. Engineering vaccine design for manipulating antigen presentation and processing pathways is one of the most important aspects that can be easily handled in the DNA vaccine technology. Several approaches have been investigated including DNA vaccine engineering, co-delivery of immunomodulatory molecules, safe routes of administration, prime-boost regimen and strategies to break the immunosuppressive networks mechanisms adopted by malignant cells to prevent immune cell function. Combined or single strategies to enhance the efficacy and immunogenicity of DNA vaccines are applied in completed and ongoing clinical trials, where the safety and tolerability of the DNA platform are substantiated. In this review on DNA vaccines, salient aspects on this topic going from basic research to the clinic are evaluated. Some representative DNA cancer vaccine studies are also discussed.","Fioretti, Daniela; Iurescia, Sandra; Fazio, Vito Michele; Rinaldi, Monica",J Biomed Biotechnol,71,1
399,399,399,Human Pregnancy Specific Beta-1-Glycoprotein 1 (PSG1) Has a Potential Role in Placental Vascular Morphogenesis,12.782546,6.2683606,2010-07-01,"Previous studies suggest that human pregnancy specific beta-1-glycoproteins (PSGs) play immunomodulatory roles during pregnancy; however, other possible functions of PSGs have yet to be explored. We have observed that PSGs induce transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1), which among its other diverse functions inhibits T-cell function and has proangiogenic properties. The present study investigates a potential role for PSG1, the most abundant PSG in maternal serum, as a possible inducer of proangiogenic growth factors known to play an important role in establishment of the vasculature at the maternal-fetal interface. To this end, we measured TGFB1, vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) A and C, and placental growth factor (PGF) protein levels in several cell types after PSG1 treatment. In addition, tube formation and wound healing assays were performed to investigate a possible direct interaction between PSG1 and endothelial cells. PSG1 induced up-regulation of both TGFB1 and VEGFA in human monocytes, macrophages, and two human extravillous trophoblast cell lines. We did not observe induction of VEGFC or PGF by PSG1 in any of the cells tested. PSG1 treatment resulted in endothelial tube formation in the presence and absence of VEGFA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to map the essential regions within the N-domain of PSG1 required for functional activity. We found that the aspartic acid at position 95, previously believed to be required for binding of PSGs to cells, is not required for PSG1 activity but that the amino acids implicated in the formation of a salt bridge within the N-domain are essential for PSG1 function.","Ha, Cam T.; Wu, Julie A.; Irmak, Ster; Lisboa, Felipe A.; Dizon, Anne M.; Warren, James W.; Ergun, Suleyman; Dveksler, Gabriela S.",Biology of Reproduction,71,11
443,443,443,A Systematic Molecular Pathology Study of a Laboratory Confirmed H5N1 Human Case,12.627778,6.758344,2010-10-12,"Autopsy studies have shown that human highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) can infect multiple human organs other than just the lungs, and that possible causes of organ damage are either viral replication and/or dysregulation of cytokines and chemokines. Uncertainty still exists, partly because of the limited number of cases analysed. In this study, a full autopsy including 5 organ systems was conducted on a confirmed H5N1 human fatal case (male, 42 years old) within 18 hours of death. In addition to the respiratory system (lungs, bronchus and trachea), virus was isolated from cerebral cortex, cerebral medullary substance, cerebellum, brain stem, hippocampus ileum, colon, rectum, ureter, aortopulmonary vessel and lymph-node. Real time RT-PCR evidence showed that matrix and hemagglutinin genes were positive in liver and spleen in addition to positive tissues with virus isolation. Immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization stains showed accordant evidence of viral infection with real time RT-PCR except bronchus. Quantitative RT-PCR suggested that a high viral load was associated with increased host responses, though the viral load was significantly different in various organs. Cells of the immunologic system could also be a target for virus infection. Overall, the pathogenesis of HPAI H5N1 virus was associated both with virus replication and with immunopathologic lesions. In addition, immune cells cannot be excluded from playing a role in dissemination of the virus in vivo.","Gao, Rongbao; Dong, Libo; Dong, Jie; Wen, Leying; Zhang, Ye; Yu, Hongjie; Feng, Zijian; Chen, Minmei; Tan, Yi; Mo, Zhaojun; Liu, Haiyan; Fan, Yunyan; Li, Kunxiong; Li, Chris Ka-Fai; Li, Dexin; Yang, Weizhong; Shu, Yuelong",PLoS One,71,11

This zoonosis is entirely preventable, but by focusing solely upon rabies prevention in humans, this “incurable wound” persists at high costs. Although preventing human deaths through canine rabies elimination is feasible, dog rabies control is often neglected, because dogs are not considered typical economic commodities by the animal health sector. Here, we demonstrate that the responsibility of managing rabies falls upon multiple sectors, that a truly integrated approach is the key to rabies elimination, and that considerable progress has been made to this effect. Achievements include the construction of global rabies networks and organizational partnerships; development of road maps, operational toolkits, and a blueprint for rabies prevention and control; and opportunities for scaling up and replication of successful programs.

Vitis trifolia (Family: Vitaceae) is commonly known as Fox grape in English; Amlabel, Ramchana in Hindi and Amlavetash in Sanskrit. It is native to India, Asia and Australia. It is a perennial climber having trifoliated leaves with 2-3 cm long petioles and ovate to oblong-ovate leaflets. Flowers are small greenish white and brown in color. Fruits are fleshy, juicy, dark purple or black, nearly spherical, about 1 cm in diameter. It is found throughout the hills in India. This perennial climber is also found in the hotter part of India from Jammu and Rajasthan to Assam extending into the peninusular India upto 600 m height. Whole plant of Cayratia trifolia has been reported to contain yellow waxy oil, steroids/terpenoids, flavonoids, tannins upon preliminary phytochemical screening. Leaves contain stilbenes (piceid, reveratrol, viniferin, ampelopsin). Stem, leaves, roots are reported to possess hydrocyanic acid, delphinidin and several flavonoids such as cyanidin is reported in the leaves. This plant also contains kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin, triterpenes and epifriedelanol. Infusion of seeds along with extract of tubers is traditionally given orally to diabetic patients to check sugar level of blood. Paste of tuberous is applied on the affected part in the treatment of snake bite. Whole plant is used as diuretic, in tumors, neuralgia and splenopathy. Its climbers wrapped around the neck of frantic bullock and poultice of leaves are used to yoke sores of bullock. The bark extract shows the antiviral, antibacterial, antiprotozoal, hypoglycemic, anticancer and diuretic activity. This article focuses on the upgraded review on chemical and biological properties of Cayratia trifolia Linn. and triggers further investigation on this plant.","Kumar, Dinesh; Kumar, Sunil; Gupta, Jyoti; Arya, Renu; Gupta, Ankit",Pharmacogn Rev,71,1
826,826,826,Macroevolutionary Immunology: A Role for Immunity in the Diversification of Animal life,12.807337,6.5490193,2012-03-12,"An emerging picture of the nature of immune systems across animal phyla reveals both conservatism of some features and the appearance among and within phyla of novel, lineage-specific defense solutions. The latter collectively represent a major and underappreciated form of animal diversity. Factors influencing this macroevolutionary (above the species level) pattern of novelty are considered and include adoption of different life styles, life histories, and body plans; a general advantage of being distinctive with respect to immune defenses; and the responses required to cope with parasites, many of which afflict hosts in a lineage-specific manner. This large-scale pattern of novelty implies that immunological phenomena can affect microevolutionary processes (at the population level within species) that can eventually lead to macroevolutionary events such as speciation, radiations, or extinctions. Immunologically based phenomena play a role in favoring intraspecific diversification, specialization and host specificity of parasites, and mechanisms are discussed whereby this could lead to parasite speciation. Host switching – the acquisition of new host species by parasites – is a major mechanism that drives parasite diversity and is frequently involved in disease emergence. It is also one that can be favored by reductions in immune competence of new hosts. Mechanisms involving immune phenomena favoring intraspecific diversification and speciation of host species are also discussed. A macroevolutionary perspective on immunology is invaluable in today’s world, including the need to study a broader range of species with distinctive immune systems. Many of these species are faced with extinction, another macroevolutionary process influenced by immune phenomena.","Loker, Eric S.",Front Immunol,71,1
884,884,884,Comparative analysis of mycobacterium and related actinomycetes yields insight into the evolution of mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis,12.785872,6.5467257,2012-03-28,"BACKGROUND: The sequence of the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strain H37Rv has been available for over a decade, but the biology of the pathogen remains poorly understood. Genome sequences from other Mtb strains and closely related bacteria present an opportunity to apply the power of comparative genomics to understand the evolution of Mtb pathogenesis. We conducted a comparative analysis using 31 genomes from the Tuberculosis Database (TBDB.org), including 8 strains of Mtb and M. bovis, 11 additional Mycobacteria, 4 Corynebacteria, 2 Streptomyces, Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, Nocardia farcinia, Acidothermus cellulolyticus, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bifidobacterium longum. RESULTS: Our results highlight the functional importance of lipid metabolism and its regulation, and reveal variation between the evolutionary profiles of genes implicated in saturated and unsaturated fatty acid metabolism. It also suggests that DNA repair and molybdopterin cofactors are important in pathogenic Mycobacteria. By analyzing sequence conservation and gene expression data, we identify nearly 400 conserved noncoding regions. These include 37 predicted promoter regulatory motifs, of which 14 correspond to previously validated motifs, as well as 50 potential noncoding RNAs, of which we experimentally confirm the expression of four. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of protein evolution highlights gene families that are associated with the adaptation of environmental Mycobacteria to obligate pathogenesis. These families include fatty acid metabolism, DNA repair, and molybdopterin biosynthesis. Our analysis reinforces recent findings suggesting that small noncoding RNAs are more common in Mycobacteria than previously expected. Our data provide a foundation for understanding the genome and biology of Mtb in a comparative context, and are available online and through TBDB.org.","McGuire, Abigail Manson; Weiner, Brian; Park, Sang Tae; Wapinski, Ilan; Raman, Sahadevan; Dolganov, Gregory; Peterson, Matthew; Riley, Robert; Zucker, Jeremy; Abeel, Thomas; White, Jared; Sisk, Peter; Stolte, Christian; Koehrsen, Mike; Yamamoto, Robert T; Iacobelli-Martinez, Milena; Kidd, Matthew J; Maer, Andreia M; Schoolnik, Gary K; Regev, Aviv; Galagan, James",BMC Genomics,71,1
1027,1027,1027,A novel strategy for efficient production of anti-V3 human scFvs against HIV-1 clade C,12.630282,6.4510455,2012-11-15,"BACKGROUND: Production of human monoclonal antibodies that exhibit broadly neutralizing activity is needed for preventing HIV-1 infection, however only a few such antibodies have been generated till date. Isolation of antibodies by the hybridoma technology is a cumbersome process with fewer yields. Further, the loss of unstable or slowly growing clones which may have unique binding specificities often occurs during cloning and propagation and the strongly positive clones are often lost. This has been avoided by the process described in this paper, wherein, by combining the strategy of EBV transformation and recombinant DNA technology, we constructed human single chain variable fragments (scFvs) against the third variable region (V3) of the clade C HIV-1 envelope. RESULTS: An antigen specific phage library of 7000 clones was constructed from the enriched V3- positive antibody secreting EBV transformed cells. By ligation of the digested scFv DNA into phagemid vector and bio panning against the HIV-1 consensus C and B V3 peptides followed by random selection of 40 clones, we identified 15 clones that showed V3 reactivity in phage ELISA. DNA fingerprinting analysis and sequencing showed that 13 out of the 15 clones were distinct. Expression of the positive clones was tested by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. All the 13 anti-V3 scFvs showed cross-reactivity against both the clade C and B V3 peptides and did not show any reactivity against other unrelated peptides in ELISA. Preliminary neutralization assays indicated varying degrees of neutralization of clade C and B viruses. EBV transformation, followed by antigen selection of lines to identify specific binders, enabled the selection of phage from un-cloned lines for scFv generation, thus avoiding the problems of hybridoma technology. Moreover, as the clones were pretested for antigen binding, a comparatively small library sufficed for the selection of a considerable number of unique antigen binding phage. After selection, the phage clones were propagated in a clonal manner. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy can be efficiently used and is cost effective for the generation of diverse recombinant antibodies. This is the first study to generate anti-V3 scFvs against HIV-1 Clade C.","Kumar, Rajesh; Andrabi, Raiees; Tiwari, Ashutosh; Prakash, Somi Sankaran; Wig, Naveet; Dutta, Durgashree; Sankhyan, Anurag; Khan, Lubina; Sinha, Subrata; Luthra, Kalpana",BMC Biotechnol,71,11
1244,1244,1244,In Vitro Infection of Pupae with Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus Suggests Disturbance of Transcriptional Homeostasis in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera),12.537857,6.6339226,2013-09-05,"The ongoing decline of honey bee health worldwide is a serious economic and ecological concern. One major contributor to the decline are pathogens, including several honey bee viruses. However, information is limited on the biology of bee viruses and molecular interactions with their hosts. An experimental protocol to test these systems was developed, using injections of Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) into honey bee pupae reared ex-situ under laboratory conditions. The infected pupae developed pronounced but variable patterns of disease. Symptoms varied from complete cessation of development with no visual evidence of disease to rapid darkening of a part or the entire body. Considerable differences in IAPV titer dynamics were observed, suggesting significant variation in resistance to IAPV among and possibly within honey bee colonies. Thus, selective breeding for virus resistance should be possible. Gene expression analyses of three separate experiments suggest IAPV disruption of transcriptional homeostasis of several fundamental cellular functions, including an up-regulation of the ribosomal biogenesis pathway. These results provide first insights into the mechanisms of IAPV pathogenicity. They mirror a transcriptional survey of honey bees afflicted with Colony Collapse Disorder and thus support the hypothesis that viruses play a critical role in declining honey bee health.","Boncristiani, Humberto F.; Evans, Jay D.; Chen, Yanping; Pettis, Jeff; Murphy, Charles; Lopez, Dawn L.; Simone-Finstrom, Michael; Strand, Micheline; Tarpy, David R.; Rueppell, Olav",PLoS One,71,28

We investigated micropolymorphisms at position 156 of HLA-A(*)24 allotypes and their effects on PLC dependence for assembly and peptide binding specificities. HLA-A(*)24:06(156Trp) and HLA-A(*)24:13(156Leu) showed high levels of cell surface expression while HLA-A(*)24:02(156Gln) was expressed at low levels in tapasin deficient cells. Peptides presented by these allelic variants showed distinct differences in features and repertoire. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated all the HLA-A(*)24/156 variants to associate at similar levels with tapasin when present. Structurally, HLA-A(*)24:02 contains the residue triad Met97/His114/Gln156 and a Trp156 or Leu156 polymorphism provides tapasin independence by stabilizing these triad residues, thus generating an energetically stable and a more peptide receptive environment. Micropolymorphisms at position 156 can influence the generic peptide loading pathway for HLA-A(*)24 by altering their tapasin dependence for peptide selection. The trade-off for this tapasin independence could be the presentation of unusual ligands by these alleles, imposing significant risk following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).","Badrinath, Soumya; Kunze-Schumacher, Heike; Blasczyk, Rainer; Huyton, Trevor; Bade-Doeding, Christina",J Immunol Res,71,1
1758,1758,1758,Merging Economics and Epidemiology to Improve the Prediction and Management of Infectious Disease,12.905278,6.4752254,2014-09-19,"Mathematical epidemiology, one of the oldest and richest areas in mathematical biology, has significantly enhanced our understanding of how pathogens emerge, evolve, and spread. Classical epidemiological models, the standard for predicting and managing the spread of infectious disease, assume that contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals depend on their relative frequency in the population. The behavioral factors that underpin contact rates are not generally addressed. There is, however, an emerging a class of models that addresses the feedbacks between infectious disease dynamics and the behavioral decisions driving host contact. Referred to as “economic epidemiology” or “epidemiological economics,” the approach explores the determinants of decisions about the number and type of contacts made by individuals, using insights and methods from economics.

2000,2000,2000,Modeling the effect of comprehensive interventions on Ebola virus transmission,12.518055,6.694243,2015-10-30,"Since the re-emergence of Ebola in West Africa in 2014, comprehensive and stringent interventions have been implemented to decelerate the spread of the disease. The effectiveness of interventions still remains unclear. In this paper, we develop an epidemiological model that includes various controlling measures to systematically evaluate their effects on the disease transmission dynamics. By fitting the model to reported cumulative cases and deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia until March 22, 2015, we estimate the basic reproduction number in these countries as 1.2552, 1.6093 and 1.7994, respectively. Model analysis shows that there exists a threshold of the effectiveness of isolation, below which increasing the fraction of latent individuals diagnosed prior to symptoms onset or shortening the duration between symptoms onset and isolation may lead to more Ebola infection. This challenges an existing view. Media coverage plays a substantial role in reducing the final epidemic size. The response to reported cumulative infected cases and deaths may have a different effect on the epidemic spread in different countries. Among all the interventions, we find that shortening the duration between death and burial and improving the effectiveness of isolation are two effective interventions for controlling the outbreak of Ebola virus infection.","Shen, Mingwang; Xiao, Yanni; Rong, Libin",Sci Rep,71,28
2041,2041,2041,M1 of Murine Gamma-Herpesvirus 68 Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone Production,12.469591,6.626958,2015-11-30,"Viruses rely on host chaperone network to support their infection. In particular, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident chaperones play key roles in synthesizing and processing viral proteins. Influx of a large amount of foreign proteins exhausts the folding capacity in ER and triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). A fully-executed UPR comprises signaling pathways that induce ER folding chaperones, increase protein degradation, block new protein synthesis and may eventually activate apoptosis, presenting both opportunities and threats to the virus. Here, we define a role of the MHV-68M1 gene in differential modulation of UPR pathways to enhance ER chaperone production. Ectopic expression of M1 markedly induces ER chaperone genes and expansion of ER. The M1 protein accumulates in ER during infection and this localization is indispensable for its function, suggesting M1 acts from the ER. We found that M1 protein selectively induces the chaperon-producing pathways (IRE1, ATF6) while, interestingly, sparing the translation-blocking arm (PERK). We identified, for the first time, a viral factor capable of selectively intervening the initiation of ER stress signaling to induce chaperon production. This finding provides a unique opportunity of using viral protein as a tool to define the activation mechanisms of individual UPR pathways.","Feng, Jiaying; Gong, Danyang; Fu, Xudong; Wu, Ting-ting; Wang, Jane; Chang, Jennifer; Zhou, Jingting; Lu, Gang; Wang, Yibin; Sun, Ren",Sci Rep,71,1
2239,2239,2239,Resveratrol attenuates cortical neuron activity: roles of large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels and voltage-gated sodium channels,12.594487,6.469781,2016-05-21,"BACKGROUND: Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in grapes and red wine, exhibits diverse pharmacological activities. However, relatively little is known about whether resveratrol modulates the ion channels in cortical neurons. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK(Ca)) and voltage-gated sodium channels were expressed in cortical neurons and play important roles in regulation of neuronal excitability. The present study aimed to determine the effects of resveratrol on BK(Ca) currents and voltage-gated sodium currents in cortical neurons. RESULTS: Resveratrol concentration-dependently increased the current amplitude and the opening activity of BK(Ca) channels, but suppressed the amplitude of voltage-gated sodium currents. Similar to the BK(Ca) channel opener NS1619, resveratrol decreased the firing rate of action potentials. In addition, the enhancing effects of BK(Ca) channel blockers tetraethylammonium (TEA) and paxilline on action potential firing were sensitive to resveratrol. Our results indicated that the attenuation of action potential firing rate by resveratrol might be mediated through opening the BK(Ca) channels and closing the voltage-gated sodium channels. CONCLUSIONS: As BK(Ca) channels and sodium channels are critical molecular determinants for seizure generation, our findings suggest that regulation of these two channels in cortical neurons probably makes a considerable contribution to the antiseizure activity of resveratrol.","Wang, Ya-Jean; Chan, Ming-Huan; Chen, Linyi; Wu, Sheng-Nan; Chen, Hwei-Hisen",J Biomed Sci,71,1

Revealing the evolutionary processes that allow novel pathogens to adapt to new hosts, also the potential barriers to host adaptation, is central to understanding the drivers of disease emergence. In particular, it is unclear how the genetics and ecology of pathogens interact to shape the likelihood of successful cross-species transmission. To better understand the determinants of host adaptation and emergence, we modelled key aspects of pathogen evolutionary dynamics at both intra- and inter-host scales, using parameter values similar to those observed in influenza virus. We considered the possibility of acquiring the necessary host adaptive mutations both before (‘off-the-shelf’ emergence) and after (‘tailor-made’ emergence) a virus is transmitted from a donor to a new recipient species. Under both scenarios, population bottlenecks at inter-host transmission act as a major barrier to host adaptation, greatly limiting the number of adaptive mutations that are able to cross the species barrier. In addition, virus emergence is hindered if the fitness valley between the donor and recipient hosts is either too steep or too shallow. Overall, our results reveal where in evolutionary parameter space a virus could adapt to and become transmissible in a new species.","Geoghegan, Jemma L.; Senior, Alistair M.; Holmes, Edward C.",Proc Biol Sci,71,17

The expression of PTEN controlled by p53 regulates autoimmune arthritis through modulating the balance between Th17 and Treg. We hypothesized that PTEN regulated by p53 might reduce CIA severity and inflammatory response via inhibiting STAT3 activation. Our results revealed that PTEN could ameliorate experimental autoimmune arthritis by reducing STAT3 activity and Th17 differentiation. Systemic infusion of PTEN overexpression downregulated CIA severity. In addition, PTEN overexpression decreased the activation of T cells and modulated reciprocal differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells. We observed that PTEN expression downregulated by p53 deficiency induced the activation of STAT3. Loss of p53 exacerbated autoimmune arthritis and dysregulated the population of Th17 and Treg.

At these relatively small geographic scales, short-distance interactions and tightly knit sub-networks dominate the dynamics of pathogen transmission; yet, the effective boundaries of these micro-scale groups are generally not known and often ignored. Using clinical test results from hospital admitted patients we analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of Influenza Like Illness (ILI) in the city of Jerusalem over a period of three winter seasons. We demonstrate that this urban area is not a single, perfectly mixed ecology, but is in fact comprised of a set of more basic, relatively independent pathogen transmission units, which we term here Local Transmission Zones, LTZs. By identifying these LTZs, and using the dynamic pathogen-content information contained within them, we are able to differentiate between disease-causes at the individual patient level often with near-perfect predictive accuracy.","Almogy, Gal; Stone, Lewi; Bernevig, B.

Environmental changes and deforestation have severely influenced many ecosystems, intensifying the contact between wildlife and humans. In recent years, bats have been found to harbor a number of different viruses with zoonotic potential, as well as a great diversity of astroviruses, for which the question of zoonotic potential remains unanswered to date. Human astroviruses have been identified as the causative agent for diarrhea in children and immunocompromised patients. For a long time, astroviruses have been considered to be strictly species-specific. However, a great genetic diversity has recently been discovered among animal and human astroviruses that might indicate the potential of these viruses to cross species barriers. Furthermore, our knowledge about the tissue tropism of astroviruses has been expanded to some neurotropic strains that have recently been shown to be responsible for encephalitis in humans and livestock. This review gives an overview on what is known about astroviruses in bats, humans and livestock, especially bovines and pigs. Future research activities are suggested to unravel astrovirus infection dynamics in bat populations to further assess the zoonotic potential of these viruses.","Fischer, Kerstin; Pinho dos Reis, Vinícius; Balkema-Buschmann, Anne",Viruses,71,28

The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) causes the TSS/surrounding region to undergo a conformational shift postulated to inhibit translation. Using optical tweezers (OT) and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD), we found that the unusual stability of pseudoknotted element H4a/Ψ(3) required five upstream adenylates, and H4a/Ψ(3) was necessary for cooperative association of two other hairpins (H5/H4b) in Mg(2+). SMD recapitulated the TSS unfolding order in the absence of Mg(2+), showed dependence of the resistance to pulling on the 3D orientation and gave structural insights into the measured contour lengths of the TSS structure elements. Adenylate mutations eliminated one-site RdRp binding to the 3’UTR, suggesting that RdRp binding to the adenylates disrupts H4a/Ψ(3), leading to loss of H5/H4b interaction and promoting a conformational switch interrupting translation and promoting replication.

To assess the protein expression profiles during embryonic skeletal muscle development, we performed a proteomics analysis using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) in leg muscle tissues of female Xinghua chicken at embryonic age (E) 11, E16, and 1-day post hatch (D1). We identified 3,240 proteins in chicken embryonic muscle and 491 of them were differentially expressed (fold change ≥ 1.5 or ≤ 0.666 and p < 0.05). There were 19 up- and 32 down-regulated proteins in E11 vs. E16 group, 238 up- and 227 down-regulated proteins in E11 vs. D1 group, and 13 up- and 5 down-regulated proteins in E16 vs. D1 group. Protein interaction network analyses indicated that these differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in the pathway of protein synthesis, muscle contraction, and oxidative phosphorylation. Integrative analysis of proteome and our previous transcriptome data found 189 differentially expressed proteins that correlated with their mRNA level. The interactions between these proteins were also involved in muscle contraction and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. The lncRNA-protein interaction network found four proteins DMD, MYL3, TNNI2, and TNNT3 that are all involved in muscle contraction and may be lncRNA regulated. These results provide several candidate genes for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of chicken embryonic muscle development, and enable us to better understanding their regulation networks and biochemical pathways.","Ouyang, Hongjia; Wang, Zhijun; Chen, Xiaolan; Yu, Jiao; Li, Zhenhui; Nie, Qinghua",Front Physiol,71,1

In this study, we disclose a rare-earth free and yellow-emission phosphor, Phellodendron, which could be both excited by near ultraviolet light and blue light. The new yellow phosphor is obtained by extraction of Phellodendron chinense Schneid. The emission wavelength, full width at half maximum and CIE coordinates of extracted Phellodendron are 540 nm, 120 nm and (0.41, 0.55), respectively. The corresponding luminescent properties of Phellodendron are characterized by PL, PLE, reflection spectra, FITR and decay lifetime. Surprising thing is luminous intensity of Phellodendron phosphors excited at 380 nm was stronger than YAG:Ce phosphor by more than 139%. In addition, we firstly introduce the yellow phosphor in white LED fabrication by combining blue chip and Y(3)Al(5)O(12):Ce(3+) phosphor, to create warm white. For comparison, red-emission CaAlSiN(3):Eu(2+) phosphors are also introduced for LED package tests.

However GAMG is quite rare in natural plants, and it must be prepared from glycyrrhizin (GL) by hydrolysing one terminal glucuronic acid. β-Glucuronidase is the key enzyme in the biotransformation of GL to GAMG, but its activities need to be enhanced to facilitate the industrial large-scale production of GAMG. In this study, we identified that isoliquiritigenin (ISL), as one of chemical compositions from the total flavonoids glycyrrhiza (TFG), can significantly enhance β-glucuronidase activity in vitro. Measurements using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the activity of β-glucuronidase could be increased by 2.66-fold via the addition of ISL to a β-glucuronidase solution that contained GL at a 3:10 molar ratio of ISL to GL. ISL was concluded to be an activator because ISL could reduce the K(m) and E(a) of β-glucuronidase reacting with GL. This study sheds new light on the mechanism of β-glucuronidase and helps to make industrial production of GAMG through fermentation feasible.","Wang, Xiaoxue; Wang, Dong; Huo, Yixin; Dai, Dazhang; Li, Chihua; Li, Chun; Liu, Guiyan",Sci Rep,71,1

Bortezomib is the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor drug approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The potential of bortezomib to cause OATP-mediated DDIs has not been assessed. The current study investigated the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 degradation and determined the effects of proteasome inhibitors on OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport. Co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-OATP1B1/1B3 and HA-ubiquitin was observed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells co-transfected with FLAG-tagged OATP1B1/OATP1B3 and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin, suggesting that OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 can be ubiquitin-modified. Although blocking proteasome activity by bortezomib treatment (50 nM, 7 h) increased the endogenous ubiquitin-conjugated FLAG-OATP1B1 and FLAG-OATP1B3 in HEK293-FLAG-OATP1B1 and–OATP1B3 cells, such treatment did not affect the total protein levels of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, suggesting that the UPS plays a minor role in degradation of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 under current constitutive conditions. Pretreatment with bortezomib (50–250 nM, 2–7 h) significantly decreased transport of [(3)H]CCK-8, a specific OATP1B3 substrate, in HEK293-OATP1B3 and human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH). However, bortezomib pretreatment had negligible effects on the transport of [(3)H]E(2)17βG and [(3)H]pitavastatin, dual substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, in HEK293-OATP1B1/1B3 cells and/or human SCH. Compared with vehicle control treatment, bortezomib pretreatment significantly decreased the maximal transport velocity (V(max)) of OATP1B3-mediated transport of CCK-8 (92.25 ± 14.2 vs. 133.95 ± 15.5 pmol/mg protein/min) without affecting the affinity constant (K(m)) values. Treatment with other proteasome inhibitors MG132, epoxomicin, and carfilzomib also significantly decreased OATP1B3-mediated [(3)H]CCK-8 transport. In summary, the current studies for the first time report ubiquitination of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and the apparent substrate-dependent inhibitory effect of bortezomib on OATP1B3-mediated transport. The data suggest that bortezomib has a low risk of causing OATP-mediated DDIs.","Alam, Khondoker; Farasyn, Taleah; Crowe, Alexandra; Ding, Kai; Yue, Wei",PLoS One,71,1

Despite a 99% reduction in annual wild poliovirus (WPV) cases since 1988, tackling the last 1% has proven difficult. We identified key covariates of geographical variation in polio transmission patterns by relating country-specific annual disease incidence to demographic, socio-economic and environmental factors. We assessed the relative contributions of these variables to the performance of computer-generated models for predicting polio transmission. We also examined the effect of spatial coupling on the polio extinction frequency in islands relative to larger land masses. Access to sanitation, population density, forest cover and routine vaccination coverage were the strongest predictors of polio incidence, however their relative effect sizes were inconsistent geographically. The effect of climate variables on polio incidence was negligible, indicating that a climate effect is not identifiable at the annual scale, suggesting a role for climate in shaping the transmission seasonality rather than intensity. We found polio fadeout frequency to depend on both population size and demography, which should therefore be considered in policies aimed at extinction. Our comparative epidemiological approach highlights the heterogeneity among polio transmission determinants. Recognition of this variation is important for the maintenance of population immunity in a post-polio era.","Noori, Navideh; Drake, John M.; Rohani, Pejman",Sci Rep,71,1

In the central nervous system (CNS), CCL5 and its receptors have multiple functions, including promoting neuroinflammation, insulin signaling, neuromodulator of synaptic activity and neuroprotection against a variety of neurotoxins. Evidence has also suggested that this chemokine may regulate opioid response. The multifunctional profile of CCL5 might correlate with its ability to bind different chemokine receptors, as well as with its unique cellular expression. In this work, we have used fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry to examine the expression profile of CCL5 mRNA in the adult rat brain and provide evidence of its cellular localization. We have observed that the highest expression of CCL5 mRNA occurs in all major fiber tracts, including the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and cerebral peduncle. In these tracts, CCL5 mRNA was localized in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Astrocytic and microglial expression was also evident in several brain areas including the cerebral cortex, caudate/putamen, hippocampus, and thalamus. Furthermore, using a specific neuronal marker, we observed CCL5 mRNA expression in discrete layers of the cortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, in the midbrain, CCL5 mRNA co-localized with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells of the ventral tegmental area, suggesting that CCL5 might be expressed by a subset of dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic system. The expression of CCL5 mRNA and protein, together with its receptors, in selected brain cell populations proposes that this chemokine could be involved in neuronal/glial communication.","Lanfranco, Maria Fe; Mocchetti, Italo; Burns, Mark P.; Villapol, Sonia",Front Neuroanat,71,1

Thus, this study was conducted to determine whether resveratrol had protective effects against RV infection in piglets. Following pretreatment with resveratrol dry suspension through adding into the basal diet for 3 weeks, the piglets were orally challenged with RV. We found that resveratrol could alleviate diarrhea induced by RV infection. Resveratrol-treatment inhibited the TNF-α production, indicating that the anti-RV activity of resveratrol may be achieved by reducing the inflammatory response. The IFN-γ level was elevated in 10mg/kg/d resveratrol-treated group and 30mg/kg/d resveratrol-treated group after RV infection. The ratios of CD4+/CD8+ in resveratrol-treated groups were the same as that in mock infected group, suggesting that resveratrol could maintain the immune function in RV-infected piglets.

As a Class 2 solvent with less severe toxicity, content of residual 1,4-dioxane in this newly developed scaffold should be rigorously controlled when it is translated to clinical use. In this study, a headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (HS-GC-MS) method and related testing protocol were developed for quantitative determination of 1,4-dioxane in the PLGA/TCP composite scaffolds. METHODS: Matrix effect analysis was used to optimise the pretreatment method of the scaffolds. Then, the procedure for testing 1,4-dioxane using HS-GC-MS was set up. The accuracy, precision, and robustness of this newly developed quantitative method were also validated before quantification of 1,4-dioxane in the scaffolds with different drying procedures. RESULTS: Dimethyl formamide (DMF) was the optimal solvent for dissolving scaffolds for GC-MS with proper sensitivity and without matrix effect. Then, the optimised procedure was determined as: the scaffolds were dissolved in DMF and kept at 90°C for 40 minutes, separated on a HP-5MS column, and detected by mass spectroscopy. Recovery experiments gave 97.9–100.7% recovery for 1,4-dioxane. The linear range for 1,4-dioxane was determined as 1–40 ppm with linear correlation coefficient ≥ 0.9999. Intraday and interday precision was determined as being within relative standard deviation of below 0.68%. The passable drying procedure was related to lyophilising (−50°C, 50 Pa) the scaffolds for 2 days and drying in vacuum (50 Pa) for 7 days. CONCLUSION: This is the first quantitative method established to test 1,4-dixoane in a novel scaffold. This method was validated with good accuracy and reproducibility, and met the methodological requirements of the Guideline 9101 documented in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015 Edition. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: This quantitative method for determination of residual 1,4-dioxane in the novel scaffolds is a key technical method during its translation into clinical use because this method is an important and indispensable file in the enterprise standard when the porous scaffold is registered as a Class III implanted medical device for bone defect repair, which is used to guarantee the safety of the scaffolds. It is also applied to optimise the drying process of scaffolds and to monitor the quality of scaffolds in the industrialisation process. Further, this method provides references for other solvents quantitative determination in porous scaffolds or materials.","Li, Ling; Long, Jing; Li, Long; Cao, Huijuan; Tang, Tingting; Xi, Xinghua; Qin, Ling; Lai, Yuxiao; Wang, Xinluan",J Orthop Translat,71,1

In addition, OcUGT1 was observed to exhibit additional five types of functions, including classical sugar transfer reaction and three reversible reactions namely NDP-sugar synthesis, sugars exchange and aglycons exchange reactions, as well as enzymatic hydrolysis reaction, suggesting OcUGT1 displays both glycosyltransferase and glycosidase activities. Expression profiles revealed that the expression of OcUGT1 was development-dependent and affected by environmental factors.

The DNA vaccine is a new vaccine being developed since the early 1990s. Although the DNA vaccine is promising, no human DNA vaccine has been approved to date. The main problem facing DNA vaccine efficacy is the lack of a DNA vaccine delivery system. Several studies explored this limitation. One of the best DNA vaccine delivery systems uses a live bacterial vector as the carrier. The live bacterial vector induces a robust immune response due to its natural characteristics that are recognized by the immune system. Moreover, the route of administration used by the live bacterial vector is through the mucosal route that beneficially induces both mucosal and systemic immune responses. The mucosal route is not invasive, making the vaccine easy to administer, increasing the patient’s acceptance. Lactic acid bacterium is one of the most promising bacteria used as a live bacterial vector. However, some other attenuated pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp., have been used as DNA vaccine carriers. Numerous studies showed that live bacterial vectors are a promising candidate to deliver DNA vaccines.","Yurina, Valentina",Med Sci (Basel),71,22

To identify molecular signatures of sALS we performed genome-wide expression profiling in laser capture microdissection-enriched surviving motor neurons (MNs) from lumbar spinal cords of sALS patients with rostral onset and caudal progression. After correcting for immunological background, we discover a highly specific gene expression signature for sALS that is associated with phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) pathology. Transcriptome–pathology correlation identified casein kinase 1ε (CSNK1E) mRNA as tightly correlated to levels of pTDP-43 in sALS patients. Enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation in human sALS patient- and healthy control-derived frontal cortex, revealed that TDP-43 binds directly to and regulates the expression of CSNK1E mRNA. Additionally, we were able to show that pTDP-43 itself binds RNA. CK1E, the protein product of CSNK1E, in turn interacts with TDP-43 and promotes cytoplasmic accumulation of pTDP-43 in human stem-cell-derived MNs. Pathological TDP-43 phosphorylation is therefore, reciprocally regulated by CK1E activity and TDP-43 RNA binding.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 197,207 cases of HFMD over the period 2003–2012 at the national level and of 57,502 cases in 10,080 institutional outbreaks over the period 2011–2016 in Singapore. The effects of school closure due to 1) institutional outbreaks, 2) public holidays, and 3) school vacations were assessed using a Bayesian time series modeling approach. School closure was associated with a reduction in HFMD transmission rate. During public holidays, average numbers of secondary cases having onset the week after dropped by 53% (95% credible interval 44–62%), and during school vacations, the number of secondary cases dropped by 7% (95% credible interval 3–10%). Schools being temporarily closed in response to an institutional outbreak reduced the average number of new cases by 1,204 (95% credible interval 1,140–1,297). Despite the positive effect in reducing transmission, the effect of school closure is relatively small and may not justify the routine use of this measure.","Chen, Yirong; Badaruddin, Hishamuddin; Lee, Vernon J.; Cutter, Jeffery; Cook, Alex R.",Am J Trop Med Hyg,71,17

Lipids not only constitute cellular membranes, but also serve as bioactive lipid mediators and essential components of the skin barrier. Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) enzymes supply fatty acids and lysophospholipids from membrane phospholipids, thereby variably affecting cutaneous homeostasis. Accordingly, perturbation of particular PLA(2)-driven lipid pathways can be linked to various forms of skin disease. In this review article, we highlight the roles of several PLA(2) subtypes in cutaneous pathophysiology, as revealed by transgenic/knockout studies in combination with comprehensive lipidomics. We focus mainly on secreted PLA(2) group IIF (sPLA(2)-IIF), which is associated with epidermal hyperplasia through mobilization of a unique lipid metabolite. We also address the distinct roles of sPLA(2)-IIE in hair follicles and sPLA(2)-IID in lymphoid immune cells that secondarily affect cutaneous inflammation, and provide some insights into species differences in sPLA(2)s. Additionally, we briefly overview the patatin-like phospholipase PNPLA1, which belongs to the Ca(2+)-independent PLA(2) (iPLA(2)) family, as a key regulator of skin barrier function through catalysis of a unique non-PLA(2) reaction. These knowledges on lipid metabolism driven by various PLA(2) subtypes will open novel opportunities for translated studies toward diagnosis and therapy of human skin diseases.","Murakami, Makoto; Yamamoto, Kei; Taketomi, Yoshitaka",Inflamm Regen,71,1

N-linked glycosylation is involved in stability and function of these proteins and occurs at Asn residues. In several organs, profiles of N-glycans have been determined by comprehensive analyses. Nevertheless, the cochlea of the mammalian inner ear, a tiny organ mediating hearing, has yet to be examined. Here, we focused on the stria vascularis, an epithelial-like tissue in the cochlea, and characterised N-glycans by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. This hypervascular tissue not only expresses several ion transporters and channels to control the electrochemical balance in the cochlea but also harbours different transporters and receptors that maintain structure and activity of the organ. Seventy-nine N-linked glycans were identified in the rat stria vascularis. Among these, in 55 glycans, the complete structures were determined; in the other 24 species, partial glycosidic linkage patterns and full profiles of the monosaccharide composition were identified. In the process of characterisation, several sialylated glycans were subjected sequentially to two different alkylamidation reactions; this derivatisation helped to distinguish α2,3-linkage and α2,6-linkage sialyl isomers with mass spectrometry. These data should accelerate elucidation of the molecular architecture of the cochlea.","Nonomura, Yoriko; Sawamura, Seishiro; Hanzawa, Ken; Nishikaze, Takashi; Sekiya, Sadanori; Higuchi, Taiga; Nin, Fumiaki; Uetsuka, Satoru; Inohara, Hidenori; Okuda, Shujiro; Miyoshi, Eiji; Horii, Arata; Takahashi, Sugata; Natsuka, Shunji; Hibino, Hiroshi",Sci Rep,71,1

Advances in pDNA delivery to host tissue with the employment of in vivo electroporation (EP) have led to significantly enhanced gene expression and the recent demonstration of clinical efficacy with the platform. Building upon this platform, this study reports that enzyme-mediated modification of the muscle tissue extracellular matrix structure at the site of pDNA delivery operates in a synergistic manner with EP to enhance both local and systemic gene expression further. Specifically, administration of chondroitinase ABC (Cho ABC) to the site of intramuscular delivery of pDNA led to transient disruption of chondroitin sulfate scaffolding barrier, permitting enhanced gene distribution and expression across the tissue. The employment of Cho ABC in combination with CELLECTRA(®) intramuscular EP resulted in increased gene expression by 5.5-fold in mice and 17.98-fold in rabbits. The study demonstrates how this protocol can be universally applied to an active prophylaxis platform to increase the in vivo production of functional immunoglobulin G, and to DNA vaccine protocols to permit drug dose sparing. The data indicate the Cho ABC formulation to be of significant value upon combination with EP to drive enhanced gene expression levels in pDNA delivery protocols.","Schommer, Nina N.; Nguyen, Jacklyn; Yung, Bryan S.; Schultheis, Katherine; Muthumani, Kar; Weiner, David B.; Humeau, Laurent; Broderick, Kate E.; Smith, Trevor R.F.",Hum Gene Ther,71,1

Several potential interventions can induce autophagy in preclinical research; however, none of these interventions are ready for translation to clinical practice yet. The topic of the current review is the molecular regulation of autophagy by glucagon, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and the GLP-1-degrading enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). Glucagon is a well-known polypeptide that induces autophagy. In contrast, GLP-1 has been shown to inhibit glucagon secretion; GLP-1 also has been related to the induction of autophagy. DPP-4 inhibitors can induce autophagy in a GLP-1–dependent manner, but other diverse effects could be relevant. Here, we analyze the distinct molecular regulation of autophagy by glucagon, GLP-1, and DPP-4 inhibitors. Additionally, the potential contribution to autophagy by glucagon and GLP-1 after bariatric surgery is discussed.","Kanasaki, Keizo; Kawakita, Emi; Koya, Daisuke",Front Pharmacol,71,1

Although the isozymes KAT1–4 have been identified, KYNA is mainly produced by KAT2 in brain tissues. KNYA is an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate and α-7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and accumulation of KYNA in the brain has been associated with the pathology of schizophrenia. Therefore, KAT2 could be exploited as a therapeutic target for the management of schizophrenia. Although currently available KAT2 inhibitors irreversibly bind to pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), inhibition via this mechanism may cause adverse side effects because of the presence of other PLP-dependent enzymes. Therefore, we identified novel selective KAT2 inhibitors by screening approximately 13,000 molecules. Among these, glycyrrhizic acid (GL) and its analogues, glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and carbenoxolone (CBX), were identified as KAT2 inhibitors. These compounds were highly selective for KAT2 and competed with its substrate KYN, but had no effects on the other 3 KAT isozymes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in complex structures that were predicted in docking calculations, GL, GA and CBX were located on the same surface as the aromatic ring of KYN. These results indicate that GL and its analogues are highly selective and competitive inhibitors of KAT2.","Yoshida, Yukihiro; Fujigaki, Hidetsugu; Kato, Koichi; Yamazaki, Kyoka; Fujigaki, Suwako; Kunisawa, Kazuo; Yamamoto, Yasuko; Mouri, Akihiro; Oda, Akifumi; Nabeshima, Toshitaka; Saito, Kuniaki",Sci Rep,71,1

With low cost whole genome sequencing technology and powerful computing capabilities, novel computational approaches have demonstrated the potential to facilitate the design of a universal influenza vaccine. However, few studies have integrated computational optimization in the design and discovery of new vaccines. Understanding the potential of computational vaccine design is necessary before these approaches can be implemented on a broad scale. This review summarizes some promising computational approaches under current development, including computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens with consensus sequences, phylogenetic model-based ancestral sequence reconstruction, and immunomics to compute conserved cross-reactive T-cell epitopes. Interactions between virus-host-environment determine the evolvability of the influenza population. We propose that with the development of novel technologies that allow the integration of data sources such as protein structural modeling, host antibody repertoire analysis and advanced phylodynamic modeling, computational approaches will be crucial for the development of a long-lasting universal influenza vaccine. Taken together, computational approaches are powerful and promising tools for the development of a universal influenza vaccine with durable and broad protection.","Qiu, Xueting; Duvvuri, Venkata R.; Bahl, Justin",Vaccines (Basel),71,1
3954,3954,3954,Discovery of All Three Types in Cartilaginous Fishes Enables Phylogenetic Resolution of the Origins and Evolution of Interferons,12.441041,6.3934183,2019-07-12,"Interferons orchestrate host antiviral responses in jawed vertebrates. They are categorized into three classes; IFN1 and IFN3 are the primary antiviral cytokine lineages, while IFN2 responds to a broader variety of pathogens. The evolutionary relationships within and between these three classes have proven difficult to resolve. Here, we reassess interferon evolution, considering key phylogenetic pitfalls including taxon sampling, alignment quality, model adequacy, and outgroup choice. We reveal that cartilaginous fishes, and hence the jawed vertebrate ancestor, possess(ed) orthologs of all three interferon classes. We show that IFN3 groups sister to IFN1, resolve the origins of the human IFN3 lineages, and find that intronless IFN3s emerged at least three times. IFN2 genes are highly conserved, except for IFN-γ-rel, which we confirm resulted from a teleost-specific duplication. Our analyses show that IFN1 phylogeny is highly sensitive to phylogenetic error. By accounting for this, we describe a new backbone IFN1 phylogeny that implies several IFN1 genes existed in the jawed vertebrate ancestor. One of these is represented by the intronless IFN1s of tetrapods, including mammalian-like repertoires of reptile IFN1s and a subset of amphibian IFN1s, in addition to newly-identified intron-containing shark IFN1 genes. IFN-f, previously only found in teleosts, likely represents another ancestral jawed vertebrate IFN1 family member, suggesting the current classification of fish IFN1s into two groups based on the number of cysteines may need revision. The providence of the remaining fish IFN1s and the coelacanth IFN1s proved difficult to resolve, but they may also be ancestral jawed vertebrate IFN1 lineages. Finally, a large group of amphibian-specific IFN1s falls sister to all other IFN1s and was likely also present in the jawed vertebrate ancestor. Our results verify that intronless IFN1s have evolved multiple times in amphibians and indicate that no one-to-one orthology exists between mammal and reptile IFN1s. Our data also imply that diversification of the multiple IFN1s present in the jawed vertebrate ancestor has occurred through a rapid birth-death process, consistent with functional maintenance over a 450-million-year host-pathogen arms race. In summary, this study reveals a new model of interferon evolution important to our understanding of jawed vertebrate antiviral immunity.","Redmond, Anthony K.; Zou, Jun; Secombes, Christopher J.; Macqueen, Daniel J.; Dooley, Helen",Front Immunol,71,1

It does so by acting as a sensor that intercepts antibody-coated viruses that have evaded extracellular neutralization and breached the cell membrane. Upon engagement of the Fc of antibodies bound to viruses, TRIM21 triggers a coordinated effector and signaling response that prevents viral replication while at the same time inducing an anti-viral cellular state. This dual effector function is tightly regulated by auto-ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Therapeutically, TRIM21 has been shown to be detrimental in adenovirus based gene therapy, while it may be favorably utilized to prevent tau aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, TRIM21 may synergize with the complement system to block viral replication as well as transgene expression. TRIM21 can also be utilized as a research tool to deplete specific proteins in cells and zebrafish embryos. Here, we review our current biological understanding of TRIM21 in light of its versatile functions.","Foss, Stian; Bottermann, Maria; Jonsson, Alexandra; Sandlie, Inger; James, Leo C.; Andersen, Jan Terje",Front Immunol,71,1

Here we designed and synthesized two PEGylated C34 peptides, PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34, with the PEG chain length of 2 and 5 kDa, respectively, and evaluated their anti-HIV-1 activity and mechanisms of action. We found that these two PEGylated peptides could bind to the HIV-1 peptide N36 to form high affinity complexes with high α-helicity. The peptides PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 effectively inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated cell–cell fusion with an effective concentration for 50% inhibition (EC(50)) of about 36 nM. They also inhibited infection of the laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strain NL4-3 with EC(50) of about 4–5 nM, and against 47 HIV-1 clinical isolates circulating in China with mean EC(50) of PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 of about 26 nM and 32 nM, respectively. The plasma half-life (t(1/2)) of PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 was 2.6 h and 5.1 h, respectively, and the t(1/2) of PEGylated C34 was about 2.4-fold and 4.6-fold longer than C34 (~1.1 h), respectively. These findings suggest that PEGylated C34 with broad-spectrum anti-HIV-1 activity and prolonged half-life can be further developed as a peptide fusion inhibitor-based long-acting anti-HIV drug for clinical use to treat HIV-infected patients who have failed to respond to current anti-retrovirus drugs.","Wang, Chen; Cheng, Shuihong; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Ding, Yibo; Chong, Huihui; Xing, Hui; Jiang, Shibo; Li, Xuebing; Ma, Liying",Viruses,71,1

Knowledge of the spatial and temporal characteristics of influenza is important in evaluating and developing disease control programs. This study aims to describe an accurate spatiotemporal pattern of influenza at the prefecture level and explore the risk factors associated with influenza incidence risk in mainland China from 2005 to 2018. The incidence data of influenza were obtained from the Chinese Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System (CNIDRS). The Besag York Mollié (BYM) model was extended to include temporal and space-time interaction terms. The parameters for this extended Bayesian spatiotemporal model were estimated through integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) using the package R-INLA in R. A total of 702,226 influenza cases were reported in mainland China in CNIDRS from 2005–2018. The yearly reported incidence rate of influenza increased 15.6 times over the study period, from 3.51 in 2005 to 55.09 in 2008 per 100,000 populations. The temporal term in the spatiotemporal model showed that much of the increase occurred during the last 3 years of the study period. The risk factor analysis showed that the decreased number of influenza vaccines for sale, the new update of the influenza surveillance protocol, the increase in the rate of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 among all processed specimens from influenza-like illness (ILI) patients, and the increase in the latitude and longitude of geographic location were associated with an increase in the influenza incidence risk. After the adjusting for fixed covariate effects and time random effects, the map of the spatial structured term shows that high-risk areas clustered in the central part of China and the lowest-risk areas in the east and west. Large space-time variations in influenza have been found since 2009. In conclusion, an increasing trend of influenza was observed from 2005 to 2018. The insufficient flu vaccine supplements, the newly emerging influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and expansion of influenza surveillance efforts might be the major causes of the dramatic changes in outbreak and spatio-temporal epidemic patterns. Clusters of prefectures with high relative risks of influenza were identified in the central part of China. Future research with more risk factors at both national and local levels is necessary to explain the changing spatiotemporal patterns of influenza in China.","Zhang, Yewu; Wang, Xiaofeng; Li, Yanfei; Ma, Jiaqi",Sci Rep,71,1

The only available vaccine, bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), has variable efficacy throughout the world. A more effective vaccine is urgently needed. The immune response against tuberculosis relies, at least in part, on CD4(+) T cells. Protective vaccines require the induction of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells via mycobacterial peptides presented by MHC class-II in infected macrophages. In order to identify mycobacterial antigens bound to MHC, we have immunoprecipitated MHC class-I and class-II complexes from THP-1 macrophages infected with BCG, purified MHC class-I and MHC class-II peptides and analysed them by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We have successfully identified 94 mycobacterial peptides presented by MHC-II and 43 presented by MHC-I, from 76 and 41 antigens, respectively. These antigens were found to be highly expressed in infected macrophages. Gene ontology analysis suggests most of these antigens are associated with membranes and involved in lipid biosynthesis and transport. The sequences of selected peptides were confirmed by spectral match validation and immunogenicity evaluated by IFN-gamma ELISpot against peripheral blood mononuclear cell from volunteers vaccinated with BCG, M.tb latently infected subjects or patients with tuberculosis disease. Three antigens were expressed in viral vectors, and evaluated as vaccine candidates alone or in combination in a murine aerosol M.tb challenge model.

This study was conducted to investigate the role of GHITM gene in the apoptosis and growth of the golden apple snail Pomacea canaliculate. RESULTS: The complete cDNA of this gene was cloned using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method and subjected to bioinformatics analysis. The full-length cDNA was 2242 bp, including an open reading frame of 1021 bp that encoded a protein of 342 amino acid residues. The mRNA expression profiles of GHITM gene in different tissues (liver, kidney, gonad and foot) and different growth phases (6-months old and 2-years old) showed that it was expressed in various tissues and different growth phases. Silencing of the GHITM gene by RNAi (RNA interference) experiments revealed that the GHITM gene possibly plays a role in inhibiting apoptosis through detecting the Caspase (Cysteine-requiring Aspartate Protease)-3 activity. In addition, the aperture width and body whorl length of the snail was significantly affected by RNAi, suggesting that this gene plays a significant role in promoting the growth of the organism.

Recently we have identified that the peptide PH((1–110)) from polyhedrin self-aggregates and incorporates foreign proteins to form particles. We have proposed that this peptide can be used as an antigen carrying system for vaccines. However, the immune response generated by the antigen fused to the peptide has not been fully characterized.

RESULTS: In the present study we demonstrate the use of a system developed to generate nano and microparticles carrying as a fusion protein peptides or proteins of interest to be used as vaccines. These particles are purified easily by centrifugation. Immunization of animals with the particles in the absence of adjuvant result in a robust and long-lasting immune response. Proteins contained inside the particles are maintained for over 1 year at ambient temperature, preserving their immunological properties. CONCLUSION: The rapid and efficient production of the particles in addition to the robust immune response they generate position this system as an excellent method for the rapid response against emerging diseases.

However, the cause of dysphagia development by halo-vest fixation is not yet clear. We therefore investigated the incidence of dysphagia and cervical alignment as well as clinical data from medical charts in patients treated with a halo-vest brace. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from the medical charts of 49 patients who had undergone halo-vest fixation. Occipito (O)-C2 angle, C2-C6 angle, and pharyngeal inlet angle were assessed by lateral plain X-rays of the cervical spine. The impacts of these parameters on incidence and severity of dysphagia were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (32%) suffered from dysphagia during halo-vest fixation, and age and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay were greater in the dysphagia group (p = 0.044 and 0.013, respectively) than in those who did not develop dysphagia. O-C2 angle was smaller in the dysphagia group (p = 0.016). After multivariate logistic analysis, body mass index, ICU stay, and O-C2 angle remained as independent risk factors related to incidence of dysphagia. Spearman rank correlation showed a negative correlation between ICU stay and Food Intake Level Scale (FILS) (p = 0.026), and a positive correlation between O-C2 angle and FILS (p = 0.008).

A conceptual framework for understanding this mental health disparity is minority stress theory, which posits that experiences of external prejudice events (i.e., distal stressors) and internal stress processes such as internalized homophobia and concealment (i.e., proximal stressors) contribute to sexual minorities’ elevated risk of psychological distress. To deepen the understanding of mental health among Chinese MSM and explore the potential utility of minority stress theory in this population, this paper synthesizes research evidence regarding prevalent mental health issues as well as how minority stress may be linked to psychological health in Chinese MSM. RECENT FINDINGS: Results indicate that Chinese MSM experience a high prevalence of several mental health issues including depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviors, and alcohol dependence. SUMMARY: This review further reveals minority stress to be an important determinant of psychological distress among Chinese MSM, though evidence is mixed regarding the relationship between proximal minority stress and psychological health. Nonetheless, there is a lack of mental health services and interventions focusing on MSM in China. Culturally relevant, competent, and LGBT-affirmative mental health interventions are needed for Chinese MSM. To guide future intervention research, we provide considerations for reducing minority stress and promoting psychological health among Chinese MSM.","Sun, Shufang; Pachankis, John E.; Li, Xiaoming; Operario, Don",Curr HIV/AIDS Rep,71,1

A total of 16 Mafa-DOB, 16 Mafa-DPB1, and 34 Mafa-DQB1 alleles were identified, which revealed limited, moderate, and marked allelic polymorphism at DOB, DPB1, and DQB1, respectively, in a cohort of cynomolgus macaques of Vietnamese origin. In addition, 16 Mafa-DOB, 5 Mafa-DPB1, and 8 Mafa-DQB1 alleles represented novel sequences that had not been reported in earlier studies. Almost of the sequences detected at the DOB and DQB1 locus in the present study belonged to DOB*01 (100%) and DQB1*06 (62%) lineages, respectively. Interestingly, four, three, and one high-frequency alleles were detected at Mafa-DOB, -DPB1, and -DQB1, respectively, in this monkeys. The alleles with the highest frequency among these monkeys were Mafa-DOB*010102, Mafa-DPB1*13, and Mafa-DQB1*0616, and these were found in 33 (25.6%) of 129 monkeys, 32 (31.37%) of 102 monkeys, and 30 (31%) of 143 monkeys, respectively. The high-frequency alleles may represent high priority targets for additional characterization of immune function. We also carried out evolutionary and population analyses using these sequences to reveal population-specific alleles. This information will not only promote the understanding of MHC diversity and polymorphism in the cynomolgus macaque but will also increase the value of this species as a model for biomedical research.","Ling, Fei; Wei, Li-qiong; Wang, Tao; Wang, Hai-bo; Zhuo, Min; Du, Hong-li; Wang, Ju-fang; Wang, Xiao-ning",Immunogenetics,71,1

The complexities in investigating this relatively inaccessible area and the necessity for studying appropriate controls by similar techniques are some of the reasons that explain this paucity of data. Tropical sprue is a syndrome with an unusual geographical distribution and unknown aetiology. Alterations in gut immunocytes, especially EL, in this disease suggest that immune-mediated mechanisms may be important in the pathogenesis. However, the available data suggests that the initiating event leading to persistent damage to enterocytes in the stem cell compartment is unlikely to be immune mediated and that the immunological alterations are secondary to the loss of barrier function consequent to enterocyte damage.","Mathan, V.

For the trials, 458 pregnant cows from 26 herds were involved. In each herd, cows which had been inseminated within a period of two months were selected and randomly subdivided in two groups. Cows in one group (248 head in total) were vaccinated 6 weeks before calving and again 4 weeks later; cows in the other group (210 head in total) were left as unvaccinated controls. At calving, colostrum was collected from each cow and stored at -30°C until used for feeding calves. The newborn calves, beginning the second day of life and for the next 7–10 consecutive days, each was fed a daily supplement of 400 ml of colostrum from its dam. The diarrhea occurred in 86 (40.9%) calves that had received colostrum from unvaccinated dams (normal colostrum), and in 7 (2.8%) calves which were fed colostrum from vaccinated dams (immune colostrum). The disease was very severe in the normal colostrum-fed calves and 52 of them died. Those calves which survived the disease underwent a significant loss of condition. By contrast, the 7 immune colostrum-fed calves displayed a rather mild enteric condition, and all recovered without any sequela being observed.","Castrucci, G.; Frigeri, F.; Angelillo, V.; Ferrari, M.; Cilli, V.; Aldrovandi, V.",Eur J Epidemiol,71,8

We extract proper names, locations, temporal expressions and normal terms into distinct sub-vectors of the document representation. Measuring the similarity of two documents is conducted by comparing a pair of their corresponding sub-vectors at a time. We use a simple perceptron to optimize the relative emphasis of each semantic class in the tracking and detection decisions.

Nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) is a cofactor of the NS3 serine protease and has been demonstrated to inhibit protein synthesis. In this study, GST pull-down assay was performed to examine potential cellular factors that interact with the NS4A protein and are involved in the pathogenesis of HCV. A trypsin digestion followed by LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that one of the GST-NS4A-interacting proteins to be eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A). Both the N-terminal domain of NS4A from amino acid residues 1–20, and the central domain from residues 21–34 interacted with eEF1A, but the central domain was the key player involved in the NS4A-mediated translation inhibition. NS4A(21–34) diminished both cap-dependent and HCV IRES-mediated translation in a dose-dependent manner. The translation inhibitory effect of NS4A(21–34) was relieved by the addition of purified recombinant eEF1A in an in vitro translation system. Taken together, NS4A inhibits host and viral translation through interacting with eEF1A, implying a possible mechanism by which NS4A is involved in the pathogenesis and chronic infection of HCV.","Kou, Yi-Hen; Chou, Shang-Min; Wang, Yi-Ming; Chang, Ya-Tzu; Huang, Shao-Yong; Jung, Mei-Ying; Huang, Yu-Hsu; Chen, Mei-Ru; Chang, Ming-Fu; Chang, Shin C.",J Biomed Sci,71,1

To assess the concomitant inflammatory reaction in an extracerebral site, livers were examined in parallel. Mice were infected i.v. withCryptococcus neoformans, group A/D, and organs were examined immunohistologically for CD4-, CD8- and monocyteand granulocyte-specific CD11b-phenotypic leukocytes over a period of 60 days. Intracerebrally, agglomerations of cryptococci formed pseudocysts that were surrounded by CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes at the end of the second week post-infection, followed by the invasion of monocytes and granulocytes into the lesions. After the fourth week post-infection, most of the invaded lesions were transformed into glious scars. Meningitis was usually marked and showed a homogenous distribution of CD4-, CD8- and CD11b-phenotypic cells, with a predominance of monocytes and CD4+ lymphocytes. Inflammatory infiltrates in the liver were found already 4 days post-infection. CD4+ lymphocytes and monocytes were distributed homogenously in the infiltrates, with a lower number of CD8+ lymphocytes being located rather in the periphery of the infiltrates. Comparing leukocyte kinetics in brain and liver, an important observation was the delayed immigration of immune cells at the intracerebral cryptococcal lesions as compared with the liver, and the different migration patterns of T-lymphocyte subgroups and macrophages. These results suggest that there are differential leukocyte migration patterns in the liver and brain following disseminated cryptococcosis. The immunological aspects of the observed leukocyte kinetics are discussed.","Dobrick, Peter; Miksits, Klaus; Hahn, Helmut",Mycopathologia,71,1

In this response paper, we join in the discussion by highlighting five issues—progress, paradigms, puzzles, promise, and potential research directions of social indicators research. In terms of progress, while we have accomplished many tasks proposed by Solomon et al. (The quality of life, Sage, London 1980), some of them are yet to be achieved. Regarding research paradigms surrounding social indicators, researchers have primarily used positivistic or post-positivistic orientation to conduct and interpret social indicators research, with relatively fewer studies using interpretive, constructionist or critical theory perspective. There are also several puzzles deserving consideration. These include (a) the use of “other types of evidence”, particularly qualitative data; (b) evaluation of social programs; (c) feasibility of assessing “social progress”; (d) choice of social indicators; (e) interpretation of findings; (f) methodological debates; and (g) explanations for social change.

The IBV Gray and JMK strains had 99% nucleotide sequence similarity. The overall nucleotide sequence similarity of the Gray and JMK strains compared with other IBV strains was between 82.0% and 87.4%. The similarity of the predicted amino acid sequence for the S1 glycoproteins of the Gray and JMK strains was 98.8%. Six of the 10 differences in the amino acid sequence were found between residues 99 and 127, suggesting a possible role for that region in the tissue trophisms of the viruses. The S1 glycoprotein of the Gray and JMK strains had 79.5%–84.6% amino acid similarity with the published sequence of other IBV strains. Serine instead of phenylalanine was observed in the protease cleavage site between the S1 and S2 glycoprotein subunits for the Gray and JMK strains, which was similar to the published sequence for the Ark99 and SE17 strains. The significance of that amino acid change is not known.

A special emphasis is placed on the study of the mechanisms of action of these antibiotics, which could be the basis of a rational approach to their chemical modification involving the transformation of the inner binding pocket and the peripheral regions of the molecules that participate in the formation of their complexes with targets. The recently discovered antiviral activity of modified glycopeptides antibiotics is also discussed. A possibility of obtaining new highly active anti-HIV-1 and anti-HIV-2 preparations on the basis of hydrophobic derivatives of the aglycones of glycopeptide antibiotics was demonstrated.

However, it is important to determine immunological variations to identify factors influencing the health status of these endangered mammals from an evolutionary, ecological, conservation, and public health point of view. Immunity is highly variable and can be influenced by both internal (e.g. hormone levels, energy demand) and external factors (e.g. pathogens, climate). As bats have some peculiar ecological, energetic, and putative immunological characteristics, they are outstanding study organisms for ecoimmunological studies. We tested if (i) female bats have a higher immunity than males similar to most other mammalian species and (ii) individuals differ according to their energy demand (e.g. reproductive status). To study these questions, we sampled female and male Myotis daubentonii with different reproductive states and estimated their bacterial killing activity, hemolysis/hemagglutination titer, immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration, and total and differential white blood cell counts. These methods characterize the cellular and humoral branches of both the adaptive and the innate immune responses of these individuals. Reproductively active males had lower cellular immunity compared to non-reproductive individuals. Pregnant females had increased IgG concentrations while hemolysis was enhanced during lactation. No clear trade-off between immunity and reproduction was found; instead immunity of males and female bats seems to be modulated differently due to varying hormonal and energetic states. Our data suggest that both adaptive and innate immunity as well as individual differences (i.e. sex and reproductive state) need to be considered to get a comprehensive overall picture of immunity in wild mammals.","Ruoss, Sara; Becker, Nina I.; Otto, Matthias S.; Czirják, Gábor Á.; Encarnação, Jorge A.",Mamm Biol,71,17

Systemic administration of cationic liposomes followed by the EBV-based plasmid led to gene expression in the lung that lasted for more than 3 weeks. Prolonged and high levels of gene expression can also be obtained in primary mouse lung endothelial cells (MLEC) following lipofection with an EBV-based plasmid.

All patients experienced pulmonary infiltrates during neutropenia followed by respiratory status deterioration coinciding with neutropenia recovery.

Of the 20 patients, 16 received invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, including 14 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Five patients died, with refractory ARDS. In patients with pulmonary infiltrates during neutropenia, G-CSF-induced neutropenia recovery carries a risk of respiratory status deterioration with acute lung injury or ARDS.

In vitro, apoptosis proceeds through an execution phase during which cell dismantling is initiated, with or without fragmentation into apoptotic bodies, but with maintenance of a near-to-intact cytoplasmic membrane, followed by a transition to a necrotic cell elimination traditionally called “secondary necrosis”. Secondary necrosis involves activation of self-hydrolytic enzymes, and swelling of the cell or of the apoptotic bodies, generalized and irreparable damage to the cytoplasmic membrane, and culminates with cell disruption. In vivo, under normal conditions, the elimination of apoptosing cells or apoptotic bodies is by removal through engulfment by scavengers prompted by the exposure of engulfment signals during the execution phase of apoptosis; if this removal fails progression to secondary necrosis ensues as in the in vitro situation. In vivo secondary necrosis occurs when massive apoptosis overwhelms the available scavenging capacity, or when the scavenger mechanism is directly impaired, and may result in leakage of the cell contents with induction of tissue injury and inflammatory and autoimmune responses. Several disorders where secondary necrosis has been implicated as a pathogenic mechanism will be reviewed.","Silva, Manuel T.; do Vale, Ana; dos Santos, Nuno M. N.",Apoptosis,71,8

This study is to determine if BMI extremes are associated with increased 28-day mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS) in emergency department (ED) patients presenting with severe sepsis. We performed a retrospective chart review at an urban, level I trauma center of adults admitted with severe sepsis between 1/2005 and 10/2007, and collected socio-demographic variables, comorbidities, initial and most severe vital signs, laboratory values, and infection sources. The primary outcome variables were mortality and LOS. We performed bivariable analysis, logistic regression and restricted cubic spline regression to determine the association between BMI, mortality, and LOS. Amongst 1,191 severe sepsis patients (median age, 57 years; male, 54.7 %; median BMI, 25.1 kg/m(2)), 28-day mortality was 19.9 % (95 % CI 17.8–22.4) and 60-day mortality was 24.4 % (95 % CI 21.5–26.5). Obese and morbidly obese patients were younger, less severely ill, and more likely to have soft tissue infections.

There was no significant difference in LOS across BMI groups. Neither LOS nor adjusted 28-day mortality was significantly increased or decreased in underweight or obese patients with severe sepsis. Morbidly obese patients may have decreased 28-day mortality, partially due to differences in initial presentation and source of infection.

During the last 20 yr, infectious diseases have indeed made a staggering comeback for a variety of reasons, including resistance against existing antibiotics. As a consequence, several alternatives to antibiotics are currently being considered or reconsidered. Passive immunization (i.e., the administration of more or less pathogen-specific antibodies to the patient) prior to or after exposure to the disease-causing agent is one of those alternative strategies that was almost entirely abandoned with the introduction of chemical antibiotics but that is now gaining interest again. This review will discuss the early successes and limitations of passive immunization, formerly referred to as “serum therapy,” the current use of antibody administration for prophylaxis or treatment of infectious diseases in agriculture, and, finally, recent developments in the field of antibody engineering and “molecular farming of antibodies in various expression systems.

Although demyelination is a common symptom in FRDA patients, no multicellular model has yet been developed to study the involvement of glial cells in FRDA. Using the recently established RNAi lines for targeted suppression of frataxin in Drosophila, we were able to study the effects of general versus glial-specific frataxin downregulation. In particular, we wanted to study the interplay between lowered frataxin content, lipid accumulation and peroxidation and the consequences of these effects on the sensitivity to oxidative stress and fly fitness. Interestingly, ubiquitous frataxin reduction leads to an increase in fatty acids catalyzing an enhancement of lipid peroxidation levels, elevating the intracellular toxic potential. Specific loss of frataxin in glial cells triggers a similar phenotype which can be visualized by accumulating lipid droplets in glial cells. This phenotype is associated with a reduced lifespan, an increased sensitivity to oxidative insult, neurodegenerative effects and a serious impairment of locomotor activity. These symptoms fit very well with our observation of an increase in intracellular toxicity by lipid peroxides. Interestingly, co-expression of a Drosophila apolipoprotein D ortholog (glial lazarillo) has a strong protective effect in our frataxin models, mainly by controlling the level of lipid peroxidation. Our results clearly support a strong involvement of glial cells and lipid peroxidation in the generation of FRDA-like symptoms.","Navarro, Juan A.; Ohmann, Elisabeth; Sanchez, Diego; Botella, José A.; Liebisch, Gerhard; Moltó, María D.; Ganfornina, María D.; Schmitz, Gerd; Schneuwly, Stephan",Hum Mol Genet,71,11

The present studies were designed to characterize 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) mediated epoxide hydrolase elevation and to investigate the relationship between epoxide hydrolase increases, AAF metabolism, and hepatocarcinogenicity. Oral or i.p. administration of AAF to F-344 rats produced log-linear doseresponse curves for epoxide hydrolase elevation, measured with either benzo[a]pyrene-4, 5-oxide or styrene oxide substrate. Following a single dose of AAF (35 mg/kg), epoxide hydrolase activity was maximally increased (560% of control) within 48 h, and the activity declined slowly, with a halflife of 17.5 days. Co-treatment with actinomycin D effectively blocked the AAF dependent increase in epoxide hydrolase, suggesblng that de novo protein synthesis is associated with the increase in enzyme activity. Dose-response curves for epoxide hydrolase induction by AAF, N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (N-OH-AAF), and aminofluorene were compared, and the potencies for increasing epoxide hydrolase activity reflected the relative hepatocarcinogenic potentials of these agents. In mice, which are resistant to the hepatocarcinogenic action of AAF and deficient in AAF-N-hydroxylase activity, AAF caused no significant increase in hepatic microsomal epoxide hydrolase activity. Similarly, in Cotton rats and guinea pigs, which are lacking in ability to form the sulfate conjugate of N-OH-AAF, neither i.p. nor dietary administration of AAF elicited increases in epoxide hydrolase activity at doses which were maximally effective in F-344 rats. These results support the hypothesis that the ability of compounds to increase epoxide hydrolase activity is related to their carcinogenic potency. Furthermore, the results suggest that increases in epoxide hydrolase activity are associated with metabolism of AAF to the putative proximate carcinogen N-OH-AAF, and the subsequent conversion of this compound to the N-O-sulfate conjugate.","Graichen, M.

Mucosal HPVs have evolved mechanisms that impede IFN-β synthesis and downregulate genes induced by IFN. Here we show that these HPV types directly subvert a cellular transcriptional response to IFN-β as a potential boost in infection. Treatment with low levels of human IFN-β induced initial amplification of HPV-16 and HPV-11 plasmid genomes and increased HPV-16 or HPV-31 DNA copy numbers up to 6-fold in HPV-immortalized keratinocytes. IFN treatment also increased early gene transcription from the major early gene promoters in HPV-16, HPV-31 and HPV-11. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the viral genomes and ectopic interferon regulatory factor (IRF) expression in transfection experiments using IRF-1 (−/−) , IRF-2 (−/−) and dual knockout cell lines determined that these responses are due to the activation of IRF-1 interaction with a conserved interferon response element demonstrated in several mucosal HPV early gene promoters. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the varying clinical outcomes of IFN therapy of papillomatoses and define an assay for the modulation of the HPV gene program by IFNs as well as other cytokines and signaling molecules in infection and therapy.","Lace, Michael J.; Anson, James R.; Klingelhutz, Aloysius J.; Harada, Hisashi; Taniguchi, Tadatsugu; Bossler, Aaron D.; Haugen, Thomas H.; Turek, Lubomir P.",Carcinogenesis,71,11

Activation of sensory nerves by both mechanical and chemical stimuli elicits a number of defensive reflexes, including cough, altered breathing pattern, and altered autonomic drive, which are important for normal lung homeostasis. However, diseases that afflict the lung are associated with altered reflexes, resulting in a variety of symptoms, including increased cough, dyspnea, airways obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. This review summarizes the current knowledge concerning the physiological role of different sensory nerve subtypes that innervate the lung, the factors which lead to their activation, and pharmacological approaches that have been used to interrogate the function of these nerves.

Due to a living environment of various stresses and pathological stimuli, podocytes are prone to injuries; moreover, as a cell without proliferative potential, loss of podocytes is vital in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis. Thus, sufficient understanding of factors and underlying mechanisms of podocyte injury facilitates the advancement of treating and prevention of glomerulosclerosis. The clinical symptom of podocyte injury is proteinuria, sometimes with loss of kidney functions progressing to glomerulosclerosis. Injury-induced changes in podocyte physiology and function are actually not a simple passive process, but a complex interaction of proteins that comprise the anatomical structure of podocytes at molecular levels. This chapter lists several aspects of podocyte injuries along with potential mechanisms, including glucose and lipid metabolism disorder, hypertension, RAS activation, micro-inflammation, immune disorder, and other factors. These aspects are not technically separated items, but intertwined with each other in the pathogenesis of podocyte injuries.","Lu, Chen-Chen; Wang, Gui-Hua; Lu, Jian; Chen, Pei-Pei; Zhang, Yang; Hu, Ze-Bo; Ma, Kun-Ling",Renal Fibrosis: Mechanisms and Therapies,71,1

The subsequent impacts of these diseases on human, livestock, and wildlife health, as well as the economic effects, have given international health organizations and national governments a greater appreciation of the importance of collaborative efforts in solving health problems. The One Health concept is not new, but under its umbrella, a new generation of veterinarians, physicians, ecologists, biologists, and social scientists is shaping the concept in novel ways. This has led to increased support for One Health initiatives to control disease by international agencies, national governments, and nongovernmental organizations as well as a growing emphasis on One Health concepts in training the veterinary workforce. Veterinary schools are reorganizing veterinary education to better teach students the precepts of One Health. This chapter explores the evolution and application of the One Health concept from the perspective of the veterinarian. The veterinary profession is positioned to be a strong advocate and leader of One Health. Veterinarians have a long history of involvement with One Health activities, and this involvement has adjusted and shifted with the changing needs of society.

The disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) that lead to abnormal secretions, recurrent infection and inflammation, bronchiectasis, and premature death. Because airways disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis, gene therapy efforts have focused on luminal delivery of vector to the airways of CF patients. Retroviruses are attractive as a gene transfer vector system since integration of the wild-type CFTR cDNA into the host genome may lead to long-term expression and perhaps, a cure. However, simple retroviruses are limited as vectors for airway gene transfer by the low rates of epithelial cell proliferation in human airways (∼0.1–0.2%) combined with the traditionally low titers. Advances in vector design and production have improved titers, and the development of human and animal lentiviruses may help overcome the requirement for cell proliferation.

T cells can serve a variety of functions as part of the host immune response during CNS viral infection. They can participate directly in viral clearance from the brain, or they can promote the survival of the host without exerting any direct effect on virus replication. Only a small number of T cells infiltrate the brain under normal circumstances. This paucity of immune surveillance of baseline is one of several reasons why the CNS has often been characterized as an “immunologically privileged” site. T cell-mediated lysis of infected cells has been demonstrated to be an important mechanism of viral clearance from tissues other than the CNS. In several well-characterized animal models of CNS viral infection, part of the elicited T cell response actually contributes to the pathology and adverse outcome of disease. Neurotropic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection of adult mice is the premier example of this phenomenon.","Irani, David N.; Griffin, Diane E.",Adv Virus Res,71,1

Reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction amplification using this set of degenerate primers yielded products of the expected size from the genomes of all three viruses. It also yielded a product of appropriate size from the genome of another strain of PRRSV (VR2332), the ORF 1b sequence of which is unknown, but the 3′ end of the genome of which differs from that of the PRRSV-LV genome by about 50%. No products were generated from the genome of simian hemorhagic fever virus (SHFV), another member of this virus group.

We used a ZIKV ZsGreen-expressing vector, two lineages of wild-type ZIKV, and other medically important flaviviruses. Benzavir-2 inhibited ZIKV derived reporter gene expression with an EC(50) value of 0.8 ± 0.1 µM. Furthermore, ZIKV plaque formation, progeny virus production, and viral RNA expression were strongly inhibited. In addition, 2.5 µM of benzavir-2 reduced infection in vitro in three to five orders of magnitude for five other flaviviruses: WNV, YFV, the tick-borne encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and dengue virus.

The HAG derivatives [RCHNNHC(NH)NHOH-tosylate] studied could be grouped as; (1) hydroxy-benzylidines; (2) methoxybenzylidines; and (3) nitrobenzylidines substituted at the R position. 2′-Hydroxybenzylidine-HAG, the lead compound, was relatively active in both HT-29 cells and L1210 cells (20 ± 5 and 13 ± 4 μM for 50% inhibition of HT-29 and L1210 cell growth respectively). The monohydroxybenzylidene compounds were generally more active than the dihydroxy- and trihy-droxybenzylidene-HAG derivatives. The methoxybenzylidene-HAGs were as active as the monohy-droxybenzylidene-HAGs. 2′-Hydroxy-4′-methoxybenzylidene-HAG was much more active than 2′,4′-dihydroxybenzylidene-HAG. The mononitrobenzylidene-HAGs were more active than the dinitro-benzylidene-HAG compound. In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the effects of the HAG compounds than were HT-29 cells. There was good agreement between the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells and that required to inhibit the growth of L1210 cells. There was also good correlation between the ability of HAG derivatives to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity and to inhibit tumor cell growth. Some derivatives, such as 2′,3′,4′- and 3′,4′,5′-trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG inhibited L1210 cell growth by 50% at lower concentrations (7.8 and 11.9 μM respectively) than the concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of HT-29 cell growth (196 and 234 μM respectively) and ribonucleotide reductase activity (122 and 188 μM respectively). The studies of nucleic acid synthesis in L1210 cells using [(3)H]cytidine as a precursor showed that 2′,3′,4′-trihy-droxybenzylidine-HAG inhibited DNA synthesis at a lower concentration (29 μM for 50% inhibition) than was needed for the inhibition of RNA synthesis and formation of [(3)H]deoxycytidine nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction (320 and 820 μM for 50% inhibition respectively). These results indicate that 2′,3′,4′-trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG inhibits DNA synthesis in L1210 cells through other mechanisms rather than exclusively through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity.","Masahiko, Matsumoto; Fox, John G.; Pou-Hsiung, Wang; Koneru, Phanesh B.; Lien, Eric J.; Cory, Joseph G.",Biochem Pharmacol,71,1

The current insights into incidence, pathophysiology, diagnostic tools, risk factors, short- and long-term consequences and management of ICU-acquired weakness are narratively reviewed. PubMed was searched for combinations of “neuropathy”, “myopathy”, “neuromyopathy”, or “weakness” with “critical illness”, “critically ill”, “ICU”, “PICU”, “sepsis” or “burn”. ICU-acquired weakness affects limb and respiratory muscles with a widely varying prevalence depending on the study population. Pathophysiology remains incompletely understood but comprises complex structural/functional alterations within myofibers and neurons. Clinical and electrophysiological tools are used for diagnosis, each with advantages and limitations. Risk factors include age, weight, comorbidities, illness severity, organ failure, exposure to drugs negatively affecting myofibers and neurons, immobility and other intensive care-related factors. ICU-acquired weakness increases risk of in-ICU, in-hospital and long-term mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation and of hospitalization and augments healthcare-related costs, increases likelihood of prolonged care in rehabilitation centers and reduces physical function and quality of life in the long term. RCTs have shown preventive impact of avoiding hyperglycemia, of omitting early parenteral nutrition use and of minimizing sedation. Results of studies investigating the impact of early mobilization, neuromuscular electrical stimulation and of pharmacological interventions were inconsistent, with recent systematic reviews/meta-analyses revealing no or only low-quality evidence for benefit.

First, how does it start causing damage? Second, how does it reach the scale of a global catastrophe? Third, how does it reach everyone? In all of these three phases there is a defence layer that blocks most risks: First, we can prevent catastrophes from occurring. Second, we can respond to catastrophes before they reach a global scale. Third, humanity is resilient against extinction even in the face of global catastrophes. The largest probability of extinction is posed when all of these defences are weak, that is, by risks we are unlikely to prevent, unlikely to successfully respond to, and unlikely to be resilient against. We find that it’s usually best to invest significantly into strengthening all three defence layers. We also suggest ways to do so tailored to the classes of risk we identify. Lastly, we discuss the importance of underlying risk factors – events or structural conditions that may weaken the defence layers even without posing a risk of immediate extinction themselves.","Cotton‐Barratt, Owen; Daniel, Max; Sandberg, Anders",Glob Policy,71,28

BCG has also a clear potential for use in animals and, in particular, in the main domestic species subjected to TB control programs, cattle. Nowadays, the use of BCG vaccination against TB in cattle is not permitted by European Union legislation because BCG can induce a cellular immune response producing diagnostic interference in the eradication programs based on tuberculin single and comparative intradermal tests imposed worldwide. In this review, we recall the history of TB vaccination as well as different vaccine trials and the response to vaccination in both domestic and wild animals. Promising potential inactivated vaccines are also reviewed. Research studies are mainly focused to improve vaccine efficacy, and at the same time to ensure its easy administration, safety and stability in the environment. Great challenges remain, particularly in terms of vaccine candidates and also in the acceptance of vaccination. Vaccination should be included in a strategic plan for integrated control of TB under a “one health” perspective, which also includes other measures such as improved biosafety on farms to avoid or decrease contact between domestic and wild animals or control of wildlife reservoirs to avoid overabundance that may favor infection maintenance.","Balseiro, Ana; Thomas, Jobin; Gortázar, Christian; Risalde, María A.",Pathogens,71,1

The blood transcriptome of the children (n = 63) was investigated at time of FN diagnosed as viral, bacterial, co-infection or unknown etiology, respectively, and compared to control samples derived from 12 of the patients following the FN episode. RNA sequencing was successful in 43 (68%) of the FN episodes. Only two genes were significantly differentially expressed in the bacterial versus the control group. Significantly up-regulated genes in patients with the other three etiologies versus the control group were enriched with cellular processes related to proliferation and cellular stress response, with no clear enrichment with innate responses to pathogens. Among the significantly down-regulated genes, a few clustered into pathways connected to responses to infection. In the present study of children during cancer treatment, the blood transcriptome was not suitable for determining the etiology of FN because of too few circulating immune cells for reliable gene expression analysis.","Wahlund, Martina; Sinha, Indranil; Broliden, Kristina; Saghafian-Hedengren, Shanie; Nilsson, Anna; Berggren, Anna",Int J Mol Sci,71,1

The aim of this study was to investigate whether NICU care has changed after introduction of less invasive surfactant administration (LISA), with regard to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the first week of life. METHODS: Infants with gestational age < 32 weeks who received surfactant by LISA (June 2014 – December 2017, n = 169) were retrospectively compared to infants who received surfactant after intubation (January 2012 – May 2014, n = 155). Local protocols on indication for surfactant, early onset sepsis, blood transfusions and enteral feeding did not change between both study periods. Besides, as secondary outcome complications of prematurity were compared. Data was collected from electronic patient files and compared by univariate analysis through Students T-test, Mann Whitney-U test, Pearson Chi-Square test or Linear by Linear Association. RESULTS: All baseline characteristics of both groups were comparable. Compared to controls, LISA patients received a higher total surfactant dose (208 vs.160 mg/kg; p < 0.001), required redosing more frequently (32.5% vs. 21.3%; p = 0.023), but needed less mechanical ventilation (35.5% vs. 76.8%; p < 0.001). After LISA, infants underwent fewer X-rays (1.0 vs. 3.0, p < 0.001), blood gas examinations (3.0 vs. 5.0, p < 0.001), less inotropic drugs (9.5% vs. 18.1%; p = 0.024), blood transfusions (24.9% vs. 41.9%, p = 0.003) and had shorter duration of antibiotic therapy for suspected early onset sepsis (3.0 vs. 5.0 days, p < 0.001). Moreover, enteral feeding was advanced faster (120 vs. 100 mL/kg/d, p = 0.048) at day seven. There were no differences in complications of prematurity. CONCLUSION: The introduction of LISA is associated with significantly fewer diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the first week of life, which emphasizes the beneficial effects of LISA.","Bugter, I.

Faecal samples from vaccinated (N17) and unvaccinated or unknown vaccination status (N41) dogs that had clinical signs of parvovirus infection were tested using three different assays of antigen tests, conventional and quantitative PCR tests. The genotype of each sample was determined by sequencing. In addition to the suspected parvovirus samples, 21 faecal samples from apparently healthy dogs were tested in three diagnostic tests to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the tests. The antigen test was positive in 41.2% of vaccinated dogs and 73.2% of unvaccinated diseased dogs. Conventional PCR and qPCR were positive for canine parvovirus (CPV) in 82.4% of vaccinated dogs and 92.7% of unvaccinated dogs. CPV type-2c (CPV-2c) was detected in 82.75% of dogs (12 vaccinated and 36 unvaccinated dogs), CPV-2b was detected in 5.17% dogs (one vaccinated and two unvaccinated) and CPV-2a in 1.72% vaccinated dog. Mean Ct values in qPCR for vaccinated dogs were higher than the unvaccinated dogs (p = 0.049), suggesting that vaccinated dogs shed less virus, even in clinical forms of CPV. CPV-2c was the dominant subtype infecting dogs in both vaccinated and unvaccinated cases. Faecal antigen testing failed to identify a substantial proportion of CPV-2c infected dogs, likely due to low sensitivity. The faecal samples from apparently healthy dogs (n = 21) showed negative results in all three tests. Negative CPV faecal antigen results should be viewed with caution until they are confirmed by molecular methods.","Yip, Hiu Ying Esther; Peaston, Anne; Woolford, Lucy; Khuu, Shiow Jing; Wallace, Georgia; Kumar, Rohan Suresh; Patel, Kandarp; Ahani Azari, Ania; Akbarzadeh, Malihe; Sharifian, Maryam; Amanollahi, Reza; Jafari Jozani, Razi; Khabiri, Aliakbar; Hemmatzadeh, Farhid",Viruses,71,1

METHODS: We investigated opinions among health professionals working on aging in LACs (N = 3365) with regression models including expertise‐related information (public policies, BI), individual differences (work, age, academic degree), and location. RESULTS: Experts specified low public policy knowledge (X(2) = 41.27, P < .001), high levels of stigma (X(2) = 2636.37, P < .001), almost absent BI knowledge (X(2) = 56.58, P < .001), and needs for regional diagnostic manuals (X(2) = 2893.63, df = 3, P < .001) and data‐sharing platforms (X(2) = 1267.5, df = 3, P < .001).

Achieving sufficient SRHR may be averted if the use of family planning by disadvantaged groups is not given required attention. AIM: This study aimed to identify and analyse the factors associated with the low use of contraceptives amongst vulnerable women in the South West region in Nigeria. SETTING: The study area was purposively chosen to capture contraceptive use amongst vulnerable women in Osun State, Nigeria. METHODS: A primary data collection was done in three senatorial districts of Osun State, Nigeria, with 140 respondents each to give a total of 420 respondents. Collected data were analysed using univariate, bivariate and multivariate measures. RESULTS: The result showed a magnitude of association and relationship at both levels of analyses. Living arrangements and family types were 89% and 88.3%, respectively, associated with family planning use. In the same vein, living arrangement and family types were also statistically significant at p < 0.05with an odds ratio of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.1184–0.4583) and an odds ratio of 0.35 (95% CI: 0.1756–0.6970) with family planning use, respectively. CONCLUSION: We concluded that policies and interventions to accelerate and encourage contraceptives use amongst vulnerable mothers in South West, Nigeria should be targeted at those whose husbands lived elsewhere and those whose husbands have more than one wife.","Bolarinwa, Obasanjo A.; Olagunju, Olalekan S.; Olaniyan, Akintayo T.",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,71,1

Intraoperative margin control (IOMC) modalities such as fast frozen section (FFS), fast paraffin (FP) and Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) are being increasingly widely used, though there is a lack of information regarding utility. The aim of this study was to survey members of the British Oculoplastic Surgery Society (BOPSS) to determine attitudes and access to different modalities of IOMC. METHODS: A 12-question online survey was disseminated via an e-mail to full members of the BOPSS. The survey was hosted using Qualtrics software via the University of Sussex. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 64 of 165 (38.8%). MMS was readily available in a neighbouring trust to 23 of 64 respondents (35.9%). Seven respondents (10.9%) reported no regional access to MMS. Twenty-nine members had readily available access to FFS (45.3%) and 37 of 64 to FP (57.8%) in their own institution. There is variation in what tumour types would be considered appropriate for IOMC, though most thought clinically ill-defined (morphoeic) basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) should undergo one form of IOMC (90.6% and 81.3%, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study highlights variation in availability and utilisation of IOMC amongst oculoplastic surgeons and in different regions of the UK. While the exact place of IOMC in periocular tumour excision is debated, there is a consistent view that it should be available for some tumours. Greater consistency in provision may improve patient outcomes.","Oliphant, Huw; Oliphant, Tom; Clarke, Lucy; Vize, Colin; Rajak, Saul",Eye (Lond),71,1

In mammals, mitophagy is mediated by BNIP3L (also known as NIX) that is a dual regulator of mitochondrial turnover and programmed cell death pathways. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with deficiency of BNIP3L are more sensitive to mitochondria-targeting drugs. But small molecular inhibitors for BNIP3L are currently not available. Some immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) have been proved by FDA for hematologic malignancies, however, the underlining molecular mechanisms are still elusive, which hindered the applications of BNIP3L inhibition for AML treatment. In this study we carried out MS-based quantitative proteomics analysis to identify the potential neosubstrates of a novel thalidomide derivative CC-885 in A549 cells. In total, we quantified 5029 proteins with 36 downregulated in CRBN(+/+) cell after CC-885 administration. Bioinformatic analysis showed that macromitophagy pathway was enriched in the negative pathway after CC-885 treatment. We further found that CC-885 caused both dose- and time-dependent degradation of BNIP3L in CRBN(+/+), but not CRBN(−/−) cell. Thus, our data uncover a novel role of CC-885 in the regulation of mitophagy by targeting BNIP3L for CRL4CRBN E3 ligase-dependent ubiquitination and degradation, suggesting that CC-885 could be used as a selective BNIP3L degradator for the further investigation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CC-885 could enhance AML cell sensitivity to the mitochondria-targeting drug rotenone, suggesting that combining CC-885 and mitochondria-targeting drugs may be a therapeutic strategy for AML patients.","Hao, Bing-bing; Li, Xiao-jing; Jia, Xing-long; Wang, Yu-xing; Zhai, Lin-hui; Li, Duan-zhuo; Liu, Jie; Zhang, Die; Chen, Yu-lu; Xu, Yong-hu; Lee, Sang-kyu; Xu, Guo-feng; Chen, Xiao-hua; Dang, Yong-jun; Liu, Bin; Tan, Min-jia",Acta Pharmacol Sin,71,1

The aim of the present study was to determine sCD40L changes in surgical patients without sepsis (SWS) and surgical sepsis patients (SS) during the first 3 days after intensive care unit (ICU) admission and to observe the association between sCD40L and mortality. METHODS: Time changes in sCD40L levels were assessed for 3 days after ICU admission in 49 patients with SS and compared with those in 19 SWS patients. Serum sCD40L concentration was detected by ELISA. Survival at 28 days served as the endpoint. RESULTS: SS had significantly higher sCD40L levels than SWS and control patients. We observed an association between sCD40L levels ≥1028.75 pg/mL at day 2 and 28-day mortality (odds ratio = 7.888; 95% confidence interval = 1.758 to 35.395; P = 0.007). We could not discover any significant differences in sex, presence of septic shock, site of infection, length of stay in the ICU, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, incidence of AKI, ARDS, or type of surgery between nonsurvivors and survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Septic patients show persistently higher circulating sCD40L levels in the first 3 days after ICU admission, and serum sCD40L levels are associated with the mortality of patients with sepsis.

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were sequentially utilized to find risk factors of AKI in included TBI patients. Nomogram composed of discovered risk factors for predicting AKI was constructed. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were drawn and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were calculated to evaluate the predictive value of cystatin C alone and the constructed nomogram. RESULTS: Among 234 included TBI patients, 55 were divided into AKI group. AKI group had shorter length of stay (p < 0.001) and higher in-hospital mortality (p < 0.001).

While hypertonic saline use was not associated with the development of AKI (p = 0.067). The AUC of single cystatin C and predictive nomogram were 0.804 and 0.925, respectively. CONCLUSION: Higher serum cystatin C is associated with development of AKI in TBI patients. Predictive nomogram incorporating cystatin C is beneficial for physicians to evaluate possibilities of AKI and consequently adjust treatment strategies to avoid occurrence of AKI.","Wang, Ruo Ran; He, Min; Gui, Xiying; Kang, Yan",,71,11

To develop effective neuroprotective strategies, the mechanistic basis for brain injury must be understood. The fragile state of neonates presents unique research challenges; invasive measures of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation assessment exceed tolerable risk profiles. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can safely and non-invasively estimate cerebral oxygenation, a correlate of cerebral perfusion, offering insight into brain injury-related mechanisms. Unfortunately, lack of standardization in device application, recording methods, and error/artifact correction have left the field fractured. In this article, we provide a framework for neonatal NIRS research. Our goal is to provide a rational basis for NIRS data capture and processing that may result in better comparability between studies. It is also intended to serve as a primer for new NIRS researchers and assist with investigation initiation.","Vesoulis, Zachary A.; Mintzer, Jonathan P.; Chock, Valerie Y.",J Perinatol,71,1

However, less is known about these potential obesogenic programming effects in obese humans. We propose three important pathways that may explain obesogenic programming effects of human breastmilk. First, human milk components and hormones may directly affect child eating and satiety characteristics. Second, human milk constituents can affect child microbiota that, in turn, may influence child eating and weight outcomes. Third, human milk composition may affect child eating and weight outcomes through flavor exposure. We reviewed a few very recent findings from well-powered longitudinal or experimental human research with regard to these three pathways. Moreover, we provide a research agenda for future intervention research with the overarching aim to prevent excessive pediatric weight gain during lactation and beyond. The ideas presented in this paper may represent important “black box” constructs that explain obesogenic programming effects during lactation. It should be noted, however, that given the scarcity of studies, findings should be seen as working hypotheses to further test in future research.","Larsen, Junilla K.; Bode, Lars",Nutrients,71,1

In addition, nutrition applied to Orthopedics has developed in recent years, driven by the need to improve the efficiency of the treatment path by enhancing the recovery after surgery. As a result, nutritional sciences have specialized into two distinct fields of research: Nutritional Orthopedics and Space Nutrition. The former primarily deals with the nutritional requirements of old patients in hospitals, whereas the latter focuses on the varied food challenges of space travelers heading to deep space. Although they may seem disconnected, they both investigate similar nutritional issues. This scoping review shows what these two disciplines have in common, highlighting the mutual features between (1) pre-operative vs. pre-launch nutritional programs, (2) hospital-based vs. space station nutritional issues, and (3) post-discharge vs. deep space nutritional resilience. PubMed and Google Scholar were used to collect documents published from 1950 to 2020, from which 44 references were selected on Nutritional Orthopedics and 44 on Space Nutrition. Both the orthopedic patient and the astronaut were found to suffer from food insecurity, malnutrition, musculoskeletal involution, flavor/pleasure issues, fluid shifts, metabolic stresses, and isolation/confinement. Both fields of research aid the planning of demand-driven food systems and advanced nutritional approaches, like tailored diets with nutrients of interest (e.g., vitamin D and calcium). The nutritional features of orthopedic patients on Earth and of astronauts in space are undeniably related. Consequently, it is important to initiate close collaborations between orthopedic nutritionists and space experts, with the musculoskeletal-related dedications playing as common fuel.","Briguglio, Matteo",Nutrients,71,1

In this study we evaluated the validity of the Prevention Impacts Simulation Model (PRISM), a system dynamics model that simulates health, mortality, and economic outcomes for the US population. PRISM primarily simulates outcomes related to cardiovascular disease but also includes outcomes related to other chronic diseases that share risk factors. PRISM is openly available through a web application. METHODS: We applied the model validation framework developed independently by the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research and the Society for Medical Decision Making modeling task force to validate PRISM. This framework included model review by external experts and quantitative data comparison by the study team. RESULTS: External expert review determined that PRISM is based on up-to-date science. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that no parameter affected results by more than 5%. Comparison with other published models, such as ModelHealth, showed that PRISM produces lower estimates of effects and cost savings. Comparison with surveillance data showed that projected model trends in risk factors and outcomes align closely with secular trends. Four measures did not align with surveillance data, and those were recalibrated. CONCLUSION: PRISM is a useful tool to simulate the potential effects and costs of public health interventions. Results of this validation should help assure health policy leaders that PRISM can help support community health program planning and evaluation efforts.","Yarnoff, Benjamin; Honeycutt, Amanda; Bradley, Christina; Khavjou, Olga; Bates, Laurel; Bass, Sarah; Kaufmann, Rachel; Barker, Lawrence; Briss, Peter",Prev Chronic Dis,71,1

Experimental infection in non-human primates can provide additional insight into disease pathogenesis. However, such a model should recapitulate the disease symptoms observed in humans, such as pneumonia and inflammatory cytokine response. While previous studies in macaques have demonstrated the occurrence of typical lesions in the lungs early after infection and a high level of immune activation, progression to severe disease and lethality were rarely observed. Here, we evaluated a routinely used combined route of infection via intra-bronchial, oral, and intra-nasal virus inoculation with aerosolized H5N1 exposure, with or without the regular collection of bronchoalveolar lavages early after infection. Both combined route and aerosol exposure resulted in similar levels of virus replication in nose and throat and similar levels of immune activation, cytokine, and chemokine release in the blood. However, while animals exposed to H5N1 by combined-route inoculation developed severe disease with high lethality, aerosolized exposure resulted in less lesions, as measured by consecutive computed tomography and less fever and lethal disease. In conclusion, not virus levels or immune activation, but route of infection determines fatal outcome for highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza infection.","Mooij, Petra; Stammes, Marieke A.; Mortier, Daniella; Fagrouch, Zahra; van Driel, Nikki; Verschoor, Ernst J.; Kondova, Ivanela; Bogers, Willy M.

Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) are the primary pathogens. We compared otitis media outcomes in infants randomised to either a combination of Synflorix™ (PHiD-CV10, with protein D of NTHi) and Prevenar13™ (PCV13, with 3, 6A, and 19A), with recommended schedules for each vaccine alone. We previously reported superior broader overall immunogenicity of the combination schedule at 7 months, and early superiority of PHiD-CV10 compared to PCV13 at 4 months. METHODS: In an open-label superiority trial, we randomised (1:1:1) Aboriginal infants at 28 to 38 days of age, to either Prevenar13™ (P) at 2–4-6 months (_PPP), Synflorix™ (S) at 2–4-6 months (_SSS), or Synflorix™ at 1–2-4 months plus Prevenar13™ at 6 months (SSSP). Ears were assessed using tympanometry at 1 and 2 months, combined with otoscopy at 4, 6, and 7 months. A worst ear diagnosis was made for each child visit according to a severity hierarchy of normal, otitis media with effusion (OME), acute otitis media without perforation (AOMwoP), AOM with perforation (AOMwiP), and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). RESULTS: Between September 2011 and September 2017, 425 infants were allocated to _PPP(143), _SSS(141) or SSSP(141). Ear assessments were successful in 96% scheduled visits. At 7 months prevalence of any OM was 91, 86, and 90% in the _PPP, _SSS, and SSSP groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in prevalence of any form of otitis media between vaccine groups at any age. Combined group prevalence of any OM was 43, 57, 82, 87, and 89% at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 months of age, respectively. Of 388 infants with ear assessments at 4, 6 and 7 months, 277 (71.4%) had OM that met criteria for specialist referral; rAOM, pOME, or CSOM. CONCLUSIONS: Despite superior broader overall immunogenicity of the combination schedule at 7 months, and early superiority of PHiD-CV10 compared to PCV13 at 4 months, there were no significant differences in prevalence of otitis media nor healthy ears throughout the first months of life.

There are currently no effective treatments against ASFV. ASFV contains a gene encoding a dUTPase (E165R), which is required for viral replication in swine macrophages, making it an attractive target for inhibitor development. However, the full structural details of the ASFV dUTPase and those of the comparable swine enzyme are not available, limiting further insights. Herein, we determine the crystal structures of ASFV dUTPase and swine dUTPase in both their ligand-free and ligand-bound forms. We observe that the swine enzyme employs a classical dUTPase architecture made up of three-subunit active sites, whereas the ASFV enzyme employs a novel two-subunit active site. We then performed a comparative analysis of all dUTPase structures uploaded in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which showed classical and non-classical types were mainly determined by the C-terminal β-strand orientation, and the difference was mainly related to the four amino acids behind motif IV. Thus, our study not only explains the reason for the structural diversity of dUTPase but also reveals how to predict dUTPase type, which may have implications for the dUTPase family. Finally, we tested two dUTPase inhibitors developed for the Plasmodium falciparum dUTPase against the swine and ASFV enzymes. One of these compounds inhibited the ASFV dUTPase at low micromolar concentrations (K(d) = 15.6 μM) and with some selectivity (∼2x) over swine dUTPase. In conclusion, our study expands our understanding of the dUTPase family and may aid in the development of specific ASFV inhibitors.","Liang, Rui; Wang, Gang; Zhang, Ding; Ye, Gang; Li, Mengxia; Shi, Yuejun; Shi, Jiale; Chen, Huanchun; Peng, Guiqing",J Biol Chem,71,7

Fluctuations of carbon dioxide have been associated with adverse neurological outcome in patients with severe respiratory failure requiring extracorporeal organ support. The aim of this study was to investigate whether early hypercapnia is associated with impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation during the acute phase of ARDS. METHODS: Between December 2018 and November 2019, patients who fulfilled the Berlin criteria for ARDS, were enrolled. Patients with a history of central nervous system disorders, cerebrovascular disease, chronic hypercapnia, or a life expectancy of less than 24 h were excluded from study participation. During the acute phase of ARDS, cerebrovascular autoregulation was measured over two time periods for at least 60 min. Based on the values of mean arterial blood pressure and near-infrared spectroscopy, a cerebral autoregulation index (COx) was calculated. The time with impaired cerebral autoregulation was calculated for each measurement and was compared between patients with and without early hypercapnia [defined as an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) ≥ 50 mmHg with a corresponding arterial pH < 7.35 within the first 24 h of ARDS diagnosis]. RESULTS: Of 66 patients included, 117 monitoring episodes were available. The mean age of the study population was 58.5 ± 16 years. 10 patients (15.2%) had mild, 28 (42.4%) moderate, and 28 (42.4%) severe ARDS. Nineteen patients (28.8%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Early hypercapnia was present in 39 patients (59.1%). Multivariable analysis did not show a significant association between early hypercapnia and impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation (B = 0.023 [95% CI − 0.054; 0.100], p = 0.556). Hypocapnia during the monitoring period was significantly associated with impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation [B = 0.155 (95% CI 0.014; 0.296), p = 0.032]. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that moderate permissive hypercapnia during the acute phase of ARDS has no adverse effect on cerebrovascular autoregulation and may be tolerated to a certain extent to achieve low tidal volumes. In contrast, episodes of hypocapnia may compromise cerebral blood flow regulation.

Characteristics of asthma include increased airway resistance and dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation that can manifest in dangerous levels of hypercapnia and acidosis, with significant mortality and morbidity. Severe respiratory distress can lead to endotracheal intubation followed by mechanical ventilation, which can cause increased air trapping with dynamic hyperinflation, predisposing the lungs to barotraumas. CASE PRESENTATION: The present case report describes the use of the minimally invasive ECCO(2)R ProLUNG(®) (Estor) with protective low-tidal-volume ventilation, in a Caucasian patient with near-fatal asthma and with no response to conventional therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Since hypercarbia rather than hypoxemia is the primary abnormality in status asthmaticus, a rescue therapeutic strategy combining the ECCO(2)R membrane ProLUNG(®) (Estor) with ultra-protective low-tidal-volume ventilation can be successfully applied to limit the risk of severe barotrauma during invasive mechanical ventilation. ECCO(2)R ProLUNG(®) is a partial respiratory support technique that, based on the use of an extracorporeal circuit with a gas-exchange membrane, achieves relevant CO(2) clearance directly from the blood using double-lumen venous-venous vascular access, at blood flow in the range of 0.4–1.0 L/minute.","Esposito, Rossella; Esposito, Irene; Imperatore, Francesco; Liguori, Giovanni; Gritti, Fabrizio; Cafora, Chiara; Marsilia, Paolo Francesco; De Cristofaro, Maria",J Med Case Rep,71,1

However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of NK cell function and fulminant hepatitis progression by KCTD9 is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of Kctd9 in regulation of early development, maturation, and function of NK cells using Kctd9-knockout mice. Compared to wild-type mice, Kctd9-deficient mice exhibited impaired NK cell lineage commitment, as evidenced by selective reduction in the refined NK progenitors, and incomplete NK cell maturation, as manifested by a higher proportion of CD11b(−) NK cells and a lower percentage of CD11b(+) NK cells with high proliferative potential. Moreover, Kctd9-depleted NK cells displayed insufficient IFN-γ production, degranulation, and granzyme B production in response to cytokine stimulation, and attenuated cytotoxicity to tumor cells in vitro. The defect in NK cells was further supported by ameliorated liver damage and improved survival in Kctd9-deficient mice following murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) infection, which otherwise leads to immune-mediated fulminant hepatitis, a phenotype homologous to that caused by NK cell depletion in wild-type mice. Further investigation to identify the underlying mechanism revealed that Kctd9 deficiency hindered the expression of transcription factors, including Ets1, Nfil3, Eomes, and Id2 in NK cells. Collectively, our data reveal that Kctd9 acts as a novel regulator for NK cell commitment, maturation, and effector function.","Zhang, Xiaoping; Wang, Peng; Chen, Tao; Yan, Weiming; Guan, Xiaoxu; Shen, Guanxin; Luo, Xiaoping; Wan, Xiaoyang; Ning, Qin",Front Immunol,71,17

Given the rapid growth of human populations in some regions like Costa Rica, pathogens introduced, sustained, and transmitted by domestic carnivores may be particularly important. To better understand the significance of domestic carnivore pathogens for wildlife, we determine the prevalence of infection and possible mechanisms for contact between the two groups. The demographics, role in the household, and pathogens of pet dogs and cats was studied during three annual spay/neuter clinics in San Luis, Costa Rica. Most dogs were owned primarily as pets and guard animals, but ~10% were used for hunting. Cats were owned primarily as pets and for pest control. Both roamed freely outdoors. We detected high prevalences of some pathogens (e.g., carnivore protoparvovirus 1 and Toxoplasma gondii). Some pathogens are known to persist in the environment, which increases the probability of exposure to wild carnivores. This study demonstrated that domestic pets in San Luis, home to a number of protected and endangered wildlife species, are infected with pathogens to which these wild species are potentially susceptible. Additionally, results from our questionnaire support the potential for domestic and wild animal contact, which may result in disease spillover.","Conrad, Joseph; Norman, Jason; Rodriguez, Amalia; Dennis, Patricia M.; Arguedas, Randall; Jimenez, Carlos; Hope, Jenifer G.; Yabsley, Michael J.; Hernandez, Sonia M.",Vet Sci,71,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data came from three Swiss surveys (2009: n = 1105; 2014: n = 1037; 2019: n = 1130) of people aged 65 years and over, each of which was conducted as a standardized telephone interview and combined with an optional written survey. RESULTS: The use of both the internet and mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) increased from 2009 to 2019: in 2009, 37.8% of the respondents used the internet, rising to 74.2% in 2019; however, people over 80 years old used these technologies less frequently. Although more and different internet resources were being used in 2019 than in 2009, the reasons given for not using the internet were similar and included security concerns, claims that using the internet is too complicated and the belief that learning to use it is too difficult. There has also been little change in the attitudes toward technology and the factors explaining internet use. CONCLUSION: Even though the digital transformation is progressing, inequalities in the use of technology remain. Even when these are levelling out, new technologies will likely create new inequalities.","Seifert, Alexander",Z Gerontol Geriatr,71,1

Cooperative publishing arrangements represent a viable path forward for society publishers to transition to OA as the default standard for disseminating research. The traditional article processing charge OA model has introduced sometimes unnavigable financial roadblocks, but cooperative arrangements premised on collective action principles can help to secure long-term stability and prevent the risk of free riding. Investment in cooperative arrangements does not require that cash-strapped libraries discover a new influx of money as their collection budgets continue to shrink, but rather that they purposefully redirect traditional subscription funds toward publishing support. These cooperative arrangements will require a two-way demonstration of trust: On one hand, libraries working together to provide assurances of sustained financial support, and on the other, societies’ willingness to experiment with discarding subscriptions. Organizations such as Society Publishers Coalition and Transitioning Society Publications to Open Access are committed to education about and further development of scalable and cooperative OA publishing models.","Naim, Kamran; Brundy, Curtis; Samberg, Rachael G.",Mol Biol Cell,71,1

Despite a great deal of research in the development and validation of health care AI, only few applications have been actually implemented at the frontlines of clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically review AI applications that have been implemented in real-life clinical practice. METHODS: We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published between January 2010 and May 2020. We also hand searched premier computer science journals and conferences as well as registered clinical trials. Studies were included if they reported AI applications that had been implemented in real-world clinical settings. RESULTS: We identified 51 relevant studies that reported the implementation and evaluation of AI applications in clinical practice, of which 13 adopted a randomized controlled trial design and eight adopted an experimental design. The AI applications targeted various clinical tasks, such as screening or triage (n=16), disease diagnosis (n=16), risk analysis (n=14), and treatment (n=7). The most commonly addressed diseases and conditions were sepsis (n=6), breast cancer (n=5), diabetic retinopathy (n=4), and polyp and adenoma (n=4). Regarding the evaluation outcomes, we found that 26 studies examined the performance of AI applications in clinical settings, 33 studies examined the effect of AI applications on clinician outcomes, 14 studies examined the effect on patient outcomes, and one study examined the economic impact associated with AI implementation. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that research on the clinical implementation of AI applications is still at an early stage despite the great potential.

Missed opportunities of HIV and hepatitis screening are numerous, with language differences being a significant barrier to testing. Several studies have shown that migrants who do not speak the language of the health provider are less likely to get tested, due to health providers’ reluctance to offer a test and to migrants’ reluctance to accept testing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study is to develop a multilingual electronic tool (app) that assists health providers in offering and explaining HIV and hepatitis screenings to migrants with a language barrier and to evaluate its acceptability and impact in terms of public health. METHODS: The study will go through 3 stages: (1) concept development, (2) app development, and (3) app evaluation. A qualitative study has been undertaken to explore language barriers during health care encounters and their effect on communication, specifically when a screening test is offered. In parallel, a systematic review of the literature was conducted to have a comprehensive overlook of electronic tools designed to help health care providers communicate with migrants with a language barrier. To generate a list of items to be translated for inclusion in the app, we will conduct a focus group and Delphi survey. The development of the app will include translation and voice recording of items. The electronic development will also include 3 steps of user testing. The acceptability of the app will be evaluated using the System Usability Scale. Evaluation of the app’s efficacy will consist of a stepped wedge randomized controlled trial. The study will be carried out in 16 centers that treat migrants and offer them screening tests for infectious diseases. The primary outcome is the percentage of screening tests realized. The secondary outcomes are the rate of screening proposal by health professionals, acceptance rate by migrants, number of positive cases using this app, and frequency of use of the app. RESULTS: The app evaluation study received a 3-year grant from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche contre le SIDA et les hépatites virales (ANRS) and from the Office Français de l’Immigration et Intégration (OFII). At the time of publication of this protocol, the initial qualitative study and systematic literature review were completed. CONCLUSIONS: This study will develop an app that assists health providers in offering and explaining HIV and hepatitis screenings to migrants with a language barrier and measure its acceptability and effectiveness in terms of public health. When completed, this app could be distributed to numerous professionals carrying out screening with migrant populations in various health care settings.

Exosomes and ectosomes are two different types of EVs generated by all cell types. Their formation depends on local microdomains assembled in endocytic membranes for exosomes and in the plasma membrane for ectosomes. Further, EV release is a fundamental process required for intercellular communication in both normal physiology and pathological conditions to transmit/exchange bioactive molecules to recipient cells and the extracellular environment. The unique structure and composition of EVs enable them to serve as natural nanocarriers, and their physicochemical properties and biological functions can be used to develop next-generation nano and precision medicine. Knowledge of the cellular processes that govern EVs biology and membrane trafficking is essential for their clinical applications. However, in this rapidly expanding field, much remains unknown regarding EV origin, biogenesis, cargo sorting, and secretion, as well as EV-based theranostic platform generation. Hence, we present a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in biogenesis, membrane trafficking, and functions of EVs, highlighting the impact of nanoparticles and oxidative stress on EVs biogenesis and release and finally emphasizing the role of EVs as nanotherapeutic agents.","Gurunathan, Sangiliyandi; Kang, Min-Hee; Qasim, Muhammad; Khan, Khalid; Kim, Jin-Hoi",Int J Nanomedicine,71,1

However, the relative contributions of the eight ESCRT-III subunits differ between each process. The minimal features of ESCRT-III proteins necessary for function and the role for the multiple ESCRT-III subunits remain unclear. To identify essential features of ESCRT-III subunits, we previously studied the polymerization mechanisms of two ESCRT-III subunits Snf7 and Vps24, identifying the association of the helix-4 region of Snf7 with the helix-1 region of Vps24 (Banjade et al., 2019a). Here, we find that mutations in the helix-1 region of another ESCRT-III subunit Vps2 can functionally replace Vps24 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Engineering and genetic selections revealed the required features of both subunits. Our data allow us to propose three minimal features required for ESCRT-III function – spiral formation, lateral association of the spirals through heteropolymerization, and binding to the AAA + ATPase Vps4 for dynamic remodeling.","Banjade, Sudeep; Shah, Yousuf H; Tang, Shaogeng; Emr, Scott D",,71,1

Bedside measurements may identify responders. STUDY DESIGN: Respiratory measurements (Resistance, Compliance, FiO(2)) and pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) patterns were downloaded from infants <30 weeks gestational age during the first 2 months of life. Mechanically ventilated infants who received albuterol were included (n = 33). Measurements were compared before and after first albuterol. Secondary analyses assessed subsequent doses. RESULTS: Median gestation and birthweight were 25 3/7 weeks and 730 g, respectively. Mean Resistance decreased post-albuterol (p = 0.007). Sixty-eight percent of infants were responders based on decreased Resistance. Compliance and FiO(2) did not significantly differ. Percent time in hypoxemia (SpO(2 )< 85%) decreased post albuterol (p < 0.02). In responders, Resistance changes diminished with subsequent administration (all p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Ventilator resistance decreased in two-thirds of preterm infants, consistent with studies that utilized formal pulmonary function testing. Albuterol had a variable effect on delivered FiO(2); however, hypoxemia may be useful in evaluating albuterol response.","Raffay, Thomas M.; Brasher, Mandy; Place, Brooke C.; Patwardhan, Abhijit; Giannone, Peter J.; Bada, Henrietta; Westgate, Philip M.; Abu Jawdeh, Elie G.",J Perinatol,71,17

In order to assess the impact of diagnostic information on subsequent treatment strategies regarding patient-relevant outcomes, randomized test-treatment studies were introduced. Various designs for randomized test-treatment studies, including an evaluation of biomarkers as part of randomized biomarker-guided treatment studies, are suggested in the literature, but the nomenclature is not consistent. METHODS: The aim was to provide a clear description of the different study designs within a pre-specified framework, considering their underlying assumptions, advantages as well as limitations and derivation of effect sizes required for sample size calculations. Furthermore, an outlook on adaptive designs within randomized test-treatment studies is given. RESULTS: The need to integrate adaptive design procedures in randomized test-treatment studies is apparent. The derivation of effect sizes induces that sample size calculation will always be based on rather vague assumptions resulting in over- or underpowered study results. Therefore, it might be advantageous to conduct a sample size re-estimation based on a nuisance parameter during the ongoing trial. CONCLUSIONS: Due to their increased complexity, compared to common treatment trials, the implementation of randomized test-treatment studies poses practical challenges including a huge uncertainty regarding study parameters like the expected outcome in specific subgroups or disease prevalence which might affect the sample size calculation. Since research on adaptive designs within randomized test-treatment studies is limited so far, further research is recommended.

Defects in the production or actions of specialized pro-resolving mediators are associated with diseases characterized by excess or chronic inflammation. In this article, we review cellular and biochemical mechanisms for specialized pro-resolving mediators in health and in sepsis and the acute respiratory distress syndrome as examples of unrestrained inflammatory responses that result in life-threatening pathology.

This study aims to describe our experience in the rate of application of CRRT, patients' clinical characteristics at admission and CRRT initiation, CRRT prescription, predictors of circuit clotting, short- and long-term outcomes. Methods: A 6-year single center retrospective study in a tertiary PICU. Results: Twenty-eight critically ill patients aged 0 to 18 years received CRRT between January 2012 and December 2017 (1.4% of all patients admitted to PICU). Complete clinical and CRRT technical information were available for 23/28 patients for a total of 101 CRRT sessions. CRRT was started, on average, 40 h (20–160) after PICU admission, mostly because of fluid overload. Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration and systemic heparinization were applied in 83.2 and 71.3% of sessions, respectively. Fifty-nine sessions (58.4%) were complicated by circuit clotting. At multivariate Cox-regression analysis, vascular access caliber larger than 8 Fr [HR 0.37 (0.19–0.72), p = 0.004] and regional citrate anticoagulation strategy [HR 0.14 (0.03–0.60), p = 0.008] were independent protective factors for clotting. PICU mortality rate was 42.8%, and six survivors developed chronic kidney disease (CKD), within an average follow up of 3.5 years. Conclusions: CRRT is uncommonly applied in our PICU, mostly within 2 days after admission and because of fluid overload. Larger vascular access and citrate anticoagulation are independent protective factors for circuit clotting. Patients' PICU mortality rate is high and survival often complicated by CKD development.","Buccione, Emanuele; Guzzi, Francesco; Colosimo, Denise; Tedesco, Brigida; Romagnoli, Stefano; Ricci, Zaccaria; L'Erario, Manuela; Villa, Gianluca",Front Pediatr,71,1

Partial support modes, especially pressure support ventilation, are frequently used in clinical practice but are associated with patient–ventilation asynchrony and deliver fixed levels of assist. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA), a mode of partial ventilatory assist that reduces patient–ventilator asynchrony, may be an alternative for weaning. However, the effects of NAVA on weaning outcomes in clinical practice are unclear. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Library from 2007 to December 2020. Randomized controlled trials and crossover trials that compared NAVA and other modes were identified in this study. The primary outcome was weaning success which was defined as the absence of ventilatory support for more than 48 h. Summary estimates of effect using odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with accompanying 95% confidence interval (CI) were expressed. RESULTS: Seven studies (n = 693 patients) were included. Regarding the primary outcome, patients weaned with NAVA had a higher success rate compared with other partial support modes (OR = 1.93; 95% CI 1.12 to 3.32; P = 0.02). For the secondary outcomes, NAVA may reduce duration of mechanical ventilation (MD = − 2.63; 95% CI − 4.22 to − 1.03; P = 0.001) and hospital mortality (OR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.84; P = 0.004) and prolongs ventilator-free days (MD = 3.48; 95% CI 0.97 to 6.00; P = 0.007) when compared with other modes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the NAVA mode may improve the rate of weaning success compared with other partial support modes for difficult to wean patients.

This ground-breaking experiment challenged a long-standing dogma of irreversible cellular differentiation that prevailed for over a century and enabled the development of methodologies for reversal of differentiation of somatic cells, also known as nuclear reprogramming. Thanks to this new paradigm, novel alternatives for regenerative medicine in humans, improved animal breeding in domestic animals and approaches to species conservation through reproductive methodologies have emerged. Combined with the incorporation of new tools for genetic modification, these novel techniques promise to (i) transform and accelerate our understanding of genetic diseases and the development of targeted therapies through creation of tailored animal models, (ii) provide safe animal cells, tissues and organs for xenotransplantation, (iii) contribute to the preservation of endangered species, and (iv) improve global food security whilst reducing the environmental impact of animal production. This review discusses recent advances that build on the conceptual legacy of nuclear transfer and – when combined with gene editing – will have transformative potential for medicine, biodiversity and sustainable agriculture.

The Healthy Campus Mainz project aims to develop an evidence-based and comprehensive student health management program covering physical, mental, and social health promotion. Hence, an initial health survey was performed in order to identify the students' health concerns and resources. Up until now, it remains unclear which topics to choose in a health survey among university students and which strategies can be recommended to receive an acceptable response rate or representative student sample within a university setting. The present paper contributes to the call for the present research topic “Public Health Promotion in University Students” by describing methods for health assessment. Therefore, the current paper aims to give an empirical example on how to perform a health survey among university students, focusing on (1) choosing topics for the survey and (2) methodological considerations of how to reach the target population. Methods: An online questionnaire including around 270 items was developed covering a comprehensive set of health topics. Participants were recruited via the university email. Mixed channels for survey promotion, such as lecture visits and social media, were used, accompanied by different monetary and non-monetary incentives. Descriptive analyses were performed to describe the sample. Results: A total of 5,006 participants (out of 31,213 registered students) viewed the first page of the questionnaire; of whom, 4,714 continued further. After a manual data cleaning according to the predefined criteria, the final sample was 4,351, demonstrating a response rate of 13.9%. Students from different study disciplines participated. However, some study disciplines showed a low participation rate, hence, making the results not free from some bias. Discussion: This survey is exceptional as it integrates a great variety of health aspects. The incentive strategy demonstrated promising results. Future research should try to improve target-group-specific recruitment strategies for the traditionally underrepresented groups, such as males and specific study disciplines. This would not only include advancing marketing strategies, but also refining the incentive strategy.","Reichel, Jennifer L.; Rigotti, Thomas; Tibubos, Ana Nanette; Werner, Antonia M.; Schäfer, Markus; Edelmann, Dennis; Pfirrmann, Daniel; Deci, Nicole; Beutel, Manfred E.; Stark, Birgit; Simon, Perikles; Letzel, Stephan; Dietz, Pavel",Front Public Health,71,1

The mechanism of GSK-3β allosteric modulators may be considered still vague in terms of elucidating a well-defined binding pocket and a bioactive pose for them. In this context, we propose to reinvestigate and reinforce such knowledge by the application of an extensive set of in silico methodologies, such as cavity detection, ligand 3D shape analysis and docking (with robust validation of corresponding protocols), and molecular dynamics. The results here obtained were consensually consistent in furnishing new structural data, in particular by providing a solid bioactive pose of one of the most representative GSK-3β allosteric modulators.

We report two successful cases for which a combination of two existing techniques, modified Robicsek wire fixation and locked titanium plate fixation, was applied to transverse sternal fracture with flail chest. CASE PRESENTATION: One patient experienced a transverse sternal and rib fracture due to a traffic injury. Flail chest due to a highly displaced transverse sternal fracture made withdrawal of the ventilator impossible. Another patient, who developed fulminant myocarditis, experienced a transverse sternal fracture resulting from chest compression during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Severe paradoxical respiratory movement was a limiting factor for cardiac and respiratory rehabilitation. In both cases, a transverse sternal fracture was difficult to correct non-invasively and indicated surgical repair. The surgical repositioning and fixation greatly contributed to the improvement of the respiratory movement, and the patients were successfully withdrawn ventilator support. CONCLUSION: The combination of modified Robicsek wire fixation and locked titanium plate fixation for a complicated sternal fracture employs the complementary and comparative advantages of each procedure and effective fixation may be achieved.","Fuke, Yoshifumi; Ushijima, Tomoki; Matsuyama, Sho; Kimura, Satoshi; Sonoda, Hiromichi; Osawa, Sayaka; Maki, Jun; Tokuda, Kentaro; Momii, Kenta; Shiose, Akira",Surg Case Rep,71,1

Beyond their many advantages, stents also have their limitations and complications. Allergic reactions to coronary stents are more common than acknowledged. These stented patients are exposed to foreign substances inserted in direct contact with the coronary intima. Hypersensitivity to stent components and drugs prescribed after stent insertion together with any environmental exposure seem to contribute to these adverse reactions. Patients can present to the hospital with a wide range of symptoms and multiple complications, the most important ones being instent restenosis and stent thrombosis. Although not very common (and not always easy to identify), allergic reactions after coronary or peripheral stents should be taken into account. Careful selection of patients (for elective stent implantation) depending on the propensity to allergies, although hard to achieve, represents a key factor in reducing the number of these complications.","Chioncel, Valentin; Andrei, Catalina Liliana; Brezeanu, Radu; Sinescu, Crina; Avram, Anamaria; Tatu, Alin Laurentiu",Int J Gen Med,71,1

We have investigated the effect of cumulative dose and duration of glucocorticoids on blood pressure and renal function in VLBW infants. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, medical records of infants (GA ≤ 35 weeks) born January 2015 to December 2019 were reviewed to extract demographic and clinical characteristics, dose and duration of steroids, blood pressure (BP), and creatinine at the time of discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-three neonates with average GA (28 ± 3 weeks) and birthweight (1060±381 g). Twenty-eight percent (33/116) of infants who received postnatal steroids developed hypertension versus 16% (27/167) of controls (OR = 2.0, p = 0.011). There was a correlation between the cumulative dosage of postnatal steroids and systolic BP (R(2) = 0.06, p < 0.001). With increasing steroid dose and total steroid days, there was a significant increase in creatinine clearance at the time of discharge (R(2) = 0.13, p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.13, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative dose of postnatal steroids and duration of use is associated with increased systolic BP in premature infants. Postnatal steroids should be used prudently to prevent long-term cardiovascular and renal morbidity. IMPACT: Preterm neonates are exposed to a high dose of glucocorticoids during their neonatal intensive care stay. The dose and duration of use of postnatal glucocorticoids was associated with significant increase in blood pressure at the time of discharge in preterm neonates. Postnatal glucocorticoid use is associated with improved creatinine clearance likely due to a state of hyperfiltration and may lead to chronic kidney disease later in life. Postnatal glucocorticoids should be used prudently in this highly vulnerable population.","Mhanna, Christiane; Pinto, Merlin; Koechley, Hannah; Kannekanti, Naveen; Raina, Rupesh; Parimi, Prabhu; Shekhawat, Prem",Pediatr Res,71,11

Although there is increasing evidence suggesting a strong association between neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and mental illness, there is a relative lack of information on BUD’s impact on the mental health and quality of life (QoL) of affected individuals in Ghana. This study is to assess the impact of BUD on mental health and quality of life of patients with active and past BUD infection, and their caregivers. METHODS: We conducted a case control study in 3 BUD endemic districts in Ghana between August and November 2019. Face-to-face structured questionnaire-based interviews were conducted on BUD patients with active and past infection, as well as caregivers of BUD patients using WHO Quality of Life scale, WHO Disability Assessment Schedule, Self-Reporting Questionnaire, Buruli Ulcer Functional Limitation Score and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale data tools. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the characteristics of the study participants. Participant groups were compared using student t test and chi-square (χ(2)) or Fisher’s exact tests. Mean quality of life scores are reported with their respective 95% confidence intervals. Data was analysed using STATA statistical software. RESULTS: Our results show that BUD patients with active and past infection, along with their caregivers, face significant levels of distress and mental health sequelae compared to controls. Depression (P = 0.003) was more common in participants with active (27%) and past BU infection (17%), compared to controls (0%). Anxiety was found in 42% (11/26) and 20% (6/29) of participants with active and past BUD infection compared to 14% (5/36) of controls. Quality of life was also significantly diminished in active BUD infection, compared to controls. In the physical health domain, mean QoL scores were 54 ± 11.1 and 56 ± 11.0 (95% CI: 49.5‒58.5 and 52.2‒59.7) respectively for participants with active infection and controls. Similarly in the psychological domain, scores were lower for active infection than controls [57.1 ± 15.2 (95% CI: 50.9‒63.2) vs 64.7 ± 11.6 (95% CI: 60.8‒68.6)]. Participants with past infection had high QoL scores in both physical [61.3 ± 13.5 (95% CI: 56.1‒66.5)] and psychological health domains [68.4 ± 14.6 (95% CI: 62.7‒74.0)]. CONCLUSIONS: BUD is associated with significant mental health distress and reduced quality of life in affected persons and their caregivers in Ghana. There is a need for integration of psychosocial interventions in the management of the disease.

The Ebola virus IFN antagonist VP24 mediates nucleocapsid assembly, and inhibits IFN-activated signaling by preventing nuclear import of STAT1 via competitive binding to nuclear import receptors (karyopherins). Proteins of many viruses, including viruses with cytoplasmic replication cycles, interact with nuclear trafficking machinery to undergo nucleocytoplasmic transport, with key roles in pathogenesis; however, despite established karyopherin interaction, potential nuclear trafficking of VP24 has not been investigated. We find that inhibition of nuclear export pathways or overexpression of VP24-binding karyopherin results in nuclear localization of VP24. Molecular mapping indicates that cytoplasmic localization of VP24 depends on a CRM1-dependent nuclear export sequence at the VP24 C-terminus. Nuclear export is not required for STAT1 antagonism, consistent with competitive karyopherin binding being the principal antagonistic mechanism, while export mediates return of nuclear VP24 to the cytoplasm where replication/nucleocapsid assembly occurs.","Harrison, Angela R.; David, Cassandra T.; Rawlinson, Stephen M.; Moseley, Gregory W.",Viruses,71,1

The aim of the present study was to investigate treatment methods of gastroschisis in four university hospitals in Finland. METHODS: The data of neonates with gastroschisis born between 1993 and 2015 were collected. The primary outcomes were short and long-term mortality and the length of stay (LOS). Statistical analyses consisted of uni- and multivariate models. RESULTS: Total of 154 patients were included (range from 31 to 52 in each hospital). There were no statistically significant differences in mortality or LOS between centers. Significant differences were observed between the hospitals in the duration of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.046), time to full enteral nutrition (p = 0.043), delay until full defect closure (p = 0.003), central line sepsis (p = 0.025), abdominal compartment syndrome (p = 0.018), number of abdominal operations during initial hospitalization (p = 0.000) and follow-up (p = 0.000), and ventral hernia at follow-up (p = 0.000). In a Cox multivariate analysis, the treating hospital was not associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: There were no differences in short or long-term mortality between four university hospitals in Finland. However, some inter-hospital variation in postoperative outcomes was present.

The leaves are opposite, hairy and green in color. Flowers possess fragrant aromatic odors and exist in inflorescences of 4–15 cm long corymbose cyme-type. In-depth morphological and anatomical characterization revealed the great resemblance to plants of the genus Premna and of the family Lamiaceae, such as the presence of glandular peltate trichomes and diacytic stomata. Additionally, most examined organs are characterized by non-glandular multicellular covering trichomes, acicular, and rhombic calcium oxalate crystals. P. odorata leaves n-hexane fraction revealed substantial anti-tuberculous potential versus Mycobacterium tuberculosis, showing a minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of 100 μg/mL. Metabolic profiling of the n-hexane fraction using gas-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis revealed 10 major compounds accounting for 93.01%, with trans-phytol constituting the major compound (24.06%). The virtual screening revealed that trans-phytol highly inhibited MTB C171Q receptor as M. tuberculosis KasA (β-ketoacyl synthases) with a high fitting score (∆G = −15.57 kcal/mol) approaching that of isoniazid and exceeding that of thiolactomycin, the co-crystallized ligand. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity predictions (ADME/TOPKAT) revealed that trans-phytol shows lower solubility and absorption levels when compared to thiolactomycin and isoniazid. Still, it is safer, causing no mutagenic or carcinogenic effects with higher lethal dose, which causes the death of 50% (LD50). Thus, it can be concluded that P. odorata can act as a source of lead entities to treat tuberculosis.","Youssef, Fadia S.; Ovidi, Elisa; Musayeib, Nawal M.

This natural mechanism has historically been a diagnostic marker for paramyxovirus infection in vivo and is now widely used for the study of virus-induced membrane fusion in vitro. However, the role of syncytium formation in within-host dissemination and pathogenicity of viruses remains poorly understood. The diversity of henipaviruses and their wide host range and tissue tropism make them particularly appropriate models with which to characterize the drivers of syncytium formation and the implications for virus fitness and pathogenicity. Based on the henipavirus literature, we summarized current knowledge on the mechanisms driving syncytium formation, mostly acquired from in vitro studies, and on the in vivo distribution of syncytia. While these data suggest that syncytium formation widely occurs across henipaviruses, hosts, and tissues, we identified important data gaps that undermined our understanding of the role of syncytium formation in virus pathogenesis. Based on these observations, we propose solutions of varying complexity to fill these data gaps, from better practices in data archiving and publication for in vivo studies, to experimental approaches in vitro.","Gamble, Amandine; Yeo, Yao Yu; Butler, Aubrey A.; Tang, Hubert; Snedden, Celine E.; Mason, Christian T.; Buchholz, David W.; Bingham, John; Aguilar, Hector C.; Lloyd-Smith, James O.",Viruses,71,1

A significant number of health services are delivered due to public hospitals. Under the World Bank program “Improving Quality and Efficiency of Health Services: Program for Results”, the competent bodies in Croatia aimed to identify the top 40% best-performing public acute hospitals in Croatia, based on a clinical audit in the preceding 12 months. This paper presents how this goal was achieved, using a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. A MCDM approach was selected due to the multidimensionality and complexity of healthcare performance and service quality. We aimed to develop a methodology for ranking top-performing hospitals at the national level. We chose the composite indicator methodology, combined with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) as a tool for determining weights for aggregation of individual indicators. The study looked at three clinical entities: acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular insult, and antimicrobial prophylaxis in colorectal surgery. Indicators for each entity were evidence-based, following the national guidelines, but limited by availability of data. The clinical audit and databases of competent administrative bodies were used as sources of data. The problem investigated in this paper has a significant impact at the strategic (national) level. Even though the AHP has already been applied in the public health domain, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the AHP in combination with composite indicators for hospital ranking at a national level. The AHP enabled participation of experts from the audited hospitals in the assessment of indicator weights. Results show that composite indicators can be successfully implemented for acute hospital evaluation using the AHP methodology: (1) the AHP supported a flexible structuring of the problem; (2) the resulting complexity of pairwise comparisons was appropriate for the experts (consistency ratios were under 0.1); (3) using the AHP approach enabled a successful aggregation of different opinions into group priorities; (4) the developed methodology was robust and enabled identifying the top 40% ranking best-performing public acute hospitals in Croatia combining 20 criteria within three entities, based on input from 36 clinical experts. The proposed methodology can be useful to other researchers for assessment of healthcare quality at the strategic level.","Kadoić, Nikola; Šimić, Diana; Mesarić, Jasna; Ređep, Nina Begičević",Int J Environ Res Public Health,71,1

Environmental and climate changes, intensification of livestock production, modification in land-use and agricultural practices, globalization of human travel, the development of the trade of livestock and livestock products have created conditions for an increase in the emergence and re-emergence of infectious agents in the last decades (Weiss and McMichael 2004; Randolph and Rogers 2010; Jones et al. 2008; Gibbs 2005). The frequency of emergence of new highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) has increased over the past 20 years, as well as the economic impact of associated outbreaks (Alexander and Brown 2009). Bluetongue virus serotypes have continuously increased their spatial distribution, specifically in a northern direction. Treatment-resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), have appeared. Numerous infectious diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) are endemic in many parts of the world, and may have a high impact on animal health and farmer livelihood. Moreover, they constrain the ability of affected countries to trade livestock and livestock-derived products. Production systems in developed countries are also vulnerable. For example, outbreaks of FMD in United Kingdom in 2001, classical swine fever in Holland in 1997/1998, and highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N7 in Holland in 2003 resulted in the loss of millions of animals, mainly as a result of culling of affected and exposed animals. Finally, infectious livestock diseases are a threat for public health: about 75% of human infectious agents that emerged in the last 25 years had an animal origin (King et al. 2006).","Fournié, Guillaume; Walker, Patrick; Porphyre, Thibaud; Métras, Raphaëlle; Pfeiffer, Dirk",Health and Animal Agriculture in Developing Countries,71,7

They are believed to play a central role in evolution, are responsible for various human diseases, and have important contributions to biotechnology and nanotechnology. Viruses undergo evolutionary selection for efficient transmission from host to host by exploiting the host’s gene expression machinery (e.g., ribosomes) for the expression of the genes encoded in their genomes. As a result, viral genes tend to be expressed via non-canonical mechanisms that are very rare in living organisms. Many of the gene expression stages and other aspects of the viral life cycle are encoded in the viral transcripts via ‘silent codes’, and are induced by mutations that are synonymous to the viral amino acid content. In a series of studies that included the analyses of dozens of organisms from the three domains of life, it was shown that there are overlapping ‘silent codes’ in the genetic code that are related to all stages of gene expression regulation. The aim of this chapter is to summarize the current knowledge related to the silent codes in viral genomes and the open questions in the field.","Goz, Eli; Zur, Hadas; Tuller, Tamir","Evolutionary Biology: Self/Nonself Evolution, Species and Complex Traits Evolution, Methods and Concepts",71,11

For silencing of specific genes involved in cell cycle, small/short interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) are being used clinically. The siRNA-based RNAi is more efficient, specific and safe antisense technology than other RNAi approaches. The route of siRNA administration for siRNA therapy depends on the targeted site. However, certain hurdles like poor stability of siRNA, saturation, off-target effect, immunogenicity, anatomical barriers and non-targeted delivery restrict the successful siRNA therapy. Thus, advancement of an effective, secure, and long-term delivery system is prerequisite to the medical utilization of siRNA. Polycationic nanocarriers mediated targeted delivery system is an ideal system to remove these hurdles and to increase the blood retention time and rate of intracellular permeability. In this chapter, we will mainly discuss the different biocompatible, biodegradable, non-toxic (organic, inorganic and hybrid) nanocarriers that encapsulate and shield the siRNA from the different harsh environment and provides the increased systemic siRNA delivery.","Gupta, Nitin; Rai, Divya Bharti; Jangid, Ashok Kumar; Pooja, Deep; Kulhari, Hitesh",Nanotechnology in Modern Animal Biotechnology,71,1

This is due to a decline in the functions of the immune system referred to as immunosenescence. The first part of this chapter will therefore summarize the status quo of the efficacy of vaccines in preventing morbidity and mortality caused by typical infectious diseases in the elderly, such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis. The second part will then elucidate the underlying age-related mechanisms which may contribute to the decreased efficacy of vaccines.

A municipality and its public health services have to be prepared to adapt to their preparations to deal with what contemporary experiences and history reveal are the most likely physical hazards and diseases to impact it. The two main preparatives are first to be able to care for the injured during a hazard event at well-staffed and supplied hospitals and medical clinics or field hospitals. The second is to fill the basic needs of affected populations with clean water, food, shelter, toilets, waste collection, and if necessary power restoration. These primary responses will help to reduce the chance of an onset and spread of disease. It is important to activate search and rescue teams help citizens isolated or trapped by the event that did not or could not evacuate such as in the case of extreme weather and flooding. In addition, where there have been deaths, bodies should be recovered and interred as soon as possible in order to prevent sickness that might originate from them. For instances of collapsed structures with people trapped inside, equipment that can move debris and rescue people or recover the deceased is necessary as would be the case for less common strong earthquakes as well as some extreme storm events. What was just described may be a good template to follow, but in reality, many sea coast cities in developing and less developed countries do not have the resources to cope with severe hazards that might impact them.

GP is a class I fusion protein that forms trimeric spikes composed of heterodimers of the subunits GP1 and GP2. GP1 and GP2 are derived from the precursor pre-GP by furin cleavage during exocytosis. GP1 contains a receptor-binding core topped by a glycan cap and a heavily glycosylated mucin-like domain, while GP2 contains a fusion loop and a membrane anchor. After entering cells by macropinocytosis, the glycan cap and the mucin-like domain are removed from GP1 by endosomal cathepsins B and L exposing the binding site for the Niemann-Pick C1 receptor. It appears that there is no strict requirement for specific proteases involved in GP processing. Thus, furin is not indispensible for GP1-2 cleavage, and GP1 may be trimmed not only by cathepsins B and L but also by other endosomal proteases. Two soluble glycoproteins of Ebola virus are also processed by host proteases. A significant amount of GP1,2 is cleaved by the metalloprotease TACE and shed from the surface of infected cells (GP1,2 delta).

Some nutritional factors (zinc and selenium) may remodel these changes leading to a possible escaping of diseases with subsequent healthy ageing, because they are especially involved in improving immune functions as well as antioxidant defense. Experiments performed “in vitro” (human lymphocytes exposed to endotoxins) and “in vivo” (old mice or young mice fed with low zinc dietary intake) show that zinc is important for immune response both innate and adoptive. Selenium provokes zinc release by Metallothioneins (MT), via reduction of glutathione peroxidase. This fact is crucial in ageing because high MT may be unable to release zinc with subsequent low intracellular free zinc ion availability for immune response. Taking into account the existence of zinc transporters (ZnT and ZIP family) for cellular zinc efflux and influx, respectively, the association between ZnT and MT is important in maintaining satisfactory intracellular zinc homeostasis in ageing. Improved immune performance occur in elderly after physiological zinc supplementation, which also induces prolonged survival in old, nude and neonatal thymectomized mice. The association “zinc plus selenium” improves humoral immunity in old subjects after influenza vaccination. Therefore, zinc and selenium are relevant for immunosenescence in order to achieve healthy ageing and longevity.","Mocchegiani, Eugenio; Malavolta, Marco",Handbook on Immunosenescence,71,1

This hypothesis implies that factors in the environment can determine the initiation of allergic sensitization and can potentially influence the clinical manifestations and severity of disease. Because the prevalence of atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy have increased worldwide in the past several decades, and there is no mechanism for changes in population genetics over this short period of time, changes in the human environment are most likely responsible for these trends. From this line of reasoning, it follows that if the factors responsible for the increasing prevalence can be identified, then there would be an opportunity to develop strategies to reverse these trends. It also would be helpful to identify infants who are at risk for developing allergy, so that preventive strategies could be used most effectively. In this article, studies to determine the contributions of genetics and the environment to the development of allergic diseases in childhood are explored.

While there are strong baselines in the literature that exploit learning to rank and semantic matching techniques, there are still a set of hard queries that are difficult for these baseline methods to address. We find that such hard queries are those whose constituting tokens (i.e., terms or entities) are not fully or partially observed in the relevant tables. We focus on proposing a latent factor model to address such hard queries. Our proposed model factorizes the token-table co-occurrence matrix into two low dimensional latent factor matrices that can be used for measuring table and query similarity even if no shared tokens exist between them. We find that the variation of our proposed model that considers keywords provides statistically significant improvement over three strong baselines in terms of NDCG and ERR.","Bagheri, Ebrahim; Al-Obeidat, Feras",Advances in Information Retrieval,71,1

Lab, which is part of the 2020 Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF). CheckThat! proposes four complementary tasks and a related task from previous lab editions, offered in English, Arabic, and Spanish. Task 1 asks to predict which tweets in a Twitter stream are worth fact-checking. Task 2 asks to determine whether a claim posted in a tweet can be verified using a set of previously fact-checked claims. Task 3 asks to retrieve text snippets from a given set of Web pages that would be useful for verifying a target tweet’s claim. Task 4 asks to predict the veracity of a target tweet’s claim using a set of potentially-relevant Web pages. Finally, the lab offers a fifth task that asks to predict the check-worthiness of the claims made in English political debates and speeches. CheckThat! features a full evaluation framework. The evaluation is carried out using mean average precision or precision at rank k for ranking tasks, and F[Formula: see text] for classification tasks.","Barrón-Cedeño, Alberto; Elsayed, Tamer; Nakov, Preslav; Da San Martino, Giovanni; Hasanain, Maram; Suwaileh, Reem; Haouari, Fatima",Advances in Information Retrieval,71,1

The concept and ideas of ANT offer a meaningful approach to addressing the hybridity and heterogeneity of complex assemblages of risk. Furthermore, the theory provides a theoretical vocabulary to analyse settings of risk and disasters. Especially for ex post analysis of disasters, ANT is able to identify errors in process chains and management practice. In this regard, it deals with questions of stability/instability in management and organisations within the broader context of risk governance. The article discusses the following questions from an ANT perspective: What is ‘risk’ and how can it be managed? What are the general implications and benefits of an ANT approach to disaster risk management? In what ways does an ANT approach challenge some of the conventional wisdoms in the field of disaster risk management? The article shows the potential of ANT as an analytical tool in disaster risk management and as a tool for planning, design and decision-making.","Neisser, Florian M",,71,1

This, in combination with the importance of Greylags as a hunting target, has called for demographic estimates for the population to assist in management decisions. To this end, we analysed long‐term mark–recapture data using Cormack–Jolly‐Seber models embedded in program MARK to obtain survival estimates for the population. No sex‐specific difference, or age effect on survival after juveniles had completed their first migration (3 months of age), was evident. Mean first‐year survival was reported as 0.485 and annual survival of older birds as 0.700. On a monthly basis, survival in Greylags during summer and winter was very similar over the study period. A significant linear decline in winter survival from 0.909 to 0.807 was, however, apparent during the study period. Over the second half of the study (1994–2002), summer survival was about 3% lower than in the first half (1986–94) but no linear relationship was evident. We found a significant inverse relationship between Greylag survival during summer and latitudinal distribution in Norway. A similar relationship was evident between survival and annual bag numbers. The changes in adult survival observed in this study are likely to have had a substantial impact on the growth rate of the Norwegian Greylag population.","PISTORIUS, PIERRE A.; FOLLESTAD, ARNE; TAYLOR, FRANCES E.",Ibis (Lond 1859),71,1

METHODS: The P. aeruginosa-multiple cross displacement amplification (PA-MCDA) assay was conducted at an isothermal temperature during the amplification stage, and products were visually detected by color changes. The entire process was completed within 1 h. A total of 77 strains, including P. aeruginosa species and various other species of non-P. aeruginosa, were used to evaluate PA-MCDA assays. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of suspected VAP patients was examined by the MCDA assay. RESULTS: The MCDA assay exhibited a 100% analytical specificity in detecting PA from all 77 strains, and the limit of detection was as low as 100 fg DNA per reaction. A temperature of 65 °C was recommended as standard during the amplification stage. The agreement between PA-MCDA and bacteria culture was 91.18% (κ = 0.787; p = 0.000) in the identification of P. aeruginosa in BALF from suspected VAP. The PA-MCDA assay showed values of 92.31%, 90.78%, 77.41%, and 97.18% for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, respectively. PA-MCDA had a higher detective rate of P. aeruginosa than bacteria culture in patients with antipseudomonal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument-free platform of the MCDA assay makes it a simple, rapid, and applicable procedure for “on-site” diagnosis and point-of-care testing for the presence of P. aeruginosa without the need for specific bacterial culture.","Wang, Juxiang; Chen, Huimin; Lin, Xiaomin; Ji, Chengyi; Chen, Bin",Crit Care,71,19

However, we know relatively little about dissemination and scale-up of parenting programs, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The scale-up of two parenting programs, Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH) for Young Children and PLH for Parents and Teens, developed under Creative Commons licensing and tested in randomized trials, provides a unique opportunity to study their dissemination in 25 LMICs. METHODS: The Scale-Up of Parenting Evaluation Research (SUPER) study uses a range of methods to study the dissemination of these two programs. The study will examine (1) process and extent of dissemination and scale-up, (2) how the programs are implemented and factors associated with variation in implementation, (3) violence against children and family outcomes before and after program implementation, (4) barriers and facilitators to sustained program delivery, and (5) costs and resources needed for implementation. Primary data collection, focused on three case study projects, will include interviews and focus groups with program facilitators, coordinators, funders, and other stakeholders, and a summary of key organizational characteristics. Program reports and budgets will be reviewed as part of relevant contextual information. Secondary data analysis of routine data collected within ongoing implementation and existing research studies will explore family enrolment and attendance, as well as family reports of parenting practices, violence against children, child behavior, and child and caregiver wellbeing before and after program participation. We will also examine data on staff sociodemographic and professional background, and their competent adherence to the program, collected as part of staff training and certification. DISCUSSION: This project will be the first study of its kind to draw on multiple data sources and methods to examine the dissemination and scale-up of a parenting program across multiple LMIC contexts. While this study reports on the implementation of two specific parenting programs, we anticipate that our findings will be of relevance across the field of parenting, as well as other violence prevention and social programs.","Shenderovich, Yulia; Ward, Catherine L.; Lachman, Jamie M.; Wessels, Inge; Sacolo-Gwebu, Hlengiwe; Okop, Kufre; Oliver, Daniel; Ngcobo, Lindokuhle L.; Tomlinson, Mark; Fang, Zuyi; Janowski, Roselinde; Hutchings, Judy; Gardner, Frances; Cluver, Lucie",Implement Sci Commun,71,19

However, there are also concerns about complications that can arise with intubation; it is still unknown which cases do not require intubation. CASE PRESENTATION: An 88-year-old woman slipped and was found prone and was transported to the emergency room. She was alert without any stridor. Physical examination revealed a subcutaneous hematoma in the anterior cervical region. Computed tomography revealed a retropharyngeal hematoma. Angiography and computed tomography angiography showed extravasation from the right costocervical trunk. A radiologist performed trans-arterial embolization, and she had an uneventful course without intubation or developing any complication. She became ambulatory on postoperative day 5. CONCLUSION: Angiography and computed tomography angiography help in early recognition of extravasation in retropharyngeal hematoma, and trans-arterial embolization can help to avoid intubation and its complications.","Sugiura, Gaku; Takahashi, Hiroyuki; Kodama, Yoshihisa; Nara, Satoshi",Int J Emerg Med,71,11

But in one critical respect—in extracting causal relationships—that epistemic distinction is not warranted. Whether they are situated in the past or future, causal arguments in economics depend equally on counterfactual reasoning. Counterfactualizing entails the construction of fictitious narratives—narratives about worlds that do not exist. Unfortunately, there is no dependable method for ascertaining the uniquely correct counterfactual. This implies that causal claims in economics, too, are irreducibly fictitious. The chief value of counterfactuals, then, is not to prove causation but to help scholars and practitioners confront an inscrutable world—to imagine and prepare for unknowable possible futures. In this endeavor, economic pluralism, which expands the range of plausible counterfactuals, is to be taken as a virtue rather than a curse.","DeMartino, George F.",Rev Evol Polit Econ,71,5

These two strains of MRSA, referred to as staph, have been a serious problem in hospitals and it is known that they give rise to more deaths per year than AIDS. Hence, the transmission dynamics determining whether the CA-MRSA overtakes HA-MRSA is analyzed by means of a non-local fractional derivative. We show the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the fractional staph infection model through fixed-point theorems. Moreover, stability analysis and iterative solutions are furnished by the recursive procedure. We make use of the parameter values obtained from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Analysis of the model under investigation shows that the disease-free equilibrium existing for all parameters is globally asymptotically stable when both [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are less than one. We also carry out the sensitivity analysis to identify the most sensitive parameters for controlling the spread of the infection. Additionally, the solution for the above-mentioned model is obtained by the Laplace-Adomian decomposition method and various simulations are performed by using convenient fractional-order [Formula: see text] .","Acay, Bahar; Inc, Mustafa; Khan, Amir; Yusuf, Abdullahi",J Appl Math Comput,71,1

Three key points are located: (a) An integrative biopsychosocial approach considering both the clinical and personal recovery perspectives is relevant for research and practice. (b) Barriers in implementing a recovery-oriented approach include both individual and systemic challenges. This is well documented in the research-based literature, highlighting the need for changes. (c) A shift from professional control to a service-user orientation is seen as crucial. Examples of a positive shift are seen, helping the health professionals in their development and practicing of skills and competences through education and personal formation. Within these perspectives, a paradigm shift from a one-dimensional biomedical approach to a biopsychosocial approach is suggested. Instead of focusing on rapid stabilisation and symptom relief as a clinical outcome, a humanistic approach building on social- and person-oriented values is fundamental for social and personal recovery leading to a meaningful life.","Damsgaard, Janne Brammer; Angel, Sanne",Int J Environ Res Public Health,71,1

The request for new ICU beds has risen worldwide, due to the rapid spreading of the infection and was faced with structural and functional reorganization of preexisting spaces and to the creation of new facilities. The necessity to minimize in-hospital spreading of the infection and to ensure adequate management of patients were both crucial in reconsidering the logistic of preexisting and new spaces and equipment allocation. Despite limited evidence from COVID-19 patients, clinical management evolved according to local experience and guidelines released by national and international committees and scientific societies. In the majority of cases, initial therapeutic strategies were based on adapting available recommendations regarding “similar diseases” (e.g., sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome-ARDS, etc.). Subsequently, new evidence highlighted specific features of COVID-19 and were implemented into previously released guidelines. These include ICU admission, respiratory support, management of hemodynamic failure, and appropriate adjuvant therapies (coagulopathy, nutrition, associated infections). Furthermore, the COVID-19 surge shaded a new light on the relevance of dedicated communication needs for both healthcare providers and patients.","Alessandri, F.; Giordano, G.; Magnanimi, E.; Bilotta, F.",Clinical Synopsis of COVID-19,71,1

One challenge for this task is that all current algorithms resort to floating-point arithmetic (FPA) at some point, which has numerous drawbacks in practice: it requires numerical stability analysis, extra storage for high-precision, lazy/backtracking techniques for efficiency, and may suffer from weak determinism which can completely break certain schemes. In this paper, we give techniques to implement Gaussian sampling over general lattices without using FPA. To this end, we revisit the approach of Peikert, using perturbation sampling. Peikert’s approach uses continuous Gaussian sampling and some decomposition [Formula: see text] of the target covariance matrix [Formula: see text] . The suggested decomposition, e.g. the Cholesky decomposition, gives rise to a square matrix [Formula: see text] with real (not integer) entries. Our idea, in a nutshell, is to replace this decomposition by an integral one. While there is in general no integer solution if we restrict [Formula: see text] to being a square matrix, we show that such a decomposition can be efficiently found by allowing [Formula: see text] to be wider (say [Formula: see text] ). This can be viewed as an extension of Lagrange’s four-square theorem to matrices. In addition, we adapt our integral decomposition algorithm to the ring setting: for power-of-2 cyclotomics, we can exploit the tower of rings structure for improved complexity and compactness.","Ducas, Léo; Galbraith, Steven; Prest, Thomas; Yu, Yang",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,71,18

How have different countries reacted to these troubling circumstances? What policies have been implemented to alleviate the pernicious effects of the pandemic on gender and labor inequalities? We examine the policies offered in Denmark, Germany, and the United States, three countries that represent distinct welfare regimes. We find important differences among the policy solutions provided, but also in the “cultural infrastructures” that allow policies to work as intended, or not. In Denmark, a social-democratic welfare state, robust federal salary guarantee programs supplemented an already strong social safety net. The country was among the first to lock down and reorganize health care—and also among the first to reopen schools and child care facilities, acknowledging that parents’ employment depends on child care provisioning, especially for mothers. Germany, a corporatist regime, substantially expanded existing programs and provided generous subsidies. However, despite an ongoing official commitment to reduce gender inequality, the cultural legacy of a father breadwinner/mother caregiver family model meant that reopening child care facilities was not a first priority, which pushed many mothers out of paid work. In the U.S. liberal regime, private organizations—particularly in privileged economic sectors—are the ones primarily offering supports to working parents. Patchwork efforts at lockdown and reopening have meant a lengthy period of limbo for working families, with disastrous consequences for women, especially the most vulnerable. Among such varied “solutions” to the consequences of the pandemic, those of liberal regimes seem to be worsening inequalities. The unprecedented nature of the current pandemic recession suggests a need for scholars to gender the study of economic crises.","Bariola, Nino; Collins, Caitlyn",Am Behav Sci,71,1

Consistent with the healthy migration hypothesis, Hong Kong adolescents and mainland Chinese adolescent immigrants did not differ on most of the outcomes; Chinese adolescent immigrants showed higher perceived moral character, empathy, and social trust than did Hong Kong adolescent non-immigrants. Chinese adolescent immigrants also showed more favorable perceptions of the school environment and moral character, social trust and social responsibility of adolescents in Hong Kong.

Still, limited research exists on the partial effects of each component of such interventions, and whether participants choose to use all of the features of a program. The objective of this study was to test the individual components of a fully-featured digital health lifestyle intervention as predictors of weight loss in a single statistical model. Methods: Participants in the study (N=25,273) were enrolled in the Livongo for Weight Loss program as part of their employee wellness benefit across 57 states/territories of the US from April, 2019 to January, 2021. Participants received a cellular-connected scale to use daily in the program; they were asked to track their eating via the app and physical activity via smartphones or wearables. Additionally, participants could engage with coaches voluntarily or by receiving feedback from coaches on their recorded food logs. A mixed-effects generalized linear model was used to test the effects of scale usage, physical activity, human telephonic coaching, and food logs without and without coaching feedback on the percent weight loss the following month. Predictors were disaggregated into between- and within-subject components to understand the impact of each component relative to one’s own mean. The month in the program and whether or not that month occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic were entered as time-varying covariates. Baseline age, gender, and BMI were entered as time-invariant covariates. Results: Participants were 45% male and had average age of 54.3 years old (SD =11.4), with an average BMI of 33.10 kg/m(2) (SD: 6.2). On average, participants were enrolled in the program for 10.4 months (SD: 5.1). Each additional use of the scale above one’s own average was associated with an overall 7.4% weight loss (z=21.06,p<0.001). Similarly, each additional minute of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) above one’s own average was associated with an overall 2.4% weight loss (z=3.14, p<0.01). Lastly, coaching and food logging with coaching feedback at a frequency above one’s own average were associated with approximately a 6% weight loss throughout the program (z=3.08 and 2.35, respectively; p<0.05 for both). Conclusion: We found that frequency of use of a scale in a weight loss intervention was most predictive of weight loss, followed by human coaching interaction and physical activity. However, food logging without feedback did not significantly impact weight loss among participants. Additional work is needed to understand drivers associated with increased utilization of beneficial program features, including optimizing the use of coaching, which offers great benefit, but may be costly to scale.","Dzubur, Eldin; James, Roberta; Shah, Bimal; Kompala, Tejaswi",J Endocr Soc,71,8

Little is known about leadership, motivation and employee performance during pandemics and associated lockdowns. RESEARCH PURPOSE: The current study investigated a model of leadership behaviour, team effectiveness, technological flexibility, work engagement and performance in the context of a ‘hard lockdown’ in South Africa. MOTIVATION FOR THE STUDY: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown, it was considered from an academic-practitioner perspective to explore leadership behaviour, team effectiveness, technological flexibility, work engagement and performance. RESEARCH APPROACH/DESIGN AND METHOD: Specifically, remote workers were sampled online via social media (n = 229). Structural equation modelling methods were used to analyse the data, also controlling optimism and pessimism at the item level. MAIN FINDINGS: The results showed that the resources of leadership behaviour and team effectiveness had direct positive paths to work engagement and that work engagement had a positive path to two performance factors: adaptivity and proactivity. Furthermore, there were significant indirect relationship present from leadership behaviour and team effectiveness to both adaptability and proactivity through work engagement. PRACTICAL/MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS: From the evidence it seems appropriate to recommend that organisations explore fostering the employee job resources in order to positively impact work engagement, which in turn can have beneficial performance outcomes for organisations who have employees working remotely whilst the COVID-19 regulations remain in force. CONTRIBUTION/VALUE-ADD: This study was unique as it sampled from employees ‘locked down’ during a pandemic and gauged their perceptions of leadership behaviour, team effectiveness, technological flexibility, work engagement and performance.","Koekemoer, Lome; de Beer, Leon T.; Govender, Karissa; Brouwers, Marissa",,71,27

This study investigated the pandemic's impact on food insecurity, disparities, and determinants among graduate students at Purdue University, a public research university. METHODS: Purdue University graduate students completed a Graduate Student Experience in the Research University Survey (gradSERU) in Apr-Jun 2019 and the Fostering Food Security, Health, and Resilience in Graduate Education (FORGE) survey in Nov-Dec 2020, which assessed students’ food security, mental and physical health, and academic performance. A validated two-question tool measured food insecurity based on worry over or experience of running out of food without the ability to purchase more. Analyses using logistic regressions were performed in StataSE16. RESULTS: Food insecurity among graduate students doubled from spring 2019 (17%) to fall 2020 (36%, P < 0.001), increasing for all races, genders. Odds of food insecurity in 2020 were higher among students who were African American (OR: 5.7, 95% CI 3.2–10.1), Asian (OR 3.1 [2.1–4.8]), Hispanic or Latino (OR 3.0 [1.8–4.0]), international (OR 1.5 [1.2–1.8]), LGBTQ+ (OR 1.9 [1.4–2.6]), caregiving for adults (OR 2.7 [1.9–3.6]), or funded through fellowships or assistantships (vs. personally funded, OR 1.5 [1.1–2.0]). Food insecure students faced greater stress (OR 3.5 [3.0–4.2]) and reduced ability (OR 0.6 [0.5–0.8]) to attain a healthy diet, with reduced access to stores with fruits and vegetables (OR 0.7 [0.6–0.9]) or considered good quality (OR 0.4 [0.3–0.5]). Food insecure students were more likely (OR 6.7 [5.2–8.6]) or vegetables (OR 8.1 [6.1–10.9]) due to cost. Lack of time (52%), culturally desired foods (11%), and transportation (10%) were limitations to a healthy diet. CONCLUSIONS: Graduate student food insecurity increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among international, minority, and LGBTQ + students, and coincided with lower likelihood of purchasing nutritious foods. Universities should implement policies and services to address persistent and increasing food insecurity and disparities among graduate students.

The β-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase plays a pivotal role in maintaining epithelial integrity by functioning as a cell adhesion molecule and regulating cell surface stability of the catalytic α-subunit of the transporter, thereby, maintaining optimal alveolar fluid balance. Here, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase for the Na,K-ATPase β-subunit, which promoted polyubiquitination, subsequent endocytosis and proteasomal degradation of the protein upon exposure of alveolar epithelial cells to elevated CO(2) levels, thus impairing alveolar integrity. Ubiquitination of the Na,K-ATPase β-subunit required lysine 5 and 7 and mutating these residues (but not other lysines) prevented trafficking of Na,K-ATPase from the plasma membrane and stabilized the protein upon hypercapnia. Furthermore, ubiquitination of the Na,K-ATPase β-subunit was dependent on prior phosphorylation at serine 11 by protein kinase C (PKC)-ζ. Using a protein microarray, we identified the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) as the E3 ligase driving ubiquitination of the Na,K-ATPase β-subunit upon hypercapnia. Of note, prevention of Na,K-ATPase β-subunit ubiquitination was necessary and sufficient to restore the formation of cell-cell junctions under hypercapnic conditions. These results suggest that a hypercapnic environment in the lung may lead to persistent epithelial dysfunction in affected patients. As such, the identification of the E3 ligase for the Na,K-ATPase may provide a novel therapeutic target, to be employed in patients with acute or chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, aiming to restore alveolar epithelial integrity.","Gabrielli, Nieves M.; Mazzocchi, Luciana C.; Kryvenko, Vitalii; Tello, Khodr; Herold, Susanne; Morty, Rory E.; Grimminger, Friedrich; Dada, Laura A.; Seeger, Werner; Sznajder, Jacob I.; Vadász, István",Front Cell Dev Biol,71,1

IDH enzymes catalyze the conversion of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG), an intermediate in the citric acid cycle. Specific mutations in the genes encoding IDHs cause neomorphic enzymatic activity that produces D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and result in the inhibition of α-KG-dependent enzymes such as histone and DNA demethylases. Thus, chromatin structure and gene expression profiles in IDH-mutant gliomas appear to be different from those in IDH-wildtype gliomas. IDH mutations are highly common in lower grade gliomas (LGG) and secondary glioblastomas, and they are among the earliest genetic events driving tumorigenesis. Therefore, inhibition of mutant IDH enzymes in LGGs is widely accepted as an attractive therapeutic strategy. On the other hand, the metabolic consequences derived from IDH mutations lead to selective vulnerabilities within tumor cells, making them more sensitive to several therapeutic interventions. Therefore, instead of shutting down mutant IDH enzymes, exploiting the selective vulnerabilities caused by them might be another attractive and promising strategy. Here, we review therapeutic options and summarize current preclinical and clinical studies on IDH-mutant gliomas.","Kayabolen, Alisan; Yilmaz, Ebru; Bagci-Onder, Tugba",Biomedicines,71,1

Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) have been a focal point in many studies that seek to increase the efficacy of biological control programs by increasing recruitment and retention of natural enemies. Our research sought to explore the role of HIPVs in asparagus agroecosystems to answer the following questions: 1) What is the composition of HIPV produced by asparagus ferns following feeding by a chewing herbivore? 2) Do field deployed lures baited with synthetic asparagus HIPVs attract natural enemies? and 3) Can HIPV lures increase biological control of asparagus pests? Volatiles were field collected from the headspace of healthy asparagus ferns, mechanically damaged ferns, and ferns fed upon by asparagus beetle larvae (Crioceris asparagi L.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). We found that asparagus beetle damaged asparagus had significantly higher concentrations of (E)-β-ocimene, (E,E)-α-farnesene, and (1)-tetradecanol than healthy or mechanically damaged ferns. Field experiments demonstrated that lures baited with isolates of ocimene and farnesene attracted parasitoids without attracting pests, but had no impact on predator recruitment. Finally, we determined that overall parasitism rates were not increased by synthetic HIPV lures but found evidence that lures may increase parasitism of asparagus miner (Ophiomyia simplex Loew) (Diptera: Agromyzidae) by pteromalids.","Ingrao, Adam J; Walters, Jenna; Szendrei, Zsofia",Environmental entomology,71,1

We incorporated this technique as an alternative to hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. We investigated intraoperative and short-term outcomes following single-incision laparoscopic colectomy compared with hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomy. METHODS Between July and November 2009, single-incision colorectal procedures were performed and matched to hand-assisted procedures based on five criteria: gender, age, body mass index, pathology, and type of procedure. Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were assessed. RESULTS Twenty-four pairs of patients with a mean age of 55.1 years and mean body mass index of 28.5 kg/m(2) were matched. The majority of cases (79.2%) were right hemicolectomies. The ranges of incision length were 2-6 cm (single incision) and 5-11 cm (hand-assisted). Mean operating time was significantly longer for single-incision procedures (143.2 min) compared with hand-assisted procedures (112.8 min), p < 0.0004. There was no significant difference in the groups regarding conversions or intraoperative complications (p < 0.083 and p < 1.0, respectively). Mean length of stay for the single-incision approach (2.7 days) was significantly shorter compared with the hand-assisted approach (3.3 days), p < 0.02. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy is a safe and feasible alternative to hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. Although the technique required longer operative time, it resulted in smaller incision size and significantly shorter length of hospitalization.","Gandhi, Dhruvil P; Ragupathi, Madhu; Patel, Chirag B; Ramos-Valadez, Diego I; Pickron, T Bartley; Haas, Eric M",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,71,4

METHODS In this national multicentric prospective case series, data of subjects with NIU receiving corticosteroids, systemic IMT and/or biological agents were analysed. The data collection was performed from 1 March 2020 to 25 June 2020. Main outcome measures included change in the ongoing treatments with corticosteroids, IMT and biological agents, use of alternate therapies and rates of uveitis relapse. RESULTS In this study, 176 patients (284 eyes) with NIU (mean age: 33±17.1 years; males: 68) were included. A total of 121 eyes (90 patients) were deemed to have active NIU. Of these, seven subjects (7.8%) did not receive intravenous methylprednisolone despite need felt by the treating uveitis experts. In addition, 35 subjects (57.4%) received a rapid tapering dosage of oral corticosteroids despite active disease. A total of 161 (91.5%) subjects were receiving systemic IMT and 25 (14.2%) were on biological therapies. Overall, IMT was altered in 29/161 (18.0%) subjects. Twenty-two eyes were treated with intravitreal therapies in the study period. Fifty-three eyes (32.5%, 29 subjects) developed relapse of NIU, of which 25 subjects (86.2%) were deemed to have reactivation related to altered systemic IMT. No patient developed COVID-19 during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, uveitis specialists may tend to reduce the ongoing systemic IMT, or prefer less aggressive treatment strategies for NIU. These subjects may be at high risk of relapse of uveitis.","Agarwal, Aniruddha Kishandutt; Sudharshan, Sridharan; Mahendradas, Padmamalini; Babu, Kalpana; Shenoy, Pratik; Dogra, Mohit; Bansal, Reema; Agarwal, Manisha; Biswas, Jyotirmay; Balamurugan, S; Agrawal, Rupesh; Gupta, Vishali",The British journal of ophthalmology,71,19

Toothbrushing physically disrupts the dental plaque that acts as a reservoir for pulmonary infection and therefore has the potential to reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Gu and colleagues performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of oral hygiene with and without a toothbrush and found no difference in the incidence of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients. The diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia is prone to bias and future studies of oral care interventions should focus on measures of oral cleanliness such as plaque and gingival scores. Once the optimal strategy for oral hygiene is defined in the critically ill, larger studies focussing on ventilator-associated pneumonia or mortality can be conducted.","Wise, Matt P; Williams, David W",Critical care,71,12

As stroke is an aging-related disease, in this work, we attempt to examine the role and potential mechanism of Sirt3 in regulating ischemic stroke by using a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model in wild type (WT) and Sirt3 knockout (KO) mice, coupled with oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) experiments in cultured primary astrocytes. Sirt3 deficiency aggravated neuronal cell apoptosis and neurological deficits after brain ischemia. In addition, Sirt3 KO mice showed more severe blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammatory responses compared with WT group in the acute phase. Furthermore, specific overexpression of Sirt3 in astrocytes by injecting glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)::Sirt3 virus in ischemic region showed protective effect against stroke-induced damage. Mechanistically, Sirt3 could regulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression by inhibiting hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling after ischemia (OGD). Our results have shown that Sirt3 plays a protective role in ischemic stroke via regulating HIF-1α/VEGF signaling in astrocytes, and reversal of the Sirt3 expression at the acute phase could be a worthy direction for stroke therapy.","Yang, Xiao; Zhang, Yanshuang; Geng, Keyi; Yang, Ke; Shao, Jiaxiang; Xia, Weiliang",Cellular and molecular neurobiology,71,17

Rarely, zoonotic strains of influenza virus spread to humans, where they have the potential to mediate new pandemics with high mortality. We studied systemic viral spread after intranasal infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1 [A/Viet Nam/1203/2004]) in ferrets with or without prior pandemic H1N1pdm09 (A/Mexico/4108/2009) or H3N2 (A/Victoria/361/2011) infection. After intranasal challenge with H5N1 influenza virus, naive ferrets rapidly succumbed to systemic infection. Animals challenged with H5N1 influenza virus greater than 3 months after recovering from an initial H1N1pdm09 infection survived H5N1 virus challenge and cleared virus from the respiratory tract 4 days after infection. However, a prolonged low-level infection of hematopoietic elements in the small bowel lamina propria, liver, and spleen was present for greater than 2 weeks postinfection, raising the potential for reassortment of influenza genes in a host infected with multiple strains of influenza. Animals previously infected with an H3N2 influenza virus succumbed to systemic disease and encephalitis after H5N1 virus challenge. These results indicate prior infection with different seasonal influenza strains leads to radically different protection from H5N1 challenge and fatal encephalitis. IMPORTANCE Seasonal influenza is efficiently transmitted from human to human, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Rarely, zoonotic strains of influenza virus spread to humans, where they have the potential to mediate new pandemics with high mortality. Infection of naive ferrets with H5N1 avian influenza virus causes a rapid and lethal systemic disease. We studied systemic H5N1 viral spread after infection of ferrets with or without prior exposure to either of two seasonal influenza virus strains, H1N1 and H3N2. Ferrets previously infected with H1N1 survive H5N1 challenge while those previously infected with H3N2 die of encephalitis. However ferrets protected from lethal H5N1 infection develop persistent low-level infection of the small intestine, liver, or spleen, providing a nidus for future viral strain recombination. The mechanism by which prior infection with specific strains of seasonal influenza virus protect from lethal H5N1 challenge needs to be elucidated in order to design effective immunization and treatments.","Bissel, Stephanie J; Wang, Guoji; Carter, Donald M; Crevar, Corey J; Ross, Ted M; Wiley, Clayton A",Journal of virology,71,5

But do social distancing policies in response to COVID-19 actually change population behavior and, if so, what political, socioeconomic, and epidemiological factors condition this policy effect? METHODS We leverage subnational variation in the stringency and timing of state-issued social distancing policies to test their effects on population mobility from March to December 2020 across 109 states in Brazil, Mexico, and the United States. We also explore how conventional explanations of compliance, including political trust, socioeconomic resources, health risks, and partisanship, modify these policy effects. FINDINGS In Brazil and the U.S., mandatory stay-at-home orders and workplace closures jointly reduced mobility, especially early in the pandemic. In Mexico, where federal government intervention created greater policy uniformity across states, workplace closures produced the most consistent reduction in mobility. Conventional explanations of compliance perform well in the U.S. but not in Brazil and Mexico, with the exception of socioeconomic resources. CONCLUSIONS In addition to new directions for future research on the politics of compliance, the article offers insights for policymakers about which public health measures are likely to elicit compliance. Our finding that the efficacy of workplace closures at reducing population mobility increases with levels of socioeconomic development suggests that cash transfers, economic stimulus packages, and other policies that mitigate the financial burdens of the pandemic may help reduce population mobility by decreasing the costs of staying at home.","Testa, Paul F; Snyder, Richard; Rios, Eva; Moncada, Eduardo; Giraudy, Agustina; Bennouna, Cyril","Journal of health politics, policy and law",71,27

CIN was defined as an increase of either 25% or 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 μmol/L) in serum creatinine within 72 hours after contrast infusion. A simple CIN risk score based on independent predictors was established. Four variables were identified for our risk score model: LVEF < 40%, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), eGFR < 60, and contrast volume > 300 mL. Based on this new CIN risk score, the incidence of CIN had a significant trend with increased predicting score values of 5.9%, 32.9%, and 60.0%, corresponding to low, moderate, and high-risk groups, respectively. The novel risk assessment exhibited moderate discrimination ability for predicting CIN, with an AUC of 0.759 [95% CI 0.668-0.852, P = 0.001] in the validation cohort. It also had similar prognostic values for one-year follow-up MACE (C-statistic: 0.705 and 0.606 for new risk score and Mehran score, respectively).

METHODS Between May 2013 and September 2014, forty patients with CRC received robotic surgery at a single institution. The clinicopathological features and perioperative parameters were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Of the 40 patients with CRC, 33 (82.5 %) had rectal cancers, and 22 (66.7 %) of those 33 patients also underwent pre-operative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). The two most frequent surgical procedures were intersphincteric resection (ISR) with coloanal anastomosis (16/40, 40 %) and lower anterior resection (LAR) (15/40, 37.5 %). Among all 40 patients, the median time to first flatus passage was 2 days. The median time to soft diet resumption was 4 days. The median post operative hospital stay was 7 days. The overall complication rate was 20 % (8/40 patients), of which most of the complications were mild, although one laparotomy was required to check for post-operative bleeding. There was no 30-day hospital mortality, nor conversion to open surgery and laparoscopy. CONCLUSION We present our preliminary experiences of robotic colorectal surgery and demonstrate that robotic colorectal surgery is a safe and feasible surgery even when conducted by laparoscopic surgeons with limited experience.","Huang, Ching-Wen; Yeh, Yung-Sung; Ma, Cheng-Jen; Choy, Tak-Kee; Huang, Ming-Yii; Huang, Chun-Ming; Tsai, Hsiang-Lin; Hsu, Wen-Hung; Wang, Jaw-Yuan",BMC surgery,71,29

Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death; however, gastrointestinal disease, diabetes and liver disease are common comorbidities. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly changed healthcare services across the globe, including redeployment of healthcare professionals. This adult CF service was challenged to continue a patient facing service within severe staffing and structural limitations.Not only were many members of the CF multidisciplinary team (MDT) redeployed at the start of the first wave, but also both the CF and ambulatory care wards were closed. Fortunately, the CF clinical nurse specialists (CF-CNSs) remained in their role. Rapid change and adaptation of the CF service was required to ensure that patients did not feel abandoned and access to treatment remained available. The role of the CF-CNS was therefore pivotal in this change.The aim of this project was to use quality improvement methodology to plan an emergency service allowing a reintroduction of ambulatory care services. Success was measured by the number of patients clinically reviewed with or without intervention, and the reasons for patients contacting the CF-CNS via email and phone were recorded.In weeks 1 and 2 of the emergency service, the CF-CNSs triaged patients by phone, then reviewed face-to-face when necessary. This first step allowed the CF-CNSs to start two patients on home intravenous antibiotics. This service continued to be developed over the following 12 weeks, leading to a total of 36 patient attendances. In March 2020, n=1187 patients made contact (mostly COVID-19, unwell and medication related), in April n=904 and May n=870 (blood test results, unwell and medication related).The motivation of the CF-CNSs was pivotal to the success of this initiative with the CF MDT available to provide some support and advice. It concluded at week 12, which then saw the opening of the formal ambulatory care ward and returning redeployed ward staff.","Dunk, Rachel; Madge, Susan",BMJ open quality,71,31

Between the complexes of (8-amino)quinolines and (4-amino)phenanthridines studied in this report, we do not observe much structural variation, and remarkably similar UV-visible absorption spectra. Expansion of the π-system in the (4-amino)phenanthridine complexes does result in an increase in the intensity of the lowest energy transitions (λmax), which computational modeling suggests are more purely MLCT in character compared with the mixed π-π*/MLCT character of these transitions in the smaller (8-amino)quinoline-supported complexes. DFT and TDDFT modeling further showed that consideration of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is essential; omitting SOC misses the π-π* contributions to λmax and is unable to accurately model the observed electronic absorption spectra.","Gaire, Sanjay; Ortiz, Robert J; Schrage, Briana R; Lozada, Issiah B; Mandapati, Pavan; Osinski, Allen J; Herbert, David E; Ziegler, Christopher J",Journal of organometallic chemistry,71,7

DESIGN Descriptive study by retrospective review. SETTING Pediatric intensive care unit at a tertiary care children's hospital. PATIENTS Infants on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to RSV. INTERVENTIONS Use of HFJV. MAIN RESULTS Eleven patients were placed on HFJV. There was sustained improvement in ventilation on HFJV with a mean decrease in PCO2 of 9 mmHg at 24 h and 11 mmHg at 72 h. There were no significant changes in oxygenation by oxygenation index. No patients required extracorporeal support or suffered pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or subcutaneous emphysema. Ten out of 11 (91%) patients survived to discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSION High frequency jet ventilation may represent an alternative therapy for RSV-induced respiratory failure that is refractory to CMV.","Valentine, Kevin M; Sarnaik, Ajit A; Sandhu, Hitesh S; Sarnaik, Ashok P",Frontiers in pediatrics,71,28

METHODS A mixed methods study with a survey in 323 NH practitioners (psychologists, elderly care physicians, nurse practitioners) in the Netherlands, and in-depth interviews in 16 NH practitioners. Nonparametric analyses were used to compare estimated proportions of residents with increased and with decreased challenging behavior. Content analyses were conducted for open-ended questions and in-depth interviews. RESULTS Participants reported changes in challenging behavior with slightly higher proportions for increased (Q1/Mdn/Q3: 12.5%, 21.7%, 30.8%) than for decreased (8.7%, 14.8%, 27.8%, Z = -2.35, p = .019) challenging behavior. Half of the participants reported that their work load increased and work satisfaction worsened during the measures. Different strategies were described to respond to the effects of COVID-19 measures, such as video calls, providing special areas for residents to meet their loved ones, adjusting activities, and reducing the exposure to negative news. CONCLUSIONS Because COVID-19 measures resulted in both increased and decreased challenging behavior in NH residents, it is important to monitor for their potential long lasting effects. Increased work load and worsened work satisfaction of the NH staff, together with the changes in type of challenging behavior, indicate that the harmful effects of the anti-pandemic measures should be taken seriously.","Leontjevas, Ruslan; Knippenberg, Inge A H; Smalbrugge, Martin; Plouvier, Annette O A; Teunisse, Saskia; Bakker, Christian; Koopmans, Raymond T C M; Gerritsen, Debby L",Aging & mental health,71,1

METHODS In this consecutive case study, we performed prospective analysis of CSF and blood in patients admitted to a university medical center with symptoms of stroke and suspected cerebral vasculitis. Flow cytometry was performed for intracellular detection of inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood lymphocytes and expanded T cells from CSF. RESULTS CSF CD4+ lymphocytes from patients with cerebral vasculitis showed significantly higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 compared to patients with stroke not due to vasculitis or with other, noninflammatory neurologic diseases. There was no difference in the production of interferon-γ in the CSF and no overall differences in the relative frequencies of peripheral immune cells. CONCLUSIONS Intracellular IL-17 in CSF cells is potentially useful in discriminating cerebral vasculitis as a rare cause in patients presenting with ischemic stroke.

To inform design of a clinic program for PLWH experiencing HUH, we quantified patient preferences and trade-offs across multiple HIV-service domains using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS We sequentially sampled PLWH experiencing HUH presenting at an urban HIV clinic with missed primary care visit and viremia in the last year to conduct a DCE. Participants chose between two hypothetical clinics varying across five service attributes: care team ""get to know me as a person"" versus not; receiving $10, $15 or $20 gift cards for clinic visits; drop-in versus scheduled visits; direct phone communication to care team versus front-desk staff; staying 2 versus 20 blocks from the clinic. We estimated attribute relative utility (i.e., preference) using mixed-effects logistic regression and calculated the monetary trade-off of preferred options. RESULTS Among 65 individuals interviewed, 61% were >40 years-old; 45% white; 77% male; 25% heterosexual; 56% lived outdoors/emergency housing, and 44% in temporary housing. Strongest preferences were for patient-centered care team (β = 3.80; 95%CI 2.57-5.02) and drop-in clinic appointments (β = 1.33; 95%CI 0.85-1.80), with a willingness to trade $32.79 (95%CI 14.75-50.81) and $11.45 (95%CI 2.95-19.95) in gift cards/visit, respectively. CONCLUSION In this DCE, PLWH-HUH were willing to trade significant financial gain to have a personal relationship with and drop-in access to their care team rather than clinic proximity and gift cards. These findings informed Ward 86's ""POP-UP"" program for PLWH-HUH and can inform ""Ending the HIV Epidemic"" efforts.","Conte, Madellena; Eshun-Wilson, Ingrid; Geng, Elvin; Imbert, Elizabeth; Hickey, Matthew D; Havlir, Diane; Gandhi, Monica; Clemenzi-Allen, Angelo",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,71,19

The lack of methods for synthesizing intricate structures from them on the micron and submicron level, however, is stopping the field from developing. In particular, the methods for the synthesis of shape memory polymers (SMPs) and structures at this scale and the effect of new geometries remain unexplored. Here, we describe the synthesis of shape memory polyurethane (PU) capsules accomplished by interfacial polymerization of emulsified droplets. The emulsified droplets contain the monomers for the hard segments, while the continuous aqueous phase contains the soft segments. A trifunctional chemical cross-linker for shape memory PU synthesis was utilized to eliminate creep and improve the recovery ratios of the final capsules. We observe an anomalous dependence of the recovery ratio with the amount of programmed strain compared to previous SMPs. We develop quantitative characterization methods and theory to show that when dealing with thin-shell objects, alternative parameters to quantify recovery ratios are needed. We show that while achieving 94-99% area recovery ratios, the linear capsule recovery ratios can be as low as 70%. This quantification method allows us to convert from observed linear aspect ratios in capsules to find out unrecovered area strain and stress. The hollow structure of the capsules grants high internal volume for some applications (e.g., drug delivery), which benefit from much higher loading of active ingredients than polymeric particles. The methods we developed for capsule synthesis and programming could be easily scaled up for larger volume applications.","Zhang, Fenghua; Zhao, Tianheng; Ruiz-Molina, Daniel; Liu, Yanju; Roscini, Claudio; Leng, Jinsong; Smoukov, Stoyan K",ACS applied materials & interfaces,71,20

OBJECTIVES We developed a mathematical analysis of ventilatory tracings recorded under noninvasive pressure ventilation in order to identify ineffective triggering efforts and their consequences without recording esophageal pressure. METHODS We assessed 2,183 cycles from 44 pressure support tracings in 14 children with cystic fibrosis treated by noninvasive home ventilation. Airway pressure, flow and esophageal pressure time series were visually analyzed and manually counted. Airway pressure versus time and flow versus time were then analyzed using a dedicated algorithm written by us. Esophageal pressure was only used for validation. RESULTS A mathematical treatment of flow time series allowed us to draw phase portraits that had specific periodic trajectories for triggered ventilatory cycles and ineffective triggering efforts. From flow and pressure tracings, our algorithm correctly identified 100% of triggered cycles and 53/56 (94.6%) of ineffective triggering efforts. Ineffective triggering was associated with a significant reduction in minute ventilation, inspiratory flows and a significant increase in inspiratory efforts. CONCLUSIONS A noninvasive analysis of flow and airway pressure can reliably identify ineffective triggering efforts during noninvasive pressure support ventilation. This approach may be a valuable tool for evaluating patient-ventilator interactions and their consequences during long-term recordings.","Cuvelier, Antoine; Achour, Linda; Rabarimanantsoa, Herinaina; Letellier, Christophe; Muir, Jean-François; Fauroux, Brigitte",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,71,12

The heterogeneous and often clustered intrahepatic biodistribution of millions of point-source radioactive particles poses a challenge for dosimetry. Several studies found a relationship between absorbed doses and treatment outcome, with regard to both toxicity and efficacy. This should ultimately lead to improved patient selection and individualized treatment planning. New calculation methods and imaging techniques and a new generation of microspheres for image-guided RE will all contribute to these improvements.

The prognostic power of commercially available gene signatures is mostly restricted to estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. On the contrary, immune-related gene signatures predict prognosis only in ER-negative breast cancer. This study aimed to develop a better prognostic signature for breast cancer. METHODS The expressions of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes from 30 independent microarray datasets with a total of 4813 samples were analyzed. A prognostic lncRNA signature was developed based on likelihood-ratio Cox regression analysis. Survival analysis was used to compare the prognostic efficiencies of our signature and 10 previously reported prognostic gene signatures. RESULTS Cox regression analysis on 30 independent datasets showed that the 6-lncRNA signature identified in this study performed as well as five commercially available signatures in recurrence prediction for ER-positive breast cancer. In ER-negative breast cancer, this lncRNA signature was as prognostic as three immune-related gene signatures. Moreover, our lncRNA signature also demonstrated a good capacity to predict recurrence risk for triple-negative breast cancer. Function analysis showed that several lncRNAs in this signature were probably involved in cell proliferation and immune processes. CONCLUSIONS A six-LncRNA signature was identified that is prognostic for ER-positive, ER-negative, and triple-negative breast cancers and thus deserves further validation in prospective studies.","Liu, Dingxie",Breast cancer research and treatment,71,11

Some health benefits have been attributed to these compounds (e.g., antioxidant and antitumorigenic properties). In this study, we investigated the possible antioxidant activity of two different grape juices: organic purple grape juice and conventional purple grape juice. The antioxidant activity of both grape juices was evaluated by an animal model of three groups: control and organic and conventional juices. After 30 days, all animals were sacrificed, and blood and liver were collected to evaluate lipid peroxidation level (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances [TBARS] assay), protein oxidative level (carbonyl assay), and catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. The group treated with organic grape juice showed the highest SOD and CAT activities in both plasma and liver when compared with the conventional and control groups (P < .05). In plasma, we observed a positive correlation among SOD and CAT activities, resveratrol, and all anthocyanin contents, suggesting that these polyphenols may be, at least in part, responsible for this increased antioxidant defense. The grape juices were capable of reducing carbonyl and lipid peroxidation levels in plasma and liver. However, in plasma, the organic group showed lower carbonyl and TBARS levels when compared to the conventional grape juice group (P < .05). Our findings suggest that the intake of purple grape juice, especially of organic juice, induces a better antioxidant capacity when compared to conventional juice and that this may be an important issue for further investigations in the area of biochemical functional foods.","Dani, Caroline; Oliboni, Lívia S; Pasquali, Matheus A B; Oliveira, Marcos R; Umezu, Fernanda M; Salvador, Mirian; Moreira, José C F; Henriques, João A P",Journal of medicinal food,71,28

Few reports had discussed flow diversion as a therapeutic option for this group. METHODS This was a retrospective study analysing flow diversion in treating ICABR aneurysms. Seven patients harbouring eight aneurysms in the ICABR were treated with flow diversion. Five aneurysms were inclined on the proximal A1 segment, and three were located at the most distal pre-bifurcation segment. Patients' demographics, presentation, procedure technical description, angiographic and clinical follow-up were recorded. PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE were also reviewed for articles published in English, including case series or case reports, for ICABR aneurysms treated with flow diverters. RESULTS All patients except one underwent angiographic follow-up. The Karman-Byrne occlusion scale was used to determine the occlusion rate. All six patients with documented angiographic follow-up had a class IV occlusion score. No permanent or transient neurological or non-neurological complications were encountered in this study. CONCLUSION Treating ICABR aneurysms using flow diversion is feasible, with a promising angiographic occlusion rate.

As health care organizations move from crisis mobilization to a new landscape of health and social needs, organizational health literacy offers practical building blocks to provide high-quality, efficient, and meaningful care to patients and their families. Organizational health literacy is defined by the Institute of Medicine as ""the degree to which an organization implements policies, practices, and systems that make it easier for people to navigate, understand, and use information and services to take care of their health."" METHODS This article synthesizes insights from organizational health literacy in the context of current major health care challenges and toward the goal of innovation in patient-centered care. We first provide a brief overview of the origins and outlines of organizational health literacy research and practice. Second, using an established patient-centered innovation framework, we show how the existing work on organizational health literacy can offer a menu of effective, patient-centered innovative options for care delivery systems to improve systems and outcomes. Finally, we consider the high value of management focusing on organizational health literacy efforts, specifically for patients in health care transitions and in the rapid transformation of care into myriad distance modalities. RESULTS This article provides practical guidance for systems and informs decisions around resource allocation and organizational priorities to best meet the needs of patient populations even in the face of financial and workforce disruption. CONCLUSIONS Organizational health literacy principles and guidelines provide a road map for promoting patient-centered care even in this time of crisis, change, and transformation.

Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) is used to improve gas exchange and promote airway clearance in these patients. The current evidence regarding the effectiveness of intrapulmonary percussive ventilation in critical care settings remains unclear. This systematic review aims to summarise the evidence of the effectiveness of intrapulmonary percussive ventilation on intensive care unit length of stay (ICU-LOS) and respiratory outcomes in critically ill patients. RESEARCH QUESTION In critically ill patients, is intrapulmonary percussive ventilation effective in improving respiratory outcomes and reducing intensive care unit length of stay. METHODS A systematic search of intrapulmonary percussive ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU) was performed on five databases from 1979 to 2021. Studies were considered for inclusion if they evaluated the effectiveness of IPV in patients aged ≥16 years receiving invasive or non-invasive ventilation or breathing spontaneously in critical care or high dependency units. Study titles and abstracts were screened, followed by data extraction by a full-text review. Due to a small number of studies and observed heterogeneities in the study methodology and patient population, a meta-analysis could not be included in this review. Outcomes of interest were summarised narratively. RESULTS Out of 306 identified abstracts, seven studies (630 patients) met the eligibility criteria. Results of the included studies provide weak evidence to support the effectiveness of intrapulmonary percussive ventilation in reducing ICU-LOS, improving gas exchange, and reducing respiratory rate. INTERPRETATION Based on the findings of this review, the evidence to support the role of IPV in reducing ICU-LOS, improving gas exchange, and reducing respiratory rate is weak. The therapeutic value of IPV in airway clearance, preventing pneumonia, and treating pulmonary atelectasis requires further investigation.","Hassan, Anwar; Lai, William; Alison, Jennifer; Huang, Stephen; Milross, Maree",PloS one,71,1

DESIGN Randomized, controlled, single-site clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS Sixty patients with nonparalytic, nonrestrictive esotropia who were cooperative for surgery under topical anesthesia. METHODS Twenty-eight patients were assigned to topical anesthesia, and 32 patients were assigned to sub-Tenon's anesthesia. Visual acuity, refraction, and deviation angle were determined in all patients preoperatively and postoperatively, and stereoacuity was measured postoperatively. Deviation angle was measured by simultaneous and alternate prism and cover test, and stereoacuity was measured using Randot circles (Stereo Optical Co., Chicago, IL). The amount of surgery under topical anesthesia was adjusted intraoperatively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The amount of surgery used in the 2 treatment groups (measured in millimeters and millimeter/degree of deviation angle) and 6-month motor and stereoacuity outcomes. RESULTS Patients in the topical group required 3.2 mm less surgery on average than those in the sub-Tenon's group (5.9 and 9.1 mm, respectively; 0.4 and 0.6 mm of recession/degree, respectively) (P<0.01). Motor success (84% and 75%, respectively, P=0.38) and stereoacuity (339.6 and 323.9 arc seconds, respectively, P=0.87) at 6 months were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Topical anesthesia requires a smaller amount of surgery and number of operated muscles to correct esotropia compared with classic surgery guidelines adapted to the surgeon's personal technique.","Tejedor, Jaime; Ogallar, Consuelo; Rodríguez, José M",Ophthalmology,71,26

In this study, we sought to reverse local and systemic GBM-induced immunosuppression using the Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein (NAP), a potent TLR2 agonist, as an immunostimulatory transgene expressed in an oncolytic measles virus (MV) platform, retargeted to allow viral entry through the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). While single-agent murine anti-PD1 treatment or repeat in situ immunization with MV-s-NAP-uPA provided modest survival benefit in MV-resistant syngeneic GBM models, the combination treatment led to synergy with a cure rate of 80% in mice bearing intracranial GL261 tumors and 72% in mice with CT-2A tumors. Combination NAP-immunovirotherapy induced massive influx of lymphoid cells in mouse brain, with CD8+ T cell predominance; therapeutic efficacy was CD8+ T cell dependent. Inhibition of the IFN response pathway using the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib decreased PD-L1 expression on myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the brain and further potentiated the therapeutic effect of MV-s-NAP-uPA and anti-PD1. Our findings support the notion that MV strains armed with bacterial immunostimulatory antigens represent an effective strategy to overcome the limited efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor-based therapies in GBM, creating a promising translational strategy for this lethal brain tumor.","Panagioti, Eleni; Kurokawa, Cheyne; Viker, Kimberly; Ammayappan, Arun; Anderson, S Keith; Sotiriou, Sotiris; Chatzopoulos, Kyriakos; Ayasoufi, Katayoun; Johnson, Aaron J; Iankov, Ianko D; Galanis, Evanthia",The Journal of clinical investigation,71,1

Serious complications include pneumonia, and mortality ranges from 2 to 5%. Until March 26, the World Health Organization reports 462 684 confirmed cases and 20 834 deaths worldwide. Dissemination occurs from aerosols or respiratory droplets. Different scientific societies have published clinical practice guidelines regarding ophthalmic care in the COVID-19 pandemic, but the information is presented inconsistently, which makes decision-making difficult. Methods We conducted a sensitive bibliographic search in EMBASE and ophthalmic society webpages, of the clinical practice guidelines of ophthalmic care in pandemic COVID-19. We extracted the recommendations, organizing them into three categories: ""Which patients to attend"", ""How should the clinic work"", and ""What interventions should be avoided"". For each guideline, we assessed whether the search was systematic and whether the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed. Results Fourteen relevant articles were found. Fifty-one recommendations were extracted and are shown in a summary table. None are based on a systematic search for evidence, nor do any use GRADE to develop the recommendations. Conclusions The clinical practice guidelines that we reviewed all recommend rescheduling all non-urgent consultations and surgeries, reinforcing contact precautions, the use of personal protection elements, and the disinfection of surfaces and instruments. The guidelines should be improved by incorporating systematic searches for evidence, using GRADE for recommendations, and Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) for reporting.","Vargas-Peirano, Manuel; Navarrete, Pamela; Díaz, Traccy; Iglesias, Gabriel; Hoehmann, Martin",Medwave,71,27

Based on spatial correlations between gene expression and CCV differences from two independent meta-analyses and between gene expression and individual CCV distributions of 404 patients and 496 controls, we identify 417 genes associated with both CCV differences and individual CCV distributions. These genes are enriched for genetic association signals and genes downregulated in the ASD post-mortem brain. The expression patterns of these genes are correlated with brain activation patterns of language-related neural processes frequently impaired in ASD. These findings highlight a model whereby genetic risk impacts gene expression (downregulated), which leads to CCV alterations in ASD.","Xie, Yingying; Zhang, Xue; Liu, Feng; Qin, Wen; Fu, Jilian; Xue, Kaizhong; Yu, Chunshui",Cell reports,71,19

Predictors for high pain scores after endoscopies in children are not known. The aim of our study was to identify risk factors for prolonged recovery and higher pain scores after gastrointestinal endoscopy in children. METHODS All the children that were electively admitted for gastrointestinal endoscopies were included. We retrospectively collected demographic, clinical and endoscopic data as well as information on the recovery process. A numerical rating scale and the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability Scale were used for pain scoring. RESULTS During the study period (01/2016-10/2016), 284 children (median age 10.7 years, interquartile range 6.7-14.8) were recruited. In a univariate analysis, older age, higher pre-procedure pain scores, longer procedure durations, higher number of biopsies and longer recovery duration were associated with higher post-procedure pain scores. In a multivariate analysis higher pain scores before the procedure (OR 12.42, 95% CI 3.67-42, P < 0.001) and older age (OR 1.016, 95% CI 1.007-1.025, P < 0.001) were associated with higher pain scores after the procedure. Children with a higher pain score before the procedure also had a longer recovery period (OR 5.28, 95% CI (1.93-14.49), P = 0.001). CONCLUSION Older age and higher pain score before the procedure were identified as predictors for higher pain score after pediatric gastrointestinal endoscopies. Children with these risk factors should be identified before the procedure in order to personalize their post-procedure management.","Galai, Tut; Yerushalmy-Feler, Anat; Heller, Nathan P; Ben-Tov, Amir; Weintraub, Yael; Amir, Achiya; Moran-Lev, Hadar; Zac, Lilach; Cohen, Shlomi",BMC gastroenterology,71,12

Health care professionals involved in the wheelchair service provision process require a specific set of skills and knowledge to enable wheelchair use that meets individual posture, mobility and daily living requirements. However, inconsistencies exist in academic programmes globally about providing comprehensive education and training programmes. The planned scoping review aims to review and synthesize the global literature on wheelchair service provision education for healthcare professional students, healthcare personnel and educators offered by universities, organizations and industries. METHODS This scoping review will be guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodological framework. Comprehensive literature searches will be conducted on various global electronic databases on health to seek out how wheelchair service provision education is organized, integrated, implemented and evaluated. Two independent reviewers will perform eligibility decisions and key data extractions. Data from selected studies will be extracted and analysed using conventional content analysis. Information related to wheelchair service provision education including curriculum development, content, teaching methods, evaluation and models of integration will be synthesized. IMPLICATIONS AND DISSEMINATION The planned scoping review will be the first to examine all aspects of wheelchair service provision education across professionals, settings and countries. We anticipate that results will inform the content of a Wheelchair Educators' Package, and if appropriate, a follow-up systematic review. An article reporting the results of the scoping review will be submitted for publication to a scientific journal. Implications for Rehabilitation A comprehensive examination of wheelchair service provision education could help develop strategies to address the unmet need for wheelchair services globally. Findings for this review will facilitate the planning and development of an evidence-based education package that could bridge the existing knowledge gaps related to safe and effective wheelchair service provision among health professionals involved.

Three tasks were performed during the dry lab session, and different urologic procedures were conducted in a porcine model. The time to complete the tasks and penalties were registered during the dry lab session. Perioperative outcomes and subjective assessment by the surgeons were registered. The surgeons had a positive experience with the SPIDER system, with a mean overall score of 3.6 (on a scale of 1-5). The surgeons were able to gain proficiency in performing tasks regardless of their level of expertise. The highest scores recorded were for ease of device insertion, instrument insertion and exchange, and triangulation. The lowest scores were for retraction. During the clinical case, the platform provided good triangulation without instrument clashing. However, retraction was challenging because of the lack of strength and precise maneuverability with the tip of the instruments fully deployed. The SPIDER system offers intuitive instrument maneuverability and restored triangulation without external instrument clashing.

Only two DPP-4 inhibitors, linagliptin and sitagliptin, were able to inhibit ACE. OBJECTIVE In the present study, we investigated if other inhibitors of ACE or DPP-4 could simultaneously inhibit the activities of both DPP-4 and ACE. METHODS Forty Sprague Dawley rats were used. The control group received saline only. The other three groups were treated with anagliptin, ramipril, or lisinopril. Two different doses were tested, separated with a 6-day drug-free interval. Angiotensin II (ang II) levels, the activities of ACE, and DPP-4 were measured from blood samples at baseline and days 1, 10, and 14. After the oral glucose challenge, levels of the active form of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) were measured. RESULTS Regardless of the dose, anagliptin did not show any inhibitory effect on the activity of ACE or ang II levels. For ramipril and lisinopril, only a high dose of lisinopril was able to produce a modest reduction of the DPP-4 activity, but it was not enough to inhibit the inactivation of GLP-1. CONCLUSION It seems that while most ACE inhibitors cannot affect DPP-4 activity, inhibitors of DPP-4 vary in their effect on ACE activity. The selection of DPP-4 inhibitors under different clinical situations should take into account the action of these drugs on ACE.","Abouelkheir, Mohamed",Current molecular pharmacology,71,32

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study is based on a cross-organisational and descriptive quantitative study conducted in spring 2013 (n = 556) and spring 2020 at the peak of the pandemic in Eastern Europe (n = 781) to identify the relationships and the changes in the satisfaction and burnout levels of healthcare professionals working in Slovenian nursing homes in rural areas, and on a qualitative study conducted in 2020, to identify in-depth relationships and changes in both studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS An increase in burnout syndromes between 2013 - 2020 was observed. The respondents experienced intensified emotional exhaustion and lack of personal accomplishment during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, depersonalisation did not differ statistically over the years. During the pandemic crisis, healthcare workers were less satisfied with their job than in spring 2013. Their job satisfaction was related to satisfaction with the work of nursing homes and with the work of state institutions and politicians who directly affected their working conditions and recognition in society. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic significantly exacerbated already existing burnout syndromes of nursing homes healthcare workers in Slovenian rural areas. Job satisfaction proved to be a relevant predictor of burnout syndrome. A negative correlation was observed between job satisfaction in 2020 and emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment in 2013 and 2020.","Leskovic, Ljiljana; Erjavec, Karmen; Leskovar, Robert; Vukovič, Goran",Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,71,1

We estimated the distributions of the intrinsic incubation period and infection dates on the basis of epidemiological information on the dengue outbreak in 2014. We searched for an assumption that satisfactorily explains the outbreak in 2014 using rough estimates of secondary and tertiary infection cases. We constructed a mathematical model for the transmission of the dengue virus between humans and Aedes albopictus. RESULTS We carried out 1,000-trial stochastic simulations for all combinations of three kinds of assumption about Ae. albopictus and asymptomatic infection with each of three levels. Simulation results showed that the scale of the outbreak was markedly affected by the daily survival rate of Ae. albopictus. The outbreak involved a small number of secondary infection cases, reached a peak at tertiary infection, and transformed to termination at the fourth infection. Under some assumptions, the daily progress of onset cases was within a range between the 1st-3rd quartiles of 1,000 trials for 87% of dates and within a range between the minimum and maximum for all dates. CONCLUSIONS It is important to execute plans to detect asymptomatic cases and reduce the survival rate of Ae. albopictus to prevent the spread of tertiary infections unless an outbreak is suppressed at the secondary infection stage.","Ishikawa, Hirofumi; Shimogawara, Rieko; Fueda, Kaoru",Nihon eiseigaku zasshi.

A systematic literature search was carried out in five electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PsycInfo, Scopus). For inclusion, primary studies had to identify locations of PA using device-based or self-report tools, whereas minutes of PA had to be examined using device-based tools only. Thirty-two studies were included, methodological quality and sex/gender sensitivity of the studies were assessed. The narrative data synthesis revealed that the highest average amount of daily moderate-to-vigorous PA was found in home and recreational locations, followed by school and neighborhood locations. In adults, highest average amount of daily moderate-to-vigorous PA was found in neighborhood and home locations followed by workplace and recreational locations. The majority of studies had a low risk of bias in four out of six domains; eight studies reported significant sex/gender differences in location-based PA. The results indicate that different locations are used for PA to a varying degree across the lifespan. Future research on the promotion of PA should focus on location-specific design features that encourage children, adolescents and adults to be physically active.","Kelso, Anne; Reimers, Anne K; Abu-Omar, Karim; Wunsch, Kathrin; Niessner, Claudia; Wäsche, Hagen; Demetriou, Yolanda",International journal of environmental research and public health,71,1

This article briefly reviews its history, describes its methods and main results, with a specific focus on low- and middle-income countries, and underlines its main challenges and future prospects. Surveillance of tuberculosis started more than two centuries ago with the recording of tuberculosis mortality in England and Wales. After Koch's discovery of the tubercle bacillus, repeated tuberculin surveys were implemented to monitor infection, and case notification of active disease was progressively established during the 20th century. Because treatment of tuberculosis disease is the key intervention to stop transmission, monitoring of treatment outcome and more recently of drug resistance became integral parts of tuberculosis surveillance. At global level, the World Health Organization (WHO) is publishing a global TB report annually since 1997. Reports present data notified by each country as well as global estimates. Estimates of tuberculosis incidence are based on case notification adjusted by various correction factors, or on derivation from results of tuberculosis prevalence surveys, e.g. in India. In 2018, 10.1 million cases of tuberculosis are estimated to have occurred, among which about 0.5 million were resistant to rifampicin, and an estimated 1.5 million patients died. While global estimates are useful to raise public awareness and attract public and private funding, their uncertainty make them less useful to guide national policies. The backbone of tuberculosis surveillance at national and subnational level is the case notification. Newly diagnosed cases of active disease, whether new or recurrent, are reported with their key characteristics (age, sex, case category, HIV co-infection, drug resistance), and treatment outcomes are reported after scheduled treatment termination. All countries follow internationally standardized definitions. Incidence rates are compared by time to observe trends, by place to compare geographical areas, and by patient's characteristics to identify high-risk groups. The laboratory plays an essential role, since the surveillance of bacteriologically confirmed cases allows the most reliable comparisons, and because of the importance of the identification of drug resistance. The number of patients examined for tuberculosis diagnosis is also a key indicator to monitor case-finding activities. Tuberculosis surveillance is today among the most performant surveillance systems for infectious diseases. The two major changes currently observed are the move from paper-based registers to individual computerized surveillance databases and the multiplication of indicators for documenting progress towards tuberculosis elimination. There is a risk that implementation of these changes be followed by a loss in data quality. All efforts should be made to accompany these changes with adequate quality control. This will only be possible if health care workers are actively involved in the process of data production and analysis.","Schwoebel, Valérie",The Indian journal of tuberculosis,71,1

OBJECTIVES To (1) determine if mean serum zinc levels differ between acne patients and controls and (2) to determine the efficacy of zinc preparations in the treatment of acne. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to recommended PRISMA [Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses] guidelines. RESULTS Subjects with acne had significantly lower serum zinc levels compared to controls. Patients who were treated with zinc had a significant improvement in mean inflammatory papule count compared to those who were not treated with zinc. There was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects in zinc supplementation versus comparators. CONCLUSIONS Acne patients have decreased serum zinc levels. Zinc is effective for the treatment of acne, particularly at decreasing the number of inflammatory papules, when used as monotherapy or as an adjunctive treatment.

This increase is most probably related to the obesity pandemic and the high consumption of fructose. However, hepatic steatosis has some rare causes (e.g., some metabolic diseases) of which clinicians should be aware, particularly (but not only) when patients are non-obese or non-overweight. Differential diagnosis is notably important when pathologies have a specific treatment, such as for glycogenosis type IX (GSD-IX). Aims To contribute to the knowledge on the differential diagnosis of NAFLD in paediatric age and to the clinical, biochemical, molecular, and histological characterisations of GSD-IX, a rare metabolic disorder. Methods We performed a retrospective study of a small series of cases (n = 3) of GSD-IX diagnosed in the past 6 years, who were currently being followed up in the Units of Gastroenterology or Metabolic Diseases of the Paediatric Division of our hospital and whose clinical presentation was NAFLD in paediatric age. Results Three male patients were diagnosed with NAFLD before 2 years of age, 2 with confirmed diagnosis before the age of 3 years (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], liver ultrasound, and molecular analysis) and 1 whose diagnosis was confirmed at 11 years (ALT, liver ultrasound, liver histology, and molecular analysis). None of the patients were obese or overweight, and the daily fructose consumption was unknown. The outcome was favourable in all 3 patients, with follow-up periods ranging from 2 to 6 years. Conclusion The decision on how far the search for secondary causes of NAFLD should go can be difficult, and GSD-IX must be on the list of possible causes.","Leuzinger Dias, Catarina; Maio, Inês; Brandão, José Ricardo; Tomás, Edite; Martins, Esmeralda; Santos Silva, Ermelinda",GE Portuguese journal of gastroenterology,71,25

METHODS Disc susceptibility data of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli causing healthcare-associated infections were evaluated. Data on annual patient-days and annual consumption (defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days) of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and ﬂuoroquinolones were analysed. RESULTS The trend of total consumption of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones significantly increased between 2000 and 2003 and remained stable between 2004 and 2009. The decreasing use of gentamicin and amikacin in recent years was associated with increasing susceptibility of E. coli, E. cloacae, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa to gentamicin, as well as increasing susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to amikacin. The use of piperacillin/tazobactam was positively correlated with the prevalence of piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant E. coli and S. maltophilia. In contrast, the use of cefotaxime and piperacillin/tazobactam was negatively correlated with the prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant E. coli and piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant S. maltophilia, respectively. The consumption of fluoroquinolones was positively correlated with the rates of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant P. aeruginosa and ceftazidime-resistant S. maltophilia.

Herein, we reported an approach to encapsulate native anti-inflammatory proteins in wind chimes like cyclodextrin (WCC) for efficient oral protein delivery. The amphiphilic WCC can self-assemble into nanoparticles in aqueous solution and achieve superior encapsulation of two antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) by simply mixing with protein solution, avoiding any extra cumbersome steps that might inactivate protein. WCC nanovehicles can effectively protect enzyme activity and enhance their intracellular delivery. SOD and CAT co-loaded WCC nanoparticles (SC/WCC) can integrate the synergistic effect of SOD and CAT for enhancing the removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS), effectively inhibit the inflammatory response by reducing the secretion of proinflammatory factors and protect cells from ROS-induced oxidative damage. In the mouse colitis model, SC/WCC administered orally was able to efficiently accumulate in the inflamed colon, significantly inhibited the expression of proinflammatory mediators and notably alleviated the symptoms related to colitis. Therefore, we believe that the strategies we described here may provide a convenient and powerful platform for the treatment of other inflammatory diseases.","Zeng, Zhiying; He, Xiao; Li, Changying; Lin, Shan; Chen, Hui; Liu, Libing; Feng, Xuli",Biomaterials,71,30

While the COVID-19 illness is largely associated with respiratory consequences, there is increased reporting of other organ-specific disease sequelae that include the skin. OBJECTIVE To identify, describe, and classify the main skin manifestations of COVID-19 and associated protocols for management. METHODS Forty-five patients from three clinical centers in North and South America with positive COVID-19 PCR and/or serology presenting cutaneous manifestations were included in this retrospective chart review. Medical history, biopsies, dermoscopy, laboratory findings, clinical photography, and disease management were documented. RESULTS Seven main types of cutaneous manifestations were identified: exanthema/molbilliform, urticaria, papular/pustular/vesicular, petechiae/purpura, livedo reticularis, chilblains, and alopecia. Histopathogical analysis from skin biopsies and/or dermoscopy highlighted an inflammatory or vascular pathophysiology depending on the type of manifestation. While the first three types of COVID-19 skin manifestations preceded or coincided with other symptoms such as anosmia, fever, chills, chilblains, and livedo were found in later disease stages. All cases had a positive resolution with appropriate treatment. CONCLUSIONS Cutaneous symptoms are part of the COVID-19 disease spectrum. Early identification, diagnosis, and management through a multidisciplinary approach can facilitate safe disease resolution for patients.

In this study, we investigated the feasibility of gasless total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) with a newly developed abdominal-wall retraction system. Methods Abdominal-wall retraction for gasless laparoscopy was performed using the newly developed J-shape retractor and the Thompson surgical retractor. Surgical outcomes between gasless TLH and conventional CO2-based TLH were compared for each of 40 patients for the period from January 2017 to October 2019. Results Between gasless TLH and conventional CO2-based TLH, no significant differences were observed for age, body mass index, parity, or surgical indications. The mean retraction setup time from skin incision was 7.4 min (range: 4-12 min) with gasless TLH. The mean total operation times were 87.9 min (range: 65-170) with gasless TLH and 90 min (range: 45-180) with conventional TLH, which showed no significant difference. Estimated blood loss and uterus weight also showed no significant intergroup difference. No major complications related to the ureter, bladder, or bowel were encountered. Conclusion Our new abdominal-wall retraction system for gasless TLH allowed for easy setup and a proper operation field in the performance of laparoscopic hysterectomy.","Kim, Mi Kyoung; Hwang, Jong Ha; Kim, Jang-Heub; Kim, Soo Rim; Lee, Sae Bom; Kim, Bo Wook",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,71,1

Arts and drama have been used to reach to communities in Cambodia to engage them in malaria research, prevention and control. The ""Village Drama Against Malaria"" (VDAM) project was conducted in north eastern and western Cambodia: Stung Treng; Battambang and Pailin provinces during 2016 to 2019. In total, VDAM reached 55 rural villages, 2,378 student participants and 43,502 audience members. Methods: This article presents the results of two stakeholder-led evaluation workshops in which participants collaboratively developed theories of change to better understand the potential and actual impact of arts and drama-based activities on malaria in these communities. The workshops had a particular focus on identifying areas for monitoring and evaluation so that impact can be measured. Workshop participants included village malaria workers, community leaders, professional and student drama performers, and representatives from the local health authorities and the national malaria control programme. Results: Five broad areas were identified as relevant for monitoring and evaluation: logistical and practical challenges; embeddedness and reach of engagement; health knowledge and confidence of young people; community-level malaria outcomes; impact on malaria. These areas align well with the monitoring and evaluation conducted to date and point to additional opportunities for data collection. Conclusions: The findings from these workshops will inform future engagement strategies, for example, we may engage a smaller number of young people but over a longer period and more in-depth.","Ean, Mom; Sanann, Nou; Callery, James J; Pell, Christopher; Peto, Thomas J; Tripura, Rupam; Cheah, Phaik Yeong",Wellcome open research,71,16

MRE11 mutations and aberrant expression are associated with carcinogenesis and cancer treatment outcomes. While, in recent years, progress has been made in understanding the role of Mre11 nuclease activities in DNA double-strand break repair, their role during replication has remained elusive. The nucleoside analog gemcitabine, widely used in cancer therapy, acts as a replication chain terminator; for a cell to survive treatment, gemcitabine needs to be removed from replicating DNA. Activities responsible for this removal have, so far, not been identified. We show that Mre11 3' to 5' exonuclease activity removes gemcitabine from nascent DNA during replication. This contributes to replication progression and gemcitabine resistance. We thus uncovered a replication-supporting role for Mre11 exonuclease activity, which is distinct from its previously reported detrimental role in uncontrolled resection in recombination-deficient cells.","Boeckemeier, L; Kraehenbuehl, R; Keszthelyi, A; Gasasira, M U; Vernon, E G; Beardmore, R; Vågbø, C B; Chaplin, D; Gollins, S; Krokan, H E; Lambert, S A E; Paizs, B; Hartsuiker, E",Science advances,71,1

Intracellular precipitation of ACC, requires [Formula: see text] concentrating as well as proton export mechanisms to promote calcification. These processes are of fundamental importance in biological mineralization, but remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the calcifying primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) use Na+/H+-exchange (NHE) mechanisms to control cellular pH homeostasis during maintenance of the skeleton. During skeleton re-calcification, pHi of PMCs is increased accompanied by substantial elevation in intracellular [Formula: see text] mediated by the [Formula: see text] cotransporter Sp_Slc4a10. However, PMCs lower their pHi regulatory capacities associated with a reduction in NHE activity.

RECENT FINDINGS New data confirm the effects of antimalarials in preventing SLE activity, damage and infections and in decreasing mortality. An important reduction in use of health resources is related to continued antimalarial use. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) may prevent preeclampsia in pregnant women with SLE. HCQ ocular toxicity is infrequent and could be associated with blood levels. Gastrointestinal and skin toxicity are underrecognized and could influence adherence. Prolongation of QT interval is extremely unusual with HCQ. Doses of HCQ of 200 mg/day seem to offer a good efficacy/toxicity balance. HCQ protection against herpes zoster and Pneumocystis jirovecii infection has been shown. On the contrary, HCQ prescription by doctors and adherence by patients are both under recommended standards. The recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in a significant shortage of HCQ in many countries with possible consequences in the correct treatment of lupus patients. SUMMARY Recent evidence reinforces the central role of HCQ in SLE therapy. The reduction in activity, damage accrual and mortality is consistent across studies, countries and ethnical groups. On the contrary, and despite the well established beneficial effects of prolonged regular HCQ therapy, many SLE patients do never take this drug or it is eventually stopped in the setting of severe flares, pregnancy or presumed toxicity. Every effort must be made to assure the correct prescription of HCQ and not to withdraw the drug unless unequivocal signs of toxicity are present.","Ruiz-Irastorza, Guillermo; Martín-Iglesias, Daniel; Soto-Peleteiro, Adriana",Current opinion in rheumatology,71,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of our clinic database from January 2004 until July 2008. The number of patients referred to the RRRP, relevant demographic data, diagnosis and treatment dispositions were recorded. Time interval between referral to consultation and consultation to simulation were also calculated. RESULTS During the study period, 3,267 patients were seen in the RRRP. Forty-five percent (1,494) of the patients were new to the clinic. Of the 3,267 patients seen, 1,548 (47.4%) were female and 1,719 (52.6%) were male. The median age was 69.2 years (range, 22-101 years). The most common primary sites were lung (34.2%), breast (21.2%) and prostate (17.0%). The majority of patients were referred for palliative treatment of bone metastases (52.4%) or treatment for brain metastases (20.7%). Of the patients referred, 2,311 (70.5%) patients received palliative radiotherapy. The median duration from referral to consultation was 4 days. The majority (82.3%) of patients were simulated and treated within the first 7 days following consultation. CONCLUSION The number of patients referred to the RRRP from January 2004-July 2008 remains comparable to our previous report (1996-2003). The overall median interval from referral to consultation for the analysed time period was 4 days. Therefore, we are continuing to meet our goal of providing rapid access to palliative radiation treatment for symptomatic cancer patients. Further information relating to progression and advancements within the clinic aimed at improving our patients' quality of life are explored.","de Sa, Eric; Sinclair, Emily; Mitera, Gunita; Wong, Jennifer; Danjoux, Cyril; Hird, Amanda; Hadi, Stephanie; Barnes, Elizabeth; Tsao, May; Chow, Edward",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,71,7

We investigated the use of an orally inserted light spectroscopy probe to measure lower esophageal oxyhemoglobin saturations (eStO2) before, during, and after transfusion and made comparisons with abdominal near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) flow. Study Design Thirteen neonates with corrected gestational ages ranging from 22 weeks, 0 day to 37 weeks, 5 days were enrolled. eStO2 and NIRS measurements were recorded continuously for a 25-hour period starting 1 hour prior to starting the 4-hour transfusion. Transabdominal ultrasound was used to measure SMA flow prior to, upon completion, and 20 hours after the transfusion. Results Twelve infants completed the study. eStO2 was well-tolerated and was weakly (r = 0.06) correlated (p < 0.001) with NIRS. Compared with NIRS, eStO2 demonstrated a markedly greater variation in oxyhemoglobin values. NIRS and SMA flow measurements did not change, while eStO2 increased from 48 ± 5% and 45 ± 5% in the pre- and intratransfusion periods to 57 ± 4% in the posttransfusion period (p = 0.03). Conclusion Measurement of eStO2 is feasible in neonates and may provide a continuous and sensitive index of rapid changes in mesenteric oxygenation in this patient population.","Vora, Farha M; Gates, Judy; Gerard, Kimberley; Hanson, Shawn; Applegate, Richard L; Blood, Arlin B",American journal of perinatology,71,31

Their mechanism of action on LD formation is likely to be different from that of seipin. Their role in maintaining cellular phosphatidylserine and cholesterol homeostasis may partially explain their requirement for viral infection. Our results suggest that the proper sorting and distribution of cellular lipids are essential for organelle biogenesis and viral infection.","Li, Yang Emma; Wang, Yichang; Du, Ximing; Zhang, Tizhong; Mak, Hoi Yin; Hancock, Sarah E; McEwen, Holly; Pandzic, Elvis; Whan, Renee M; Aw, Yvette Celine; Lukmantara, Ivan E; Yuan, Yiqiong; Dong, Xiuju; Don, Anthony; Turner, Nigel; Qi, Shiqian; Yang, Hongyuan",The Journal of cell biology,71,16

However, few data are available on the associated risk of pneumonia and influenza and work exposure on a large population scale. AIM This study aimed to examine the associated risk of pneumonia and influenza by type of work exposure. METHODS By cross-linking administrative Danish registries, we classified people in 10 different profession types. The main outcome was hospitalisation with pneumonia or influenza. A multivariable Poisson regression analysis was used to assess the associated incidence rate ratio (IRR) of being hospitalised with pneumonia or influenza by type of profession. RESULTS A total of 1,327,606 people added risk time to the analyses. In a multivariable model, work in day care, public transportation, sewers and nursing home care was associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation with pneumonia compared to work within public administration: IRR=1.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.28), IRR=1.21 (95% CI 1.09-1.34), IRR=1.61 (95% CI 1.19-2.19) and IRR=1.10 (95% CI 1.03-1.18), respectively. In a multivariable analysis, people working within public transportation were associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation with influenza compared to people working within public administration: IRR=2.54 (95% CI 1.79-3.58). CONCLUSIONS Working in day care, public transportation, sewers and nursing home care increased the associated risk of hospitalisation with pneumonia, and working within public transportation increased the associated risk of being hospitalised with influenza compared to working within public administration.","Østergaard, Lauge; Mortensen, Rikke Nørmark; Kragholm, Kristian; Dalager-Pedersen, Michael; Koch, Kristoffer; Køber, Lars; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Fosbøl, Emil",Scandinavian journal of public health,71,1

Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which was recently identified in piglets in southern China, is an alphacoronavirus that originates from the same genus of horseshoe bats as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and was reported to be capable of infecting cells from broad range of species, suggesting a considerable potential for interspecies transmission. Given the importance of coronavirus spike glycoprotein (S) in host range determination and viral entry, we report a cryo-EM structure of the SADS-CoV S-trimer in prefusion conformation at 3.55 Å resolution. Our structure reveals that SADS-CoV S-trimer assumes an intra-subunit quaternary packing mode in which the S1-NTD and S1-CTD of the same protomer pack together by facing each other in the ""lying-down"" state. SADS-CoV S has several distinctive structural features that may facilitate immune escape, such as relatively compact architecture of the S-trimer and epitope masking by glycan shielding. Comparison of SADS-CoV S with those of the other coronavirus spike proteins suggested that the structural features of SADS-CoV S are evolutionarily related to other genera rather than being that of a typical alphacoronavirus. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary relationship between spike glycoproteins of SADS-CoV and other coronaviruses and extends our understanding of their structural and functional diversity.SIGNIFICANCE In this article, we report the atomic-resolution pre-fusion structure of spike protein from swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). SADS-CoV is a pathogenic alphacoronavirus responsible for large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs that was reported to be capable of interspecies transmission. We describe the overall structure of the SADS-CoV spike protein and conduct detailed analysis of its main structural elements. Our results and analyses are consistent with the previous phylogenetic studies and suggest that SADS-CoV spike protein is evolutionarily related to spike proteins of betacoronaviruses, with strong similarity in S1-NTDs and marked divergence in S1-CTDs. Moreover, we discussed possible immune evasion strategies used by SADS-CoV spike protein. Our study provides insights into structure and immune evasion strategies of SADS-CoV spike protein and broadens the understanding of evolutionary relationships between coronavirus spike proteins of different genera.","Guan, Hongxin; Wang, Youwang; Perčulija, Vanja; Saeed, Abdullah F U H; Liu, Yichang; Li, Jinyu; Jan, Syed Sajid; Li, Yu; Zhu, Ping; Ouyang, Songying",Journal of virology,71,1

We reported nodal and breast downstaging rates with NET, and compared axillary response rates following NET and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). METHODS Consecutive stage I-III breast cancer patients treated with NET and surgery from January 2009 to December 2019 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Nodal pCR rates were compared between biopsy-proven node-positive patients treated with NET, and HR+/HER2- patients treated with NAC from November 2013 to July 2019. RESULTS 127 cancers treated with NET and 338 with NAC were included. NET recipients were older, more likely to have lobular and lower-grade tumors, and higher HR expression. With NET, the nodal pCR rate was 11% (4/38) of biopsy-proven cases, and the breast pCR rate was 1.6% (2/126). Nodal-dowstaging rates with NET and NAC were not significantly different (11% vs 18%; P = 0.37). Patients achieving nodal pCR with NET versus NAC were older (median age 70 vs 50, P = 0.004) and had greater progesterone receptor (PR) expression (85% vs 13%, P = 0.031), respectively. Of patients not candidates for BCS due to a large tumor relative to breast size, 36/47 (77%) became BCS-eligible with NET (median PR expression 55% vs 5% in those remaining ineligible, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Although nodal pCR is more frequent than breast pCR, NET is more likely to de-escalate breast surgery than axillary surgery. However, with a nodal pCR rate of 11%, NET remains an option for downstaging node-positive patients without clear indications for NAC.","Montagna, Giacomo; Sevilimedu, Varadan; Fornier, Monica; Jhaveri, Komal; Morrow, Monica; Pilewskie, Melissa L",Annals of surgical oncology,71,1

A remaining unanswered question is whether elevated amygdala activity in those with familial risk for depression is related to the presence of subthreshold symptoms or to a trait-level vulnerability for illness. METHODS To examine this question, functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected in nondepressed young adults with (family history [FH+]) (n = 27) or without (FH-) (n = 45) a first-degree relative with a history of depression while they viewed images of ""looming"" or withdrawing stimuli (faces and cars) that varied in salience by virtue of their apparent proximity to the subject. Activation of the amygdala and 2 other regions known to exhibit responses to looming stimuli, the dorsal intraparietal sulcus (DIPS) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv), were measured, as well as levels of resilience, anxiety, and psychotic and depressive symptoms. RESULTS Compared with the FH- group, the FH+ group exhibited significantly greater responses of the amygdala, but not the dorsal intraparietal sulcus or ventral premotor cortex, to looming face stimuli. Moreover, amygdala responses in the FH+ group were negatively correlated with levels of resilience and unrelated to levels of subthreshold symptoms of psychopathology. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that elevated amygdala activity in nondepressed young adults with a familial history of depression is more closely linked to poor resilience than to current symptom state.","Barbour, Tracy; Holmes, Avram J; Farabaugh, Amy H; DeCross, Stephanie N; Coombs, Garth; Boeke, Emily A; Wolthusen, Rick P F; Nyer, Maren; Pedrelli, Paola; Fava, Maurizio; Holt, Daphne J",Biological psychiatry.

Parenteral exposure to HCV is the major mode of transmission of infection. Once established, infection will persist in up to 85% of individuals with only a minority of patients clearing viremia. Egypt has possibly the highest HCV prevalence in the world where 10-20% of the general population are infected with HCV. Endemic HCV appears to be concentrated in the tropics and sub-tropics where there are higher biting rates from insects. The question as to whether a bridge vector transmission is possible, via arthropods, both between humans and/or from an animal reservoir to humans is explored. Mechanical transmission, as opposed to biological transmission, is considered. Mechanical transmission can be an efficient way of transmitting an infection, as effective as biological transmission. Probability of transmission can increase as to the immediate circumstances and conditions at the time. Several factors may enhance mechanical transmission, including high levels of microbes in the vector, frequent biting, the close proximity, and contact between vectors and recipients as well as high density of insects. HCV has been isolated from bodies or heads of mosquitoes collected from the houses of HCV-infected individuals. The possibility of enzootic cycles of HCV tangential transmission via bridging vectors, such as, arthropods needs to be further investigated and possible animal reservoirs, including domestic rural epizootic cycles for HCV infection, requires further research with particular initial emphasis on equine infections.

This unforeseen situation has led to psychological problems among these health care workers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the mental health status of pan-Indian frontline doctors combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted among frontline doctors of tertiary care hospitals in India (East: Kolkata, West Bengal; North: New Delhi; West: Nagpur, Maharashtra; and South: Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala) from May 23, 2020, to June 6, 2020. Doctors involved in clinical services in outpatient departments, designated COVID-19 wards, screening blocks, fever clinics, and intensive care units completed an online questionnaire. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale were used to assess depression and perceived stress. Results The results of 422 responses revealed a 63.5% and 45% prevalence of symptoms of depression and stress, respectively, among frontline COVID-19 doctors. Postgraduate trainees constituted the majority (45.5%) of the respondents. Moderately severe and severe depression was noted in 14.2% and 3.8% of the doctors, respectively. Moderate and severe stress was noted in 37.4% and 7.6% of participants, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis showed working ≥ 6 hours/day (adjusted odds ratio: 3.5; 95% CI, 1.9-6.3; P < .0001) to be a significant risk factor for moderate or severe perceived stress, while single relationship status (adjusted odds ratio: 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.9; P = .002) and working ≥ 6 hours/day (adjusted odds ratio: 10.3; 95% CI, 4.3-24.6; P < .0001) significantly contributed to the development of moderate, moderately severe, or severe depression. Conclusions The pandemic has taken a serious toll on the physical and mental health of doctors, as evident from our study. Regular screening of medical personnel involved in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19 should be conducted to evaluate for stress, anxiety, and depression.","Das, Anupam; Sil, Abheek; Jaiswal, Saurabh; Rajeev, Rahul; Thole, Akhilesh; Jafferany, Mohammad; Ali, Syed Naiyer",The primary care companion for CNS disorders,71,1

We argue that to unravel the American COVID-19 crisis-and to craft effective responses-we need a more sophisticated understanding of the political culture of public health crises. We use data from interviews and online media to examine symbolic representation of public health phenomena (masks; public health institutions) within the first months of the US epidemic. We show how political scripts about pandemic responses are shaped by, and align with, deeply-rooted social values and political cultures. Social processes of meaning-making help explain the evolution of increasingly partisan public health discourse regarding topics like masking and institutional trust. We highlight the lack of memorialization of deaths in America-that has not acquired the same polarized political meaning as other issues-to consider how and why certain issues gain political valence, and what opportunities certain acts of politicization provide in shifting public discourse. The coronavirus pandemic challenged the science of public health strategy, and the legitimacy of its institutions, with devastating consequences. Anticipating and understanding the central role of political cultures, cultural scripts, and meanings in positioning public health measures is essential for more effective responses to COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Kenworthy, Nora; Koon, Adam D; Mendenhall, Emily",Global public health,71,1

Facility-based childbirth is promoted as the standard of care for reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. We conducted a convergent, mixed methods study to assess barriers and facilitators to facility-based childbirth at Hôpital Universitaire de Mirebalais (HUM) in Mirebalais, Haiti. METHODS We conducted secondary analyses of a prospective cohort of pregnant women seeking antenatal care at HUM and quantitatively assessed predictors of not having a facility-based childbirth at HUM. We prospectively enrolled 30 pregnant women and interviewed them about their experiences delivering at home or at HUM. RESULTS Of 1105 pregnant women seeking antenatal care at the hospital between May and December 2017, 773 (70%) returned to the hospital for facility-based childbirth. In multivariable analyses, living farther from the hospital (adjusted OR (AOR)=0.73; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.96), poverty (AOR=0.93; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99) and household hunger (AOR=0.45; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.79) were associated with not having a facility-based childbirth. Primigravid women were more likely to have a facility-based childbirth (AOR=1.34, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.76). Qualitative data provided insight into the value women place on traditional birth attendants ('matrons') during home-based childbirths. While women perceived facility-based childbirths as better equipped to handle birth complications, barriers such as distance, costs of transportation and supplies, discomfort of facility birthing practices and mistreatment by medical staff resulted in negative perceptions of facility-based childbirths. CONCLUSION Pregnant women in rural Haiti must overcome substantial structural barriers and forfeit valued support from traditional birth attendants when they pursue facility-based childbirths. If traditional birth attendants could be involved in care alongside midwives at facilities, women may be more inclined to deliver there. While complex structural barriers remain, the inclusion of matrons at facilities may increase uptake of facility-based childbirths, and ultimately improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.","Raymondville, Maxi; Rodriguez, Carly A; Richterman, Aaron; Jerome, Gregory; Katz, Arlene; Gilbert, Hannah; Anderson, Gregory; Joseph, Jean Paul; Franke, Molly F; Ivers, Louise C",BMJ global health,71,1

For members of the Caliciviridae, neither the nature of these structural changes in the capsid nor the factor(s) responsible for inducing these changes is known. Feline junctional adhesion molecule A (fJAM-A) mediates the attachment and infectious viral entry of feline calicivirus (FCV). Here, we show that the infectivity of some FCV isolates is neutralized following incubation with the soluble receptor at 37 degrees C. We used this property to select mutants resistant to preincubation with the soluble receptor. We isolated and sequenced 24 soluble receptor-resistant (srr) mutants and characterized the growth properties and receptor-binding activities of eight mutants. The location of the mutations within the capsid structure of FCV was mapped using a new 3.6-A structure of native FCV. The srr mutations mapped to the surface of the P2 domain were buried at the protruding domain dimer interface or were present in inaccessible regions of the capsid protein. Coupled with data showing that both the parental FCV and the srr mutants underwent increases in hydrophobicity upon incubation with the soluble receptor at 37 degrees C, these findings indicate that FCV likely undergoes conformational change upon interaction with its receptor. Changes in FCV capsid conformation following its interaction with fJAM-A may be important for subsequent interactions of the capsid with cellular membranes, membrane penetration, and genome delivery.","Ossiboff, Robert J; Zhou, Yi; Lightfoot, Patrick J; Prasad, B V Venkataram; Parker, John S L",Journal of virology,71,1

Notwithstanding ethical considerations, the prioritization of patients with better prognoses may support a more effective use of available capacity in maximizing aggregate outcomes. This has prompted various proposed triage criteria, although in none of these has an objective assessment been made in terms of impact on number of lives and life-years saved. DESIGN An open-source computer simulation model was constructed for approximating the intensive care admission and discharge dynamics under triage. The model was calibrated from observational data for 9505 patient admissions to UK intensive care units. To explore triage efficacy under various conditions, scenario analysis was performed using a range of demand trajectories corresponding to differing nonpharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS Triaging patients at the point of expressed demand had negligible effect on deaths but reduces life-years lost by up to 8.4% (95% confidence interval: 2.6% to 18.7%). Greater value may be possible through ""reverse triage"", that is, promptly discharging any patient not meeting the criteria if admission cannot otherwise be guaranteed for one who does. Under such policy, life-years lost can be reduced by 11.7% (2.8% to 25.8%), which represents 23.0% (5.4% to 50.1%) of what is operationally feasible with no limit on capacity and in the absence of improved clinical treatments. CONCLUSIONS The effect of simple triage is limited by a tradeoff between reduced deaths within intensive care (due to improved outcomes) and increased deaths resulting from declined admission (due to lower throughput given the longer lengths of stay of survivors). Improvements can be found through reverse triage, at the expense of potentially complex ethical considerations.","Wood, Richard M; Pratt, Adrian C; Kenward, Charlie; McWilliams, Christopher J; Booton, Ross D; Thomas, Matthew J; Bourdeaux, Christopher P; Vasilakis, Christos",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,71,1

SUBJECTS AND METHODS An online cross-sectional observational study was done with the participation of patients diagnosed with AS or COPD. AS and COPD patients completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to identify a major depressive disorder risk. RESULTS Two hundred seventy-seven patients diagnosed with AS or COPD aged 18 to 69 (M=60.4, SD=17.6) participated. The risk of major depression was assessed using the PHQ-9 sent online after telephone contact with the participants. 30.7% of the patients during the last month reported a risk of major depression, and it was associated with a history of major depressive disorder (OR=4.39, 95% CI 1.53-12.67) and medical comorbidity (OR=1.69, 95% CI 1.00-2.86).

Patients with cancer are immunocompromised and may be vulnerable to COVID-related morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to determine if patients with cancer have worse outcomes compared with patients without cancer and to identify demographic and clinical predictors of morbidity and mortality among patients with cancer. METHODS We used data from adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to two New York-Presbyterian hospitals between March 3 and May 15, 2020. Patients with cancer were matched 1:4 to controls without cancer in terms of age, sex, and number of comorbidities. Using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test, we compared morbidity (intensive care unit admission and intubation) and mortality outcomes between patients with cancer and controls. Among those with cancer, we identified demographic and clinical predictors of worse outcomes using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS We included 585 patients who were COVID-19 positive, of whom 117 had active malignancy, defined as those receiving cancer-directed therapy or under active surveillance within 6 months of admission. Presenting symptoms and in-hospital complications were similar between the cancer and noncancer groups. Nearly one half of patients with cancer were receiving therapy, and 45% of patients received cytotoxic or immunosuppressive treatment within 90 days of admission. There were no statistically significant differences in morbidity or mortality (P = .894) between patients with and without cancer. CONCLUSION We observed that patients with COVID-19 and cancer had similar outcomes compared with matched patients without cancer. This finding suggests that a diagnosis of active cancer alone and recent anticancer therapy do not predict worse COVID-19 outcomes and therefore, recommendations to limit cancer-directed therapy must be considered carefully in relation to cancer-specific outcomes and death.","Brar, Gagandeep; Pinheiro, Laura C; Shusterman, Michael; Swed, Brandon; Reshetnyak, Evgeniya; Soroka, Orysya; Chen, Frank; Yamshon, Samuel; Vaughn, John; Martin, Peter; Paul, Doru; Hidalgo, Manuel; Shah, Manish A",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,71,1

Increasing evidence suggests that significant species differences exist in meloxicam metabolism. Because of this, dose extrapolation from domestic animals may not be appropriate for exotic species. The objective of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in a population of male Malayan flying foxes, Pteropus vampyrus, following a single oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Using a sparse sampling method based on a pilot study, two blood samples from each of 10 bats were collected over an 8-hr time period. Analysis of meloxicam in plasma samples was conducted using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The peak plasma concentration of 598 ± 157.5 ng/ml occurred at 1.0 hr post dosing. The terminal half-life was 1.1 ± 0.1 hr, which indicates that meloxicam is rapidly metabolized in this species. No adverse clinical effects were noted during the study period. A single oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg appears safe for use in male Malayan flying foxes, but due to rapid elimination, frequent dosing may be required to maintain plasma concentrations within a therapeutic range.

Conventionally, public health is viewed as an evidence-based profession that is above politics. Yet national responses to COVID-19 in India reveal the embeddedness of health and illnesses in the larger politics of the state. Although it is still early to assess the full spectrum of damage caused by lack of central-level planning, this article argues against COVID-19 being viewed as a 'great leveller'. Rather, it suggests that we inhabit somatic societies that regularly employ the vocabulary of pathology/disease to determine social health. Moreover, the Indian experience illustrates how, even during a pandemic, 'social distancing' is not an apolitical notion. It becomes a measure for the state to co-opt scientific interventions of risk mitigation and relay them to people as a metaphor for exclusion: thereby exacerbating deeper structural inequities around which access to health and well-being of the population is organised.","Rahman, Sabina Yasmin",Health sociology review : the journal of the Health Section of the Australian Sociological Association,71,1

METHODOLOGY In this single-centre, cross-sectional, real-world study, serum levels of 5 TMs (CEA, CYFRA 21-1, SCC, ProGRP, NSE) were measured from consented patients with suspicious lung nodules who were candidates for biopsy, and also from healthy controls. TM level measurement was done through electrochemiluminescent immunoassay, followed by histological diagnosis on the biopsied specimen. Using package insert cut-offs, sensitivity and specificity of the 5 TMs were evaluated individually and in combination. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of individual TMs, the ability of CEA, CYFRA 21-1, and ProGRP taken together was evaluated for its ability to differentiate LC from no-LC. RESULTS Out of 178 subjects, 160 had LC (147 NSCLC; 13 SCLC). NSCLC patients had higher median values of CYFRA 21-1 and SCC; SCLC patients had higher median values of CEA, NSE, and ProGRP. Adenocarcinoma-NSCLC patients had higher median values of CEA, CYFRA 21-1, NSE, and ProGRP; squamous-NSCLC patients had higher median value of SCC. For differentiating LC from no-LC, the combination of all 5 TMs (sensitivity:97.5%, specificity:33.3%) and combination of CEA, CYFRA 21-1 and ProGRP (sensitivity:91.3%, specificity:88.9%) were found suitable. CONCLUSION Combination of all 5 TMs, and combination of CEA, CYFRA 21-1, and ProGRP represents an easy and non-invasive method for aid in LC diagnosis that does not require technical expertise. TM evaluation can also supplement histological diagnosis of LC. .","Mehta, Anurag; Parkash, Anuj; Bhatia, Meenu",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,71,1

Neonatal care is emblematic of these acute services as averting deaths requires skilled care over many days from multiple professionals with at least basic equipment. However, hospital care is often of poor quality and large-scale change is needed to improve outcomes. In this manuscript we aim to show how we have drawn upon our understanding of contexts of care in Kenyan general hospital NBUs, and on social and behavioural theories that offer potential mechanisms of change in these settings, to develop an initial programme theory guiding a large scale change intervention to improve neonatal care and outcomes. Our programme theory is an expression of our assumptions about what actions will be both useful and feasible. It incorporates a recognition of our strengths and limitations as a research-practitioner partnership to influence change. The steps we employ represent the initial programme theory development phase commonly undertaken in many Realist Evaluations. However, unlike many Realist Evaluations that develop initial programme theories focused on pre-existing interventions or programmes, our programme theory informs the design of a new intervention that we plan to execute. Within this paper we articulate briefly how we propose to operationalise this new intervention. Finally, we outline the quantitative and qualitative research activities that we will use to address specific questions related to the delivery and effects of this new intervention, discussing some of the challenges of such study designs. We intend that this research on the intervention will inform future efforts to revise the programme theory and yield transferable learning.","English, Mike; Nzinga, Jacinta; Irimu, Grace; Gathara, David; Aluvaala, Jalemba; McKnight, Jacob; Wong, Geoffrey; Molyneux, Sassy",Wellcome open research,71,20

K-space undersampling is an obvious approach to accelerate MR acquisition. However, undersampling of k-space data can result in blurring and aliasing artefacts for the reconstructed images. Recently, several studies have been proposed to use deep learning-based data-driven models for MRI reconstruction and have obtained promising results. However, the comparison of these methods remains limited because the models have not been trained on the same datasets and the validation strategies may be different. The purpose of this work is to conduct a comparative study to investigate the generative adversarial network (GAN)-based models for MRI reconstruction. We reimplemented and benchmarked four widely used GAN-based architectures including DAGAN, ReconGAN, RefineGAN and KIGAN. These four frameworks were trained and tested on brain, knee and liver MRI images using twofold, fourfold and sixfold accelerations, respectively, with a random undersampling mask. Both quantitative evaluations and qualitative visualization have shown that the RefineGAN method has achieved superior performance in reconstruction with better accuracy and perceptual quality compared to other GAN-based methods.

It leads to a lack of tissue oxygen delivery and, if not addressed quickly, will inevitably cause death. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the only available treatment for CPA and several opportunities exist to improve the veterinary team's resuscitation approach and optimize small animal CPR patient outcomes. In 2012, the Reassessment Campaign on Veterinary Resuscitation (RECOVER) initiative generated evidence-based clinical guidelines to form the basis for training and practice of CPR in dogs and cats. When employing an evidence-based, standardized approach to small animal CPR, return of spontaneous circulation can be achieved in up to 58% of patients and up to 7% of dogs and 19% of cats can be discharged from the veterinary hospital alive. Survival for dogs and cats that suffer CPA is best in patients that suffer a peri-anesthetic arrest, so high quality CPR in the anesthesia patient population is of utmost importance and expected to be the most rewarding. To ensure the best possible outcomes for any patient suffering from CPA and undergoing CPR, a comprehensive resuscitation strategy is necessary, that includes preventive and preparedness measures, basic life support (chest compressions and ventilation), advanced life support (optimization of the patient status by targeted drug therapy, cardiac rhythm monitoring, and defibrillation), and post-cardiac arrest critical care. This article summarizes the most important RECOVER CPR guidelines for the small animal practitioner.","Hoehne, S; Kruppert, A; Boller, M",Schweizer Archiv fur Tierheilkunde,71,8

There are four identified factors that puts one at high-risk for infection and/or mortality creating a disparity: age, comorbidities, race/ethnicity, and gender. Data indicate that the older a person is, and/or the presence of obesity and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease place one at higher risk for COVID-19. In the United States, specific race/ethnicities, particularly African Americans and Native Americans, are strong COVID-19 risk components. Male gender has also emerged as a severity risk factor. For age and racial/ethnicities, the accumulation of health comorbidities are common precipitating mechanisms. In particular, underlying socioeconomic structures in the United States likely drive development of comorbidities, putting affected populations at higher risk for severe COVID-19. Sudden cardiac death triggered by a common sodium channel variant in African Americans with COVID-19 has not been evaluated as a cause for racial disparity. There is no evidence that racial/ethnic differences for COVID-19 are caused by ABO blood groups, use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or from amino acid substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There is growing evidence that androgen-enabled expression of ACE2 receptors and the serine protease TMPRSS2, two permissive elements engaging the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for infection, may contribute to severe COVID-19 in men. Overall, COVID-19 has generated disparities for who is infected and the severity of that infection. Understanding the mechanisms for the disparity will help nullify the differences in risk for COVID-19.","Carethers, John M",Journal of internal medicine,71,1

METHODS Pharyngeal swabs were collected at four study sites (Agogo, Ghana: n=490; Lambaréné, Gabon: n=182; Mbeya, Tanzania: n=293; Nouna, Burkina Faso: n=115) and analysed for RSV and other respiratory viruses using rtPCR. For RSV positive samples, sequence analysis of the second hypervariable region of the G-gene was performed. A dataset of RSV strains from sub-Saharan Africa (2011-2017) currently available in GenBank was compiled. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to identify the diversity of circulating RSV genotypes. RESULTS In total, 46 samples tested RSV positive (Ghana n=31 (6.3%), Gabon n=4 (2.2%), Tanzania n=9 (3.1%), Burkina Faso n=2 (1.7%)). The most common RSV co-infection was with rhinovirus. All RSV-A strains clustered with genotype ON1 strains with a 72-nucleotide duplication and all RSV-B strains belonged to genotype BAIX. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences from sub-Saharan Africa revealed the diversification into 11 different ON1 and 22 different BAIX lineages and differentiation of ON1 and BAIX strains into potential new sub-genotypes, provisionally named ON1-NGR, BAIX-KEN1, BAIX-KEN2 and BAIX-KEN3. CONCLUSION The study contributes to an improved understanding of the molecular epidemiology of RSV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. It provides the first phylogenetic data for RSV from Tanzania, Gabon and Burkina Faso and combines it with RSV strains from all other sub-Saharan countries currently available in GenBank.","Marlene Ihling, Clara; Schnitzler, Paul; Heinrich, Norbert; Mangu, Chacha; Sudi, Lwitiho; Souares, Aurélia; Gies, Sabine; Sié, Ali; Coulibaly, Boubacar; Thierry Ouédraogo, Andiyam; Mordmüller, Benjamin; Held, Jana; Akim Adegnika, Ayola; Fernandes, José F; Eckerle, Isabella; May, Juergen; Hogan, Benedikt; Eibach, Daniel; Tabatabai, Julia",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,71,5

STUDY DESIGN In vivo experimental. ANIMALS Four normal adult quarterhorse crossbreed horses (2-4 years of age, > 250 kg). METHODS One mid-cervical spinal unit (C3-C4) was distracted with a porous metal interbody fusion device (IFD) and stabilized with a polyaxial pedicle screw and rod construct. Neurologic examinations were performed preoperatively and postoperatively. Radiographs of the fusion site and adjoining vertebrae were obtained preoperatively and monthly. Horses were euthanized at 8 months and spinal units were evaluated for osseointegration and implant safety via micro-computed tomography (CT), histology, and histomorphometry. RESULTS The procedure was performed safely in all horses, without severe postoperative complications. Evaluation of radiographs revealed no implant failure, implant migration, or spinal unit instability in any of the horses. The presence of new bone formation around the screw and rod constructs was confirmed via micro-CT. No evidence of inflammation or iatrogenic damage was noted from histology. New bone was present within the IFD in all horses, with variable osseointegration on the cranial and caudal surfaces of the implant in 3 horses. CONCLUSION The novel technique reported in the present study was safely applied to stabilize the C3-C4 spinal unit in the horses tested here and led to variable osseointegration within 8 months. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The results of this study justify evaluation of this technique in horses with a diagnosis of cervical vertebral compressive myelopathy.","Aldrich, Ellison; Nout-Lomas, Yvette; Seim, Howard B; Easley, Jeremiah T",Veterinary surgery : VS,71,27

RESULTS There was a significant interaction between treatment and time on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, on the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, on the 9-Hole Peg Test, and on the 8-Meter Walking Time (P < 0.001). At the end of the sessions, all performance scores were significantly different in the sham trial, compared to the intervention trial.

We demonstrate that, when the confining external potential is designed to produce an approximate 1/r 2 density profile, the particles crystallize into highly ordered structures featuring spiral crystalline lines. Despite the strong inhomogeneity of the observed configurations, most of them are characterized by small density of topological defects, typical of conformal crystals, and the net topological charge induced by the simply-connected geometry of the system is concentrated near the cluster center. These crystals are shown to be robust with respect to thermal fluctuations up to a certain threshold temperature, above which the net charge is progressively redistributed from the center to the rest of the system and the topological order is lost. The crystals are also resilient to the shear stress produced by a small nonuniform azimuthal force field, rotating as a rigid body (RB). For larger forces, topological defects proliferate and the RB rotation gives place to plastic flow.","Silva, Fillipe C O; Menezes, Raí M; Cabral, Leonardo R E; de Souza Silva, Clécio C",Journal of physics.

However, when size exceeds 5 cm visceral aneurysms are considered as ""giant"" (giant visceral artery aneurysms or GVAAs) and management is significantly more complex. Between August 2007 and June 2019 eleven cases of GVAAs that were endovascularly treated were retrospectively reviewed and included in this single center study. Mean size was 80 mm (± 26.3 mm) x 46 mm (+ \-11.8 mm). Nine of the lesions were true aneurysms, and two were pseudoaneurysms. In 8 patients, the lesion was causing compression symptoms in the surrounding organs, one patient developed a contained rupture while 2 patients were completely asymptomatic. However, all patients were hemodynamically stable at the time of treatment. Technical success was defined as immediate complete exclusion of the aneurysmal sac, and clinical success as complete relief from clinical symptoms. Follow-up was performed with CT angiography, ultrasound and clinical examination. Mean follow-up was 45 months (range 6-84). Technical and clinical success were both 91%. Complications were one lack of control of contained rupture that was subsequently operated, one case of self-limiting non-target spleen embolization and one case of splenic abscess. Three patients died, one due to the contained rupture 15 days after procedure, the other two for other causes and occurred during the long-term follow-up. This series suggests that endovascular treatment of giant visceral artery aneurysms and pseudoaneuryms is a valid minimally invasive solution with very satisfactory immediate and long-term outcomes unless the aneurysm is already ruptured. A variety of endovascular tools may be required for successful treatment.","Tipaldi, Marcello Andrea; Krokidis, Miltiadis; Orgera, Gianluigi; Pignatelli, Matteo; Ronconi, Edoardo; Laurino, Florindo; Laghi, Andrea; Rossi, Michele",Scientific reports,71,26

A multiport device (SILS Port, Covidien, USA) was placed at the umbilical area through a single 3 cm incision. Three cannulae were introduced in the multiport device through the access channels and laparoscopic ovariohysterectomy was performed using a 5-mm sealing device, a 5-mm articulating grasper and a 5-mm 30° laparoscope. The mean total operative time was 52.66±15.20 minutes and the mean skin incision during surgery was 3.09±0.20 cm. Of the nine cases examined, in the one with an ovarian tumour, the technique was converted to multiport laparoscopy introducing an additional 5-mm trocar. No surgical complications were encountered and intraoperative blood loss was minimum in all animals. Clashing of the instruments and reduced triangulation were the main limitations of this technique. The combination of articulated and straight instruments facilitated triangulation towards the surgical field and dissection capability. One month after surgery a complete wound healing was observed in all animals. The present data showed that ovariohysterectomy performed with a single-port access is technically feasible in dogs. The unique abdominal incision minimises the abdominal trauma with good cosmetic results.","Sánchez-Margallo, F M; Tapia-Araya, A; Díaz-Güemes, I",Veterinary record open,71,5

Animals bearing human MDSC-containing solid tumor xenografts received treatment with MDSC-targeting human natural killer (NK) cells and underwent nanoparticle contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging. Whereas conventional CT-derived tumor metrics were unable to differentiate NK cell immunotherapy tumors from untreated tumors, nano-radiomics revealed texture-based features capable of differentiating treatment groups.

The prevalence of obesity was approximately 13% among world's adult population. Recently, several reports suggested that the interference of gut microbiota composition and function is associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity. Gut microbiota produce a board range of metabolites involved in energy and glucose homeostasis, leading to the alteration in host metabolism. However, systematic evaluation of the relationship between gut microbiota, gut metabolite and host metabolite profiles in obese adults is still lacking. In this study, we used comparative metagenomics and metabolomics analysis to determine the gut microbiota and gut-host metabolite profiles in six normal and obese adults of Chinese origin, respectively. Following the functional and pathway analysis, we aimed to understand the possible impact of gut microbiota on the host metabolites via the change in gut metabolites. The result showed that the change in gut microbiota may result in the modulation of gut metabolites contributing to glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle and homolactic fermentation. Furthermore, integrated metabolomic analysis demonstrated a possible positive correlation of dysregulated metabolites in the gut and host, including l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine, uric acid, kynurenic acid, cholesterol sulfate and glucosamine, which were reported to contribute to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes. The findings of this study provide the possible association between gut microbiota-metabolites and host metabolism in obese adults.

We sought to study the impact of the surge period on patients with cancer prescribed radiation treatment (RT). METHODS We reviewed our secure departmental quality assurance database for all patients who underwent RT planning simulations from March 6, 2020, through April 30, 2020. A priority level between 1 and 3 was prospectively assigned to each case based on faculty consensus to determine which patients required immediate RT. In May 2020, each faculty physician again retrospectively reviewed their patients from the database and provided additional commentary on how the COVID-19 pandemic had affected each patient's care. All statistics are descriptive. RESULTS A total of 412 RT courses in 406 unique patients were simulated for linear accelerator-based external beam RT. The median age was 66 years. Treatment intent was curative in 70.6% and palliative in 29.4%. Of the 412 cases, 66.7% were priority 1, 25% priority 2, and 7.8% priority 3. Two hundred thirty-nine cases (58%) underwent standard-of-care diagnosis, workup, and treatment plan. Seventeen patients (4.1%) electively canceled their RT, and 17 others (4.1%) electively delayed RT start. Thirty-four (8.3%) were prescribed hypofractionation to shorten their RT course, and 22 (5.3%) had a change in modality. Incomplete or delayed workup was identified in 19 cases (4.6%). CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic surge resulted in 42% of our patients having a non-standard-of-care pathway.

INS upstream and downstream defects were analyzed and revealed that only the kisspeptin and glucagon coding genes were upstream to INS. A metabolic dominance was, thus, inferred, and discussed herein with its implications in puberty, obesity, infertility and cardiovascular function.","Geronikolou, Styliani A; Pavlopoulou, Athanassia; Cokkinos, Dennis; Bacopoulou, Flora; Chrousos, George",European journal of clinical investigation,71,1

Sucrose transport, mediating distribution of photosynthates in plant, is a key physiological process impacted by drought and salinity stresses, as sucrose is a prime energy and signaling molecule as well as an osmolyte. Therefore, understanding the effects of abiotic stresses on sucrose transport and transporters, and underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms is imperative to maintain sugar homeostasis in plants under stress. Here, we investigated the effects of drought and salinity stresses on sucrose transport and distribution, and on expression levels of genes encoding SWEET transporters, along with a potential transcription factor regulating SWEET expression in rice. We observed that drought and salinity stresses increased the sucrose content in leaf and root tissues, and in phloem sap of rice indica varieties. Expression analyses of SWEET genes and histochemical analysis of GUS reporter transgenic plants suggested that OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 are major SWEET transporters regulating the sucrose transport and levels in response to the abiotic stresses. Transactivation analyses showed that an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15, and activates their expression. Taken together, the results showed that the higher expressions of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 genes, induced by binding of an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 to the promoters, potentially modulate sucrose transport and distribution in response to the abiotic stresses. The mechanism could possibly be targeted for maintaining sugar homeostasis in rice under drought and salinity stresses. This article is protected by copyright.

In reality, synchrony between the patient and ventilator is complex and can be affected by the ventilator settings, type of ventilator, patient-ventilator interface, and sedation. Inspections of airway pressure and flow waveforms are reliable methods for detecting asynchrony, and automated detection seems accurate. A number of types of asynchronies have been defined, and asynchrony during invasive and noninvasive ventilation have different calling cards. There is a clear association between asynchrony, ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Whether these are cause and effect or simply associated remains to be determined.","Branson, Richard D; Blakeman, Thomas C; Robinson, Bryce R H",Respiratory care,71,19

Rigid bronchoscopy is typically performed under general anesthesia because of the strong stimulation caused by metal instruments. Anesthesia for rigid bronchoscopy is challenging to administer because anesthesiologists and interventionists share the same working channel: the airway. Previously reviewed anesthetic methods are used primarily for short procedures. Balanced anesthesia with ultrasound-guided superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) block and total intravenous anesthesia might provide anesthesia for a prolonged procedure and facilitate patient recovery. PATIENT CONCERNS A patient with obstructed endobronchial stent was referred for therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy, which requires deeper anesthesia than flexible bronchoscopy. There were concerns of the stronger stimulation of the rigid bronchoscopy, lengthy duration of the procedure, higher risk of hypoxemia, and the difficulty of mechanical ventilation weaning after anesthesia due to the patients co-morbidities. DIAGNOSIS A 66-year-old female patient presented with a history of breast cancer with lung metastases. Right main bronchus obstruction due to external compression of lung metastases was relieved through insertion of an endobronchial stent, but obstructive granulation developed after 4 months. Presence of the malfunctioning stent caused severe cough and discomfort. Removal of the stent by using a flexible bronchoscope was attempted twice but failed. INTERVENTIONS Regional anesthesia of the upper airway through ultrasound-guided SLN block combined with intratracheal 2% lidocaine spray was performed to assist in total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) during rigid bronchoscopy. OUTCOMES The patient maintained steady spontaneous breathing throughout the procedure without laryngospasm, bucking, or desaturation. Emergence from anesthesia was smooth and rapid after propofol infusion was discontinued. The surgery lasted 2.5 hours without discontinuity, and no perioperative pulmonary or cardiovascular complications were noted. CONCLUSION Ultrasound-guided SLN block is a simple technique with a high success rate and low complication rate. Application of SLN block to assist TIVA provides sufficient anesthesia for lengthened therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy without interruption and facilitates patient recovery.","Liao, Yu-Chen; Wu, Wei-Ciao; Hsieh, Ming-Hui; Chang, Chuen-Chau; Tsai, Hsiao-Chien",Medicine,71,1

In this Health Policy, we explore the current health of the population, the changing health needs, and future threats to health. Relative to other high-income countries, the UK is lagging on many health outcomes, such as life expectancy and infant mortality, and there is a growing burden of mental illness. Successes exist, such as the striking improvements in oral health, but inequalities in health persist as well. The growth of the ageing population relative to the working-age population, the rise of multimorbidity, and persistent health inequalities, particularly for preventable illness, are all issues that the National Health Service (NHS) will face in the years to come. Meeting the challenges of the future will require an increased focus on health promotion and disease prevention, involving a more concerted effort to understand and tackle the multiple social, environmental, and economic factors that lie at the heart of health inequalities. The immediate priority of the NHS will be to mitigate the wider and long-term health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it must also strengthen its resilience to reduce the impact of other threats to health, such as the UK leaving the EU, climate change, and antimicrobial resistance.","McKee, Martin; Dunnell, Karen; Anderson, Michael; Brayne, Carol; Charlesworth, Anita; Johnston-Webber, Charlotte; Knapp, Martin; McGuire, Alistair; Newton, John N; Taylor, David; Watt, Richard G",Lancet,71,31

Across all experiments, adaptive narcissism predicted performance under pressure only when maladaptive narcissism was high. In the presence of maladaptive narcissism, adaptive narcissism also predicted decreased pre-putt time in Experiment 2 and an adaptive psychophysiological response in Experiment 3, reflecting better processing efficiency. Findings suggest that individuals high in both aspects of narcissism perform better under pressure thanks to superior task processing. In performance contexts, the terms ""adaptive"" and ""maladaptive""-adopted from social psychology-are oversimplistic and inaccurate.

For many IB variants, homologous live vaccines are not available for priming. Very little is known about the efficacy of priming with heterologous live IB vaccines (or combination of live IB vaccines) to induce broad IB protection in long living chickens. In this study, the protection levels induced by vaccination programs with only a heterologous live priming by a Massachusetts and a 4/91 vaccine, only a multivalent inactivated vaccine that contained D1466 antigen and a combination of both, against a D1466 challenge were compared.The infection with IBV D1466, a genotype II, lineage 1 virus was able to cause serious damage to the unvaccinated laying hens resulting in respiratory signs, a long-lasting drop in egg production and loss of egg quality. All three vaccination programs induced significant levels of protection against challenge with a pathogenic D1466 strain. Overall, the vaccination program using the broad heterologous live priming and the inactivated vaccine provided high protection against the combination of egg drop and loss of egg quality. The results showed that the used combination of heterologous live vaccines was able to increase the efficacy of the inactivated IBV vaccine despite the very low antigenic relationship of both live vaccines with the challenge strain.","de Wit, J J Sjaak; Ter Veen, Christiaan; Koopman, H C Rik",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,71,16

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective clinical study. METHODS Six eyes of three patients (6-day-old girl, 5-month-old girl, and 14-day-old boy) with IP were examined and treated under general anesthesia. Ophthalmologic examinations were performed including images from wide-angle fluorescein angiography (FA), swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA). RESULTS Ophthalmoscopy showed prominent vascular tortuosity in five eyes, retinal hemorrhages in four eyes, and incomplete vascular development in two eyes. FA showed extensive avascularity including the posterior pole of the retina in all cases except one eye. Prompt and intensive laser photocoagulation stabilized the pre-proliferative severe retinopathy in five eyes; however, foveal structure and vessel anomalies were detected in three of six eyes by OCT and two of five eyes by OCTA. CONCLUSION Severe retinopathy in the neonatal period and infancy was present not only in the periphery but also in the posterior pole including the fovea, which might be related to retinal vascular maldevelopment. It is, therefore, recommended that wide-angle fundus FA examination be performed in the early postnatal period to detect early signs of severe retinopathy in infants with IP.","Nakao, Shiro; Nishina, Sachiko; Tanaka, Shin; Yoshida, Tomoyo; Yokoi, Tadashi; Azuma, Noriyuki",Japanese journal of ophthalmology,71,16

While refugees arguably exhibit an increased incidence of measles and tuberculosis compared with the U.S. population, the legitimacy of the medical examination will be undermined if other diseases that are endemic to refugee populations, yet currently deemed admissible, are used to restrict refugees from entering the U.S. This paper addressees the historic refugee policy of the U.S. and its consequent effect on the health of this vulnerable population. The needs of refugees should be carefully considered in the context of increased disease burden and the associated health care challenges of the country as a whole.","Hong, Mi-Kyung; Varghese, Reshma E; Jindal, Charulata; Efird, Jimmy T",International journal of environmental research and public health,71,1

However, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to date investigating the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in knee OA have reported conflicting results. Further research is needed to clarify the effects of vitamin D on patient-reported outcomes and determine whether there are patient subgroups who may benefit from the supplementation. The aim of this individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis is to identify patient-level predictors of treatment response to vitamin D supplementation on pain and physical function. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic literature search will be conducted for RCTs of vitamin D supplementation on knee OA. Authors of original RCTs will be contacted to obtain the IPD. The primary outcomes will include long-term (≥12 months) pain and physical function. Secondary outcomes will include medium-term (≥6 months and <12 months) and short-term (<6 months) pain and physical function, as well as patient global assessment, quality of life and adverse events. Potential treatment effect modifiers to be examined in the subgroup analyses include age, gender, body mass index, baseline knee pain severity and physical function, baseline vitamin D level, radiographic stage, presence of bone marrow lesions on MRI, presence of clinical signs of local inflammation and concomitant depressive symptoms. Both one-step and two-step modelling methods will be used to determine the possible modifiable effect of each subgroup of interest.

However, unrestrained MMP-9 may disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which has limited its use for the treatment of brain ischemia. In the present study, we constructed lentivirus mediated hypoxia-controlled MMP-9 expression and explored its role after stroke. Hypoxia response element (HRE) was used to confine MMP-9 expression only to the hypoxic region of mouse brain after 120-min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Lentiviruses were injected into the peri-infarct area on day 7 after transient ischemia. We found hyperexpression of exogenous HRE-MMP-9 under the control of hypoxia, and its expression was mainly located in neurons and astrocytes without aggravation of BBB damage compared to the CMV group. Furthermore, mice in the HRE-MMP-9 group showed the best behavioral recovery compared with the normal saline, GFP, and SB-3CT groups. Therefore, hypoxia-controlled MMP-9 hyperexpression during the sub-acute phase of ischemia may provide a novel promising approach of gene therapy for stroke.","Cai, Hongxia; Mu, Zhihao; Jiang, Zhen; Wang, Yongting; Yang, Guo-Yuan; Zhang, Zhijun",Neuroscience bulletin,71,22

APH is a fully enclosed, closed-loop plant life support system with an environmentally controlled growth chamber designed for conducting both fundamental and applied plant research during experiments extending as long as 135 days. APH was delivered to the ISS in parts aboard two commercial resupply missions: OA-7 in April 2017 and SpaceX-11 in June 2017, and was assembled and installed in the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo in November 2018. We report here on a 7-week-long hardware validation test that utilized a root module planted with both Arabidopsis (cv. Col 0) and wheat (cv. Apogee) plants. The validation test examined the APH's ability to control light intensity, spectral quality, humidity, CO2 concentration, photoperiod, temperature, and root zone moisture using commanding from ground facilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The test also demonstrated the execution of programmed experiment profiles that scheduled: (1) changes in environmental combinations (e.g., a daily photoperiod at constant relative humidity), (2) predetermined photographic events using the three APH cameras [overhead, sideview, and sideview near-infrared (NIR)], and (3) execution of experimental sequences during the life cycle of a crop (e.g., measure photosynthetic CO2 drawdown experiments). Arabidopsis and wheat were grown in microgravity to demonstrate crew procedures, planting protocols and watering schemes within APH. The ability of APH to contain plant debris was assessed during the harvest of mature Arabidopsis plants. Wheat provided a large evaporative load that tested root zone moisture control and the recovery of transpired water by condensation. The wheat canopy was also used to validate the ability of APH to measure gas exchange of plants from non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., canopy photosynthesis and respiration). These features were evaluated by executing experiment profiles that utilized the CO2 drawdown technique to measure daily rates of canopy photosynthesis and dark-period CO2 increase for respiration. This hardware validation test confirmed that APH can measure fundamental plant responses to spaceflight conditions.","Monje, Oscar; Richards, Jeffrey T; Carver, John A; Dimapilis, Dinah I; Levine, Howard G; Dufour, Nicole F; Onate, Bryan G",Frontiers in plant science,71,27

For direct-acting antiviral combinations only weak association with IFNL4 SNPs was observed. Little is known about potential selections of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) by the IFNL4 genotype. This study analyzed the prevalence of RAVs to currently approved direct-acting antivirals in a large European population in correlation to SNPs in IFNL4. Samples of 633 patients chronically infected with HCV genotypes 1a (n = 259), 1b (n = 323), and 3 (n = 51) were genotyped for rs12979860 (formerly known as IL28B) and rs368234815. RAVs in NS3, NS5A, and NS5B were detected by population-based sequencing. In addition, IFNL4 SNPs and NS5A RAVs were analyzed including deep sequencing (n = 109) in an independent replication cohort of HCV genotype 1-infected patients (n = 201). No significant correlation was found between IFNL4 SNPs and rare and common RAVs within NS3 and NS5B. In contrast, the NS5A RAV Y93H was detected frequently in HCV genotype 1b (14%) and significantly associated with the beneficial IFNL4 SNPs (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Moreover, the presence of Y93H in HCV genotype 1b patients was significantly associated with the second site variant T83M (P < 0.001). Independent factors significantly associated with the presence of Y93H were IFNL4 genotype and high baseline viral load. CONCLUSION The NS5A RAV Y93H is significantly associated with the presence of beneficial IFNL4 SNPs and a high baseline viral load in HCV genotype 1-infected patients, which may explain a lack of correlation or even an inverse correlation of treatment response with IFNL4 genotype in some NS5A inhibitor containing IFN-free regimens.","Peiffer, Kai-Henrik; Sommer, Lisa; Susser, Simone; Vermehren, Johannes; Herrmann, Eva; Döring, Matthias; Dietz, Julia; Perner, Dany; Berkowski, Caterina; Zeuzem, Stefan; Sarrazin, Christoph",Hepatology,71,8

This moral paradigm-which has been defined by Francis in various speeches and the encyclical Laudato si'-characterizes a present-day culture in which food, disposable objects, and even human beings themselves are ""discarded as 'unnecessary.'"" As Catholic physicians, it is our duty to ensure that we are working to counteract throwaway culture in our daily clinical practice by embracing and exhibiting a culture of encounter. When throwaway culture is discussed within the context of medical practice, it is easy to think of major life and systemic issues including abortion, assistive reproductive technology, physician assisted suicide, and so on. However, rejection of throwaway culture has much broader implications for Catholic physicians. We are called to resist this perverse culture whenever we experience a situation that requires special attention to the respect of human dignity. In this article, we present two common situations encountered in clinical practice in which it is essential to counteract throwaway culture and embrace a culture of encounter: in working with patients who are isolation settings and those who require translation services. Various studies are cited which demonstrate a lack of respect for human dignity that can be seen when working with these patient populations, and recommendations are provided which illustrate how to embrace a culture of encounter in each scenario. The authors conclude that through adoption of a culture of encounter, Catholic physicians as a community can be role models for coworkers, trainees, and students, promoting a culture in which we validate human dignity and ensure the quality and just care of even our most vulnerable patients.

The objective of this study was to review and analyze the available data of the effect of IGB on markers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver enzymes. METHODS Searches were performed of MEDLINE and Embase databases from inception through January 2016. Study inclusion criteria were the following: ≥5 overweight or obese adult patients undergoing intragastric balloon placement, with liver tests [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)] or markers of NAFLD (e.g., imaging, biopsy) reported before balloon insertion and after balloon removal at 6 months. RESULTS Nine observational studies and one randomized trial were identified. ALT decreased by -10.02 U/l (95 % CI, -13.2, -6.8), GGT decreased by -9.82 U/l (95 % CI, -12.9, -6.8), and BMI decreased by -4.98 kg/m(2) (-5.6, -4.4) with IGB therapy. Hepatic steatosis improved from baseline after 6 months of balloon therapy by magnetic resonance imaging (fat fraction, 16.7 ± 10.9-7.6 ± 9.8, p = 0.003), ultrasound (severe liver steatosis, 52-4 %, p < 0.0001). Histological NAFLD activity score was lower after 6 months of IGB versus control with sham endoscopy and diet (2 ± 0.75 vs. 4 ± 2.25, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION The use of intragastric balloon decreases liver enzymes and is potentially an effective short-term treatment for NAFLD as part of a multidisciplinary approach. Larger, more rigorous trials are needed to confirm the effect of IGBs on NAFLD.","Popov, Violeta B; Thompson, Christopher C; Kumar, Nitin; Ciarleglio, Maria M; Deng, Yanhong; Laine, Loren",Digestive diseases and sciences,71,16

However, in cases of complicated DAVFs, it is difficult to preserve the patency of the dural sinus. The authors describe the technical details of a new reconstructive technique using transvenous balloon-assisted Onyx embolization as another treatment option in a patient with an extensive and complex DAVF of the left TSS. A microcatheter and compliant balloon catheter were navigated into the left internal jugular vein and placed at the distal end of the DAVF in the transverse sinus. The microcatheter was placed between the vessel wall of the TSS and the balloon. After the balloon was fully inflated, Onyx-18 was injected at the periphery of the balloon in a slow, controlled, progressive, stepwise manner; the balloon and microcatheter were simultaneously withdrawn toward the sigmoid sinus, with Onyx encompassing the entirety of the complex DAVF. The Onyx refluxed into multiple arterial feeders in a distal-to-proximal step-by-step manner, ultimately resulting in an Onyx tunnel. The final angiography study revealed complete obliteration of the DAVF and patency of the TSS. The Onyx tunnel, or reconstructive transvenous balloon-assisted Onyx embolization technique, may be an effective treatment option for large, complex DAVFs of the TSS.

METHODS An audit of a telehealth service for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus at four rural sites was conducted. The case notes for each patient for 2019 were reviewed to determine if standards of paediatric diabetic care were met. Interviews were conducted at a clinic at each site with the child, parent(s) and staff attending the clinics. A retrospective review of difficulties in service provision was undertaken with staff. RESULTS Nineteen children and adolescents were seen in the telehealth clinics over the year. Eighteen (95%) were seen four times with point-of-care measurement of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and growth by the consultant paediatrician and diabetic nurse educator. Complication screening was achieved on time for 15 (78%) patients, with the remaining patients having had the tests ordered. Eleven (56%) patients were reviewed by a dietician, six (33%) by social worker and five (27%) by psychologist. All patients and parents reported receiving good support for their diabetes without any preferring to attend the central clinic. There were no significant technical difficulties. CONCLUSION Providing paediatric diabetic care through a telehealth service at rural hospitals meets standards of care and was provided without technical difficulties. It is preferred by patients and their parents to attending a central clinic. A model of service is presented that may be replicated elsewhere in Australia.","Williams, Michael",Journal of paediatrics and child health,71,16

Regardless of conservation efforts, different techniques have been developed for large-scale restoration strategies in the Mediterranean Sea. In this study we tested ex situ pilot restoration of Gongolaria barbata (=Treptacantha barbata) for the first time in Slovenian coastal waters. Healthy apical fronds of the species were collected and the development of recruits on clay tiles was followed under laboratory conditions for 20 days. Despite the experimental difficulties experienced, especially due to the lack of antibiotics to prevent the growth of the biofilm, G. barbata recruits were outplanted in the sea on two concrete plates with 48 tiles each, protected by purpose-built cages to avoid grazing by herbivorous fish. The high survival rate of juveniles after four months in the field (89% of the tiles on the plate that was constantly protected) suggests that outplanting G. barbata is an operable approach for restoration efforts in the northern Adriatic Sea. Our first experiment in Slovenian coastal waters provides new information for the optimization of the best practices during the laboratory cultivation and addresses the early steps of restoration and introduction of young thalli in the natural environment.","Orlando-Bonaca, Martina; Pitacco, Valentina; Slavinec, Petra; Šiško, Milijan; Makovec, Tihomir; Falace, Annalisa",Plants,71,5

It consists of interlinked cages and could improve procedural benchmarks and clinical outcome compared with classic stent retrievers. This study compares the rates of recanalization, favorable clinical outcome, procedural adverse events, and benchmarks between the ERIC device and classic stent retrievers. MATERIALS AND METHODS From 545 patients treated with thrombectomy between 2012 and 2015, 316 patients were included. The mean age was 69 ±13 years, the mean baseline NIHSS score was 17 ± 5, and 174 (55%) were men. The ERIC was used as the primary thrombectomy device in 59 (19%) patients. In a propensity score matched analysis including the NIHSS score, clot location, delay to groin puncture, neurointerventionalist, and anesthetic management, 57 matched pairs were identified. RESULTS Patients treated with the ERIC device compared with classic stent retrievers showed equal rates of recanalization (86% versus 81%, P = .61), equal favorable 3-month clinical outcome (mRS 0-2: 46% versus 40%, P = .71), and procedural adverse events (28% versus 30%, P = 1.00). However, in patients treated with the ERIC device, thrombectomy procedures were less time-consuming (67 versus 98 minutes, P = .009) and a rescue device was needed less often (18% versus 39%, P = .02) compared with classic stent retrievers. CONCLUSIONS Mechanical thrombectomy with the ERIC device is effective and safe. Rates of favorable procedural and clinical outcomes are at least as good as those with classic stent retrievers. Of note, the ERIC device might be time-saving and decrease the need for rescue devices. These promising results call for replication in larger prospective clinical trials.","Steglich-Arnholm, H; Kondziella, D; Wagner, A; Cronqvist, M E; Hansen, K; Truelsen, T C; Krarup, L-H; Højgaard, J L S; Taudorf, S; Iversen, H K; Krieger, D W; Holtmannspötter, M",AJNR.

METHODS A decision tree and Markov model were constructed based on current literature. The model was conditional on age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and sex. Three treatment strategies were considered: ECPR for patients with an Age-Combined Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI) below different thresholds (2 - 4), ECPR for everyone (EALL), and ECPR for no one (NE). Cost-effectiveness was assessed with costs per quality-of-life adjusted life years (QALY). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Treating eligible patients with an ACCI below 2 points costs 8,394 (95% CI: 4,922 - 14,911) euro per extra QALY per IHCA patient; treating eligible patients with an ACCI below 3 costs 8,825 (95% CI: 5,192 - 15,777) euro per extra QALY per IHCA patient; treating eligible patients with an ACCI below 4 costs 9311 (95% CI: 5,478 - 16,690) euro per extra QALY per IHCA patient; treating every eligible patient with ECPR costs 10818 (95% CI: 6,357 - 19,400) euro per extra QALY per IHCA patient. For WTP thresholds of 0 to 9,500 euro, NE has the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy. For WTP thresholds between 9,500 and 12,500, treating eligible patients with an ACCI below 4 has the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy. For WTP thresholds of 12,500 or higher, EALL was found to have the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS Given that conventional WTP thresholds in Europe and North-America lie between 50,000 - 100,000 euro or U.S. dollars, ECPR can be considered a cost-effective treatment after in-hospital cardiac arrest from a healthcare perspective. More research is necessary to validate the effectiveness of ECPR, with a focus on the long-term effects of complications of ECPR.","Gravesteijn, Benjamin Y; Schluep, Marc; Voormolen, Daphne C; van der Burgh, Anna C; Dos Reis Miranda, Dinís; Hoeks, Sanne E; Endeman, Henrik",Resuscitation,71,31

METHODS Ten sound, extracted human premolars were selected and submitted to occlusal tooth wear simulation in 0.5-mm steps (0/0.5/1.0/1.5 mm). At each step, enamel thickness on the buccal cusp tips was evaluated using cross-polarization optical coherence tomography (CP-OCT) and micro-computed tomography (μ-CT). The occlusal surface of each premolar was also scanned at each step using a 3D digital intraoral scanner, followed by morphological characterization using standard topography attributes (Slope, Relief, RFI, OPCr). Repeated measures ANOVA assessed differences in simulated wear levels for the µ-CT and CP-OCT data as well as the topography values. Correlations were also calculated between the µ-CT/CP-OCT and topography data RESULTS: : Significant differences were observed for enamel thickness at each simulation wear stage, for both CP-OCT (p < 0.001) and μ-CT (p < 0.001), with good agreement between methods (intraclass correlation: 0.89). For topography analysis, as wear increased, the average Slope, RFI, and Relief values decreased, and average OPCr values increased, with more significant differences shown for Slope. Slope showed significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations with CP-OCT. OPCr showed significant negative correlations with µ-CT, and CP-OCT (p < 0.05). RFI and Relief were not correlated with either µ-CT or CP-OCT (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest the potential of PS-OCT for measuring enamel thickness changes in the cusp tips of the occlusal surface. Similarly, conventional intraoral scanners can serve effectively for monitoring overall tooth wear when combined with dental topographic analyses of resultant point clouds.","Alwadai, Ghadeer S; Roberts, Grace; Ungar, Peter S; González-Cabezas, Carlos; Lippert, Frank; Diefenderfer, Kim E; Eckert, George J; Hara, Anderson T",Journal of dentistry,71,20

Patients' management and outcomes, especially in severe and critical cases, can vary depending on regional standard operating procedures and local guidance. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Rapid review methodology was applied to include all the studies published on PubMed and Embase between December 15th 2019 and February 28th 2021, reporting in-hospital and respiratory support-related mortality in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 that underwent either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Only English language studies with ≥100 patients and reporting data on respiratory failure were included. Data on comorbidities, ventilatory parameters and hospital-related complications were registered. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Fifty-two studies (287359 patients - 57.5% males, mean age 64 years (range 24-98)) from 17 different countries were included in the final analysis. 33.3% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units. 44.2% had hypertension, 26.1% had diabetes, and 7.1% a chronic respiratory disease. 55% of patients underwent respiratory support (36% IMV, 62% NIV and 2% CPAP). Without considering a study with the highest number of patients treated with NIV (n=96729), prevalence of NIV and CPAP use was 12.5% and 13.5% respectively. Globally, invasive and non-invasive approaches were heterogeneously applied. In-hospital mortality was 33.7%, and IMV-related mortality was 72.6% (range: 4.3%-99%). Specific mortality in patients treated with CPAP or NIV was available for 53% of studies, and was 29% (range: 7.2%-100%). The median length of hospital stay was 13 days (range: 6-63). The most frequent hospital-related complication was acute kidney injury being reported in up to 55.7% of enrolled patients. CONCLUSIONS Global employment of respiratory supports and related outcomes are very heterogeneous. The most frequent respiratory support in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is IMV, while NIV and CPAP are less frequently and equally applied, the latter especially in Europe, while data on NIV/CPAP-related mortality is often under-reported. Integrated and comprehensive reporting is desirable and needed to construct evidence-based recommendations.","Radovanovic, Dejan; Santus, Pierachille; Coppola, Silvia; Saad, Marina; Pini, Stefano; Giuliani, Fabio; Mondoni, Michele; Chiumello, Davide A",Minerva anestesiologica,71,1

The last included enhancements to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a pregnancy registry for inadvertently vaccinated pregnant women, and a Clinician Telephone Information Line to collect reports about adverse events. The civilian responder vaccination program was conducted with rigorous safety procedures, and few historically recognized adverse events were observed. However, myocarditis and/or pericarditis was newly recognized as an adverse event caused by the New York City Board of Health vaccinia vaccine strain.

It is associated with age, comorbidities and a weakened immune system. Typically, lymphopenias have been evidenced in severe cases and an excessive production of inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm), which would explain the role of the hyperinflammatory response in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Secondary inflammatory responses from virus reinfections may induce antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a viremic phenomenon that may be an alternative mechanism of cellular infection and should be considered when designing vaccines or immunotherapies involving the stimulation of neutralizing antibodies or the use of monoclonal antibodies. Currently, no vaccines or treatments demonstrate safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19. However, the results from phase III clinical trials which involve the application of an mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) nucleic acid vaccine and an antiviral drug (remdisivir), are yet to be concluded.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent complex ventral hernia repairs with either non cross-linked or cross-linked porcine dermal meshes. METHOD This was retrospective analysis from a prospectively maintained database from January 2010 to May 2013. Patients undergoing open incisional hernia repair with a biologic mesh in the presence of a clean-contaminated, contaminated or dirty wound were reviewed. RESULTS There were 39 patients who underwent single-staged abdominal wall reconstruction for a contaminated ventral hernia with a biologic mesh. In 15 cases, non cross-linked mesh was used (Strattice, n=8; Protexa, n=1; XenMatrix, n=6); a cross-linked mesh was used in the remaining 24 cases (Permacol n=21; CollaMend n=3). The median follow-up was 11.9 ± 10.6 months. The overall morbidity was 71.8% (n=28), with 15.4% (n=6) for grade I, 23.1% (n=9) for grade II, 23.1% (n=9) for grade III (n=3 grade IIIA, n=6 grade IIIB), 7.7% (n=3) for grade IV and 2.6% (n=1) for grade V. In the cross-linked group, there were six complications directly linked to the biologic mesh, compared with three in the non-cross-linked group. Overall wound morbidity was 41.0% (n=16). There were 13 hernia recurrences (33.3%), and recurrence rate was not significantly different for both groups. CONCLUSION Despite the high rate of wound morbidity associated with the single-staged reconstruction of contaminated fields, it can be safely performed with biologic mesh reinforcement. Recurrence rate was not significantly different between cross-linked and non cross-linked porcine meshes.","Romain, B; Story, F; Meyer, N; Delhorme, J B; Brigand, C; Rohr, S",Journal of wound care,71,6

We hypothesize that standard 5-mm laparoscopic trocars may be a safe and more effective alternative. METHODS Thirty episodes of tPTX and 27 episodes of tension-induced pulseless electrical activity (PEA) were induced in five adult swine using thoracic CO2 insufflation via balloon trocar. Tension was defined as a 50% decrease in cardiac output. Chest decompression was performed with 5-mm laparoscopic trocars for the treatment of both tPTX with hemodynamic compromise and tension-induced PEA. The lungs and heart were inspected and graded at necropsy for trocar-related injury. Results were also compared with success rates with NT in the same model. RESULTS The placement of a 5-mm trocar rapidly and immediately relieved tension physiology in 100% of the cases. Mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure all returned to baseline within 1 minute of trocar placement. Adequate perfusion was restored in 100% of tension-induced PEA cases within 30 seconds of trocar placement. There was no evidence of trocar-related heart or lung damage in any of the experimental animals at necropsy (mean injury scores, 0 for both). Five-millimeter trocars significantly outperformed standard NT for both tPTX and tension-induced PEA arrest. CONCLUSION tPTX and tension-induced PEA can be safely and effectively treated with chest decompression using 5-mm laparoscopic trocars. This technique may serve as a more rapid and reliable alternative to needle decompression.","Hatch, Quinton; Debarros, Mia; Johnson, Eric; Inaba, Kenji; Martin, Matthew",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,71,1

Genetically modified adenoviruses are also used as vaccines, gene therapies and anti-cancer treatments. The APOBEC3s are a family of cytidine deaminases that restrict viruses by introducing mutations in their genomes. Viruses developed different strategies to cope with the APOBEC3 selection pressure but nothing is known on the interplay between the APOBEC3s and the HAdVs. In this study, we focused on three HAdV strains: the B3 and C2 strains as they are very frequent and the A12 strain, less common but oncogenic in animal models. We demonstrated that the three HAdV strains induce a similar APOBEC3B upregulation at the transcriptional level. At the protein level however, the APOBEC3B is abundantly expressed during the HAdV-A12 and -C2 infection and shows a nuclear distribution. On the contrary, APOBEC3B is barely detectable in HAdV-B3-infected cells. APOBEC3B deaminase activity is detected in total protein extracts upon HAdV-A12 and -C2 infection. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrate that the HAdV-A12 genome bears a stronger APOBEC3 evolutionary footprint than the HAdV-C2 and HAdV-B3 genomes. Our results show that HAdV infection triggers the transcriptional upregulation of the antiviral innate effector APOBEC3B. The discrepancies between the APOBEC3B mRNA and protein levels might reflect the ability of some HAdV strains to antagonize the APOBEC3B protein. These findings point toward an involvement of APOBEC3B in HAdVs restriction and evolution.IMPORTANCEThe APOBEC3 family of cytosine deaminases has important roles in antiviral innate immunity and cancer. Notably, APOBEC3A and/or APOBEC3B are actively upregulated by several DNA tumor viruses and contribute to transformation by introducing mutations in the cellular genome. Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are a large family of DNA viruses causing generally asymptomatic infections in immunocompetent adults. HAdVs encode several oncogenes and some HAdV strains like HAdV-A12 induce tumors in hamsters and mice. Here, we show that HAdV infection specifically promotes the expression of the APOBEC3B gene. We report that infection with the A12 strain induces a strong expression of an enzymatically active APOBEC3B protein in bronchial epithelial cells. We provide bioinformatic evidences that HAdVs' genomes and notably the A12 genome are under APOBEC3 selection pressure. Thus, APOBEC3B might contribute to adenoviral restriction, diversification and oncogenic potential of particular strains.","Lejeune, Noémie; Poulain, Florian; Willemart, Kévin; Blockx, Zoé; Mathieu, Sarah; Gillet, Nicolas A",Journal of virology,71,31

To investigate how interhomolog sequence polymorphism affects crossovers, we sequenced multiple recombinant populations of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Crossovers were elevated in the diverse pericentromeric regions, showing a local preference for polymorphic regions. We provide evidence that crossover association with elevated diversity is mediated via the Class I crossover formation pathway, although very high levels of diversity suppress crossovers. Interhomolog polymorphism causes mismatches in recombining molecules, which can be detected by MutS homolog (MSH) mismatch repair protein heterodimers. Therefore, we mapped crossovers in a msh2 mutant, defective in mismatch recognition, using multiple hybrid backgrounds. Although total crossover numbers were unchanged in msh2 mutants, recombination was remodelled from the diverse pericentromeres towards the less-polymorphic sub-telomeric regions. Juxtaposition of megabase heterozygous and homozygous regions causes crossover remodelling towards the heterozygous regions in wild type Arabidopsis, but not in msh2 mutants. Immunostaining showed that MSH2 protein accumulates on meiotic chromosomes during prophase I, consistent with MSH2 regulating meiotic recombination. Our results reveal a pro-crossover role for MSH2 in regions of higher sequence diversity in A. thaliana.","Blackwell, Alexander R; Dluzewska, Julia; Szymanska-Lejman, Maja; Desjardins, Stuart; Tock, Andrew J; Kbiri, Nadia; Lambing, Christophe; Lawrence, Emma J; Bieluszewski, Tomasz; Rowan, Beth; Higgins, James D; Ziolkowski, Piotr A; Henderson, Ian R",The EMBO journal,71,27

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on the degeneration of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and its mechanism. Methods: We established a mouse model of IVDD and cultured mouse NP cells and treated them with IL-1β and DEX. The effect of DEX on NP cells was determined by detecting the extracellular matrix of NP cells, changes in ROS levels and inflammatory mediators. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, is used to inhibit the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The effect of DEX on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was determined by studying the effects of DEX on PI3K/ Akt signaling pathway-related molecules and the effect of LY294002 on NP cells degeneration. DEX significantly increased the disc height index and attenuated IVDD in mice. Results: DEX significantly inhibited the expression of MMP3/9 in NP cells, effectively inhibiting the degradation of extracellular matrix. In addition, oxidative stress levels and inflammatory levels in NP cells are also attenuated by DEX. The expression of PI3K, Akt and p-Akt was significantly increased in DEX-stimulated NP cells, indicating that DEX increased the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. DEX promotes PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, inhibits oxidative stress and inflammatory of NP cells, thereby slowing the degeneration of NP cells. Conclusion: DEX promotes PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, inhibits oxidative stress and inflammatory of NP cells, thereby slowing the degeneration of NP cells.","Qi, Shanhong; Li, Chao; Kong, Xiangdong; Zheng, Qiang",Die Pharmazie,71,1

Although there have been many studies about the association between Bwt variability and various health status, its association with the incidence of dementia among elderly people has not been examined. Methods: We performed a retrospective elderly cohort study from 19,987 participants with mean age 73 years old in the Korean National Health Insurance Service. We examined the risk of incident dementia, including Alzheimer's dementia and vascular dementia, according to the quartile of Bwt variability, represented as coefficient of variation (Bwt-CV), SD (Bwt-SD), and variability independent of the mean (Bwt-VIM). Results: In fully adjusted model, the group with the highest Bwt variability (Bwt-VIM Q4) showed an increased risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.206-1.603) and Alzheimer's dementia (HR 1.46, CI 1.240-1.724) compared to the lowest quartile (Bwt-VIM Q1). We also found that subjects with the highest Bwt variability (Q4) and underweight BMI had a significantly increased risk of developing dementia (HR 1.994, 95% CI 1.302-3.054), while subjects with low Bwt variability (Q1 and Q2) and obese BMI had decreased risk of dementia (HR 0.664, 95% CI 0.505-0.872 and HR 0.648, 95% CI 0.493-0.852, respectively) compared to reference group (lowest Bwt variability (Q1) with normal baseline BMI). The effect of Bwt variability on the incidence of dementia was more prominent in subjects <75 years old and abnormal BMI groups (P for interaction < 0.05). Conclusion: The present study revealed that high Bwt variability was associated with an increased risk of dementia in the elderly.","Roh, Eun; Hwang, Soon Young; Kim, Jung A; Lee, You-Bin; Hong, So-Hyeon; Kim, Nam Hoon; Seo, Ji A; Kim, Sin Gon; Kim, Nan Hee; Choi, Kyung Mook; Baik, Sei Hyun; Yoo, Hye Jin",Frontiers in endocrinology,71,20

The origin of these new viruses is unknown; however, animals have been proposed as a potential source as human noroviruses have been detected in animal species. Here we investigated the potential of animals to serve as reservoir of human noroviruses, by testing noroviruses attachment to formalin-fixed intestinal tissues of a range of potential reservoir animals. We set up a novel method to study norovirus binding using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled virus-like particles. In humans, noroviruses interact with histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), carbohydrates that are expressed, among others, on the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract. In animals, this interaction is not well understood. To test if virus binding depends on HBGAs, we characterized the HBGA phenotype in animal tissues by immunohistochemistry. With the exception of the black-headed gull and the straw-coloured fruitbat, we observed attachment of several human norovirus genotypes to the intestinal epithelium of all tested animal species. We did, however, not find an association between the expression of a specific HBGA phenotype and VLP attachment. We show that selected human noroviruses can attach to small intestinal tissues across species, supporting the hypothesis that human noroviruses could reside in an animal reservoir. However, whether this attachment can subsequently lead to infection, needs to be further assessed.IMPORTANCE Noroviruses are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in humans. New norovirus variants and recombinants (re-)emerge regularly in the human population. From animal experiments and surveillance studies it has become clear that at least seven animal models are susceptible to infection with human strains and that domesticated and wild animals shed human noroviruses in their faeces. As virus attachment is a first important step for infection we used a novel method utilising FITC-labelled VLPs to test for norovirus attachment to intestinal tissues of potential animal hosts. We further characterized these tissues with regards to their HBGA expression, a well-studied norovirus susceptibility factor in humans. We found attachment of several human strains to a variety of animal species independent of their HBGA phenotype. This supports the hypothesis that human strains could reside in an animal reservoir.","Villabruna, Nele; Schapendonk, Claudia; Aron, Georgina I; Koopmans, Marion P G; de Graaf, Miranda",Journal of virology,71,16

Daily ambient PM10 , PM2.5 , NO, NO2 and O3 concentrations in Delhi and Kolkata from 1 March to 3 May period of 2019 and 2020 were collected from different monitoring stations along with meteorological data to study the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on ambient pollutant concentrations. Average ambient concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 were significantly decreased (Delhi: 59% and 43% respectively and Kolkata: 49% and 50% respectively) during the lockdown period compared to the same period during 2019 in both cities. Average ambient O3 concentration in Delhi was significantly lower in 2020 (38.5 μg m-3 ) compared to 2019 (44.7 μg m-3 ) during the study period. However, average ambient O3 concentration was significantly higher during 2020 (46.9 μg m-3 ) compared to 2019 (31.4 μg m-3 ) in Kolkata. Effect size analysis of different predictive variables concludes that the lockdown period explains maximum variation in ambient concentrations of PM10 andPM2.5 during 2020 in both cities. However, maximum variation in ambient O3 concentrations in both cities was explained primarily by spatial variation rather than the lockdown period. The study suggests, major policy implementation related to the transport and industrial sectors that aims to address the ambient air pollution problem in India may reduce the ambient particulate matter concentrations, though it may not have a significant effect on other ambient air pollutants such as O3 in major Indian cities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective, multicenter group trial was approved by each institutional review board. Participants were enrolled between November 1, 2001, and April 6, 2006. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and patient confidentiality protocols were followed in compliance with HIPAA. Computed tomography (CT)-guided RF ablation and contrast material-enhanced 1-month follow-up CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging were performed in 49 subjects (24 men, 25 women; age range, 34-83 years) with a confirmed malignant solitary bone lesion of maximum dimension of 8 cm or smaller that was causing intractable pain. Pain intensity and patient mood were measured before and after RF ablation. Tumor imaging features were recorded. Unadjusted and adjusted linear mixed-effects models, with a random intercept for each subject, were used to model patient mood, pain relief, and pain intensity scores at three times after ablation as a function of each tumor characteristic. RESULTS Decreased postablation tumor pain correlated with preablation tumor volume (P = .02) and pathologic fracture (P = .01), while pain relief correlated with pathologic fracture (P = .03) and percentage of bone-tumor interface (BTI) ablated (P = .02). Conversely, presence of an irregular rim after ablation (P = .02) and rim thickness (P = .01) correlated with increased pain. There was no evidence in this study that RF ablation of larger tumor percentage or larger volume leads to better pain relief or decreased pain (P > .05). CONCLUSION Existing pathologic fracture and smaller tumor size appear to be predictive parameters of success when selecting patients for palliative RF ablation of painful solitary osseous metastases. Successful palliation also appears to be related to the percentage of BTI ablated.","Guenette, Jeffrey P; Lopez, Michael J; Kim, Eunhee; Dupuy, Damian E",Radiology,71,16

Despite this, few studies have examined whether the results of these tests are associated with clinically significant changes in medical management. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, we identified pediatric inpatients between August 2009 and December 2010 for whom an RVP was ordered within 24 hours of admission to a large, tertiary-care children's hospital. We used linear regression to determine whether RVP was associated with length of stay (LOS), duration of antibiotics and the number of diagnostic microbiology tests ordered, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS We found that the association between results of the RVP and LOS was dependent on a patient's admission service, specifically admission to the hematology/oncology service. We also found that patients with a positive RVP had a shorter duration of intravenous antibiotic administration (P = 0.03; 42% reduction in the geometric mean), but that this was influenced by the primary admission service. We also found that positive results of the RVP were associated with decreased LOS and shorter duration of antibiotics in patients with some common respiratory diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS This study lacked sufficient evidence to claim an association between a positive RVP and LOS in pediatric patients, adjusting for their underlying diagnosis. However, we found that a positive RVP was associated with a shorter duration of intravenous antibiotic administration in certain groups of patients and those with some common respiratory diagnoses. These findings help clarify the utility of rapid viral testing in the management of hospitalized pediatric patients.","Schulert, Grant S; Lu, Zengqi; Wingo, Tammy; Tang, Yi-Wei; Saville, Benjamin R; Hain, Paul D",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,71,31

AVM compartments supplied by leptomeningeal networks and feeding arteries too small and/or tortuous for safe catheterization are rarely penetrated by liquid occlusive agents. A case with both impediments prompted a novel solution. A balloon was inflated across the supply to a lenticulostriate feeder, thereby favoring penetration of the liquid occlusive agent, injected from a different feeding territory, back into the AVM compartment supplied by the temporarily occluded feeder. This technique may reduce the number of embolization stages in large high-flow AVMs and increase the likelihood of achieving complete occlusion. This technique is highly complex and requires meticulous monitoring of multiple events.","Bank, William O; Stemer, Andrew B; Armonda, Rocco A; Bell, Randy S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,71,5

High time-resolved characterization of water-soluble inorganic ions, elements, organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC) in PM2.5 was conducted in a coastal city of southeast China during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that the average concentration of PM2.5 during the city lockdown (CLD) decreased from 46.2 μg m-3 to 24.4 μg m-3, lower than the same period in 2019 (PM2.5: 37.1 μg m-3). Concentrations of other air pollutants, such as SO2, NO2, PM10, OC, EC, and BC, were also decreased by 27.3%-67.8% during the CLD, whereas O3 increased by 28.1%. Although SO2 decreased from 4.94 μg m-3to 1.59 μg m-3 during the CLD, the concentration of SO42- (6.63 μg m-3) was comparable to that (5.47 μg m-3) during the non-lockdown period, which were attributed to the increase (16.0%) of sulfate oxidation rate (SOR). Ox (O3+NO2) was positively correlated with SO42-, suggesting the impacts of photochemical oxidation. A good correlation (R2 = 0.557) of SO42- and Fe and Mn was found, indicating the transition-metal ion catalyzed oxidation. Based on positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, the contribution of secondary formation to PM2.5 increased during the epidemic period, consisting with the increase of secondary organic carbon (SOC), while other primary sources including traffic, dust, and industry significantly decreased by 9%, 8.5%, and 8%, respectively. This study highlighted the comprehensive and nonlinear response of chemical compositions and formation mechanisms of PM2.5 to anthropogenic emissions control under relatively clean conditions.","Hong, Youwei; Xu, Xinbei; Liao, Dan; Zheng, Ronghua; Ji, Xiaoting; Chen, Yanting; Xu, Lingling; Li, Mengren; Wang, Hong; Xiao, Hang; Choi, Sung-Deuk; Chen, Jinsheng",Environmental pollution,71,1

This drug, called AB569, consists of acidified nitrite (A-NO2-) and EDTA, of which there is no mechanism of resistance. Using both chemistry-, genetic-, and bioinformatics-based techniques, we first discovered that AB569 was able to generate bactericidal levels of nitric oxide (NO), while the EDTA component stabilized S-nitrosyl thiols, thereby furthering NO and downstream reactive nitrogen species production.

People who vape flavours tend to underestimate the harm of vaping. We examined the inter-relationship between flavour preference, vaping for cessation purposes, e-cigarette dependence, e-cigarette harm perception and purchase/use intention, given a hypothetical flavour ban. We hypothesised that non-tobacco flavour preference and vaping for cessation would be negatively associated with harm perception of e-cigarettes and intention to continue vaping if a flavour ban occurred and that these effects would be mediated by e-cigarette dependence. METHODS From July 2019 to March 2020, we conducted intercept interviews with 276 customers at 44 vape shops in California. The predictor variables were flavour preference and vaping for cessation. The outcome variables were harm perception of e-cigarettes and intention to purchase/use, given a hypothetical flavour ban. Multilevel structural equation modelling tested whether e-cigarette dependence mediates the effects of flavour preference on hypothetical continued vaping and purchase. RESULTS Those who preferred flavours showed significantly lower intention to purchase e-liquids (β=-0.28, p<0.001) and to continue vaping (β=-0.17, p=0.001), given a hypothetical flavour ban. Those who vaped for smoking cessation indicated greater intention to purchase e-liquid (β=0.10, p=0.016) and to continue vaping (β=0.17, p=0.001), given a hypothetical flavour ban. E-cigarette dependence significantly mediated these effects (ps<0.04). DISCUSSION Flavour preference was negatively related to intention to continue to vape within a hypothetical flavour ban. Our results also highlight the importance of e-cigarette dependence and use of e-cigarettes as smoking cessation methods. Implications for future flavour bans are discussed.","Huh, Jimi; Yu, Sheila; Galimov, Artur; Meza, Leah R; Galstyan, Ellen; Medel, Donna; Unger, Jennifer B; Baezconde-Garbanati, Lourdes; Sussman, Steve",Tobacco control,71,19

The key challenge in paracetamol therapy is associated with the frequency of the dosing. Depending on the gastric filling within 10-20 min paracetamol is released and rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, it must be taken three or four times a day. To address the dose challenge it is desirable that the paracetamol release profile follows the zero-order kinetic model (constant rate of drug release per unit time). This goal can be achieved by using a suitable porous carrier system. Herein, non-toxic wrinkled mesoporous carbons with unique morphology were synthesized via the hard template method as new carriers for paracetamol. These particles can precisely modulate the release of paracetamol over 24 h in a simulated gastric fluid according to the zero-order kinetic model completely eliminating the initial burst release. Overall, these systems could significantly enhance the bioavailability of paracetamol and prolong its therapeutic effect in numerous diseases such as cold, flu, COVID-19, and severe pain.","Goscianska, Joanna; Olejnik, Anna; Ejsmont, Aleksander; Galarda, Aleksandra; Wuttke, Stefan",Journal of colloid and interface science,71,16

Whereas its physiological effects are clearly beneficial in hypercapnic patients, it could be deleterious in hypoxemic patients without hypercapnia. RECENT FINDINGS NIV should be cautiously used in patients with de-novo respiratory failure, the vast majority of whom meet the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Spontaneous breathing with high tidal volumes may worsen lung injury in these patients, and recent findings suggest that NIV may increase the risk of mortality. Even though high-flow oxygen therapy is increasingly applied in this context, NIV remains recommended for management of immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure. NIV should be the first-line oxygenation strategy in patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure when pH is equal to or below 7.35. Prophylactic NIV prevents respiratory failure after extubation of patients at high risk of reintubation. SUMMARY Most previous studies have compared NIV with standard oxygen, and recent recommendations have been established from these findings. Given the growing use of high-flow oxygen therapy, new studies are needed to compare NIV versus high-flow oxygen therapy so as to better define the appropriate indications for each treatment.","Thille, Arnaud W; Frat, Jean-Pierre",Current opinion in critical care,71,1

This work aims to identify high-risk patients who have a high probability of changing from mild to critical COVID-19 (only account for 5% of cases). Methods: Using traditional convolutional neural networks for classification may not be suitable to identify this 5% of high-risk patients from an entire dataset due to the highly imbalanced label distribution. To address this problem, we propose a Mix Contrast (MixCo) model, which matches original features with mixed features for contrastive learning. Three modules are proposed for training MixCo: 1) a cumulative learning strategy for synthesizing the mixed feature; 2) a commutative feature combination module for learning the commutative law of feature concatenation; 3) a united pairwise loss assigning adaptive weights for sample pairs with different class anchors based on their current optimization status. Results: We collect a multi-center computed tomography dataset including 918 confirmed COVID-19 patients from four hospitals and evaluate the proposed method on both the COVID-19 mild-to-critical prediction and COVID-19 diagnosis tasks. For mild-to-critical prediction, the experimental results show a recall of 0.80 and a specificity of 0.815. For diagnosis, the model shows comparable results with deep neural networks using a large dataset. Our method demonstrates improvements when the amount of training data is small or imbalanced.

Believing that one is or has been infected with COVID-19 may act as a nocebo. However, not much is known about potential nocebo effects associated with the reporting of COVID-19 symptoms. AIM An online survey investigated whether certainty of being infected with COVID-19, age, sex, cognitive, emotional and personality factors were associated with perceived severity of COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS Participants (N=375) filled out an online survey containing 57 questions asking about symptoms resembling COVID-19, certainty of being infected with COVID-19, anxiety, stress and personality dimensions. RESULTS Certainty of being infected with COVID-19 and anxiety predicted 27% of the variance in reporting of COVID-like symptoms. The mediation analysis showed that both higher certainty of being infected and anxiety independently predicted increased reports of COVID-like symptom. Females had higher anxiety and stress levels, and reported more COVID-like symptoms than males did. Older age was not associated with reporting COVID-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Believing to be infected with COVID-19, along with anxiety, can enhance the severity of COVID-like symptoms. Thus, the nocebo effect was due to both cognitive and emotional factors and was higher in females.","Daniali, Hojjat; Flaten, Magne Arve",Scandinavian journal of public health,71,1

Resection of the mediastinal pleura (mediastinectomy) was performed through a median sternotomy to remove all diseased and surgically accessible mediastinal pleural tissue. Dogs were re-examined two weeks postoperatively, and long-term outcome was evaluated by contacting owners by phone. Twelve dogs underwent mediastinectomy; additional surgeries included subtotal pericardiectomy (8), lung lobectomy (4) and partial diaphragmatic resection (2). Histology of resected tissue consistently revealed neutrophilic, pyogranulomatous cellulitis/serositis. Foreign material was evident in the mediastinal tissue of five dogs and microorganisms were recovered from three dogs. Two dogs developed pneumothorax immediately postoperatively; one dog developed haemothorax one month postoperatively and was euthanased. Median follow-up time was eight months (range: 6-43 months); eleven dogs were alive and considered to be symptom-free by their owners. Mediastinectomy resulted in complete resolution of symptoms in most dogs (92 per cent) and was associated with a low incidence of major complications. The results of this study indicated that mediastinectomy results in favourable outcome for dogs with chronic pleural pyogranulomatous pleural disease unresponsive to medical management.","Trinterud, T; Nelissen, P; Caine, A R; White, R A S",The Veterinary record,71,28

Entry screening was implemented in some countries although poor evidence on its effectiveness is reported. We developed a model to estimate the number of imported SARS cases between regions, using the 2003 SARS epidemic data to apply this model for two scenarios: from Beijing to Frankfurt and from Hong Kong to London. We back-calculated the data to estimate individuals' time of infection and built a model where every individual has a probability of being isolated, of traveling, and of being undetected at arrival. The findings, consistent with what was observed in 2003, suggest that entry screening does not affect the predicted number of imported cases. Inversely, importation depends on the transmission dynamic in the country of origin (including control measures in place) and on the intensity of air travel between regions.","Goubar, A; Bitar, D; Cao, W C; Feng, D; Fang, L Q; Desenclos, J C",Epidemiology and infection,71,30

Understanding balance impairments in ankle OA may help inform the management of this condition. RESEARCH QUESTION Does balance overall performance differ between individuals with symptomatic radiographic ankle OA, asymptomatic radiographic ankle OA and healthy controls? Are there any differences in mediolateral or anteroposterior balance, or confidence to perform balance tasks between these groups? METHODS Ninety-six volunteers (31 symptomatic radiographic ankle OA, 41 asymptomatic radiographic ankle OA and 24 healthy controls) completed six static balance tasks: bilateral stance on a firm surface, bilateral stance on foam, and tandem stance, all performed with eyes open and closed. Centre of pressure (COP) data were collected using force plates. Confidence to perform each balance task was collected using an 11-point numerical rating scale. RESULTS Compared to controls, participants with symptomatic radiographic ankle OA had greater COP area when standing on a firm surface, foam and in tandem with eyes closed (all p < 0.05) and greater total COP sway in both firm surface and tandem stance conditions (p < 0.04). Participants with symptomatic ankle OA had greater COP area (p < 0.04) and total COP sway (p = 0.01) than those with asymptomatic ankle OA during tandem stance. Total COP sway and area were similar between asymptomatic ankle OA and control participants. Some differences in mediolateral and anteroposterior balance were identified between groups. Individuals with symptomatic ankle OA had lower confidence to perform the tandem stance eyes closed task compared to controls. SIGNIFICANCE Balance impairments and decreased balance confidence were identified in those with symptomatic radiographic ankle OA compared to asymptomatic individuals with and without radiographic ankle OA. This suggests that balance deficits in ankle OA may be related to symptoms, rather than radiographic evidence of disease.","Smith, Michelle D; Rhodes, Jonah; Al Mahrouqi, Munira; MacDonald, David A; Vicenzino, Bill",Gait & posture,71,16

A complex regulatory network is needed to preserve a population of naïve cells over lifetime that exhibit sufficient diversity of antigen receptors to respond to new antigens, while also sustaining immune memory. In parallel, cells need to maintain their proliferative potential and the plasticity to differentiate into different functional lineages. Initial signs of waning immune competence emerge after 50 years of age, with increasing clinical relevance in the 7th -10th decade of life. Morbidity and mortality from infections increase, as drastically exemplified by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Many vaccines, such as for the influenza virus, are poorly effective to generate protective immunity in older individuals. Age-associated changes occur at the level of the T cell population as well as the functionality of its cellular constituents. The system highly relies on the self-renewal of naïve and memory T cells, which is robust but eventually fails. Genetic and epigenetic modifications contribute to functional differences in responsiveness and differentiation potential. To some extent, these changes arise from defective maintenance; to some, they represent successful, but not universally beneficial adaptations to the aging host. Interventions that can compensate for the age-related defects and improve immune responses in older adults are increasingly within reach.","Zhang, Huimin; Weyand, Cornelia M; Goronzy, Jörg J",The FEBS journal,71,1

One of the reasons behind that behaviour is the existence of three different types of K+ transporters in their plasma membrane: Trk1, Acu1 and Hak1. This work shows that the transporters are very differently regulated at the transcriptional level upon exposure to saline stress, pH alterations or K+ starvation. We propose that different transporters take the lead in the diverse environmental conditions, Trk1 being the ""house-keeping"" one, and Acu1/Hak1 dominating upon K+ limiting conditions. Heterologous expression of the genes coding for the three transporters in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking its endogenous potassium transporters showed that all of them mediated cation transport but with very different efficiencies. Moreover, expression of the transporters in S. cerevisiae also affected other physiological characteristics such as sodium and lithium tolerance, membrane potential or intracellular pH, being, in general, CaTrk1 the most effective in keeping these parameters close to the usual wild-type physiological levels.","Ruiz-Castilla, Francisco J; Bieber, Jan; Caro, Gabriel; Michán, Carmen; Sychrova, Hana; Ramos, José",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

BACKGROUND During the COVID-19 epidemic, under the influence of multiple factors, nurses were vulnerable to negative emotions. While previous studies have explored, the role of emotional intelligence in negative emotions, the relationship between the two has not been sufficiently discussed in the context of COVID-19. DESIGN The study carried out a cross-sectional survey. The STROBE was selected as the checklist in this study. METHODS 202 nurses from Wuhan makeshift hospital participated in the questionnaire survey. Data collection tools included a general data questionnaire designed by the researchers, Chinese version of EI scale (WLEIS-C) and Chinese version of depression-anxiety-stress scale (DASS-21). Descriptive statistics, single factor analysis, and correlation analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS The emotional intelligence of the front-line nurses was in the upper middle range. Among the negative emotions, anxiety was the most prominent symptom. CONCLUSIONS Managers should pay attention to the negative emotional problems of front-line nurses, improve their EI level and promote mental health and the progress of epidemic prevention. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Improving the level of emotional intelligence can reduce the frequency and intensity of negative emotions. In clinical work, emotional intelligence can be used as a skill to carry out relevant training, which is conducive to playing a positive role in future emergencies.","Sun, Huili; Wang, Shuling; Wang, Wei; Han, Guanghong; Liu, Zhijian; Wu, Qi; Pang, Xiaoli",Journal of clinical nursing,71,27

While recycling and the circular economy have been touted as potential solutions, upward of half of the plastic waste intended for recycling has been exported to hundreds of countries around the world. China, which has imported a cumulative 45% of plastic waste since 1992, recently implemented a new policy banning the importation of most plastic waste, begging the question of where the plastic waste will go now. We use commodity trade data for mass and value, region, and income level to illustrate that higher-income countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation have been exporting plastic waste (70% in 2016) to lower-income countries in the East Asia and Pacific for decades.

The need for evidence-based interventions in Chinese communities is urgent. Although a wide range of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for dementia have been trialled in Chinese populations, the evidence has not been systematically synthesised. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to map out the interventions for people living with dementia and their carers in Chinese communities worldwide and compare the effectiveness of these interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols checklist. We will search Chinese (China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang DATA) and English bibliographical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, Global Health, WHO Global Index Medicus, Virtual Health Library, Cochrane CENTRAL, Social Care Online, BASE, MODelling Outcome and cost impacts of interventions for DEMentia (MODEM) Toolkit, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), complemented by hand searching of reference lists. We will include studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions for dementia or mild cognitive impairment in Chinese populations, using a randomised controlled trial design, and published between January 2008 and June 2020. We will use a standardised form to extract data and Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. Collected data will be fully interpreted with narrative synthesis and analysed using pairwise and network meta-analyses to pool intervention effects where sufficient information is available. We will perform subgroup analysis and meta-regression to explore potential reasons for heterogeneity. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No formal ethics approval is required for this protocol. The findings will facilitate the development of studies on interventions for dementia and timely inform dementia policymaking and practice.

C-reactive protein (CRP) levels increase during exacerbations but the relationship with aetiology is not established. We aimed to explore the relationship between serum CRP and the rate of detection of viruses and bacteria. This was a prospectively recruited, observational study of patients hospitalised with exacerbations of COPD. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for respiratory viruses by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Sputum and blood were collected for bacterial culture and urine tested for pneumococcal antigen. CRP levels were measured on sera. CRP and other factors associated with viral, bacterial or mixed detection were assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis. 264 patients with exacerbations of COPD were studied: 26% tested positive for respiratory viruses only, 13% had bacteria only, 12% had mixed viral/bacterial detection, and 49% had no pathogens detected. CRP level and temperature were strongly associated with viral detection rate (p<0.001 and p=0.004, respectively) and mixed viral/bacterial detection rate (p=0.02 and p=0.03, respectively) on multivariate analysis. Bacterial detection rate was not associated with CRP level or body temperature.

Even though its clinical benefits have been well documented, laparoscopic colorectal surgery has been slow to gain adoption in the surgical community, given its technical demands. To help overcome these challenges while preserving the clinical benefits derived from a minimally invasive approach, hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) was proposed. HALS can decrease the learning curve by restoring tactile sensation and improving proprioception, and it may be more accessible for surgeons already in practice. A meta-analysis of the 3 published RCTs comparing hand-assisted laparoscopic to conventional laparoscopic colorectal resection showed a significantly lower rate of conversion in the hand-assist patients, while morbidity rates were equivalent. The meta-analysis further indicated that short-term postoperative benefits of conventional laparoscopic colectomies were preserved and costs were likely to be offset by reduced operative time and specific need of laparoscopic equipment. HALS represents a valuable option for performing colorectal resections.","Yang, Ilun; Boushey, Robin P; Marcello, Peter W",Techniques in coloproctology,71,24

However, subsequent lead optimizations often rely on other types of computational methods, such as de novo design methods. We have developed an automatic method, namely automatic tailoring and transplanting (AutoT&T), which can effectively utilize the outcomes of virtual screening in lead optimization. This method detects suitable fragments on virtual screening hits and then transplants them onto a lead compound to generate new ligand molecules. Binding affinities, synthetic feasibilities, and drug-likeness properties are considered in the selection of final designs. In this study, our AutoT&T program was tested on three different target proteins, including p38 MAP kinase, PPAR-α, and Mcl-1. In the first two cases, AutoT&T was able to produce molecules identical or similar to known inhibitors with better potency than the given lead compound. In the third case, we demonstrated how to apply AutoT&T to design novel ligand molecules from scratch. Compared to the solutions generated by other two de novo design methods, i.e., LUDI and EA-Inventor, the solutions generated by AutoT&T were structurally more diverse and more promising in terms of binding scores in all three cases. AutoT&T also completed the assigned jobs more efficiently than LUDI and EA-Inventor by several folds. Our AutoT&T method has certain technical advantages over de novo design methods. Importantly, it expands the application of virtual screening from lead discovery to lead optimization and thus may serve as a valuable tool for many researchers.","Li, Yan; Zhao, Yuan; Liu, Zhihai; Wang, Renxiao",Journal of chemical information and modeling,71,14

As the pandemic is spreading and the whole picture is yet unknown, ophthalmologists should be aware of unusual ocular presentations of COVID-19 since they could precede the development of severe respiratory distress. METHODS We report here the first case of a patient with bilateral unusual dot-blot retinal hemorrhages and retinal venous dilation who presented shortly thereafter a PCR-proven COVID-19. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old woman presented with a 7 days history of blurred vision in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed bilateral venous stasis and dot and blot intra-retinal hemorrhages preceding the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a patient with mild respiratory symptoms that progressed within a few days to a severe respiratory distress. After 1 month of the COVID-19 treatment, fundus examination improved and fluorescein angiography demonstrated no diabetic retinopathy signs, no retinal vasculitis and no significant delay in arterial or venous filling. CONCLUSION Intraretinal hemorrhages similar to those found in the retinopathy associated to blood dyscrasias could be an association with SARS-CoV-2 in the context of a coagulopathy induced by the infection.","Monferrer-Adsuara, Clara; Castro-Navarro, Verónica; González-Girón, Nuria; Remolí-Sargues, Lidia; Ortiz-Salvador, Miguel; Montero-Hernández, Javier; Cervera-Taulet, Enrique",European journal of ophthalmology,71,28

A 4-h glucose tolerance test (GTT) was used to assess the incidence and extent of hypoglycemia. METHODS Thirty-six patients who were at least 6 months postoperative from RYGB were administered a 4-h GTT with measurement of insulin levels. Mean age was 49.4±11.4 years, mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 48.8±6.6 kg/m2, percent excess BMI lost (%EBL) was 62.6 ± 21.6%, mean weight change from nadir weight was 8.2±8.6 kg, and mean follow-up time was 40.5±26.7 months. Twelve patients had diabetes preoperatively. RESULTS Thirty-two of 36 patients (89%) had abnormal GTT. Six patients (17%) were identified as diabetic based on GTT. All six of these patients were diabetic preoperatively. Twenty-six patients (72%) had evidence of reactive hypoglycemia at 2 h post glucose load. Within this cohort of 26 patients, 14 had maximum to minimum glucose ratio (MMGR)>3:1, 5 with a ratio>4:1. Eleven patients had weight regain greater than 10% of initial weight loss (range 4.9-25.6 kg). Ten of these 11 patients (91%) with weight recidivism showed reactive hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS Abnormal GTT is a common finding post RYGB. Persistence of diabetes was noted in 50% of patients with diabetes preoperatively. Amongst the nondiabetic patients, reactive hypoglycemia was found to be more common and pronounced than expected. Absence of abnormally high insulin levels does not support nesidioblastosis as an etiology of this hypoglycemia. More than 50% of patients with reactive hypoglycemia had significantly exaggerated MMGR. We believe this may be due to the nonphysiologic transit of food to the small intestine due to lack of a pyloric valve after RYGB. This reactive hypoglycemia may contribute to maladaptive eating behaviors leading to weight regain long term.

We compared the use of LigaSure with conventional dissection techniques in pancreatic surgery in a prospective randomised single-centre trial (registration number: NCT00850291). METHODS Patients with tumours of the pancreatic head that were assumed to be technically resectable were randomised to LigaSure or conventional surgery. The primary endpoint of this study was overall operation time. Secondary endpoints were preparation time until tumour resection, intraoperative blood loss, number of given units of packed red blood cells, costs of surgery, postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay and mortality. RESULTS There was no difference in overall operation time between the two groups (P = 0.227). Median costs for pancreatic surgery were significantly less in the conventional group with €3,047 (range 2,004-5,543) vs. €3,527 (range 2,516-5,056, P = 0.009). Preparation time, intraoperative blood loss, number of units of packed red blood cells, postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay and mortality did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION Our data indicate that the LigaSure device is equivalent to conventional dissection modalities in pancreatic surgery.","Uzunoglu, Faik Guentac; Bockhorn, Maximilian; Fink, Judith Alexandra; Reeh, Matthias; Vettorazzi, Eik; Gawad, Karim Abdel; Bogoevski, Dean; Vashist, Yogesh Kumar; Tsui, Tung Yu; Koenig, Alexandra; Mann, Oliver; Izbicki, Jakob Robert",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,71,29

Up to now, however, the efficacy of school closure to reduce the spread of the disease in the community still remain unclear and no much is known about the potential negative effects of such measures on physical health and psychological wellbeing of children and adolescents, mainly if protracted for long periods. OBJECTIVE To summarize the most relevant data of a systematic review on the impact of the 2020 school closure and social distances measures implemented in response to covid-19 pandemic on youths physical health and psychological wellbeing. In the present paper we describe the review's methodology and the characteristics and methodological quality of the retrieved studies. METHODS We searched on 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality of included studies has been assessed with validated checklists. RESULTS Sixty-four studies have been included; 42 assessed the effect of social distances measure of physical health and 27 on psychological wellbeing. All the studies have been conducted during the first wave of pandemic and assessed the short-term effect of social distances measures implemented for relatively short periods. The 32.4% of the studies has been conducted in the UK, 20.3% in Italy, 12.5% in China, 10.9% in developing countries and 9.4% in the US. 37.5% of the studies were cohort studies, 40.6% cross sectional surveys, 19.7% uncontrolled studies and 1 was a modeling study. 59.6% of the studies has been rated as high quality. The most important weakness of the cross-sectional surveys and uncontrolled studies was the scarce representativeness of the sample while 96% of the cohort studies were judged as high quality. CONCLUSIONS A large number of acceptable quality studies have been published during the first months of pandemic to assess the impact of school closure and social distances measures on physical health and psychological wellbeing of youths. This highlights the relevance of the topic and the need to assess carefully the balance between harms and benefits of such measures in terms of actual reduction of transmission and youths' psychological and physical harms. Further studies are needed on the long-term effect of social distances measures extended over long periods.","Minozzi, Silvia; Saulle, Rosella; Amato, Laura; Davoli, Marina",Recenti progressi in medicina,71,26

We examined whether symptom severity and quality of life (QoL) are associated with weight status in the general population with AF. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients with electrocardiogram-confirmed AF completed validated questionnaires: the EuroQol 5 Dimensions QoL questionnaire and the Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale (AFSS). The AFSS assessed the AF burden scoring on AF-related symptoms and the total AF burden measured as a combination of duration, frequency, and severity of an irregular heartbeat. Generalized liner models examined the association of body mass index (BMI) with AF severity and QoL adjusting for confounders. Between 2018 and 2019, 882 of 1901 (46%) mailed questionnaires were returned completed. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 74 (10) years old and a BMI of 27.4 (5.6) kg/m2. Sixteen percent reported having never experienced an irregular heartbeat. A 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was associated with a 0.65 (95%CI: 0.25 to 1.06) higher symptom score, where 3 points represent a clinically relevant change in state. A 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was associated with a -1.61 (95%CI: -2.72 to -0.50) lower QoL score. The coefficient of the total AF burden for a 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was 0.17 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.68). CONCLUSION BMI was positively associated with symptoms and negatively associated with one of the two measures of QoL, but not with the total AF burden.

There is a growing consensus that IBD is associated with anxiety- and depression-related symptoms. Psychological symptoms appear to be more prevalent during active disease states with no difference in prevalence between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Behavioural disturbances including anxiety- and depression-like symptoms have also been observed in animal models of IBD. RESULTS The likely mechanisms underlying the association are discussed with particular reference to communication between the gut and brain. The close bidirectional relationship known as the gut-brain axis includes neural, hormonal and immune communication links. Evidence is provided for a number of interacting factors including activation of the inflammatory response system in the brain, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and brain areas implicated in altered behaviours, changes in blood brain barrier integrity, and an emerging role for gut microbiota and response to probiotics in IBD.DiscussionThe impact of psychological stress in models of IBD remains somewhat conflicted, however, it is weighted in favour of stress or early stressful life events as risk factors in the development of IBD, stress-induced exacerbation of inflammation and relapse. CONCLUSION It is recommended that patients with IBD be screened for psychological disturbance and treated accordingly as intervention can improve quality of life and may reduce relapse rates.","Abautret-Daly, Áine; Dempsey, Elaine; Parra-Blanco, Adolfo; Medina, Carlos; Harkin, Andrew",Acta neuropsychiatrica,71,12

METHODS A systematic literature search of laparoscopic liver resections in the Netherlands was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE. Analysis of initial experience with laparoscopic liver surgery was performed by case-control comparison of patients undergoing laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy matched with patients undergoing the open procedure in the Netherlands between the years 2000 and 2008. Furthermore, a nationwide survey was conducted in 2011 on the current status of laparoscopic liver surgery. RESULTS The systematic review revealed only 6 Dutch reports on actual laparoscopic liver surgery. Matched case-control comparison showed significant differences in the length of hospital stay, blood loss and operation time. Complications did not differ significantly between the two groups (26 vs. 21%). The 2011 survey showed that 21 centers in the Netherlands performed formal liver resections and that 49 (5% of total) laparoscopic liver resections were performed in 2010. CONCLUSION The systematic review revealed that very few laparoscopic liver resections were performed in the Netherlands in the previous millennium. The matched case-control comparison of laparoscopic and open left lateral resection showed a reduction in hospital length of stay with comparable morbidity. The laparoscopic technique has been slowly adopted in the Netherlands, but its popularity seems to increase in recent years.","Stoot, Jan H M B; Wong-Lun-Hing, Edgar M; Limantoro, Ione; Visschers, Ruben; Busch, Olivier R; Van Hillegersberg, Richard; De Jong, Koert M; Rijken, Arjen M; Kazemier, Geert; Olde Damink, Steven W M; Lodewick, Toine M; Bemelmans, Marc H A; van Dam, Ronald M; Dejong, Cornelis H C",Digestive surgery,71,1

Acute respiratory failure due to viral-lower respiratory tract disease necessitates PICU admission for mechanical ventilation. In critically ill patients in PICU settings, early fluid overload is common and associated with adverse outcomes such as prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased mortality. It is unclear, however, if this also applies to young children with viral-lower respiratory tract disease induced acute respiratory failure. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relation of early fluid overload with adverse outcomes in mechanically ventilated children with viral-lower respiratory tract disease in a retrospective dataset. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Single, tertiary referral PICU. PATIENTS One hundred thirty-five children (< 2 yr old) with viral-lower respiratory tract disease requiring mechanical ventilation admitted to the PICU of the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam between 2008 and 2014. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The cumulative fluid balance on day 3 of mechanical ventilation was compared against duration of mechanical ventilation (primary outcome) and daily mean oxygen saturation index (secondary outcome), using uni- and multivariable linear regression. In 132 children, the mean cumulative fluid balance on day 3 was + 97.9 (49.2) mL/kg. Higher cumulative fluid balance on day 3 was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation in multivariable linear regression (β = 0.166; p = 0.048). No association was found between the fluid status and oxygen saturation index during the period of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS Early fluid overload is an independent predictor of prolonged mechanical ventilation in young children with viral-lower respiratory tract disease. This study suggests that avoiding early fluid overload is a potential target to reduce duration of mechanical ventilation in these children. Prospective testing in a clinical trial is warranted to support this hypothesis.","Ingelse, Sarah A; Wiegers, Hanke M G; Calis, Job C; van Woensel, Job B; Bem, Reinout A",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,71,17

This randomized, controlled, cross-over study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of Macintosh, Miller, McCoy and McGrath laryngoscopes during with or without chest compressions in the scope of a simulated cardiopulmonary resuscitation scenario. METHODS The time required for successful tracheal intubation, number of attempts, dental trauma severity and the need for optimization manoeuvres were recorded during cardiopulmonary resuscitation with and without chest compressions. The experience with computer games during the last 10 years were asked to the participants and recorded. RESULTS McCoy laryngoscope yielded the shortest time for successful tracheal intubation both in the presence of and without chest compressions. During the use of McCoy laryngoscopes, fewer tracheal intubation attempts, lower incidence of dental trauma and lower visual analogue scale scores on the ease of intubation were recorded. Participants who are experienced computer game players using Macintosh, McCoy and McGrath achieved successful tracheal intubation in a significantly shorter time during resuscitation without chest compressions. Dental trauma incidence and number of tracheal intubation attempts did not show any significant difference between the four laryngoscopes being related to the rate of playing computer games. CONCLUSION McGrath video laryngoscopes do not appear to have advantages over direct laryngoscopes for securing a smooth and successful tracheal intubation during rhythmic chest compressions. We believe that as McCoy laryngoscope provided tracheal intubation in a shorter time and with fewer attempts, this laryngoscope may increase the success rate of resuscitation.","Saraçoğlu, Ayten; Bezen, Olgaç; Şengül, Türker; Uğur, Egin Hüsnü; Şener, Sibel; Yüzer, Fisun",Turkish journal of anaesthesiology and reanimation,71,1

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the associations between multisite NIRS measurements and clinical signs of circulatory failure in relation to short-term outcome in preterm infants with clinical sepsis. METHODS Prospective cohort study of preterm infants (gestational age <32 weeks) with clinical sepsis. We monitored cerebral, renal, and intestinal oxygen saturation using NIRS for 72 h following sepsis workup and calculated fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE). We recorded clinical signs of circulatory failure every 8 h. We analyzed the associations between FTOE values, clinical signs of circulatory failure, and short-term outcome. RESULTS In 28 preterm infants with clinical sepsis, intraindividual and interindividual associations between NIRS values and clinical signs of circulatory failure were weak. At several points of time during the study period, cerebral and renal FTOE were higher in infants who developed intestinal complications compared with infants who did not, while clinical signs of circulatory failure never differed between groups. After correcting for multiple testing, significant differences disappeared. CONCLUSIONS The associations between multisite FTOE values and clinical signs of circulatory failure were weak in preterm infants with clinical sepsis. Nevertheless, in contrast to clinical signs of circulatory failure, cerebral and renal FTOE values were associated with adverse short-term intestinal outcome in the uncorrected analyses. Multisite NIRS monitoring might help to detect critically low tissue oxygen delivery leading to adverse intestinal outcome not detected by routine hemodynamic measurements.","van der Laan, Michelle E; Schat, Trijntje E; Olthuis, Annelies J; Boezen, H Marike; Bos, Arend F; Kooi, Elisabeth M W",Neonatology,71,31

Repeated passaging of the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus (EAV) in the presence of CsA revealed that reduced drug sensitivity is associated with the emergence of adaptive mutations in nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), one of the transmembrane subunits of the arterivirus replicase polyprotein. Introduction of singular nsp5 mutations (nsp5 Q21R, Y113H, or A134V) led to a ∼2-fold decrease in sensitivity to CsA treatment, whereas combinations of mutations further increased EAV's CsA resistance. The detailed experimental characterization of engineered EAV mutants harboring CsA-resistance mutations implicated nsp5 in arterivirus RNA synthesis. Particularly, in an in vitro assay, EAV RNA synthesis was far less sensitive to CsA treatment when nsp5 contained the adaptive mutations mentioned above. Interestingly, for increased sensitivity to the closely-related drug ALV CsA-resistant nsp5 mutants required the incorporation of an additional adaptive mutation, which resided in nsp2 (H114R), another transmembrane subunit of the arterivirus replicase. Our study provides the first evidence for the involvement of nsp2 and nsp5 in the mechanism underlying the inhibition of arterivirus replication by cyclophilin inhibitors.ImportanceCurrently, no approved treatments are available to combat infections with nidoviruses, a group of plus-stranded RNA viruses including important zoonotic and veterinary pathogens. Previously, the cyclophilin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and Alisporivir (ALV) were shown to inhibit the replication of diverse nidoviruses (both arteriviruses and coronaviruses), and may thus represent a class of pan-nidovirus inhibitors. Here, using the arterivirus prototype equine arteritis virus, we have established that resistance to CsA and ALV treatment is associated with adaptive mutations in two trans-membrane subunits of the viral replication complex, nonstructural proteins 2 and 5. This is the first evidence for the involvement of specific replicase subunits of arteriviruses in the mechanism underlying the inhibition of their replication by cyclophilin inhibitors. Understanding this mechanism of action is of major importance to guide future drug design, both for nidoviruses and other RNA viruses inhibited by these compounds.","de Wilde, Adriaan H; Boomaars-van der Zanden, A Linda; de Jong, Anja W M; Barcéna, Montserrat; Snijder, Eric J; Posthuma, Clara C",Journal of virology,71,17

We will include randomised controlled trials, non-randomised clinical trials, before-after studies and observational studies of adult stroke survivors with an average stroke onset < 6 months, undergoing hospital-based therapy to improve UL function. Eligible interventions will aim to promote UL functional recovery. Two reviewers will independently screen, select and extract data. Study risk of bias will be appraised using appropriate tools. Clinical measures of motor recovery will be investigated (primary measure Fugl Meyer UL assessment), as well as measures of health-related quality of life (primary measure EQ-5D) and all cost-effectiveness analyses completed. Secondary outcomes include therapy dose (minutes, weeks, repetitions as available) and safety (i.e. adverse events, serious adverse events). A narrative synthesis will describe quality and content of the evidence. If feasible, we will conduct random effects meta-analyses where appropriate. DISCUSSION We anticipate the findings of this review will increase our understanding of UL therapy and inform the generation of novel, data-driven hypotheses for future UL therapy research post-stroke.

There is also lack of a reliable method to estimate uncertainties in the source contributions derived by positive matrix factorization (PMF). Applying a moving window evolving PMF to hourly PM2.5 composition dataset from a field campaign in Tianjin China that included the Spring and Lantern Festivals and the start of COVID-19 pandemic has substantially improved the apportionment compared to a conventional analysis using the entire data. Festival-related sources (e.g., fireworks and residential burning here) have been clearly identified and estimated during both the Spring and Lantern Festivals. During this period, the sources changed because the time period overlaps with the outbreak of COVID-19 and related reductions in activity during the lockdown that began on Lunar New Year. Multiple PMF runs providing source contribution estimates made it possible to estimate the uncertainties in these values. Our results show that winds-dependent sources like dust and distant point sources have larger uncertainties than the other sources. Compared with conventional PMF analyses, the current method may better reflect the actual emissions as well as being able to estimate uncertainties. Thus, this approach appears to be an improvement if the appropriate data are available.","Song, Lilai; Dai, Qili; Feng, Yinchang; Hopke, Philip K",Environmental pollution,71,31

The investigators designed and implemented a study composed of conventional and customized distractors. The design of customized distractor was based on the specification of conventional mandibular distractors and was fabricated using selective laser melting (SLM) technology. The same type of conventional distractors served as control group. Vickers-hardness test, three-point bending test and welding strength test were carried out for the conventional and customized distractor respectively and data was analyzed with t test using SPSS13.0 software package. The sample was composed of 18 distractors grouped as follows: customized distractor (n = 9) and conventional distractor (n = 9). The customized distractor showed better result than the conventional distractor in mechanical property tests, with statistically significant differences in Vickers-hardness and maximum load (P < 0.05), and no significant differences in yield strength and welding strength (P > 0.05). The results of this study suggest indicated that compared to the conventional distractor, the customized distractor had better mechanical properties and could be used in maxillofacial distraction osteogenesis.","Zhao, Xinran; Li, Guangwei; Shen, Guofang; Wei, Jianhe; Cai, Ming",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,71,31

The etiology of PTB is complex and multifactorial. Exposures to environmental metals or metalloids are pervasive and prenatal exposures to them are considered important in the etiology of PTB. We conducted a scoping review to determine the extent of prenatal exposures to four metals/metalloids (lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic) and their association with PTB. We reviewed original research studies published in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, POPLINE and the WHO regional indexes from 2000 to 2019; 36 articles were retained for full text review. We documented a higher incidence of PTB with lead and cadmium exposures. The findings for mercury and arsenic exposures were inconclusive. Metal-induced oxidative stress in the placenta, epigenetic modification, inflammation, and endocrine disruptions are the most common pathways through which heavy metals and metalloids affect placental functions leading to PTB. Most of the studies were from the high-income countries, reflecting the need for additional data from low-middle-income countries, where PTB rates are higher and prenatal exposure to metals are likely to be just as high, if not higher.","Khanam, Rasheda; Kumar, Ishaan; Oladapo-Shittu, Opeyemi; Twose, Claire; Islam, Asmd Ashraful; Biswal, Shyam S; Raqib, Rubhana; Baqui, Abdullah H",International journal of environmental research and public health,71,12

Recent reports have proposed the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for inducing tissue repair in burn injuries. OBJECTIVE We aim to evaluate the effect of allogeneic MSC transplantation on full-thickness burns with delayed healing. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study includes five patients with AB B/B burns. All patients received conservative treatments, including cleaning, debridement of necrotic tissue, and silver based dressing on the burn wounds. Cryopreserved allogeneic MSCs were thawed and rapidly expanded and used for application in burned patients. MSCs were implanted into preclotted platelet-rich plasma onto the surface of burn wounds. RESULTS All treated burn wounds showed early granulation tissue and rapid re-epithelialization after MSC transplantation. Healing took between 1 and 5 months after MSC transplantation. Repair of burn wounds was associated with slight discoloration of the regenerated skin without hypertrophic scarring or contractures. CONCLUSION Our results provide evidence of healing in deep- and full-thickness burns by allogeneic MSC transplantation. Rapid healing of burn patients, after MSC transplantation, improves their quality of life and reduces the length of hospitalization. Future studies incorporating a larger number of patients may confirm the results obtained in this work.","Wittig, Olga; Diaz-Solano, Dylana; Chacín, Tulio; Rodriguez, Yudith; Ramos, Giselle; Acurero, Gleriset; Leal, Fredy; Cardier, Jose E",International journal of dermatology,71,24

The objective of this scoping review is to critically appraise and synthesize the evidence in the reported number of falls, fear of falling, and risk factors associated with falls in older patients waiting for or recovering from TJA. METHODS Seven electronic databases were searched with no date limits and using language restriction (English). The inclusion criteria were 1) cohorts that included older adults 60+ years of age, 2) reported prevalence of falls, fear of falling, and/or risk factors for falls in patients who were waiting or recovering from TJA and 3) cross-sectional studies, cohort studies, and case control study designs. The quality assessment of selected articles was assessed using the SIGN Guidelines Checklist. RESULTS Of the 866 citations identified, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Prevalence of falls in pre-operative TJA patients and post-operative TJA patients ranged from 23 to 63%, and 13 to 42%, respectively. Of those five studies that examined fear of falling, pre-operative TJA patients reported greater fear of falling than post-operative patients. Modifiable risk factors for falls included fear of falling, joint range of motion, and depression. CONCLUSIONS An increased risk of falls in patients with TJA was reported both for patients waiting for and recovering from surgery. A number of modifiable risk factors were identified including fear of falling that could be targeted in fall prevention programs for TJA.","Chen, Serena Kuangyi; Voaklander, Don; Perry, Danielle; Jones, C Allyson",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,71,1

In this study, we designed a new type of cannulated screws called degradable magnesium alloy bionic cannulated screws (DMBCS) and our aim was to compare the biomechanical properties of DMBCS, the traditionally used titanium alloy bionic cannulated screws (TBCS) and titanium alloy cannulated screws (TTCS). METHODS A proximal femur model was established based on CT data of a lower extremity from a voluntary healthy man. Garden type III femoral neck fracture was constructed and fixed with DMBCS, TBCS, and TTCS, respectively. Biomechanical effect which three type of CS models have on femoral neck fracture was evaluated and compared using von Mises stress distribution and displacement. RESULTS In the normal model, the maximum stress value of cortical bone and cancellous bone was 76.18 and 6.82 MPa, and the maximum displacement was 5.52 mm. Under 3 different fracture healing status, the stress peak value of the cortical bone and cancellous bone in the DMBCS fixation model was lower than that in the TTCS and TBCS fixation, while the maximum displacement of DMBCS fixation model was slightly higher than that of TTCS and TBCS fixation models. As the fracture heals, stress peak value of the screws and cortical bone of intact models are decreasing, while stress peak value of cancellous bone is increasing initially and then decreasing. CONCLUSIONS The DMBCS exhibits the superior biomechanical performance than TTCS and TBCS, whose fixation model is closest to the normal model in stress distribution. DMBCS is expected to reduce the rates of post-operative complications with traditional internal fixation and provide practical guidance for the structural design of CS for clinical applications.","Ding, Kai; Yang, Weijie; Zhu, Jian; Cheng, Xiaodong; Wang, Haicheng; Hao, Du; Yinuo, Song; Zhu, Yanbin; Zhang, Yingze; Chen, Wei; Zhang, Qi",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,71,1

Experimental environmental manipulation, particularly when conducted in experiments where the dynamics of the purging of deleterious alleles are compared, has demonstrated both direct and indirect effects on the strength and direction of selection. However, many of these studies are conducted with fairly simplistic environments, where it is not always clear how or why particular forms of spatial heterogeneity influence behaviour or selection. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we tested three different spatial environments designed to determine if spatial constraint of critical resources influences the efficiency of natural and sexual selection. We conducted two allele purging experiments to 1) assess effects of these spatial treatments on selective dynamics of six recessive mutations, and 2) determine how these dynamics changed when sexual selection was relaxed and spatial area reduced for 2 of the mutants. Allele purging dynamics depended on spatial environment, however the patterns of purging rates between the environments differed across distinct deleterious mutations. We also tested two of the mutant alleles, and demonstrate sexual selection increased the purging rate. This article is protected by copyright.

We, therefore, undertook a complete nationwide analysis of all hospitalized ischemic stroke patients in Germany from 2013 to 2017. Methods- We used the nationwide administrative database of the German Federal Statistical Office and investigated access to stroke unit treatment, IVT, MT, and in-hospital mortality. Patients were subdivided into 6 predefined age groups (20-44, 45-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, and >90 years). Pooled overall and age group estimates were calculated using the random-effects model. To evaluate potential sex disparities, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Results- A total of 1 112 570 patients were hospitalized for first or recurrent ischemic stroke from 2013 to 2017. Overall, stroke unit treatment increased significantly from 66.8% in 2013 to 73.5% in 2017, as did IVT (from 12.4% to 15.9%) and MT (from 2.4% to 5.8%; all P<0.001). Although the difference became smaller over time, patients ≥80 years of age still received significantly less often treatments. Men of all age groups had a significantly higher probability receiving stroke unit treatment (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.09-1.12) and lower in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89-0.93). No disparity was observed in the use of IVT (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98-1.01), while women of all ages were treated more often with MT (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.22-1.30). Conclusions- Access to stroke unit treatment has to be increased in both older patients and women of all ages. While there was no sex difference in IVT use, it is important to further investigate the significantly higher frequency of MT in women with ischemic stroke irrespective of age.","Weber, Ralph; Krogias, Christos; Eyding, Jens; Bartig, Dirk; Meves, Saskia H; Katsanos, Aristeidis H; Caso, Valeria; Hacke, Werner",Stroke,71,17

It was recently reported that fluorination increases the potency of inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mutations of which have been linked specifically to nonsmall-cell lung cancer. For the L858R/T790M/C797S triplet mutant (EGFRTM), a difluorinated inhibitor, 25g, was found to have 4.23 times greater potency against the EGFRTM than an unfluorinated inhibitor, 25a. This discovery necessitates a rational explanation for the underlying inhibitory mechanisms. Here, we apply multiple computational approaches to explore, validate, and differentiate the binding modes of 25a and 25g in the EGFRTM and investigate the cooperativity effect of fluorine substituents on the inhibitory activity. Our results showed that the EGFRTM in the presence of 25g undergoes a series of conformational changes that favor inhibitor binding to both the active and allosteric sites. Further, the cooperativity effect of fluorine substituents is positive: the complex stability is increased by each additional fluorine substituent. Estimated binding free energies show good correlation with the experimental biological activity. Subsequently, the decomposition energy analysis revealed that the van der Waals interaction is the principal force contributing to variations in the binding affinities of 25a and 25g to the EGFRTM. Per-residue energy-based hierarchical clustering analysis suggests that three hot-spot residues, L718, K745, and D855, are the key in achieving optimal binding modes for 25g with higher affinity in the EGFRTM compared to 25a. This study provides a rationale for the superior EGFRTM-inhibitory potency exhibited by 25g over 25a, which is expected to be useful for the future rational structure-based design of novel EGFRTM inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity.","Akher, Farideh Badichi; Farrokhzadeh, Abdolkarim; Ravenscroft, Neil; Kuttel, Michelle M",The journal of physical chemistry.

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of this shape of tracheal cuff on abundant microaspiration of gastric contents in critically ill patients. METHODS All patients intubated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and requiring mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h were eligible for this multicenter cluster-randomized controlled cross-over open-label study. The primary outcome was abundant microaspiration of gastric contents, defined by the presence of pepsin at significant level in >30% of tracheal aspirates. Quantitative measurement of pepsin and salivary amylase was performed in all tracheal aspirates during the 48 h following enrollment. RESULTS A total of 326 patients were enrolled in the ten participating ICUs (162 in the PVC tapered-cuff group and 164 in the standard-cuff group). Patient characteristics were similar in the two study groups. The proportion of patients with abundant microaspiration of gastric contents was 53.5% in the tapered-cuff and 51.0% in the standard-cuff group (odds ratio 1.14, 95% CI 0.72-1.82). While abundant microaspiration of oropharyngeal secretions was not significantly different (77.4 vs 68.6%, p = 0.095), the proportion of patients with tracheobronchial colonization was significantly lower (29.6 vs 43.3%, p = 0.01) in the tapered-cuff than in the standard-cuff group. No significant difference between the two groups was found for other secondary outcomes, including ventilator-associated events and VAP.

We reported previously that vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) mediates monocyte adhesion to LSEC. However, the pathogenic role of VCAM-1 in NASH is unclear. Herein, we report that VCAM-1 was a top upregulated adhesion molecule in the NASH mouse liver transcriptome. Open chromatin landscape profiling combined with genome-wide transcriptome analysis showed robust transcriptional upregulation of LSEC-VCAM-1 in murine NASH. Moreover, LSEC-VCAM-1 expression was significantly increased in human NASH. LSEC-VCAM-1 expression was upregulated by palmitate treatment in vitro, and reduced with inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase, mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3). Likewise, LSEC-VCAM-1 expression was reduced in the Mlk3-/- mice with diet-induced NASH. Furthermore, VCAM-1 neutralizing antibody or pharmacological inhibition attenuated diet-induced NASH in mice, mainly via reducing the proinflammatory monocyte hepatic population as examined by mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). Moreover, endothelium-specific Vcam1 knockout mice were also protected against NASH. In summary, lipotoxic stress enhances the expression of LSEC-VCAM-1, in part, through MLK3 signaling. Inhibition of VCAM-1 was salutary in murine NASH, and might serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for human NASH.","Furuta, Kunimaro; Guo, Qianqian; Pavelko, Kevin D; Lee, Jeong-Heon; Robertson, Keith D; Nakao, Yasuhiko; Melek, Jan; Shah, Vijay H; Hirsova, Petra; Ibrahim, Samar H",The Journal of clinical investigation,71,1

The 2 most common methods are the transtibial (TT) and anteromedial (AM) techniques. Purpose To determine whether graft orientation and placement affect clinical outcomes by comparing clinical and radiological outcomes after single-bundle ACL reconstruction with the AM versus TT technique. Study Design Systematic review; Level of evidence, 3. Methods Articles in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and MEDLINE were searched from inception until April 25, 2020, using the following Boolean operators: transtibial OR trans-tibial AND (anteromedial OR trans-portal OR independent OR three portal OR accessory portal) AND anterior cruciate ligament. Results Of 1270 studies retrieved, 39 studies involving 11,207 patients were included. Of these studies, 14 were clinical, 13 were radiological, and 12 were mixed. Results suggested that compared with the TT technique, the AM technique led to significantly improved anteroposterior and rotational knee stability, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, and recovery time from surgery. A higher proportion of negative Lachman (P = .0005) and pivot-shift test (P = .0001) results, lower KT-1000 arthrometer maximum manual displacement (P = .00001), higher Lysholm score (P = .001), a higher incidence of IKDC grade A/B (P = .05), and better visual analog scale score for satisfaction (P = .00001) were observed with the AM technique compared with the TT technique. The AM drilling technique demonstrated a significantly shorter tunnel length (P = .00001). Significant differences were seen between the femoral and tibial graft angles in both techniques. Low overall complication and revision rates were observed for ACL reconstruction with the AM drilling technique, similar to the TT drilling technique. Conclusion In single-bundle ACL reconstruction, the AM drilling technique was superior to the TT drilling technique based on physical examination, scoring systems, and radiographic results. The AM portal technique provided a more reproducible anatomic graft placement compared with the TT technique.","Loucas, Marios; Loucas, Rafael; D'Ambrosi, Riccardo; Hantes, Michael Elias",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,71,1

Suggestions for laparoscopic and open operative techniques are given together with a review of the literature and a presentation of three new cases. MATERIAL The PubMed database was searched for publications on ALH. Identified cases, including three from our department, are reported. RESULTS Five males and two females, with a median age of 53 years were identified. Three patients were correctly diagnosed on a preoperative CT scan and the rest at surgery. Two patients had bilateral ALHs and four had other concomitant hernias repaired. Small bowel was present in the hernia in three cases and sigmoid colon in one. In one case, an emergency operation was performed due to bowel incarceration. Five patients had laparoscopic repairs, three with mesh and two without. Two patients, one converted from laparoscopic to open operation, had open mesh repairs. The postoperative course was uneventful in all cases, and no recurrences have been reported at a median follow-up of 6 months. CONCLUSIONS A laparoscopic approach is recommended for diagnostic purposes, for pre-peritoneal mesh placement and for repair of concomitant hernias in both elective and emergency settings. Highlighting its existence might help general surgeons in interpreting an unusual finding on a CT scan or at operation.","Montgomery, A; Petersson, U; Austrums, E",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,71,19

The overall inadequate preparation of the rehabilitation system to face a sudden epidemic was clear, and similar to that of the acute services. The original idea of confining the Covid-19 cases to some areas of rehabilitation wards and/or hospitals, preserving others, proved not to be feasible. Continuous reorganization and adaptation were required due to the rapid changes. Overall, rehabilitation needs had to surrender to the more acute emergency, with total conversion of beds, wards and even hospitals. The quarantine needs heavily involved also outpatient services that were mostly closed. Rehabilitation professionals needed support, but also acted properly, again similarly to what happened in the acute wards. The typical needs of rehabilitation, such as human and physical contacts, but also social interactions including patient, team, family and caregivers, appeared clearly in the current unavoidable need of being suppressed.

Although decreases in hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have been reported during the pandemic, the implication for in-hospital outcomes is not well understood. Objective To define changes in AMI case rates, patient demographics, cardiovascular comorbidities, treatment approaches, and in-hospital outcomes during the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study retrospectively analyzed AMI hospitalizations that occurred between December 30, 2018, and May 16, 2020, in 1 of the 49 hospitals in the Providence St Joseph Health system located in 6 states (Alaska, Washington, Montana, Oregon, California, and Texas). The cohort included patients aged 18 years or older who had a principal discharge diagnosis of AMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]). Segmented regression analysis was performed to assess changes in weekly case volumes. Cases were grouped into 1 of 3 periods: before COVID-19 (December 30, 2018, to February 22, 2020), early COVID-19 (February 23, 2020, to March 28, 2020), and later COVID-19 (March 29, 2020, to May 16, 2020). In-hospital mortality was risk-adjusted using an observed to expected (O/E) ratio and covariate-adjusted multivariable model. Exposure Date of hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the weekly rate of AMI (STEMI or NSTEMI) hospitalizations. The secondary outcomes were patient characteristics, treatment approaches, and in-hospital outcomes of this patient population. Results The cohort included 15 244 AMI hospitalizations (of which 4955 were for STEMI [33%] and 10 289 for NSTEMI [67%]) involving 14 724 patients (mean [SD] age of 68 [13] years and 10 019 men [66%]). Beginning February 23, 2020, AMI-associated hospitalizations decreased at a rate of -19.0 (95% CI, -29.0 to -9.0) cases per week for 5 weeks (early COVID-19 period). Thereafter, AMI-associated hospitalizations increased at a rate of +10.5 (95% CI, +4.6 to +16.5) cases per week (later COVID-19 period). No appreciable differences in patient demographics, cardiovascular comorbidities, and treatment approaches were observed across periods. The O/E mortality ratio for AMI increased during the early period (1.27; 95% CI, 1.07-1.48), which was disproportionately associated with patients with STEMI (1.96; 95% CI, 1.22-2.70). Although the O/E mortality ratio for AMI was not statistically different during the later period (1.23; 95% CI, 0.98-1.47), increases in the O/E mortality ratio were noted for patients with STEMI (2.40; 95% CI, 1.65-3.16) and after risk adjustment (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.02-2.26). Conclusions and Relevance This cross-sectional study found important changes in AMI hospitalization rates and worse outcomes during the early and later COVID-19 periods. Future studies are needed to identify contributors to the increased mortality rate among patients with STEMI.","Gluckman, Ty J; Wilson, Michael A; Chiu, Shih-Ting; Penny, Brian W; Chepuri, Vinaya B; Waggoner, John W; Spinelli, Kateri J",JAMA cardiology,71,1

We devised a novel technique to quantify blood permeating through thrombi and determine whether this parameter predicts early recanalization with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator. METHODS Intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator-treated patients with stroke and complete occlusion on computed tomographic angiography were analyzed using perfusion computed tomography and a delay insensitive algorithm. We generated maps that measure delay in arrival time of contrast within the intracranial arterial tree (T0 maps). A positive sloped regression line of T0 values measured along artery silhouette distal to thrombus was defined as marker of permeable thrombus (occult anterograde flow). Median T0 values at proximal and distal thrombus interface were measured. Early recanalization was assessed on first angiography of subsequent intra-arterial procedure or on a 4-hour computed tomographic angiography. RESULTS Of 66 patients, occult anterograde flow was detected in 17 (25.8%). Early recanalization was more in patients with occult anterograde flow versus not (66.7 versus 29.7%; P=0.031). Median T0 value (in s) at distal thrombus interface (1.5 versus 3.8; P=0.006) and difference in median T0 value between proximal and distal thrombus interface (1.3 versus 3.7; P=0.014) were less in early recanalizers versus in nonrecanalizers. In multivariable analysis, patients with occult anterograde flow and T0 value difference between proximal and distal thrombus interface ≤2 s recanalized most (71.4%; odds ratio, 12.15; 95% confidence interval, 2.05-71.91), whereas patients with retrograde flow and T0 value difference >2 s recanalized least (25.9%; odds ratio, 1). CONCLUSIONS Occult anterograde flow through thrombus can be assessed by perfusion computed tomography T0 maps and predicts early recanalization with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator robustly.","Ahn, Seong Hwan; d'Esterre, Christopher D; Qazi, Emmad M; Najm, Mohammed; Rubiera, Marta; Fainardi, Enrico; Hill, Michael D; Goyal, Mayank; Demchuk, Andrew M; Lee, Ting Y; Menon, Bijoy K",Stroke,71,12

A decade of high-throughput sequencing-based investigations into the genomic basis of migration points to an integrative framework that incorporates quantitative genetics, evolutionary developmental biology, phenotypic plasticity, and epigenetics to explain migration evolution. In this perspective, I argue that the transcontinental migration of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) can serve as a compelling system to study the mechanism of evolutionary lability of a complex trait. Monarchs show significant phenotypic and genotypic diversity across their global range, with phenotypic switching that allows for explicit study of evolutionary lability. A developmental approach for elucidating how migratory traits are generated and functionally integrated will be important for understanding the evolution of monarch migration traits. I propose a plasticity threshold model to describe migration lability, and I describe novel functional techniques that will help resolve open questions and model assumptions. I conclude by considering the relationships between adaptive genetic architecture, anthropogenic climate change, and conservation management practice and the timeliness of the monarch migration model to illuminate these connections given the rapid decline of the North American migration.","Green, Delbert A",The American naturalist,71,17

METHODS In vitro human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocyte model showed that miR-1, miR-133a, miR-208a, miR-208b, and miR-499 are released from cells into culture medium in a time- and dose-dependent manner on doxorubicin exposure. Left ventricular (LV) myocardial deformation and circulating heart-associated miRs and plasma hs-cTnT during and after completion of chemotherapy were determined in 40 children with newly diagnosed acute leukaemia. RESULTS Significant reduction of LV global longitudinal strain and strain rates were found within 1 week after completion of anthracycline therapy in the induction phase of treatment (all p < 0.05). Hs-cTnT level peaked and miR-1 increased significantly at this time point. Log-transformed hs-cTnT correlated negatively with LV global systolic longitudinal strain (r = -0.38, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that area under the curve for changes in plasma hs-cTnT from baseline and plasma miR-1 levels in detecting a reduction in ≥20% of global longitudinal strain were respectively 0.62 (95% CI 0.38-0.87) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.40-0.84). CONCLUSION Plasma hs-cTnT and circulating miR-1 may be useful markers of myocardial damage during chemotherapy in children with leukaemias. IMPACT Heart-associated miRNAs including miR-1, miR-133a, miR-208a, miR-208b,and miR-499 were increased in the culture medium upon exposure of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to doxorubicin.Only miR-1 increased significantly during anthracycline-based therapy in paediatric leukaemic patients.In paediatric leukaemic patients, plasma hs-cTnT and circulating level of miR-1 showed the most significant increase within 1 week after completion of anthracycline therapy in the induction treatment phase.The study provides the first evidence of progressive increase in circulating miR-1 and plasma hs-cTnT levels during the course of anthracycline-based therapy in children with leukaemias, with hs-cTnT level also associated with changes in LV myocardial deformation.","Cheung, Yiu-Fai; Li, Vivian Wing-Yi; Lai, Clare Tik-Man; Shin, Vivian Yvonne; Keung, Wendy; Cheuk, Daniel Ka-Leung; Kwong, Ava; Li, Ronald Adolphus; Chan, Godfrey Chi-Fung",Pediatric research,71,31

Patients with ACS, showed a difference (p < 0.0001) in methylation profiles between groups. The low TIMI group had a higher level of DNA methylation, while the intermediate / high group showed a decreased methylation pattern. A negative correlation was observed between the level of global methylation and the increase in age (p = 0.0387; r = -0.15), which became hypomethylated over the years.

In the initial 27 cases, three cases had recurrence, especially in cases of a long rectal prolapse measuring over 10 cm. In order to avoid recurrence, the transanal vacuum test was performed following the dissection of the rectovaginal septum towards the pelvic floor. The disappearance of rectal prolapse is confirmed by the intraoperative transanal vacuum test. When the posterior wall of the rectum showed the presence of prolapse according to the transanal vacuum test, then laparoscopic ventral rectopexy was converted to laparoscopic posterior rectopexy. In 94 cases in which laparoscopic ventral rectopexy was attempted, laparoscopic ventral rectopexy was completed in 57 cases, while the procedure was converted to laparoscopic posterior rectopexy in 37 cases. The recurrence rate following laparoscopic ventral rectopexy decreased from 11.1% (3/27) to 1.7% (1/57) after beginning to use the transanal vacuum test.

HVTN 104 assessed VRC01 safety and pharmacokinetics in humans. We extend the clinical evaluation to determine intravenous-infused VRC01 distribution and protective function at mucosal sites of HIV-1 entry. METHODS Healthy, HIV-1-uninfected men (n=7) and women (n=5) receiving VRC01 every two months provided mucosal and serum samples once, 4-13 days post-infusion. Eleven male and 8 female HIV-seronegative volunteers provided untreated control samples. VRC01 levels were measured in serum, secretions and tissue, and HIV-1 inhibition was determined in tissue explants. RESULTS Median VRC01 levels were quantifiable in serum (96.2 µg/ml or 1.3 pg/ng protein), rectal tissue (0.11 pg/ng protein), rectal secretions (0.13 pg/ng protein), vaginal tissue (0.1 pg/ng protein) and cervical secretions (0.44 pg/ng protein) from all recipients. VRC01/IgG ratios in male serum correlated with those in paired rectal tissue (r=0.893, P=0.012) and rectal secretions (r=0.9643, P=0.003). Ex vivo HIV-1Bal26 challenge infected 4/21 rectal explants from VRC01-infused versus 20/22 from controls (P=0.005); HIV-1 Du422.1 infected 20/21 rectal explants of VRC01 recipients and 12/12 from controls (P=0.639). HIV-1Bal26 infected 0/14 vaginal explants of VRC01 recipients compared to 23/28 control explants (P=0.003). CONCLUSION Intravenous VRC01 distributes into the female genital and male rectal mucosa and retains anti-HIV-1 functionality, inhibiting a highly neutralization-sensitive but not a highly-resistant HIV-1 strain in mucosal tissue.

While vaccine uptake has been increasing in recent months, many regions remain at risk of significant coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) related healthcare burden. Health systems will continue to benefit from the availability of a variety of clinical and laboratory model when other triaging models are equivocal. OBJECTIVE To validate previously reported clinical laboratory abnormalities seen in COVID-19 patients and identify what laboratory parameters might be outcome-predictive. DESIGN We undertook an observational study of hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients (n=113), looking at a broad selection of clinical, laboratory, peripheral blood smear, and outcome data over discrete discovery and validation periods from March 2020 to November 2020. RESULTS We confirmed the findings of previous studies noting derangement of a variety of laboratory parameters in COVID-19 patients, including peripheral blood morphological changes. We also devised a simple-to-use decision tree by which patients could be risk stratified on the basis of Red Blood Cell count, creatinine, urea, and atypical plasmacytoid lymphocyte (""covidocyte"") count. This outcome classifier performed comparably to the World Health Organization clinical classifier and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio.

They are mostly cutaneous; however, extracutaneous lesions are possible, and occur in very rare cases in the central nervous system. A European multicentre observational retrospective study was conducted in the last 5 years. Seven patients with intracranial or intraspinal infantile haemangiomas were selected and treated with oral propranolol. Propranolol was interrupted after complete or almost complete resolution of infantile haemangiomas. All patients tolerated the treatment well without side-effects. Central nervous system infantile haemangiomas are probably underestimated due to the frequent absence of symptoms and their spontaneous involution. However, they should be investigated in case of segmental cutaneous infantile haemangiomas, particularly on the head, neck, upper trunk, lumbar or sacral area in order to diagnosis intra-central nervous system involvement at an early stage.","Diociaiuti, Andrea; Carnevale, Claudia; Torres, Eulalia Baselga; Léauté-Labrèze, Christine; Neri, Iria; Rotunno, Roberta; Figà-Talamanca, Lorenzo; El Hachem, May",Acta dermato-venereologica,71,1

We aimed to develop a brief measure, the Pandemic Anxiety Scale, to capture the specific aspects of the pandemic that are provoking anxiety, and explore how these vary by health and demographic factors. DESIGN Data were from a convenience sample of parents (N = 4,793) and adolescents (N = 698) recruited in the first 6 weeks of lockdown. METHODS Factor analytic and IRT methods were used to validate the new measure in both parent and adolescent samples. Associations between scores on the new measure and age, gender, household income, and physical health status were explored using structural equation modelling (SEM). RESULTS Two factors were identified in both samples: disease anxiety (e.g., catching, transmitting the virus) and consequence anxiety (e.g., impact on economic prospects); and unique associations with health and demographic factors were observed. CONCLUSIONS Anxieties due to the COVID-19 are multifaceted, and the PAS is a short, reliable, and valid measure of these concerns. These anxieties are differentially associated with demographic, social, and health factors, which should be considered when developing strategies to mitigate the mental health impact of the pandemic.","McElroy, Eoin; Patalay, Praveetha; Moltrecht, Bettina; Shevlin, Mark; Shum, Adrienne; Creswell, Cathy; Waite, Polly",British journal of health psychology,71,13

This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous dexmedetomidine in mechanically ventilated children in the intensive care unit (ICU) after neurosurgery. Pediatric patients aged 2-12 years, who were mechanically ventilated in ICU after neurosurgery, were allocated into a low-dose (n = 15) or high-dose (n = 14) group. The low-dose group received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 0.25 µg/kg for 10 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.25 µg/kg/h for 50 min, whereas the high-dose group received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 0.5 µg/kg for 10 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 µg/kg/h for 50 min. Serial blood samples were collected for a pharmacokinetic analysis up to 480 min after the end of the infusion. The sedative effect of dexmedetomidine was assessed using the Bispectral Index and University of Michigan Sedation Scale. Adverse reactions, electrocardiography findings, and vital signs were monitored for a safety assessment. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using non-linear mixed effects modeling. Dexmedetomidine induced a moderate-to-deep degree of sedation during infusion in both groups. The pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine were best described by a two-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination kinetics. The parameters were standardized for a body weight of 70 kg using an allometric power model. The population estimates (95% confidence interval) per 70 kg body weight were as follows: clearance of 81.0 (72.9-90.9) L/h, central volume of distribution of 64.2 (50.6-81.0) L, intercompartment clearance of 116.4 (90.6-156.0) L/h, and peripheral volume of distribution of 167 (132-217) L. No serious adverse reactions or hemodynamic changes requiring the discontinuation of dexmedetomidine were observed. Dexmedetomidine had increased clearance and volume of distribution in mechanically ventilated children in ICU after neurosurgery, thereby indicating the need to adjust the dosage to obtain a target plasma concentration.","Song, In-Kyung; Yi, SoJeong; Lim, Hyeong-Seok; Lee, Ji-Hyun; Kim, Eun-Hee; Cho, Joo-Youn; Kim, Min-Chang; Kim, Jin-Tae; Kim, Hee-Soo",Journal of clinical medicine,71,1

In cats, BDV may cause a non-suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis ('staggering disease'). INFECTION The mode of transmission is not completely elucidated. Direct and indirect virus transmission is postulated, but BDV is not readily transmitted between cats. Vectors such as ticks may play a role and shrews have been identified as a potential reservoir host. Access to forested areas has been reported to be an important risk factor for staggering disease. DISEASE SIGNS It is postulated that BDV may infect nerve endings in the oropharynx and spread via olfactory nerve cells to the central nervous system. A strong T-cell response may contribute to the development of clinical disease. Affected cats develop gait disturbances, ataxia, pain in the lower back and behavioural changes. DIAGNOSIS For diagnostic purposes, detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription PCR in samples collected from cats with clinical signs of Borna disease can be considered diagnostic. Serology is of little value; cats without signs of Borna disease may be seropositive and yet not every cat with BDV infection has detectable levels of antibodies. HUMAN INFECTION A hypothesis that BDV infection may be involved in the development of selected neurological disorders in man could not be confirmed. A research group within the German Robert Koch Institute studied the potential health threat of BDV to humans and concluded that BDV was not involved in the aetiology of human psychiatric diseases.","Lutz, Hans; Addie, Diane D; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman; Frymus, Tadeusz; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Hartmann, Katrin; Horzinek, Marian C; Hosie, Margaret J; Lloret, Albert; Marsilio, Fulvio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Radford, Alan D; Thiry, Etienne; Truyen, Uwe; Möstl, Karin",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,71,19

However, it is crucial to assess the impact of atmospheric conditions on air quality and air pollutant dispersion in the face of the potential variability of all sources. In this study, the impact of mobility restrictions on the air quality was analyzed for the most populous Brazilian State, São Paulo, severely impacted by COVID-19. Ground-based air quality data (PM10, PM2.5, CO, SO2, NOx, NO2, NO, and O3) were used from 50 automatic air quality monitoring stations to evaluate the changes in concentrations before (January 01 - March 25) and during the partial quarantine (March 16 - June 30). Rainfall, fires, and daily cell phone mobility data were also used as supplementary information to the analyses. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the heterogeneity of the air quality data during and before mobility restrictions. In general, the results demonstrated no substantial improvements in air quality for most of the pollutants when comparing before and during restrictions periods. Besides, when the analyzed period of 2020 is compared with the year 2019, there is no significant air quality improvement in the São Paulo State. However, special attention should be given to the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP), due to the vast population residing in this area and exposed to air pollution. The region reached an average decrease of 29% in CO, 28% in NOx, 40% in NO, 19% in SO2, 15% in PM2.5, and 8% in PM10 concentrations during the mobility restrictions period compared to the same period in 2019. The only pollutant that showed an increase in concentration was ozone, with a 20% increase compared to 2019 during the mobility restrictions period. Before the mobility restrictions period, the region reached an average decrease of 30% in CO, 39% in NOx, 63% in NO, 12% in SO2, 23% in PM2.5, 18% in PM10, and 16% in O3 concentrations when compared to the same period in 2019. On the other hand, Cubatão, a highly industrialized area, showed statistically significant increases above 20% for most monitored pollutants in both periods of 2020 compared to 2019. This study reinforces that the main driving force of pollutant concentration variability is the dynamics of the atmosphere at its various time scales. An abnormal rainy season, with above average rainfall before the restrictions and below average after it, generated a scenario in which the probable significant reductions in emissions did not substantially affect the concentration of pollutants.","Rudke, A P; Martins, J A; de Almeida, D S; Martins, L D; Beal, A; Hallak, R; Freitas, E D; Andrade, M F; Foroutan, H; Baek, B H; de A Albuquerque, T T",Environmental research,71,1

OBJECTIVE To compare metabolic effects of MR-HC with Standard Glucocorticoid (SG) replacement in adults with AI. Randomised control trials (RCTs) were meta-analysed; non-RCT studies described narratively with critical appraisal. DATA SOURCES PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL were searched to identify relevant articles, published before Aug 2019. STUDY SELECTION All study types that reported metabolic profile (including anthropometric, glucose and lipid-related parameters), on patients switched from SG to MR-HC replacement. Following independent screening from two reviewers, 390 studies were identified, of which 9 studies were included for review (RCT, n=2; non-RCT, n=7). DATA EXTRACTION Two independent reviewers assessed each paper for bias and data extraction. RESULTS Meta-analysis from RCTs (n=2), 104 patients were switched from SG to MR-HC replacement. Combining treatment effects, at 3-months post-therapy switch there was significant reduction in body weight (-0.82kg; 95% CI: -1.24kg to -0.40kg; p<0.001) and HbA1c (-0.13%; 95% CI: -0.214% to -0.045%; p=0.003). In the sub-group with Diabetes Mellitus (DM), reduction in HbA1C was more pronounced (-0.52%; 95% CI: -0.82% to -0.23%; p<0.001). Non-RCT studies showed improved anthropometric measures and glucose metabolism up to 48-months following switch from SG to MR-HC replacement. CONCLUSIONS In adults with AI, replacement with MR-HC associates with significant improvements in anthropometric measurements and HbA1c compared with SG replacement, particularly those with DM.","Bannon, C; Gallacher, D; Hanson, P; Randeva, H S; Weickert, M O; Barber, T M",Clinical endocrinology,71,1

However, few studies explored the role of circRNAs in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The present study aims to investigate the role of circ_0060745 in the pathogenesis of AMI. We found that the expression of circ_0060745 was significantly increased in the myocardium of AMI mice and was mainly expressed in myocardial fibroblasts. The knockdown of circ_0060745 decreased myocardial infarct size and improved systolic cardiac functions after AMI. The knockdown of circ_0060745 in cardiac fibroblasts inhibited the migration of peritoneal macrophage, the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and the expressions of IL-6, IL-12, IL-1β, TNF-α and NF-κB under hypoxia. Overexpression of circ_0060745 caused an increase in infarct size and worsened cardiac functions after AMI. In summary, our findings showed that knockdown of circ_0060745 mitigates AMI by suppressing cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammation. These protective effects could be attributed to inhibition of NF-κB activation.","Zhai, Changlin; Qian, Gang; Wu, Huajun; Pan, Haihua; Xie, Shuoyin; Sun, Zhewei; Shao, Pingyang; Tang, Guanmin; Hu, Huilin; Zhang, Song",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,71,16

We hypothesized that antimicrobial S100A8/A9 would mitigate change to the local microbial community and promote resistance to experimental periodontitis in vivo. To test this hypothesis, S100A9-/- and wild-type (WT; S100A9+/+) C57BL/6 mice were compared using a model of ligature-induced periodontitis. On day 2, WT mice showed fewer infiltrating innate immune cells than S100A9-/- mice; by day 5, the immune cell numbers were similar. At 5 days post-ligature placement, oral microbial communities sampled with swabs differed significantly in beta diversity between the mouse genotypes. Ligatures recovered from molar teeth of S100A9-/- and WT mice contained significantly dissimilar microbial genera from each other and the overall oral communities from swabs. Concomitantly, the S100A9-/- mice had significantly greater alveolar bone loss than WT mice around molar teeth in ligated sites. When the oral microflora was ablated by antibiotic pre-treatment, differences disappeared between WT and S100A9-/- mice in their immune cell infiltrates and alveolar bone loss. Calprotectin, therefore, suppresses emergence of a dysbiotic, proinflammatory oral microbial community, which reduces innate immune effector activity including early recruitment of innate immune cells, mitigating subsequent alveolar bone loss, and protecting against experimental periodontitis.","Johnstone, Karen F; Wei, Yuping; Bittner-Eddy, Peter D; Vreeman, Gerrit W; Stone, Ian A; Clayton, Jonathan B; Reilly, Cavan S; Walbon, Travis B; Wright, Elisa N; Hoops, Susan L; Boyle, William S; Costalonga, Massimo; Herzberg, Mark C",Infection and immunity,71,1

Of US adults, 77% supported paid sick leave, and a majority also supported universal health insurance, an increased minimum wage, and various unemployment support policies. Public support for an active government role in society to improve citizens' lives increased by 10 percentage points during this initial pandemic response relative to September 2019. Belief in a strong governmental role in society was associated with greater support for social safety-net policies.Conclusions. During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in early April 2020, most US adults favored a range of safety-net policies to ameliorate its negative health and economic consequences. For most safety-net policies, public support was highest among those favoring a stronger governmental role in society. (Am J Public Health.

Antenatal breastmilk expression (BME) may be suggested to mothers, including mothers with diabetes, to improve breastfeeding, maternal, and infant outcomes postpartum. However, there have been few evaluations of the potential harms and benefits of this practice. The objective of our scoping review will be to broadly examine the literature describing maternal and infant outcomes of antenatal BME. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This scoping review will address the research question: 'Among women who engaged in antenatal BME, what maternal and infant outcomes have been evaluated?' A search of published and unpublished studies available in English will be conducted in February 2020 using the following databases: Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCOHost), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (OVID). A search of the British Library E-Theses Online Services (EThOS) database and OpenGrey will be conducted to identify relevant grey literature. This scoping review will use a five-step framework to guide the selection, extraction, and analysis of eligible studies. Clinical consultation will be included as a sixth step to our methodology. Literature reporting on the effect of antenatal BME on maternal and infant outcomes, breastfeeding initiation and duration, and the experiences of women who have engaged in the practice will be considered. The data will be summarised with attention paid to high-risk obstetrical populations such as women with diabetes. Our results will be reported as outlined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews.

It seems reasonable to argue that the risk patterns for COVID-19 have to be usefully studied in quantitative terms too, whenever possible applying the same approach to the relationship 'dose of the exposure vs pathological response' commonly used for chemicals and already followed for several biological agents to SARS-CoV-2, too. Such an approach is of particular relevance in the fields of both occupational epidemiology and occupational medicine, where the identification of the sources of a dangerous exposure and of the web of causation of a disease is often questionable and questioned: it is relevant when evaluating the population risk, too. Specific occupational scenarios, basically involving health workers, exhibit important proportions of both subjects simply infected by SARS-CoV-2 and of ill subjects with, respectively, mild, moderate, and severe disease. Similar patterns have been described referring to various circumstances of community exposure, e.g., standing in crowded public places, travelling on crowded means of transport, living in accommodation or care homes, living in the same household as a COVID-19 case. The hypothesis that these findings are a consequence not only of high probabilities of exposure, but also of high doses (as a product of both intensity and duration, with possible autonomous effects of peaks of exposure) deserves to be systematically tested, in order to reconstruct the web of causation of COVID-19 individual and clustered cases and to cope with situations at critical risk for SARS-CoV-2, needing to be identified, mapped, and dealt with at the right time. A limited but consistent set of papers supporting these assumptions has been traced in the literature. Under these premises, the creation of a structured inventory of both values of viral concentrations in the air (in case and if possible, of surface contaminations too) and of viral loads in biological matrixes is proposed, with the subsequent construction of a scenario-exposure matrix. A scenario-exposure matrix for SARS-CoV-2 may represent a useful tool for research and practical risk management purposes, helping to understand the possibly critical circumstances for which no direct exposure measure is available (this is an especially frequent case, in contexts of low socio-economic level) and providing guidance to determine evidence-based public health strategies.","Calisti, Roberto",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,71,1

We aimed to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) employees who fight COVID-19 at the forefront. METHODS A total of 400 EMS workers (doctors, nurses, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, and ambulance drivers) were included in this study. Knowledge, attitude, and preventive behaviors for COVID-19 were evaluated using an online questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 275 EMS workers participated in the study with a response rate of 68.8%. The respondents reported that their highest common sources of knowledge about COVID-19 were social media and television (n=240, 88%). Overall, > 96% of the participants had adequate knowledge about the transmission routes of COVID-19. Among the respondents, 36% of them were unaware of the correct hand washing or scrubbing technique. In addition, 78% of the participants had poor knowledge about floor and surface disinfection. The majority of the participants exhibited inaccurate attitudes toward the use of personal preventive equipment. More than half of EMS workers (52%) agreed that a surgical mask is not enough during the procedures that do not generate aerosol. Moreover, a significant proportion of the participants (66%) perceived that a N95 mask is required. CONCLUSIONS As a consequence, although emergency workers have sufficient basic knowledge about COVID-19, there is a need for postgraduate training in many subjects.","Vatan, Asli; Güçlü, Ertuğrul; Öğütlü, Aziz; Kibar, Fulya Aktan; Karabay, Oğuz",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,71,1

However, state-of-the-art microscopy techniques and continuum modeling approaches focus on large length and time scales. Here, we perform component-based computer simulations of polar filaments and molecular motors linking microscopic interactions and activity to self-organization and dynamics from the filament level up to the mesoscopic domain level. Dynamic filament cross-linking and sliding and excluded-volume interactions promote formation of bundles at small densities and of active polar nematics at high densities. A buckling-type instability sets the size of polar domains and the density of topological defects. We predict a universal scaling of the active diffusion coefficient and the domain size with activity, and its dependence on parameters like motor concentration and filament persistence length. Our results provide a microscopic understanding of cytoplasmic streaming in cells and help to develop design strategies for novel engineered active materials.","Vliegenthart, Gerard A; Ravichandran, Arvind; Ripoll, Marisol; Auth, Thorsten; Gompper, Gerhard",Science advances,71,14

Although previous studies examined several intrathymic mechanisms that negatively affect T lymphopoiesis, the extrathymic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report a dramatic decrease in the percentage of early T lineage progenitors (ETPs) in three models of sepsis in mice (cecal ligation and puncture, lipopolysaccharide continuous injection, and poly I:C continuous injection). However, septic mice did not show a decrease in the number of bone marrow (BM) precursor cells. Instead, the BM progenitors for ETPs expressed reduced mRNA levels of CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 7, CCR9 and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1, and exhibited impaired homing capacity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analysis and real-time PCR showed a marked downregulation of several lymphoid-related genes in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells differentiated into myeloid cells but failed to generate T lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that the depletion of ETPs in septic mice might be a consequence of an impaired migration of BM progenitors to the thymus, as well as a defect in lymphoid lineage commitment.

This is a major problem for science, society and economy. Driven by industry or scientific networks, several attempts to combat this crisis are initiated. However, only few measures address the applicability and feasibility of implementation of actions into an academic research environment with limited resources. Methods: Here we propose a strategy catalogue aiming for a quality management system suitable for many research labs, on the example of a cell culture focused laboratory. Our proposal is guided by its inexpensiveness and possibility of rapid installation. For this we used eLabFTW, an electronic lab book, as hub for all other components of our Quality Management System (QMS) and digital storage of lab journals. We introduced Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) as well as a managed bio bank for safer long-term storage of bio samples. Next, we set up a lab meeting as feedback mechanism for the QMS. Finally, we implemented an automated pipeline to be used for example for drug screens. Results: With this effort we want to reduce individual differences in work techniques, to further improve the quality of our results. Although, just recently established, we can already observe positive outcomes in quality of experimental results, improvements in sample and data storage, stakeholder engagement and even promotion of new scientific discoveries. Conclusions: We believe that our experiences can help to establish a road map to increase value and output of preclinical research in academic labs with limited budget and personnel.","Hewera, Michael; Nickel, Ann-Christin; Knipprath, Nina; Muhammad, Sajjad; Fan, Xiaolong; Steiger, Hans-Jakob; Hänggi, Daniel; Kahlert, Ulf Dietrich",F1000Research,71,20

Identifying and averting spillover transmission is crucial for preventing outbreaks and mitigating infectious disease burdens. Investigating the processes that lead to spillover fundamentally involves interactions between animals, humans, pathogens and the environments they inhabit. Accordingly, it is recognized that transdisciplinary approaches provide a more holistic understanding of spillover phenomena. To characterize the discourse about spillover within and between disciplines, we conducted a review of review papers about spillover from multiple disciplines. We systematically searched and screened literature from several databases to identify a corpus of review papers from ten academic disciplines. We performed qualitative content analysis on text where authors described either a spillover pathway, or a conceptual gap in spillover theory. Cluster analysis of pathway data identified nine major spillover processes discussed in the review literature. We summarized the main features of each process, how different disciplines contributed to them, and identified specialist and generalist disciplines based on the breadth of processes they studied. Network analyses showed strong similarities between concepts reviewed by 'One Health' disciplines (e.g. Veterinary Science & Animal Health, Public Health & Medicine, Ecology & Evolution, Environmental Science), which had broad conceptual scope and were well-connected to other disciplines. By contrast, awas focused on processes that are relatively overlooked by other disciplines, especially those involving food behaviour and livestock husbandry practices. Virology and Cellular & Molecular Biology were narrower in scope, primarily focusing on concepts related to adaption and evolution of zoonotic viruses. Finally, we identified priority areas for future research into zoonotic spillover by studying the gap data.","Sánchez, Cecilia A; Venkatachalam-Vaz, Joy; Drake, John M",Zoonoses and public health,71,5

A total of 20 patients with pulmonary embolisms (PE) and 20 age‑ and gender‑matched controls were enrolled in the present study. Human complementary DNA microarray analysis was used in order to detect the differential expression of B‑cell‑associated genes between the PE and control groups. Messenger (m)RNA expression was detected for 82 genes involved in B‑cell activation. The results showed that PE patients exhibited significantly increased expression levels of the B‑cell receptor genes LYN, CD22, SYK, BTK, PTPRC and NFAM1, whereas expression levels of FYN, FCRL4 and LAX1 were significantly decreased compared to those of the control group. Expression levels of T‑cell‑dependent B‑cell‑activation genes, including EMR2, TNFSF9, CD86, ICOSLG, CD37 and CD97, were significantly upregulated in PE patients, whereas SPN mRNA expression was significantly downregulated compared with those of the control group. LILRA1 and TLR9 T cell‑independent B‑cell activation mRNAs were significantly upregulated in PE patients compared with those of the control group. In addition, the expression levels of B‑cell‑activation regulator genes, including CR1, LILRB4 and VAV1, were significantly increased, whereas SLAMF7 expression levels were significantly decreased in PE patients compared with those of the control group. Furthermore, the expression levels of B‑cell‑activation‑associated cytokine genes demonstrated a significant upregulation of LTA and IL10 and downregulation of L1A, IFNA5, IFNA6, IFNA8, IFNA14, IL2, IL13 and IFNG in PE patients compared to those of the control group. In conclusion, the differential gene expression at different stages of B‑cell activation between healthy controls and PE patients indicated that B‑cell function was reduced or disorganized in patients with symptomatic PE.","Lv, Wei; Duan, Qianglin; Wang, Lemin; Gong, Zhu; Yang, Fan; Song, Yanli",Molecular medicine reports,71,26

The purpose of this study was to analyse the aetiology, incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of CAP patients with fever during non-pandemics, and then to provide theoretical basis for accurate diagnosis and treatment in CAP patients. Methods An enrolment system was established for monitoring the CAP patients with fever. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) kits were used to detect 10 viruses [influenza A and B, adenovirus (ADV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, picornavirus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), coronavirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and bocavirus]. Data on age, gender, underlying diseases, complications, laboratory indexes, and outcomes were collected by physicians. Results This prospective study included 320 patients with fever. Among them, 23.4% were viral-positive by mPCR, with influenza virus most prominent followed by picornavirus. Strong variation in seasonal distribution was shown in viral infections, with peak months from December to February. Patients with influenza infection were likely to be taken to emergency rooms and have respiratory failure with higher creatinine kinase levels and lower white blood cell counts. Streptococcus pneumoniae followed by haemophilus influenzae were the most common bacteria in viral co-infections, which accounted for one third of virus-positive patients. Viral CAP and mixed CAP were not independent factors for death. In addition, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >246 IU/L [odds ratio (OR) =7.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15-23.2, P=0.001], and serum calcium <2.18 mmol/L (OR =6.67, 95% CI: 1.42-31.3, P=0.016) were associated with death. Conclusions Viruses play an important role in CAP patients with fever, a systematic clinical, radiological and biological analysis of these patients can contribute to effective therapy that may prevent the development of CAP and improve the outcomes.

The Ottawa Decision Support Framework (ODSF) has guided practitioners and patients facing difficult decisions for 20 years. It asserts that decision support interventions that address patients' decisional needs improve decision quality. Purpose. To update the ODSF based on a synthesis of evidence. Methods. We conducted an overview of systematic reviews, searching 9 electronic databases. Eligible reviews included decisional needs assessments, decision support interventions, and decisional outcome measures guided by the ODSF. We extracted data and synthesized results narratively. Eight ODSF developers/expert users from 4 disciplines revised the ODSF. Results. Of 4656 citations, we identified 4 eligible reviews (>250 studies, >100 different decisions, >50,000 patients, 18 countries, 5 continents). They reported current ODSF decisional needs and their most frequent manifestations in the areas of inadequate knowledge/information, unclear values, decisional conflict/uncertainty, and inadequate support. They uncovered 11 new manifestations of 6 decisional needs. Using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) to assess decisional needs, average scores were elevated at baseline and declined shortly after decision making, even without information interventions. Patient decision aids were superior to usual care in reducing total DCS scores and improving decision quality. We revised the ODSF by refining definitions of 6 decisional needs and adding new interventions to address 4 needs. We added a decision process outcome and eliminated secondary outcomes unlikely to improve across a range of decisions, retaining the implementation/continuance of the chosen option and appropriate use/costs of health services. Conclusions. We updated the ODSF to reflect the current evidence and identified implications for practice and further research.","Stacey, Dawn; Légaré, France; Boland, Laura; Lewis, Krystina B; Loiselle, Marie-Chantal; Hoefel, Lauren; Garvelink, Mirjam; O'Connor, Annette",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,71,19

MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty surgeons participated in this study and were distributed into three groups (novices, intermediate and experts). Each subject carried out suturing and dissection tasks on a physical simulator, using axial-handled or ring-handled instruments, respectively. Hand and wrist positions were registered by the CyberGlove® and a modified RULA method was applied to establish appropriate risk levels for wrist disorders. RESULTS We found statistically significant differences in seven of the eleven glove sensors when comparing both tasks. RULA method showed that all subjects, with the exception of the experts using an axial-handled instrument, assume a prejudicial wrist posture during the practice of suturing and dissection tasks on the simulator. CONCLUSIONS Data glove CyberGlove® allows for the distinction between two laparoscopic exercises performed with different instruments. Also, laparoscopic intracorporeal suturing when performed with an axial-handled needle holder entails a more ergonomic posture for the wrist joint. Previous minimally invasive surgical experience is a positive influencing factor on the surgeons' wrist postures during laparoscopy.","Sánchez-Margallo, Francisco M; Pérez-Duarte, Francisco J; Sánchez-Margallo, Juan A; Lucas-Hernández, Marcos; Matos-Azevedo, Ana Maria; Díaz-Güemes, Idoia",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,71,29

We assessed risk factors for bacterial colonisation in COPD. METHODS Patients with stable COPD consecutively recruited over 1 year gave consent to provide a sputum sample for microbiologic analysis. Bronchial colonisation by potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPMs) was defined as the isolation of PPMs at concentrations of > or =102 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL on quantitative bacterial culture. Colonised patients were divided into high (>105 CFU/mL) or low (<105 CFU/mL) bacterial load. RESULTS A total of 119 patients (92.5% men, mean age 68 years, mean forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] [% predicted] 46.4%) were evaluated. Bacterial colonisation was demonstrated in 58 (48.7%) patients. Patients with and without bacterial colonisation showed significant differences in smoking history, cough, dyspnoea, COPD exacerbations and hospitalisations in the previous year, and sputum colour. Thirty-six patients (62% of those colonised) had a high bacterial load. More than 80% of the sputum samples with a dark yellow or greenish colour yielded PPMs in culture. In contrast, only 5.9% of white and 44.7% of light yellow sputum samples were positive (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed an increased degree of dyspnoea (odds ratio [OR] = 2.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-5.09, P = 0.004) and a darker sputum colour (OR = 4.11, 95% CI 2.30-7.29, P < 0.001) as factors associated with the presence of PPMs in sputum. CONCLUSIONS Almost half of our population of ambulatory moderate to very severe COPD patients were colonised with PPMs. Patients colonised present more severe dyspnoea, and a darker colour of sputum allows identification of individuals more likely to be colonised.","Miravitlles, Marc; Marín, Alicia; Monsó, Eduard; Vilà, Sara; de la Roza, Cristian; Hervás, Ramona; Esquinas, Cristina; García, Marian; Millares, Laura; Morera, Josep; Torres, Antoni",Respiratory research,71,28

The present study was to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms involved in the immunomodulation of GSLS-Se on the Harderian gland (HG). It was found that the window allowing animals susceptible to infections due to low antibody titers became smaller or even completely closed because of increased NDV-specific HI titers when NDV vaccine and GSLS-Se were coadministered for immunization at early life in chickens. In addition, NDV-specific sIgA and the numbers of IgG+, IgA+, IgM+ plasma cells were significantly more in GSLS-Se group than the control in the HGs. Transcriptome analysis of HGs identified 1184 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between GSLS-Se treated and non-treated groups. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses identified 42 significantly enriched GO terms and 13 canonical immune pathways. These findings indicated that GSLS-Se might exert immunomodulatory effects through influencing the antioxidant regulation and modulating the activity of immune related enzymes. Besides, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway might be involved primarily in the immunomodulation. Therefore, enhanced antibody responses in GSLS-Se group may be attributed to the immunomodulatory effects of GSLS-Se on the immune-related gene profile expressed in the immunocompetent cells of the HGs.","Ma, Xiaodan; Chi, Xiaoqing; Yuan, Lijia; Wang, Yuemin; Li, Zoushuyi; Xu, Wei; Rajput, Zahid Iqbal; Hu, Songhua",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,71,33

However, research on such deviations is limited. To address this we investigated the prevalence of procedural and documentation deviations in IV infusion administration and explored variability in policy and practice across different hospital trusts. METHODS We conducted a mixed methods study. This involved observations of deviations from local policy including quantitative and qualitative data, and focus groups with clinical staff to explore the causes and contexts of deviations. The observations were conducted across five clinical areas (general medicine, general surgery, critical care, paediatrics and oncology day care) in 16 National Health Service (NHS) trusts in England. All infusions being administered at the time of data collection were included. Deviation rates for procedural and documentation requirements were compared between trusts. Local data collectors and other relevant stakeholders attended focus groups at each trust. Policy details and reasons for deviations were discussed. RESULTS At least one procedural or documentation deviation was observed in 961 of 2008 IV infusions (deviation rate 47.9%; 95% confidence interval 45.5-49.8%). Deviation rates at individual trusts ranged from 9.9 to 100% of infusions, with considerable variation in the prevalence of different types of deviation. Focus groups revealed lack of policy awareness, ambiguous policies, safety and practicality concerns, different organisational priorities, and wide variation in policies and practice relating to prescribing and administration of IV flushes and double-checking. CONCLUSIONS Deviation rates and procedural and documentation requirements varied considerably between hospital trusts. Our findings reveal areas where local policy and practice do not align. Some policies may be impractical and lack utility. We suggest clearer evidence-based standardisation and local procedures that are contextually practical to address these issues.","Furniss, Dominic; Lyons, Imogen; Franklin, Bryony Dean; Mayer, Astrid; Chumbley, Gillian; Wei, Li; Cox, Anna L; Vos, Jolien; Galal-Edeen, Galal; Blandford, Ann",BMC health services research,71,25

Despite numerous studies in marine systems, little is known about diazotrophs and their functioning in oligohaline estuarine environments. Here we applied a combination of nifH transcript and metagenomic shotgun sequencing approaches to investigate temporal shifts in taxonomic composition and nifH activity of size-fractionated diazotrophic communities in a shallow and mostly freshwater coastal lagoon. Patterns in active nifH phylotypes exhibited a clear seasonal succession, which reflected their different tolerances to temperature change and nitrogen (N) availability. Thus, in spring, heterotrophic diazotrophs (Proteobacteria) dominated the nifH phylotypes, while increasing water temperature and depletion of inorganic N fostered heterocystous Cyanobacteria in summer. Metagenomic data demonstrated four main N-cycling pathways and three of them with a clear seasonal pattern: denitrification (spring) → N2 fixation (summer) → assimilative NO3- reduction (fall), with NH4+ uptake into cells occurring across all seasons. Although a substantial denitrification signal was observed in spring, it could have originated from the re-suspended benthic rather than planktonic community. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the realized genetic potential of pelagic N2 fixation and its seasonal dynamics in oligohaline estuarine ecosystems, which are natural coastal biogeochemical reactors.","Zilius, Mindaugas; Samuiloviene, Aurelija; Stanislauskienė, Rūta; Broman, Elias; Bonaglia, Stefano; Meškys, Rolandas; Zaiko, Anastasija",Microbial ecology,71,1

Although endovascular management (EM) is currently a preferred method of treatment of SD, complications associated with this method of treatment in published reports are quite frequent (3-16%). Aim In this retrospective study we analyzed the results of EM with novel, double-mesh stent and protection systems (PS) for SD of the internal carotid (IC) or vertebral arteries (VA) that coexisted with hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysmatic dilatation of the dissected artery. Material and methods We evaluated the results of EM in 19 patients (men 15, median age: 55, range: 25-83), presenting with SD of the IC or VA with coexisting stenosis and/or aneurysmatic dilatation of the artery in segments C1-C5 of IC or V0-V4 of VA. Twelve patients had a stroke, 6 TIA, and 3 patients a headache and/or a neck pain with Horner syndrome. Stents and PS were tailored according to the location, length of dissection and coexisting stenotic or aneurysmatic lesions. Results There were no new strokes, in-hospital deaths or other serious morbidities during the procedure and postprocedural hospital stay. There were no fatalities during 6-40 months of follow-up. In control angiographies performed after interventions all patients demonstrated a patent target artery, complete coverage of the dissection and aneurysm by stents and no new lesions in the area of the previous dissection. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that EM of SD of IC and VA with the new stents and PS is safe and effective with good early and midterm results.","Latacz, Paweł; Simka, Marian; Brzegowy, Paweł; Słowik, Agnieszka; Popiela, Tadeusz",Postepy w kardiologii interwencyjnej = Advances in interventional cardiology,71,1

The possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pharmaceutical supply chain is assessed and recommendations are listed for risk mitigation steps to minimize supply disruption to pharmaceutical drug products. Areas addressed include a brief history of the COVID-19 viral pandemic, a description of the virus, the regulatory response to the pandemic, the screening of employees, the persistence on inanimate surfaces, cleaning and disinfection of manufacturing facilities, use of GMP-mandated personal protective equipment to counter the spread of the disease, the role of air changes in viral clearance, approaches to risk assessment and mitigation. Biological medicinal products have a great record of safety, yet the cell cultures used for production can be susceptible to viruses, and contamination events have occurred. Studies on SARS-CoV-1 for its ability to replicate in various mammalian cell lines used for biopharmaceutical manufacturing suggest SARS-CoV-2 poses low risk and any contamination would be detected by currently used adventitious virus testing. The consequences of the potential virus exposure of manufacturing processes, as well as the effectiveness of mitigation efforts are discussed.

Recently, vessel recanalization has been associated with reduced ischemic brain edema in patients with good clinical outcome. As edema volume (EV) may be quantified in computed tomography (CT), we hypothesized that higher EV after revascularization predicts futile recanalization with poor outcome. METHODS In this observational study, 67 ischemic stroke patients with M1 middle cerebral artery occlusion fulfilled all inclusion criteria and were analyzed. All patients received successful endovascular recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scale 2b/3) and subsequent follow-up CT 24 hours later. Edema volume within the infarct lesion was calculated in follow-up CT applying lesion water uptake quantification and was used to predict clinical outcome (Modified Rankin Scale [mRS] after 90 days) compared with infarct volume. RESULTS The median EV after thrombectomy was 1.6 mL (interquartile range, 0.2-4.2 mL) in patients with mRS 0 to 4 and 8.6 mL (interquartile range, 2.0-49.8 mL) in patients with mRS 5 to 6 (P = 0.0008). In regression analysis, an EV increase of 1 mL was associated with an 8.0% increased likelihood of poor outcome (95% confidence interval, 2.8%-15.4%; P = 0.008). Based on univariate receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, absolute EV over 4.2 mL predicted poor outcome (mRS 5-6) with good discriminative power (area under curve, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.84; specificity, 77%; sensitivity, 68%). In comparison, the area under curve for infarct volume was 0.68. CONCLUSIONS Elevated EV after endovascular thrombectomy was associated with poor clinical outcome and may indicate futile recanalization.","Nawabi, Jawed; Flottmann, Fabian; Hanning, Uta; Bechstein, Matthias; Schön, Gerhard; Kemmling, Andre; Fiehler, Jens; Broocks, Gabriel",Investigative radiology,71,30

This study was initiated by the Norwegian Army to evaluate potential outcomes during failure of oxygen supply, and to explore physiology during acute severe hypobaric hypoxia. A simulated HAHO without supplemental oxygen was carried out in a hypobaric chamber with decompression to 30,000 ft (9,144 m) and then recompression to ground level with a descent rate of 1,000 ft/min (305 m/min). Nine subjects were studied. Repeated arterial blood gas samples were drawn throughout the entire hypoxic exposure. Additionally, pulse oximetry, cerebral oximetry, and hemodynamic variables were monitored. Desaturation evolved rapidly and the arterial oxygen tensions are among the lowest ever reported in volunteers during acute hypoxia. PaO2 decreased from baseline 18.4 (17.3-19.1) kPa, 138.0 (133.5-143.3) mmHg, to a minimum value of 3.3 (2.9-3.7) kPa, 24.8 (21.6-27.8) mmHg, after 180 (60-210) s, [median (range)], N = 9. Hyperventilation with ensuing hypocapnia was associated with both increased arterial oxygen saturation and cerebral oximetry values, and potentially improved tolerance to severe hypoxia. One subject had a sharp drop in heart rate and cardiac index and lost consciousness 4 min into the hypoxic exposure. A simulated high-altitude airdrop scenario without supplemental oxygen results in extreme hypoxemia and may result in loss of consciousness in some individuals.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to investigate physiology and clinical outcome of oxygen system failure in a simulated HAHO scenario. The acquired knowledge is of great value to make valid risk-benefit analyses during HAHO training or operations. The arterial oxygen tensions reported in this hypobaric chamber study are among the lowest ever reported during acute hypoxia.","Ottestad, William; Hansen, Tor Are; Pradhan, Gaurav; Stepanek, Jan; Høiseth, Lars Øivind; Kåsin, Jan Ivar",Journal of applied physiology,71,17

By the end of February 2021, more than 100 million SARS-CoV-2 cases had been reported worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be divided into three phases: An early phase with fever and cough (phase I), a pulmonary vascular disease (phase II) and a hyperinflammatory syndrome (phase III). Since viral replication plays a particularly important role in the early stage of the disease and the patient's immune system in the later course of infection, different therapeutic options arise depending on the stage of the disease. The antiviral nucleoside analogue remdesivir is the only antiviral compound with conditional approval in the European Union. Treatment with remdesivir should be initiated early (within the first seven days of symptom onset) in patients receiving supplemental oxygen without invasive ventilation. In turn, the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone should be administered later in the course of disease in patients receiving oxygen therapy. Since autopsies indicate an increased frequency of thromboembolic events due to COVID-19, additional treatment with anticoagulants is recommended. Since the development of novel antivirals may take years, the application of convalescent plasma from patients who recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection for the treatment of COVID-19 is reasonable. However, large-scale studies indicated low efficacy of convalescent plasma. Furthermore, vaccination of the population is essential to control the pandemic. Currently, the mRNA vaccine Tozinameran from BioNTech and Pfizer, the mRNA-1273 vaccine from Moderna as well as the vector vaccine AZD1222 from AstraZeneca are licensed in the European Union. All three vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy in large clinical trials. In addition to these licensed vaccines, many others are being tested in clinical trials. In the present article, an overview of therapeutic options for COVID-19 as well as vaccines for protection against SARS-CoV-2 is provided.","Bormann, Maren; van de Sand, Lukas; Witzke, Oliver; Krawczyk, Adalbert",Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,71,1

Opium produced sleep, pain relief, and addiction. Once a variety of opioids had been extracted from opium, and still others synthesized chemically, it became clear that there must be endogenous receptors to explain differential drug effects. So, the search was on to identify the receptors, and subsequently their endogenous ligands. Even then, the consequential ways in which the endogenous opioid system influences the way we respond to the environment and survive took time to unravel. Today's understanding extends far beyond simply accepting pain relief and addiction as separate processes, to the realization that the endogenous opioid system achieves constant adjustments between punishment (pain) and reward in communicating areas of the brain previously thought to subserve separate functions. The system also plays a crucial role in socialization. Taken together, these 2 lines of research have led to new insights into why the endogenous opioid system is so important in terms of evolution, individual survival and day-to-day function, and how important it is to consider opioid medications within the context of these critical natural functions.","Ballantyne, Jane C; Sullivan, Mark D",Pain,71,16

Workflows combining optical or fluorescent data with electron microscopic images are complex, hence there is a need to communicate detailed protocols and share tips & tricks for successful application of these methods. With the development of volume-EM techniques such as serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) and Focussed Ion Beam-SEM, correlation in three dimensions has become more efficient. Volume electron microscopy allows automated acquisition of serial section imaging data that can be reconstructed in three dimensions (3D) to provide a detailed, geometrically accurate view of cellular ultra-structure. In addition, combining volume-EM with high resolution light microscopy (LM) techniques decreases the resolution gap between LM and EM, making retracing of a region of interest and eventual overlays more straightforward. Here, we present a workflow for 3D CLEM on mouse liver, combining high resolution confocal microscopy with SBF-SEM. In this workflow, we have made use of two types of landmarks: (1) near infrared laser branding marks to find back the region imaged in LM in the electron microscope and (2) landmarks present in the tissue but independent of the cell or structure of interest to make overlay images of LM and EM data. Using this approach, we were able to make accurate 3D-CLEM overlays of liver tissue and correlate the fluorescent signal to the ultra-structural detail provided by the electron microscope. This workflow can be adapted for other dense cellular tissues and thus act as a guide for other three-dimensional correlative studies. This article is protected by copyright.

It has been shown to significantly alleviate anxiety and improve patient satisfaction. In this study, we aimed to compare music therapy to a control (no music) group with respect to sedation requirements, anxiety levels, and patient satisfaction for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia. Methods In this randomized controlled study, we compared the effect of music therapy in patients ≥ 18 years old. Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were screened for the study to rule out any contraindications for spinal anesthesia. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio for either the ""music"" or ""control"" group. Both groups were compared for sedation requirements, preoperative and postoperative anxiety levels, and patient satisfaction. Results Subjects in the music group had a statistically significant lower than average State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-State baseline score as compared to the control group (music group 31.00 (standard deviation (SD) 1.44), control group 38.04 (SD 2.35); p = 0.01). Postoperative STAI-State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)-State scores for the music group were lower for the music group than the control group (music group 28.34 (SD 1.64), control group 32.21 (SD 1.56), p= 0.09). STAI-Trait scores were similar pre-operatively, but significantly less post-operatively in the music group (28.14 SD 1.0) as compared to the control group (34.71 SD 2.31); p = 0.01. Propofol dose per kilogram per surgical minute was similar between the two groups (music group 0.05, control group 0.06; p= 0.264). Patient satisfaction scores with their perioperative experience were higher in the music group (p= 0.009). Conclusions Music therapy may be offered as an alternative to traditional anxiolytics intra-operatively. However further studies are warranted to evaluate whether or not music therapy can decrease sedation and anxiolytic medications during surgery. The type and mode of delivery of music also need to be studied to better understand the impact of music therapy.

The diagnosis and treatment of COPD is the responsibility of the general practitioner (GP); the GP also serves as gatekeeper, referring patients to the other levels of public health care system when necessary. Undertreatment of COPD can result in a greater frequency of exacerbations and hospitalizations. Elderly patients require special attention due to the increased prevalence of COPD and systemic comorbidities. However, both the occurrence of exacerbations and the quality of life of the patients may be improved by developing and implementing guidelines for practice and ensuring their adherence. This proposal concerns the development of a checklist-based educational program to assist general practitioners in managing COPD patients. METHODS No less than eighty-four general clinics in the Lodz region, Poland (28 clusters in each of three study arms), will be identified, randomized, and included in the trial. The trial will be based on anonymized data in electronic health records within the national public health care system. The educational intervention program will consist of GPs in two intervention arms being provided with a COPD management checklist: those in the first intervention arm with receive the checklist once at the beginning, while those in the second with receive it twice. The third (control) arm receives standard care without the checklist. The study used the International Code of Diseases (ICD)-10 for COPD. The primary aim is to determine the effect of interventions delivered to general practitioners (GPs) in primary health care. These interventions are aimed at decreasing the hospitalization of elderly patients with medical code J-44 (COPD) as the main reason for hospital admission.

This study evaluated the appearance and management of chylous ascites following lymphadenectomy for gynecological malignancies. METHODS A total of 931 patients who underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecological malignancies at Erlangen University Hospital between 2002 and 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS Chylous ascites occurred postoperatively in 28 of the 931 patients (3.0%). All patients with chylous ascites had undergone combined systematic para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy (SAPL). Patients with chylous ascites had a larger mean number of lymph nodes removed (51.9 vs. 40.0, P = 0.002) and the proportion of laparoscopic SAPLs was significantly higher (20/28; 71.4%) in comparison with open surgery (8/28; 28.6%) (P < 0.0001). Additional parameters, such as the number of positive lymph nodes, were not significantly associated with the occurrence of chylous ascites. Conservative management was sufficient to resolve chylous ascites in all observed cases, with a mean time to resolution of 8 days. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative chylous ascites was more frequently observed in patients with laparoscopic SAPL in comparison with open SAPL and was strongly associated with a larger mean number of removed lymph nodes.

Many challenges have occurred in the attempt to produce a successful immunogen, mainly caused by the basic biology of the virus. Immunogens have been developed focusing on inducing one or more of the following types of immune responses; neutralizing antibodies, non-neutralizing antibodies, and T-cell mediated responses. One way to better present and develop an immunogen for HIV-1 is through the use of nanotechnology and nanoparticles.Areas covered: This article gives a basic overview of the HIV-1 vaccine field, as well as nanotechnology, specifically nanovaccines. It then covers the application of nanovaccines made from biological macromolecules to HIV-1 vaccine development for neutralizing antibodies, non-neutralizing antibodies, and T-cell-mediated responses.Expert opinion: Nanovaccines are an area that is ripe for further exploration in HIV-1 vaccine field. Not only are nanovaccines capable of carrying and presenting antigens in native-like conformations, but they have also repeatedly been shown to increase immunogenicity over recombinant antigens alone.

RECENT FINDINGS An upsurge in wild poliovirus type 1 cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan and an expansion of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus transmission in multiple countries threaten the remarkable progress made over past several decades by the global eradication program. These challenges have also spurred innovation on multiple fronts, including earlier detection, enhanced environmental surveillance and safer and more affordable vaccine options. SUMMARY A concerted effort to adapt program strategies to address context-specific challenges and continued focus on innovations to enhance detection and response capabilities will be the key to achieve and sustain eradication of all types of polioviruses.","Bandyopadhyay, Ananda S; Macklin, Grace R",Current opinion in infectious diseases,71,17

Here, we review recent insights into the functions of non-coding regulatory elements and their protein interactors during transcription control. A picture emerges in which the topological environment constraints enhancer-promoter interactions and specific enhancer-bound proteins with distinct promoter-compatibilities refine target promoter choice. Such compatibilities are encoded within the sequences of enhancers and promoters and realized by diverse transcription factors and cofactors with distinct biochemical activities. An emerging property of transcription factors and cofactors is the formation of nuclear microenvironments or membraneless compartments that can have properties of phase-separated liquids. These environments are able to selectively enrich certain proteins and small molecules over others. Further investigation into the interaction of transcriptional regulators with themselves and regulatory DNA elements will help reveal the complexities of gene regulation within the context of the nucleus.","Serebreni, Leonid; Stark, Alexander",Current opinion in cell biology,71,1

Areas covered: In this review, the authors put together current understanding of the neuropathogenesis of EV-A71 based on various clinical, human and animal model studies. The authors discuss the important advancements in virus entry, virus dissemination and neuroinvasion. The authors highlight the role of host immune system, host genetic factors, viral quasispecies and heparan sulfate in EV-A71 neuropathogenesis.Expert opinion: Comparison of EV-A71 with EV-D68 and PV shows similarity in primary target sites and dissemination to the central nervous system. More research is needed to understand cellular tropisms, persistence of EV-A71 and other possible invasion routes. EV-A71 infection has varied clinical manifestations which may be attributed to multiple receptors usage. Future development of antivirals and vaccines should target neurotropic enteroviruses. Repurposing drug and immunomodulators used in combination could reduce the severity of EV-A71 infection. Only a few drugs have been tested in clinical trials, and in the absence of antiviral and vaccines (in most parts of the world), active virus surveillance, good hand hygiene and physical distancing should be advocated. A better understanding of EV-A71 neuropathogenesis is critical for antiviral and multivalent vaccines development.","Tee, Han Kang; Zainol, Mohd Izwan; Sam, I-Ching; Chan, Yoke Fun",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,71,17

However, whether predictors of weight loss differ between men and women is, to our knowledge, unknown. We therefore aimed to investigate baseline predictors for overall weight loss and identify potential sex-specific baseline predictors in bariatric surgery patients. METHODS In this prospective cohort study, 160 patients (117 women and 43 men) who underwent sleeve gastrectomy were followed up for 2 years. Weight loss was defined as percent excess body mass index loss (%EBMIL). To investigate whether %EBMIL differed between men and women, we included all two-way interactions with sex by incorporating the product term sex and predictors using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS The overall mean ± standard deviation of %EBMIL after 2 years was 78.3 ± 23.5. Predictors for lower %EBMIL in a regression model with no interactions were female sex (P = 0.003), higher body mass index before surgery (P = 0.001), and nonsmoking (P = 0.029). When examining sex-specific predictors for %EBMIL, higher age (P = 0.027) and not having diabetes (P = 0.007) predicted lower %EBMIL in men. In women, unemployment (P = 0.006) and anxiety and/or depression (P = 0.009) predicted lower %EBMIL. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that weight loss and predictors for weight loss 2 years after sleeve gastrectomy are sex-specific. These findings may be useful for the surgical strategy used to treat these patients.","Andersen, John Roger; Aadland, Eivind; Nilsen, Roy Miodini; Våge, Villy",Obesity surgery,71,17

However, there have been no screening tools developed to identify individuals who may be suffering from dysfunctional grief during the pandemic. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the properties of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS), which is a brief mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional grief associated with a COVID-19 death. This 5-item scale, which was based on 831 adults who lost someone to COVID-19, demonstrated solid reliability (αs = 0.86), factorial validity (PCA and CFA support), and construct validity with strong correlations with suicidal ideation and substance use coping. The PGS measures COVID-19 grief equivalently across demographic groups, and discriminates well between persons with and without dysfunctional grief using an optimized cut score of ≥ 7 (87% sensitivity and 71% specificity). An alarming 66% of the sample scored in the clinical range. The PGS also demonstrates incremental validity by explaining 18% additional variance in functional impairment due to a COVID-19 loss beyond measures of depression and generalized anxiety. These results support the PGS as an efficient and valid screening tool for clinical research and practice during a pandemic.","Lee, Sherman A; Neimeyer, Robert A",Death studies,71,1

Near-infrared (NIR) laparoscopy in conjunction with indocyanine green (ICG) allows for visualization of the microcirculation before formation of the anastomosis, thereby allowing the surgeon to choose the point of transection at an optimally perfused area. METHODS This is a retrospective case-control analysis examining the effectiveness of NIR + ICG in reducing the rate of AL after low anterior resection (LAR) for rectal cancer. Records of patients undergoing robot-assisted LAR for rectal cancer with and without ICG were analyzed for the years 2011 and 2012. RESULTS Among the 40 patients who underwent robotic LAR, NIR + ICG was used in 16 cases (41 %). Male patients accounted for the majority of cases in both groups (74 %). The median level of the anastomosis was 3.5 cm in the NIR + ICG group and 5.5 cm in the control group. There was no difference in the use of diverting ileostomy. In 3 patients (19 %), the use of NIR + ICG resulted in revision of the proximal bowel (colonic) transection point before formation of the anastomosis. The distal transection point was never revised. The rate of AL in the NIR + ICG group was 6 % versus 18 % in control group. CONCLUSIONS ICG fluorescence may play a role in anastomotic tissue perfusion assessment and affect the AL rate. Larger prospective studies are needed to further validate this novel technology.","Jafari, Mehraneh D; Lee, Kang Hong; Halabi, Wissam J; Mills, Steven D; Carmichael, Joseph C; Stamos, Michael J; Pigazzi, Alessio",Surgical endoscopy,71,1

Over the past decade, there has been a proliferation of hearing devices that connect wirelessly to smartphone technologies via Bluetooth.

Here, we demonstrated that gut microbiome modulation attenuated emphysema development. To modulate the gut microbiome, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and diet modification were adopted in mice exposed to smoking and poly I:C for the emphysema model. We analyzed the severity of emphysema by the mean linear intercept (MLI) and apoptosis by the fluorescent TUNEL assay. Microbiome analysis was also performed in feces and fecal extracellular vesicles (EVs). The MLI was significantly increased with smoking exposure. FMT or a high-fiber diet (HFD) attenuated the increase. Weight loss, combined with smoking exposure, was not noted in mice with FMT. HFD significantly decreased macrophages and lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Furthermore, IL-6 and IFN-γ were decreased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum. The TUNEL score was significantly lower in mice with FMT or HFD, suggesting decreased cell apoptosis. In the microbiome analysis, Bacteroidaceae and Lachnospiraceae, which are alleged to metabolize fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), increased at the family level with FMT and HFD. FMT and HFD attenuated emphysema development via local and systemic inhibition of inflammation and changes in gut microbiota composition, which could provide a new paradigm in COPD treatment.","Jang, Yoon Ok; Lee, Se Hee; Choi, Jong Jin; Kim, Do-Hyun; Choi, Je-Min; Kang, Min-Jong; Oh, Yeon-Mok; Park, Young-Jun; Shin, Yong; Lee, Sei Won",Experimental & molecular medicine,71,29

Incontinence and care dependence threatens patient dignity. The aim of this research was to explore, describe and explain the concept of dignity as it relates to continence care for older people requiring long-term care. METHODS The first four steps of Rodgers evolutionary method of concept analysis were followed. First, a comprehensive and systematic search of databases and key guidelines about continence care was undertaken to identify empirical research about dignity and continence care in older people in facilities that provide permanent residential or inpatient care of older people for day-to-day living. Data were extracted on the authors, date, sample, country of origin, and key definitions, attributes, contexts and consequences from each included record. Findings were inductively analysed and grouped according to whether they were the key attributes and antecedents of dignity in relation to continence care or the consequences of undignified continence care. RESULTS Of 625 articles identified, 18 were included in the final analysis. Fifty individual attributes were identified that were categorised in 6 domains (respect, empathy, trust, privacy, autonomy and communication). A further 15 were identified that related to the environment (6 physical and 9 social). Key consequences of undignified continence care were also identified and categorised into 3 levels of impact (resident/family member, staff or organisation). CONCLUSIONS This research resulted in a conceptual understanding of dignity that can be used as a value or guiding principle in an ethic of care for older people who need assistance with toileting, incontinence or bladder or bowel care in long-term care settings.","Ostaszkiewicz, Joan; Dickson-Swift, Virginia; Hutchinson, Alison; Wagg, Adrian",BMC geriatrics,71,1

To fill this gap, we introduce a novel indicator of governance quality based on the ideal of informed support, and examine national differences on this measure through a quantitative survey of OP policy informedness and preferences in seven European countries. METHODS Between 2017-2019, we conducted a convenience sample survey of students (n = 2006) in Austria (AT), Belgium (BE), Denmark (DK), Germany (DE), Greece (GR), Slovenia (SI) and Spain (ES), asking participants about their donation preferences, as well as their beliefs and views about the policy in place. From these measures, we computed indices of informedness, policy support, and fulfilment of unexpressed preferences, which we compared across countries and consent systems. RESULTS Our study introduces a tool for analyzing policy governance in the context of OP. Wide variation in policy awareness was observed: Most respondents in DK, DE, AT and BE correctly identified the policy in place, while those in SI, GR and ES did not. Respondents in opt-out countries (AT, BE, ES and GR) tended to support the policy in place (with one exception, i.e., SI), whereas those in opt-in countries (DE and DK) overwhelmingly opposed it. These results reveal stark differences in governance quality across countries and consent policies: We found a preponderance of informed opposition in opt-in countries and a general tendency towards support-either informed or uninformed-in opt-out countries. We also found informed divergence in opt-in countries and a tendency for convergence-either informed or uninformed-among opt-out countries. CONCLUSION Our study offers a novel tool for analyzing governance quality and illustrates, in the context of OP, how the strengths and weaknesses of different policy implementations can be estimated and compared using quantitative survey data.","Rodríguez-Arias, David; Molina-Pérez, Alberto; Hannikainen, Ivar R; Delgado, Janet; Söchtig, Benjamin; Wöhlke, Sabine; Schicktanz, Silke",PloS one,71,16

It has been increasingly used in neurodevelopmental disorders, especially attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but its efficacy (based on effect size calculations), safety, and stimulation parameters have not been systematically examined. In this systematic review, we aimed to (1) explore the effectiveness of tDCS on the clinical symptoms and neuropsychological deficits of ADHD patients, (2) evaluate the safety of tDCS application, especially in children with ADHD, (3) model the electrical field intensity in the target regions based on the commonly-applied and effective versus less-effective protocols, and (4) discuss and propose advanced tDCS parameters. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses approach, a literature search identified 14 empirical experiments investigating tDCS effects in ADHD. Partial improving effects of tDCS on cognitive deficits (response inhibition, working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility) or clinical symptoms (e.g., impulsivity and inattention) are reported in 10 studies. No serious adverse effects are reported in 747 sessions of tDCS. The left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are the regions most often targeted, and anodal tDCS the protocol most often applied. An intensity of 2 mA induced stronger electrical fields than 1 mA in adults with ADHD and was associated with significant behavioral changes. In ADHD children, however, the electrical field induced by 1 mA, which is likely larger than the electrical field induced by 1 mA in adults due to the smaller head size of children, was sufficient to result in significant behavioral change. Overall, tDCS seems to be a promising method for improving ADHD deficits. However, the clinical utility of tDCS in ADHD cannot yet be concluded and requires further systematic investigation in larger sample sizes. Cortical regions involved in ADHD pathophysiology, stimulation parameters (e.g. intensity, duration, polarity, and electrode size), and types of symptom/deficit are potential determinants of tDCS efficacy in ADHD. Developmental aspects of tDCS in childhood ADHD should be considered as well.","Salehinejad, Mohammad Ali; Nejati, Vahid; Mosayebi-Samani, Mohsen; Mohammadi, Ali; Wischnewski, Miles; Kuo, Min-Fang; Avenanti, Alessio; Vicario, Carmelo M; Nitsche, Michael A",Neuroscience bulletin,71,31

It is important to note, however, that more than 50% of these prescriptions are unnecessary or inappropriate. AREAS COVERED The current choice of antimicrobial therapy for etiological agents of LRTIs is examined and discussed considering each type of LRTI. EXPERT OPINION There is a clear need for the appropriate utilization of antibiotics in children. Therefore, accurate drug selection and choice of best dosage and duration of the antibacterial treatment are important to optimize the treatment of LRTIs. It's fundamental to bear in mind that children differ from adults in how LRTIs manifest and evolve not only because of the diversity in the immunological profiles but also the fundamental age-related differences in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of drugs. Since comprehensive antibiotic guideline recommendations for the treatment of pediatric LRTIs are generally lacking, there is an undeniable need for the introduction of pediatric antimicrobial stewardship programmes in both community and hospital settings.","Matera, Maria Gabriella; Rogliani, Paola; Ora, Josuel; Cazzola, Mario",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,71,17

Thus, controlling colorectal cancer in Japan is a major concern. In 2006, colon capsule endoscopy was first introduced by Eliakim et al. First-generation colon capsule endoscopy had a moderate sensitivity for detecting polyps of more than 6 mm. Thus, second-generation colon capsule endoscopy was developed to achieve higher sensitivity. Colonoscopy is the gold standard tool for colorectal cancer surveillance. With an improvement in the imaging function, the performance of second-generation colon capsule endoscopy is almost as satisfactory as that of colonoscopy. Certain situations, such as incomplete colonoscopy and contraindication for use of sedation, can benefit from colon capsule endoscopy. Colon capsule endoscopy requires a more extensive bowel preparation than colonoscopy and computed tomography colonography because it requires laxatives not only for bowel cleansing but also for promoting the excretion of the capsule. Another problem with colon capsule endoscopy includes the burden of reading and interpretation and overlook of the lesions. Currently, the development of automatic diagnosis of colon capsule endoscopy using artificial intelligence is still under progress. Although the available guidelines do not support the use of colon capsule endoscopy for inflammatory bowel disease, the possible application of colon capsule endoscopy is ulcerative colitis. This review article summarizes and focuses on the current status of colon capsule endoscopy for colorectal cancer screening and the possibility for its applicability on inflammatory bowel disease.","Hosoe, Naoki; Limpias Kamiya, Kenji Jl; Hayashi, Yukie; Sujino, Tomohisa; Ogata, Haruhiko; Kanai, Takanori",Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society,71,11

Conflicting and limited data exist regarding the value of assessing thrombus properties in acute stroke cases treated with endovascular IA approaches. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed cases of anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke in which a Solitaire stent retriever (ev3-Covidien) was the primary treatment device. We measured the following thrombus characteristics: absolute and corrected HU values; thrombus length and volume; clot burden score; and vessel bifurcation involvement. Fisher's exact test and the t test were used to study the association between these clot characteristics and successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score 2b-3). RESULTS We identified 41 patients with anterior circulation stroke treated with the Solitaire stent retriever as the primary treatment device. Successful recanalization (TICI score 2b-3) was achieved in 59% of cases. Higher absolute and corrected HU values were strongly predictive of successful recanalization (49.9±7.6 vs 43.8±6.6, p=0.01 for absolute HU values and 1.2±0.2 vs 1.0±0.1, p=0.03 for HU ratio in TICI 2b-3 and TICI 0-2a groups, respectively). There was no significant difference between recanalization and non-recanalization groups in the other thrombus characteristics studied. CONCLUSIONS In acute stroke treated with Solitaire stent retriever thrombectomy, higher thrombus HU values are predictive of successful recanalization.

We present a patient who underwent bariatric surgery, prior to child bearing, and suffered maternal and foetal complications during eleven pregnancies, possibly associated with vitamin A deficiency, amongst multiple micronutrient deficiencies and risk factors including smoking and obesity. Maternal complications included visual disturbance, night blindness and recurrent infections. Recurrent foetal pulmonary hypoplasia and microphthalmia led to foetal and neonatal loss, not previously described in the medical literature. Current guidance on vitamin A deficiency in pregnancy is focused on developing countries where aetiology of vitamin A deficiency is different to that of women in developed countries. We describe nutritional management of the micronutritient deficiencies, focusing on vitamin A, during her last pregnancy. The need for specific antenatal nutritional guidance for pregnant women post-bariatric surgery is becoming more urgent as more mothers and offspring will be affected.","Mackie, Fiona L; Cooper, Nicola S; Whitticase, Louise J; Smith, Amanda; Martin, William L; Cooper, Sheldon C",European journal of clinical nutrition,71,1

DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients presenting to a university teaching hospital for investigation of coronary artery disease. Radiation doses for each technique were calculated using computational Monte Carlo modelling of a standard Cristy phantom rather than the application of previously published conversion factors. While these have frequently been used in other studies, they are based on out-dated ICRP tissue weightings (ICRP 60) and are for the whole chest rather than for structures irradiated in cardiac imaging. In order to allow a comparison, doses were calculated and expressed in terms of effective dose in millisieverts (mSv). RESULTS From a population presenting for angiography within a clinical service, the median radiation dose from cardiac CT with standard filtered back-projection (84 patients, 5.4 mSv) was comparable with the dose from invasive diagnostic coronary angiography (94 patients, 6.3 mSv). The dose for cardiac CT using iterative reconstruction was significantly lower (39 patients, 2.5 mSv). CONCLUSION The median effective dose from cardiac CT with standard filtered back-projection was comparable with the effective dose from invasive coronary angiography, even with application of the most contemporary ICRP tissue weightings and use of cardiac specific volumes. Cardiac CT scanning incorporating iterative reconstruction resulted in a significant reduction in the effective dose.","Gosling, O; Loader, R; Venables, P; Roobottom, C; Rowles, N; Bellenger, N; Morgan-Hughes, G",Heart,71,1

We have previously established that axolotl salamanders can fully repair large articular cartilage lesions, which may be due to the presence of an interzone-like tissue in the intra-articular space. Study objectives were to further characterize axolotl diarthrodial joint structure and determine the differentiation potential of interzone-like tissue in a skeletal microenvironment. DESIGN Diarthrodial joint morphology and expression of aggrecan, brother of CDO (BOC), type I collagen, type II collagen, and growth/differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) were examined in femorotibial joints of sexually mature (>12 months) axolotls. Joint tissue cellularity was evaluated in individuals from 2 to 24 months of age. Chondrogenic potential of the interzone was evaluated by placing interzone-like tissue into 4 mm tibial defects. RESULTS Cavitation reached completion in the femoroacetabular and humeroradial joints, but an interzone-like tissue was retained in the intra-articular space of distal limb joints. Joint tissue cellularity decreased to 7 months of age and then remained stable. Gene expression patterns of joint markers are broadly similar in developing mammals and mature axolotls. When interzone-like tissue was transplanted into critical size skeletal defects, an accessory joint developed within the defect site. CONCLUSIONS These experiments indicate that mature axolotl diarthrodial joints are phenotypically similar to developing synovial joints in mammals. Generation of an accessory joint by interzone-like tissue suggests multipotent cellular differentiation potential similar to that of interzone cells in the mammalian fetus. The data support the axolotl as a novel vertebrate model for joint development and repair.","Cosden-Decker, R S; Bickett, M M; Lattermann, C; MacLeod, J N",Osteoarthritis and cartilage,71,1

Results of clinical trials, with three-year event-free and overall survival as primary outcomes, often take 7 to 10 years. Identification of an early surrogate biomarker, predictive for survival, is therefore crucial. We conducted a systematic review to define the prognostic value of early tumor size response in children with IRSG group III rhabdomyosarcoma. The search included MEDLINE/EMBASE from inception to 18 November 2020. In total, six studies were included, describing 2010 patients, and assessed by the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) instrument. Four studies found no prognostic value for tumor size response, whereas two studies reported a prognostic effect. In these two studies, the survival rate of patients with progressive disease was not separately analyzed from patients with stable disease, potentially explaining the difference in study outcome. In conclusion, our findings support that early progression of disease is associated with poorer survival, justifying adaptation of therapy. However, in patients with non-progressive disease, there is no evidence that the degree of response is a prognostic marker for survival. Because the vast majority of patients do not have progressive disease, early tumor size response should be reconsidered for assessment of treatment efficacy. Therefore, at present, early surrogate biomarkers for survival are still lacking.","van Ewijk, Roelof; Vaarwerk, Bas; Breunis, Willemijn B; Schoot, Reineke A; Ter Horst, Simone A J; van Rijn, Rick R; van der Lee, Johanna H; Merks, Johannes H M",Cancers,71,33

We evaluated the improvement of flap survival and changes in angiogenic gene expression profiles after transfer of the VEGF gene by means of adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) vector to rat ischemic flaps. Thirty rats were divided into one experimental group, one AAV2-GFP group, and one saline group. AAV2-VEGF or AAV2-GFP were injected intradermally into the rat dorsum in the AAV2-VEGF or AAV2-GFP group. The saline group received saline injection. A 3 × 10 cm flap was raised in each rat two weeks post-injection. One week after surgery, flap viability was evaluated. Angiogenesis real-time PCR array was performed to analyze the expression of angiogenesis-associated genes. The AAV2-VEGF treatment significantly improved flap survival (p<0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed increased VEGF expression in AAV2-VEGF treated flaps. The PCR array identified remarkable changes in 6 out of the 84 angiogenesis-associated genes in AAV2-VEGF treated flaps. Particularly, EGF, PDGF-A and VEGF-B genes were up-regulated in these flaps. In contrast, FGF2 gene expression was down-regulated. In conclusion, AAV2-VEGF improves flap survival and affects the expression of a series of endogenous growth factor genes, which likely play critical roles in the enhancement of ischemic flap survival.","Wang, Xiao Tian; Avanessian, Bella; Ma, Qiangzhong; Durfee, Heather; Tang, Yu Qing; Liu, Paul Y",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,71,12

METHODS We retrospectively compared the results of a transperitoneal approach with those of a retroperitoneal approach in 22 patients (mean age 57.5 years, range 38-76 years) with unilateral large pheochromocytomas (12 right, 10 left). The mean body mass index, operation time, pneumoperitoneum time, estimated blood loss, fluctuation in blood pressure and complication rate were compared between the two approaches. RESULTS The mean tumor diameter (range) was 7.0 cm (range 5.2-15.5 cm), and no significant differences were observed between the transperitoneal approach and retroperitoneal approach in any baseline clinical parameter. For right-sided procedures, significant differences were found for operation time (113 vs 85 min), pneumoperitoneum time (93 vs 64 min) and estimated blood loss (96 vs 23 mL; P < 0.05, transperitoneal approach and retroperitoneal approach, respectively). No open conversion or recurrence was reported, but one right transperitoneal approach case required blood transfusion. No difference in these parameters was noted on the left side. CONCLUSIONS For right side procedures, the retroperitoneal approach is feasible, safer and faster than the transperitoneal approach for large pheochromocytomas.

In clinical studies of TSPO, the ligand total distribution volume, VT, is frequently the reported outcome measure. Since VT is the sum of the ligand specific (VS) and non-displaceable binding (VND), differences in VND across subjects and groups will have an impact on VT. Methods: Here, we used a recently developed method for simultaneous estimation of VND (SIME) to disentangle contributions from VND and VS. Data from four previously published 11C-PBR28 PET studies were included: (i) before and after a lipopolysaccharide challenge (8 subjects), (ii) in alcohol use disorder (14 patients, 15 controls), (iii) in first-episode psychosis (16 patients, 16 controls), and (iv) in Parkinson's disease (16 patients, 16 controls). In each dataset, regional VT estimates were obtained with a standard two-tissue compartment model, and brain-wide VND was estimated with SIME. VS was then calculated as VT-VND. VND and VS were then compared across groups, within each dataset. Results: A lower VND was found for individuals with alcohol use disorder (34%, P = 0.00084) and Parkinson's disease (34%, P = 0.0032), when compared to their corresponding controls. We found no difference in VND between first-episode psychosis patients and their controls, and the administration of lipopolysaccharide did not change VND.

This virus is endemic in many countries and has very recently spread to China, but no licensed vaccines or treatments are currently available. Despite extensive research, the basic question of how ASFV-encoded proteins inhibit host translation remains. Here, we examined how ASFV interfered with host translation and optimized viral gene expression. We found that 14 ASFV proteins inhibited Renilla luciferase (Rluc) activity greater than 5-fold, and the protein with the strongest inhibitory effect was pE66L, which was not previously reported. Combined with bioinformatical analysis and biochemical experiment, we determined that the transmembrane (TM) domain (amino acids 13-34) of pE66L was required for the inhibition of host gene expression. Notably, we constructed a recombinant plasmid with the TM domain linked to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and further demonstrated that this domain broadly inhibited protein synthesis. Confocal and biochemical analyses indicated that the TM domain might help proteins locate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to suppress translation though the PKR/eIF2α pathway. Deletion of the E66L gene had little effect on virus replication in macrophages, but significantly recovered host gene expression. Taken together, our findings complement studies on the host translation of ASFV proteins and suggest that ASFV pE66L induces host translation shutoff, which is dependent on activation of the PKR/eIF2α pathway.Importance African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a member of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus superfamily that predominantly replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The ASFV double-stranded DNA genome varies in length from approximately 170 to 193 kbp depending on the isolate and contains between 150 and 167 open reading frames (ORFs), of which half the encoded proteins have not been explored. Our study showed that 14 proteins had an obvious inhibitory effect on Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene synthesis, with pE66L showing the most significant effect. Furthermore, the transmembrane (TM) domain of pE66L broadly inhibited host protein synthesis in a PKR/eIF2a pathway-dependent manner. Loss of pE66L during ASFV infection had little effect on virus replication, but significantly recovered host protein synthetic. Based on the above results, our findings expand our view of ASFV in determining the fate of host-pathogen interactions.","Shen, Zhou; Chen, Chen; Yang, Yilin; Xie, Zhenhua; Ao, Qingying; Lv, Lu; Zhang, Shoufeng; Chen, Huanchun; Hu, Rongliang; Chen, Hongjun; Peng, Guiqing",Journal of virology,71,31

The objective of this study was to evaluate obesity-related morbidity after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) according to whether patients were aged≥60 years or<60 years. METHODS Forty-two patients aged≥60 years (the elderly group) were matched 1:2 with 84 patients aged<60 (the control group). The primary objective was to compare weight change and the remission rate of co-morbidities in the 2 groups after 24 months of follow-up. The secondary endpoints were short-term and midterm postoperative outcomes (operating time, the frequency of conversion to laparotomy, the length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, mortality, and the SG failure rate). RESULTS No significant differences were observed between the elderly and control groups in terms of the mean operating time (83 minutes in both groups; P = .90), length of stay (3.2 versus 3.4 days, respectively; P = .51), morbidity rate (4.7% versus 9.5%, P = .35), or mortality rate (0% in both groups). The mean excess weight loss was significantly lower in the elderly group than in the control group at 12 months (56.2% versus 71.4%, respectively; P<.01) and 24 months (51.8% versus 73.5%, P<.01). Similar statistically significant differences were observed between the elderly group and control group for remission of metabolic syndrome (95% versus 90%, respectively; P = .55), type 2 diabetes mellitus (87% versus 71%, respectively; P = .13), hypertension (81% versus 77%, respectively; P = .71), and dyslipidemia (94% versus 74%, respectively; P = .09) at 24 months after SG.

This study aimed to determine the antioxidant and anti-α-glucosidase activities of eight selected underutilized plants in Malaysia: Leucaena leucocephala, Muntingia calabura, Spondias dulcis, Annona squamosa, Ardisia elliptica, Cynometra cauliflora, Ficus auriculata, and Averrhoa bilimbi. This study showed that the 70% ethanolic extract of all plants exhibited total phenolic content (TPC) ranging from 51 to 344 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g dry weight. A. elliptica showed strong 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and nitric oxide (NO) scavenging activities, with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 2.17 and 49.43 μg/mL, respectively. Most of the tested plant extracts showed higher inhibition of α-glucosidase enzyme activity than the standard, quercetin, particularly A. elliptica, F. auriculata, and M. calabura extracts with IC50 values of 0.29, 0.36, and 0.51 μg/mL, respectively. A total of 62 metabolites including flavonoids, triterpenoids, benzoquinones, and fatty acids were tentatively identified in the most active plant, i.e., A. elliptica leaf extract, by using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-electrospray ionization (ESI) Orbitrap MS.

These reactions are the first steps of N-linked glycan processing and are essential for proper folding and function of many glycoproteins. Because most of the viral envelope glycoproteins contain N-linked glycans, inhibition of ER glucosidases with derivatives of 1-deoxynojirimycin, i.e., iminosugars, efficiently disrupts the morphogenesis of a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses. However, like viral envelope proteins, the cellular receptors of many viruses are also glycoproteins. It is therefore possible that inhibition of ER glucosidases not only compromises virion production but also disrupts expression and function of viral receptors and thus inhibits virus entry into host cells. Indeed, we demonstrate here that iminosugar treatment altered the N-linked glycan structure of angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which did not affect its expression on the cell surface or its binding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike glycoprotein. However, alteration of N-linked glycans of ACE2 impaired its ability to support the transduction of SARS-CoV and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) spike glycoprotein-pseudotyped lentiviral particles by disruption of the viral envelope protein-triggered membrane fusion. Hence, in addition to reducing the production of infectious virions, inhibition of ER glucosidases also impairs the entry of selected viruses via a post-receptor-binding mechanism.","Zhao, Xuesen; Guo, Fang; Comunale, Mary Ann; Mehta, Anand; Sehgal, Mohit; Jain, Pooja; Cuconati, Andrea; Lin, Hanxin; Block, Timothy M; Chang, Jinhong; Guo, Ju-Tao",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,71,11

In this extraordinary research context of the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, publishers are announcing that their coronavirus-related articles will be made immediately accessible in appropriate open repositories, like PubMed Central, agreeing upon funders' and researchers' instigation. Methods: This work uses Unpaywall, OpenRefine and PubMed to analyse the level of openness of articles about COVID-19, published during the first quarter of 2020. It also analyses Open Access (OA) articles published about previous coronavirus (SARS CoV-1 and MERS CoV) as a means of comparison. Results: A total of 5,611 COVID-19-related articles were analysed from PubMed. This is a much higher amount for a period of 4 months compared to those found for SARS CoV-1 and MERS during the first year of their first outbreaks (335 and 116 articles, respectively). Regarding the levels of openness, 88.8% of the SARS CoV-2 papers are freely available; similar rates were found for the other coronaviruses. Deeper analysis showed that (i) 67.4% of articles belong to an undefined Bronze category; (ii) 76.4% of all OA papers don't carry any license, followed by 10.4% which display restricted licensing. These patterns were found to be repeated in the three most frequent publishers: Elsevier, Springer and Wiley. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, although scientific production is much higher than during previous epidemics and is open, there is a caveat to this opening, characterized by the absence of fundamental elements and values ​​on which Open Science is based, such as licensing.","Arrizabalaga, Olatz; Otaegui, David; Vergara, Itziar; Arrizabalaga, Julio; Méndez, Eva",F1000Research,71,1

We surveyed faculty about their experience during the early weeks of adapting to these new instructional techniques. METHODS An anonymous quantitative and qualitative survey was distributed to all individuals registered by programs as Physician Assistant Education Association members. RESULTS The survey response rate was 22.3% (667/2991) with 32% of program directors (PD), and 23.7% of faculty reporting they had taught online synchronous content prior to COVID-19 adaptations. Prior experience with technology was associated with significantly lower levels of faculty stress during the pivot to online instruction. A majority of the respondents felt educational quality had remained consistent despite the transition to online teaching, and a majority of both faculty and program directors anticipate only minor changes to program structure once they are able to return to traditional classroom learning. Concerns about technology were most commonly cited as stressors and as causes of decreased quality of instruction. CONCLUSION Educational challenges and stress during the pandemic were most prominently associated with unfamiliar technology. It remains to be seen what changes persist when the pandemic subsides.","Neary, Stephanie; Van Rhee, James; Roman, Christopher",The journal of physician assistant education : the official journal of the Physician Assistant Education Association,71,16

Upon optimizing the model parameters in the learning phase of the analysis using actual infection data from a period of the first 30 days, we then find that the model output closely tracks the actual data for the next 15 days. Next, we introduce a control input into the model to represent the Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention of social distancing. Implementing the control using two distinct schemes, we find that in both cases the control input is able to significantly mitigate the infection spread. In addition to opening a novel pathway towards the characterization, analysis and implementation of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions across multiple geographical scales using Control frameworks, our results highlight the importance of first-principles based PDE models in understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of epidemics triggered by novel pathogens.","Majid, Faray; Gray, Michael; Deshpande, Aditya M; Ramakrishnan, Subramanian; Kumar, Manish; Ehrlich, Shelley",ISA transactions,71,1

Following institutional review board approval, we performed a retrospective comparison study in patients with suspected PE. Patients were scanned using an ultra high pitch dual source technique (pitch = 2.6) using 120 kV (SVCTPA) (n = 54) or 100 kV (RV-CTPA) (n = 52). SV-CTPA images were reconstructed using filtered back projection (SV-wFBP) and RV-CTPA images were reconstructed using both FBP (RV-wFBP) and Iterative Reconstruction (RV-IR). Comparison of radiation dose, diagnostic ability, subjective image noise, quality, and sharpness, diagnostic agreement, signal to noise (SNR) and contrast to noise ratios (CNR) were performed. Mean effective dose was 2.56 ± 0.19 mSv for the RV protocol compared to 5.36 ± 0.60 mSv for the SV. The RV-CTPA protocol resulted in a mean DLP reduction of 52 % and mean CTDI reduction of 51 %. Pulmonary artery SNR and CNR were significantly higher on RV-IR images than SV-wFBP (p = 0.007, p = 0.003). Mean subjective image noise, quality and sharpness scores did not differ significantly between the SV-wFBP and RVIR images (p > 0.05). Subjective quality scores were significantly better for the RV-IR group compared to the RV-wFBP group (p < 0.001). Agreement between readers for presence or absence of pulmonary emboli on RV-IR images was almost perfect (κ = 0.891, p < 0.001). Iterative reconstruction complements ultra high pitch dual source CTPA examinations acquired using a reduced voltage resulting in higher mean pulmonary artery SNR and CNR when compared to both RV-wFBP and SV-CTPA.","McLaughlin, Patrick D; Liang, T; Homiedan, M; Louis, L J; O'Connell, T W; Krzymyk, Karl; Nicolaou, S; Mayo, J R",Emergency radiology,71,16

We examined the prevalence of depression, distress, and suicidal thoughts and their association with social and economic factors during the state of emergency in a nationwide representative sample of the general population in Latvia. MATERIALS AND METHOD An online survey was conducted using a randomized stratified sample of the general adult population in July 2020 for 3 weeks. Distress, depression, suicidal thoughts, and self-reported changes in mental health were identified using a structured questionnaire. The statistical analysis included chi-square tests, analyses of variance, and multivariate forward-stepwise linear regressions. RESULTS The study sample included 2608 respondents. Clinical depression was present in 5.75% and distress in 7.82%. Suicidal thoughts increased in 13.30% of those with a history of clinical depression, and 27.05% of those with a history of suicidal attempts. The variables that were associated with increases in self-reported anxiety, depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, and being currently depressed/distressed included lower general health, increased fears of contracting COVID-19 or having family members contract it and die, history of suicidality, increased family conflicts, decreased religiosity, caring for a vulnerable person. Protective factors included positive changes in family relationships and economic situation, maintaining one's basic routine, and having more people living in the household. CONCLUSIONS Further research and interventions should focus specifically on these factors. The study's findings can help to develop future strategies for management of psychological support for different groups in general population.","Vrublevska, Jelena; Sibalova, Anna; Aleskere, Ilana; Rezgale, Baiba; Smirnova, Daria; Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Rancans, Elmars",Nordic journal of psychiatry,71,16

METHODS An anonymous survey was distributed through email and social media to adult patients with asthma during a three-week period in April-May 2020. A separate survey was sent to physicians. The surveys asked about demographic information, specific challenges and concerns due to COVID-19, and attitudes/behaviors during this time. RESULTS A total of 1171 patients and 225 physicians completed the surveys. Overall, patients with asthma and physicians had large differences in expectations related to COVID-19. Patients were more likely than physicians to believe that individuals with asthma are at a higher risk to get COVID-19 (37.5% vs. 12.0%, p < 0.001), have increased anxiety due to COVID-19 (79.6% vs 70.0%, p = 0.002), and should not go to work (62.7% vs 11.9%, p < 0.001). Neither patients nor physicians felt confident they could distinguish COVID-19 symptoms from asthma (61.2% and 74.5% did not feel confident, respectively). Patients with severe asthma were significantly more impacted by the pandemic (e.g. became unemployed [OR 2.15], had difficulty getting asthma meds [OR 2.37]) compared to those with nonsevere asthma. CONCLUSION Patients with asthma and their physicians have markedly different attitudes and opinions regarding care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such differences have important implications when providing patient-centered care.","Arora, Nonie; Lowe, Desmond; Sarsour, Nadeen; Jaffee, Hannah; Eftekhari, Sanaz; Carpenter, Laurie M; Bansal, Priya; Baptist, Alan P",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,71,1

The purpose of this study was to compare clinical and chest CT findings in patients with influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Thirty patients with diagnosed influenza A (H1N1) virus infection (group A) and 30 patients with diagnosed COVID-19 (group B) were retrospectively enrolled in the present study. The clinical characteristics and chest CT findings of the two groups were compared. RESULTS. Fever, cough, expectoration, and dyspnea were the main symptoms in both groups with viral pneumonia, with cough and expectoration more frequently found in group A. Lymphopenia, an elevated C-reactive protein level, and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate were common laboratory test findings in the two groups. The median time from symptom onset to CT in group A and group B was 6 and 15 days, respectively, and the median total CT score of the pulmonary lobes involved was 6 and 13, respectively. Linear opacification, crazy-paving sign, vascular enlargement, were more common in group B. In contrast, bronchiectasis and pleural effusion were more common in group A. Other common CT features, including peripheral or peribronchovascular distribution, ground-glass opacities (GGOs), consolidation, subpleural line, air bronchogram, and bronchial distortion, did not show statistical significance. CONCLUSION. On CT, the significant differences between influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia and COVID-19 pneumonia were findings of linear opacification, crazy-paving sign, vascular enlargement, pleural thickening, and pleural effusion, which were more common in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and bronchiectasis and pleural effusion, which were more common in patients with influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia. Other imaging findings, including peripheral or peribronchovascular distribution, ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, subpleural line, air bronchogram, and bronchial distortion, were not significantly different between the two patient groups.","Yin, Zhilan; Kang, Zhen; Yang, Danhui; Ding, Shuizi; Luo, Hong; Xiao, Enhua",AJR.

METHODS This 52-week, multicentre, randomized, active-controlled study compared vildagliptin (50 mg b.i.d., n = 295) and pioglitazone (30 mg daily, n = 281) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control [haemoglobin A1c (HbA(1c)) 7.5-11%] receiving a stable dose of metformin (>or=1500 mg). The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of vildagliptin at 24 weeks in the change in HbA(1c) from baseline. The objective of the additional 28 weeks of the study was to assess long-term safety, while also assessing mean change from baseline to study end in HbA(1c), fasting plasma glucose and body weight. RESULTS When added to a stable dose of metformin (mean baseline dose approximately 2 g/day), the non-inferiority of HbA(1c) lowering of vildagliptin to pioglitazone over 24 weeks was established at the non-inferiority margin of 0.3% (between-group difference = 0.1%). During the remaining 28 weeks, comparable HbA(1c) decreases were recorded in both groups. Overall adverse event (AE) rates were similar in both groups, as was the occurrence of peripheral oedema. Hypoglycaemia occurred rarely in both groups. Serious AEs occurred more frequently with pioglitazone group. While mean body weight increased significantly in the pioglitazone group (+2.6 kg) from baseline, there was no significant weight gain with vildagliptin (+0.2 kg). CONCLUSIONS When added to metformin, vildagliptin demonstrates favourable safety and tolerability over 1 year. Vildagliptin provided additional HbA(1c) lowering to that achieved with metformin alone and comparable to that achieved with pioglitazone, with only pioglitazone causing weight gain.","Bolli, G; Dotta, F; Colin, L; Minic, B; Goodman, M","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",71,1

To address this, we piloted 35 medical students at home consulting remotely with patients. METHOD We evaluated the intervention using qualitative analysis of post-experience interviews with a sample of 13 students and 10 clinical supervisors. RESULTS The experience was perceived by all those interviewed to be both acceptable and educationally valuable. Data analysis revealed different models of implementation according to type of patients involved (acute, recently treated or expert patients) and type of communication platform used (AccuRx, Microsoft Teams or telephone). Practical and educational challenges were identified in relation to the following elements of the experience: patients consulting with students remotely, students being remotely supervised and students undertaking patient contact from home. Strategies for addressing these challenges were directly suggested by interviewees and also inferred from our analysis of the data. CONCLUSIONS Remotely supervised medical students at home undertaking remote consultations with patients can be acceptable and educationally valuable. The intervention was piloted in a UK graduate entry medical course and so it would be useful to replicate this study in other medical student populations.","Darnton, Richard; Lopez, Tony; Anil, Megha; Ferdinand, Jonathan; Jenkins, Mark",Medical teacher,71,27

This literature is limited by looking at an arbitrary number of trials and not adjusting for potential confounders. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of gender on the learning curve for a fundamental laparoscopic task. METHODS Thirty-two medical students performed the FLS peg transfer task and their scores were plotted to generate a learning curve. Nonlinear regression was used to estimate learning plateau and learning rate. Variables that may affect performance were assessed using a questionnaire. Innate visual-spatial abilities were evaluated using tests for spatial orientation, spatial scanning, and perceptual abilities. Score on first peg transfer attempt, learning plateau, and learning rate were compared for men and women using Student's t test. Innate abilities were correlated to simulator performance using Pearson's coefficient. Multivariate linear regression was used to investigate the effect of gender on early laparoscopic performance after adjusting for factors found significant on univariate analysis. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. RESULTS Nineteen men and 13 women participated in the study; 30 were right-handed, 12 reported high interest in surgery, and 26 had video game experience. There were no differences between men and women in initial peg transfer score, learning plateau, or learning rate. Initial peg transfer score and learning rate were higher in subjects who reported having a high interest in surgery (P = 0.02, P = 0.03). Initial score also correlated with perceptual ability score (P = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, only surgical interest remained a significant predictor of score on first peg transfer (P = 0.03) and learning rate (P = 0.02), while gender had no significant relationship to early performance. CONCLUSIONS Gender did not affect the learning curve for a fundamental laparoscopic task, while interest in surgery and perceptual abilities did influence early performance.","Kolozsvari, Nicoleta O; Andalib, Amin; Kaneva, Pepa; Cao, Jiguo; Vassiliou, Melina C; Fried, Gerald M; Feldman, Liane S",Surgical endoscopy,71,16

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS We sought to catalogue past and present human research studies on psychiatric neuromodulation and identify relevant trends in this field. METHODS ClinicalTrials.gov (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (https://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) were queried in March 2020 for trials assessing the outcome of neuromodulation for psychiatric disorders. Relevant trials were categorized by variables such as neuromodulation modality, country, brain target, publication status, design, and funding source. RESULTS From 72,086 initial search results, 1252 unique trials were identified. The number of trials registered annually has consistently increased. Half of all trials were active and a quarter had translated to publications. The largest proportion of trials involved depression (45%), schizophrenia (18%), and substance use disorders (14%). Trials spanned 37 countries; China, the second largest contributor (13%) after the United States (28%), has increased its output substantially in recent years. Over 75% of trials involved non-convulsive non-invasive modalities (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation), while convulsive (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy) and invasive modalities (e.g., deep brain stimulation) were less represented. 72% of trials featured approved or cleared interventions. Characteristic inter-modality differences were observed with respect to enrollment size, trial design/phase, and funding. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex accounted for over half of focal neuromodulation trial targets. The proportion of trials examining biological correlates of neuromodulation has increased. CONCLUSION(S) These results provide a comprehensive overview of the state of psychiatric neuromodulation research, revealing the growing scope and internationalism of this field.","Elias, Gavin J B; Boutet, Alexandre; Parmar, Roohie; Wong, Emily H Y; Germann, Jürgen; Loh, Aaron; Paff, Michelle; Pancholi, Aditya; Gwun, Dave; Kin, Clement T Chow B; Gouveia, Flavia Venetucci; Harmsen, Irene E; Beyn, Michelle E; Santarnecchi, Emiliano; Fasano, Alfonso; Blumberger, Daniel M; Kennedy, Sidney H; Lozano, Andres M; Bhat, Venkat",Brain stimulation,71,24

PURPOSE To investigate recent practice changes with respect to the provision of virtual visits by hand therapists due to the COVID-19 pandemic by asking about changes in the frequency of virtual visits, the assessments and treatments currently provided virtually, and the opinions of therapists on the future on virtual visits in hand therapy practice. METHODS The survey was distributed to the American Society of Hand Therapists (ASHT), the Australian Hand Therapy Association (AHTA), the Canadian Society of Hand Therapists (CSHT), and the European Federation for the Societies of Hand Therapy (EFSHT). RESULTS Of the 819 responses, there were 573 therapists (70%) who reported that they currently use virtual visits in their practice. Only 38 therapists (4.6%) were providing virtual visits prior to COVID-19, representing a 15-fold increase in virtual visits since the beginning of the pandemic. Only 26% (n = 213) reported that they used patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) in conjunction with their virtual visits. Approximately 78% (n = 638) said that they thought there is a sustainable future for this method of care in hand therapy practice. DISCUSSION This survey has helped identify the changing landscape in the provision of rehabilitation and established some of the common assessments and interventions currently utilized by hand therapists in the virtual environment. Next, steps for research are to investigate the reliability and validity of some of the assessments and interventions used, to establish whether virtual care will provide good outcomes for patients, and ultimately understand the optimal combination of conventional therapy and virtual care.","Szekeres, Mike; Valdes, Kris",Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists,71,1

One reason for their decline is thought to be a high susceptibility to (infectious) diseases because cheetahs in zoos suffer from high disease-induced mortality. Data on the health status of free-ranging cheetahs are scarce, and little is known about their exposure and susceptibility to infectious diseases. We determined seroprevalences to nine key viruses (feline herpesvirus 1, feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus, canine distemper virus, feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV], puma lentivirus, feline leukemia virus, and rabies virus) in 68 free-ranging cheetahs on east-central Namibian farmland, 24 nonvaccinated Namibian captive cheetahs, and several other wild carnivore species and conducted necropsies of cheetahs and other wild carnivores. Eight of 11 other wild carnivores were seropositive for at least one of the viruses, including the first record of an FIV-like infection in a wild felid west of the Kalahari, the caracal (Felis caracal). Seroprevalences of the free-ranging cheetahs were below 5% for all nine viruses, which is significantly lower than seroprevalences in nonvaccinated captive cheetahs and those for five of seven viruses in previously studied free-ranging cheetahs from north-central Namibia (L. Munson, L. Marker, E. Dubovi, J. A. Spencer, J. F. Evermann, and S. J. O'Brien, J. Wildl. Dis. 40:23-31, 2004). There was no clinical or pathological evidence of infectious diseases in living or dead cheetahs. The results suggest that while free-ranging wild carnivores may be a source of pathogens, the distribution of seroprevalences across studies mirrored local human population density and factors associated with human habitation, probably reflecting contact opportunities with (nonvaccinated) domestic and feral cats and dogs. They also suggest that Namibian cheetahs respond effectively to viral challenges, encouraging consistent and sustainable conservation efforts.","Thalwitzer, Susanne; Wachter, Bettina; Robert, Nadia; Wibbelt, Gudrun; Müller, Thomas; Lonzer, Johann; Meli, Marina L; Bay, Gert; Hofer, Heribert; Lutz, Hans",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,71,1

The stay-athome period was proposed to protect against the pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home period on body structures and functions, activity and participation levels, and environmental factors of children with cerebral palsy (CP) from the parental perspective in Turkey. METHODS A twenty-question survey, using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth set to understand the functional changes of children with CP during the stay-athome period, was sent to parents in this prospective study. Motor function levels of children were determined by the Gross Motor Function Classification System parent report. The structural equation model was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS One hundred and three parents of children with CP participated. At least one of four children with CP had increased levels of anxiety (41.8%), and increased level of a sensation of pain (34%) and sleep problems (25.2%). More than half of the children had increased tonus (67%), decreased range of motion (60.2%), decreased physical activity level (55.3%), and decreased support level of rehabilitation services (82.6%). During the stayat- home period activity and participation levels and environmental factors of children explained the changes of body functions as 70% and 33% (RMSEA=0.077, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This study is the first study to examine the functional health of children with CP biopsychosocially during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period. According to the parents, the functional health of children with CP was affected at different levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Body functions may also be affected positively if physical activity level, home program and environmental supports increase.","Bıyık, Kübra Seyhan; Özal, Cemil; Tunçdemir, Merve; Üneş, Sefa; Delioğlu, Kıvanç; Günel, Mintaze Kerem",The Turkish journal of pediatrics,71,17

Since the initial description of the cancer, just over 300 cases have been reported. EMCs occupy a biphasic cellular differentiation-state defined by the constitution of two cell types representing epithelial and myoepithelial lineages, yet the functional consequence of the differentiation-state heterogeneity with respect to therapy resistance of the tumors remains unclear. The reported local recurrence rate of the cases is approximately 30%, and while distant metastases are rare, a significant fraction of these cases are reported to receive no survival benefit from radio- or chemotherapy given in addition to surgery. Moreover, no targeted therapies have been reported for these neoplasms. We report here the first use and application of ex vivo drug screening together with next generation sequencing to assess targeted treatment strategies for a rare metastatic epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma. Results of the ex vivo drug screen demonstrate significant differential therapeutic sensitivity between the epithelial and myoepithelial intra-tumor cell lineages suggesting that differentiation-state heterogeneity within epithelial-myoepithelial carcinomas may present an outlet to partial therapeutic responses to targeted therapies including MEK and mTOR inhibitors.

The pandemic has motivated attempts to increase robustness of supply chains through diversification away from excessive dependence on China and into Southeast and South Asia, in an incremental rather than revolutionary way;no wholesale departure from manufacturing in China is anticipated. For most countries, the most efficient response is to continue to rely on international trade and global production networks, while addressing the strategic concerns through improved emergency-preparedness stockpiles.

Although the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has weakened China's financial and economic capacities in sustaining and expanding its BRI projects, it is unlikely that China will give up the BRI under Xi Jinping's leadership. This, however, creates an opportunity for the Quad countries to weigh in on the future BRI in the post-COVID era. These Quad countries could consider employing an 'inclusive institutional balancing' strategy to constrain, change, and shape China's BRI behaviour from the inside.

Efforts to control such infections typically focus on the practice of strict contact-avoidance measures. Yet, contact rates and their relation to transmission, and the impact of control measures, are seldom quantified. Here, we quantify the response of contact rates, transmission and new cases of COVID-19 to public health contact-restriction orders, and the associations among these three variables, in the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC) and within its two most densely populated regional health authorities: Fraser Health Authority (FHA) and Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (VCHA). We obtained time series for self-reported close-contact rates from the BC Mix COVID-19 Survey, new reported cases of COVID-19 from the BC Center for Disease Control, and transmission rates based on dynamic model fits to reported cases. Our study period was from September 13, 2020 to February 19, 2021, during which three public health contact-restriction orders were introduced (October 26, November 7 and November 19, 2020). We used segmented linear regression to quantify impacts of public health orders, Pearson correlation to assess the instantaneous relation between contact rates and transmission, and vector autoregressive modeling to study the lagged relations among the three variables. Overall, declines in contact rates and transmission occurred concurrently with the announcement of public health orders, whereas declines in new cases showed a reporting delay of roughly two weeks. The impact of the first public health order (October 26, 2020) on contact rates and transmission was more pronounced than that of the other two health orders. Contact rates and transmission on the same day were strongly correlated (correlation coefficients = 0.64, 0.53 and 0.34 for BC, FHA, and VCHA, respectively). Moreover, contact rates were a significant time-series driver of COVID-19 and explained roughly 30% and 18% of the variation in new cases and transmission, respectively. Interestingly, increases in transmission and new cases were followed by reduced rates of contact: overall, average daily cases explained about 10% of the variation in provincial contact rates. We show that close-contact rates were a significant driver of transmission of COVID-19 in British Columbia, Canada and that they varied in response to public health orders. Our results also suggest a possible feedback, by which contact rates respond to recent changes in reported cases. Our findings help to explain and validate the commonly assumed, but rarely measured, response of close contact rates to public health guidelines and their impact on the dynamics of infectious diseases.","Ringa, N.; Otterstatter, M.

In this study, we focus on type I interferon (IFN) signaling in human epithelial cells and combine microfluidics, time-lapse microscopy, and computational modeling to investigate how the IFN-responsive regulatory network operates in single cells to process repetitive IFN stimulation. We found that IFN-α pretreatments lead to opposite effects, priming versus desensitization, depending on the input durations. These effects are governed by a regulatory network composed of a fast-acting positive feedback loop and a delayed negative feedback loop, mediated by upregulation of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18). We further revealed that USP18 upregulation can only be initiated at the G1 and early S phases of cell cycle upon the treatment onset, resulting in heterogeneous and delayed induction kinetics in single cells. This cell cycle gating provides a temporal compartmentalization of feedback control processes, enabling duration-dependent desensitization to repetitive stimulations. Moreover, our results, highlighting the importance of IFN dynamics, may suggest time-based strategies for enhancing the effectiveness of IFN pretreatment in clinical applications against viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.","Mudla, Anusorn; Jiang, Yanfei; Arimoto, Kei-ichiro; Xu, Bingxian; Rajesh, Adarsh; Ryan, Andy P; Wang, Wei; Daugherty, Matthew D; Zhang, Dong-Er; Hao, Nan",bioRxiv,71,13

Previous studies showed that engineered heterozygous NRXN1 deletions impaired neurotransmitter release in human neurons, suggesting a synaptic pathophysiological mechanism. Utilizing this observation for drug discovery, however, requires confidence in its robustness and validity. Here, we describe a multi-center effort to test the generality of this pivotal observation, using independent analyses at two laboratories of patient-derived and newly engineered human neurons with heterozygous NRXN1 deletions. We show that in neurons that were trans-differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from three NRXN1-deletion patients, the same impairment in neurotransmitter release was observed as in engineered NRXN1-deficient neurons. This impairment manifested as a decrease in spontaneous synaptic events and in evoked synaptic responses, and an alteration in synaptic paired-pulse depression. Nrxn1-deficient mouse neurons generated from embryonic stem cells by the same method as human neurons did not exhibit impaired neurotransmitter release, suggesting a human-specific phenotype. NRXN1 deletions produced a reproducible increase in the levels of CASK, an intracellular NRXN1-binding protein, and were associated with characteristic gene expression changes. Thus, heterozygous NRXN1 deletions robustly impair synaptic function in human neurons regardless of genetic background, enabling future drug discovery efforts.","Pak, ChangHui; Danko, Tamas; Mirabella, Vincent R.; Wang, Jinzhao; Zhang, Xianglong; Ward, Thomas; Grieder, Sarah; Vangipuram, Madhuri; Huang, Yu-Wen Alvin; Liu, Yingfei; Jin, Kang; Dexheimer, Philip; Bardes, Eric; Mittelpunkt, Alexis; Ma, Junyi; McLachlan, Michael; Moore, Jennifer C.; Urban, Alexander E.; Dage, Jeffrey L.; Swanson, Bradley J.; Aronow, Bruce J.; Pang, Zhiping P.; Levinson, Douglas F.; Wernig, Marius; Südhof, Thomas C.",bioRxiv,71,33

Here, we develop the paninvasion severity assessment framework and use it to assess a rapidly spreading regional US grape pest, the spotted lanternfly planthopper (Lycorma delicatula; SLF), to spread and disrupt the global wine market. We found that SLF invasion potentials are aligned globally because important viticultural regions with suitable environments for SLF establishment also heavily trade with invaded US states.

We aim to test if: i) star cluster formation proceeds according to universal physical processes, suggestive of a common formation mechanism for young-massive clusters (YMCs), intermediate-age clusters (IACs), and ancient globular clusters (GCs); ii) massive clusters of all ages trace a continuous AMR; iii) the AMRs of smaller mass galaxies show a shallower relation when compared to more massive galaxies. Our results show that, within the uncertainties, the predicted AMRs of L/SMC-mass galaxies with similar star formation histories to the L/SMC follow the same relation as observations. We also find that the metallicity at which the AMR saturates increases with galaxy mass, which is also found for the field star AMRs. This suggests that relatively low-metallicity clusters can still form in dwarfs galaxies. Given our results, we suggest that ancient GCs share their formation mechanism with IACs and YMCs, in which GCs are the result of a universal process of star cluster formation during the early episodes of star formation in their host galaxies.","Horta, Danny; Hughes, Meghan E.; Pfeffer, Joel L.; Bastian, Nate; Kruijssen, J.

The resulting heat damage the cutting tool, causes in high power consumption, shorter tool life and poor surface quality. Therefore, it is important to choose a latest cooling technique with excellent capacity to remove heat, chips and frictional effects from the cutting zone. Therefore, Carbon dioxide snow (CO2-snow) and hybrid copper oxide (CuO)-multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanofluids based minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) are compared to achieve clean cooling/lubrication technique to machine biomedical/aerospace material Ti-6Al-4V. Taguchi L9 orthogonal array was applied to design the experiments. Critical machining parameters are cutting speed (m/min), feed (mm/rev), and cooling mode. The output responses are surface quality Ra (μm), cutting power Pc (W), cutting temperature T (oC), and tool life TL (min) were evaluated under CO2-snow and MQL-hybrid nanofluids. Findings have revealed less surface roughness and longer tool life under hybrid nanofluids. While CO2-snow has justified less temperature and power consumption at high cutting conditions.","Jamil, Muhammad; He, Ning; Li, Liang; Khan, Aqib Mashood",Procedia Manufacturing,71,24

Items specific to COVID-19 stressors assessed the types of stressors each parent faced. The sample consisted of 236 North American mothers, mostly white (n = 187, 79.2%) and aged 30–50 years. The surveyed mothers reported a consistent and significant relation between more positive coparenting and less COVID-19-related stressors whether parents were living together or not, married or divorced, and with a lower or higher income level, suggesting the importance and centrality of positive coparenting as a key factor for family well-being.

However, despite many efforts, it has been proven very difficult to find additional EM counterparts to the many LIGO/Virgo compact binary merger candidates since then. We explore the sensitivity of ongoing optical surveys searching for kNe and propose ways to optimize the choices of filters and survey depth to boost the detection efficiency for these faint and fast-evolving transients. In particular, we use kN models to explore the dependence on ejecta mass, geometry, viewing angle, wavelength coverage and source distance. Considering that the O3 LIGO/Virgo binary neutron star merger candidates were at distances about 5 times further than GW170817, we find that efficient $gri$ counterpart search would require reaching a limiting magnitude $m_{\rm lim}=$ 23 mag, given the model phase-space. We conclude that kN searches during O3 were generally too shallow to observe optical counterparts, even under optimistic assumptions, thus providing a plausible explanation for the lack of detections.","Carracedo, A.

We developed the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA); a 5-minute, language independent computerised cognitive test that employs an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to improve its accuracy in detecting cognitive impairment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the generalisability of the ICA in detecting cognitive impairment in MCI and mild AD patients. METHODS We studied the ICA in a total of 230 participants. 95 healthy volunteers, 80 MCI, and 55 participants with mild AD completed the ICA, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (ACE) cognitive tests. RESULTS The ICA demonstrated convergent validity with MoCA (Pearson r = 0.58, p<0.0001) and ACE (r = 0.62, p<0.0001). The ICA AI model was able to detect cognitive impairment with an AUC of 81% for MCI patients, and 88% for mild AD patients. The AI model demonstrated improved performance with increased training data and showed generalisability in performance from one population to another. The ICA correlation of 0.17 (p=0.01) with education years is considerably smaller than that of MoCA (r=0.34, p<0.0001) and ACE (r=0.41, p<0.0001) which displayed significant correlations. In a separate study the ICA demonstrated no significant practice effect observed over the duration of the study. DISCUSSION The ICA can support clinicians by aiding accurate diagnosis of MCI and AD and is appropriate for large-scale screening of cognitive impairment. The ICA is unbiased by differences in language, culture and education.","Modarres, Hadi; Kalafatis, Chris; Apostolou, Panos; Marefat, Haniye; Khanbagi, Mahdiyeh; Karimi, Hamed; Vahabi, Zahra; Aarsland, Dag; Khaligh-Razavi, Seyed-Mahdi",bioRxiv,71,4

While several studies have evaluated vaping effects on the lungs and heart; effects on the gastrointestinal tract remain unknown. Using established murine models of acute (1 week) and chronic (3 month) daily e-cigarette aerosol inhalation, both with nicotine-containing and vehicle control e-liquids, murine colon transcriptomics and organoid co-culture models, we assessed the effects of e-cigarette use on the gut barrier and mucosal health. Histologic analyses revealed that chronic exposure to nicotine-free e-cigarette aerosols induced mucosal inflammation. Transcriptome analyses revealed that chronic, but not acute, nicotine-free e-cigarette use significantly reduced expression of tight junction markers, including occluding, and drove expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Exposure of murine and human enteroid-derived monolayers (EDMs) to nicotine-free e-cigarette aerosols alone, or in co-culture with invasive E. coli, confirmed that repetitive exposure was sufficient to recapitulate the key findings observed in vivo, i.e., barrier-disruption, downregulation of occludin, inflammation, and an accentuated risk of and response to bacterial infection. These data highlight an unexpected harmful effect of e-cigarette use on the gut barrier and pinpoint non-nicotine chemical components common across >90% of e-cigarette e-liquids as the source of harm. Given the ever-expanding importance of the integrity of the gut barrier for host fitness, and impact of gut mucosal inflammation on a multitude of chronic diseases, these findings are broadly relevant to medicine and public health. SIGNIFICANCE The safety of electronic cigarettes has been questioned amidst emerging evidence that they may derail our immune system and increase our susceptibility to infections. Despite these insights, their impact on the most critical entity that separates trillions of microbes from the largest immune system in our body, i.e., the gut barrier, remains unexplored. Using a combination of mouse models, gut transcriptomics, and murine and human gut-derived organoids, here we show that chronic exposure to aerosols of electronic-cigarette disrupts the gut barrier, increases its susceptibility to bacterial infections and triggers inflammation. Given the importance of the gut barrier in the maintenance of immune homeostasis, these findings provide valuable insights into the potential long-term harmful effects of electronic cigarettes on health.","Sharma, Aditi; Lee, Jasper; Fonseca, Ayden G.; Moshensky, Alex; Kothari, Taha; Sayed, Ibrahim M.; Ibeawuchi, Stella-Rita; Pranadinata, Rama F.; Ear, Jason; Sahoo, Debashis; Crotty-Alexander, Laura E.; Ghosh, Pradipta; Das, Soumita",bioRxiv,71,1

Since mutations on single-stranded viral RNA are heavily shaped by host factors, the viral mutation signatures can in turn inform the host. By comparing publically available viral genomes we here inferred the mutations SARS-CoV-2 accumulated before the outbreak and after the split from RaTG13. We found the mutation spectrum of SARS-CoV-2, which measures the relative rates of 12 mutation types, is 99.9% identical to that of RaTG13. It is also similar to that of two other bat coronaviruses but distinct from that evolved in non-bat hosts. The viral mutation spectrum informed the activities of a variety of mutation-associated host factors, which were found almost identical between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, a pattern difficult to create in laboratory. All the findings are robust after replacing RaTG13 with RshSTT182, another coronavirus found in horseshoe bats with ∼93% similarity to SARS-CoV-2.

We begin by analyzing the vector model dynamics and by determining the offspring reproductive number denoted by N as well as the trivial and nontrivial equilibria. Using theory of cooperative systems and the general theory of Lyapunov, we prove that, although there is a possibility that the trivial equilibrium coexists with a positive equilibrium, it remains globally asymptotically stable whenever N≤1. The fact that the non-trivial equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable permits us to reduce the study of the full model to the study of a reduced model whenever N&gt;1. Thus, we analyze the reduced model by computing the basic reproduction number R0, equilibrium points as well as asymptotic stability of each equilibrium point. We also explore the nature of the bifurcation for the disease-free equilibrium from R0=1. By the application of the centre manifold theory, we prove that the backward bifurcation phenomenon can occur in our model, which means that the necessary condition R0&lt;1 is not sufficient to guarantee the final extinction of the disease in human populations. To calibrate our model, we estimate model parameters on clinical data from the last Chikungunya epidemic which occurred in Chad, using the non-linear least-square method. We find out that R0=1.8519, which means that we are in an endemic state since R0&gt;1. To determine model parameters that are responsible for disease spread in the human community, we perform sensitivity analysis (SA) using a global method. It follows that the density-dependent death rate of mosquitoes and the average number of mosquito bites are key parameters in the disease dynamics. Following this, we thus formulate an optimal control model by including in the autonomous model, four time-dependent control functions to fight the disease spread. Pontryagin’s maximum principle is used to characterize our optimal controls. Numerical simulations, using parameter values of Chikungunya transmission dynamics, and efficiency analysis, are conducted to determine the better control strategy which guaranteed the final extinction of the disease in human populations.","Abboubakar, Hamadjam Kouchéré Guidzavaï Albert Yangla Joseph Damakoa Irépran Mouangue Ruben","Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals",71,1

The FINLAY-FR-1 group reported more adverse events than the other two groups. After the third dose, anti-RBD seroconversion was 100%, 94.4% and 90% for the FINLAY-FR-1, FINLAY-FR-1A-50 and FINLAY-FR-1A-25 respectively. The in-vitro inhibition of RBD:hACE2 interaction increased after the second dose in all formulations. The geometric mean neutralizing titres after the third dose rose significantly in the group vaccinated with FINLAY-FR-1 with respect to the other formulations and the COVID-19 Convalescent Serum Panel. No differences were found between FINLAY-FR-1 homologous or heterologous schedules. Conclusions Vaccine candidates were safe and immunogenic, and induced live-virus neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The highest values were obtained when outer membrane vesicles were used as adjuvant.","Perez-Rodriguez, S.; Rodriguez-Gonzalez, M. d. l. C.; Ochoa-Azze, R.; Climent-Ruiz, Y.; Gonzalez-Delgado, C.

However, the regulation of the NF90-SGs pathway remain largely unclear. We found that Tim-3, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of NF90 and inhibits NF90-SGs mediated antiviral immunity. Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) infection induces the up-regulation and activation of Tim-3 in macrophages which in turn recruited the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM47 to the zinc finger domain of NF90 and initiated a proteasome-dependent degradation of the NF90 via K48-linked ubiquitination at Lys297. Targeted inactivation of the Tim-3 enhances the NF90 downstream SGs formation by selectively increasing the phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2a, the expression of SGs markers G3BP1 and TIA-1, and protected mice from lethal VSV challenge. These findings provide insights into the crosstalk between Tim-3 and other receptors in antiviral innate immunity and its related clinical significance.","Dou, Shuaijie; Li, Guoxian; Li, Ge; Hou, Chunmei; Zheng, Yang; Tang, Lili; Gao, Yang; Mo, Rongliang; Li, Yuxiang; Wang, Renxi; Shen, Beifen; Zhang, Jun; Han, Gencheng",bioRxiv,71,29

In multimedia analysis, domain adaptation studies the problem of cross-domain knowledge transfer from a label rich source domain to a label scarce target domain, thus potentially alleviates the annotation requirement for deep learning models. However, we find that contemporary domain adaptation methods for cross-domain image understanding perform poorly when source domain is noisy. Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation (WSDA) studies the domain adaptation problem under the scenario where source data can be noisy. Prior methods on WSDA remove noisy source data and align the marginal distribution across domains without considering the fine-grained semantic structure in the embedding space, which have the problem of class misalignment, e.g., features of cats in the target domain might be mapped near features of dogs in the source domain. In this paper, we propose a novel method, termed Noise Tolerant Domain Adaptation, for WSDA. Specifically, we adopt the cluster assumption and learn cluster discriminatively with class prototypes in the embedding space. We propose to leverage the location information of the data points in the embedding space and model the location information with a Gaussian mixture model to identify noisy source data. We then design a network which incorporates the Gaussian mixture noise model as a sub-module for unsupervised noise removal and propose a novel cluster-level adversarial adaptation method which aligns unlabeled target data with the less noisy class prototypes for mapping the semantic structure across domains. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method on both general images and medical images from COVID-19 and e-commerce datasets. The results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art WSDA methods.","Zhu, Lei; Luo, Zhaojing; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Meihui; Chen, Gang; Zheng, Kaiping",,71,1

The portable ventilator ensures adequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide clearance while avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Oxygen is delivered through the compression of a bag valve (Ambu bag) using a moving strap. Carbon dioxide is cleared through the control of a pinch valve actuated by a low-torque servomotor. The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is controlled by an adjustable mechanical valve of the system. An Arduino Mega microcontroller board is used in this prototype to control the respiratory variables. All mechanical components as well as sensors, actuators, and control hardware are of common use in robotics and are very inexpensive. The total cost of the prototype built in this work is about $425 U.S. dollars. The design is meant to be replicated and utilized in emergency conditions that involve an overwhelming number of cases, such as COVID-19 treatment, in places with no access to commercial mechanical ventilation (MV) technologies. In order to account for variations in the prototype as built, the software developed for this portable MV applies an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) strategy. This control strategy is presented as a universal control structure for any mechanical ventilator able to supply air flow with controlled pressure and volume.","Arcos-Legarda, J.; Tovar, A.",Journal of Medical Devices-Transactions of the Asme,71,24

Methods We conducted a systematic review. Databases including PubMed, Web of Science, WHO COVID-19 database, and CNKI were searched on 23 July 2021. International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) was also searched to collect ongoing trials. We included published researches or ongoing clinical trials related to the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in children or adolescents (aged [≤]18 years). Meta-analysis was performed if the consistency of the included studies was high. If not, descriptive analyses were performed. Results Eight published studies with 2851 children or adolescents and 28 ongoing clinical trials were included. Among eight published studies, two (25.0%) were RCTs, two (25.0%) case series, and four (50.0%) case reports. The results showed selected COVID-19 vaccines had a good safety profile in children and adolescents. Injection site pain, fatigue, headache, and chest pain were the most common adverse events. Some studies reported a few cases of myocarditis and pericarditis. Two RCTs showed that the immune response to BNT162b2 in adolescents aged 12-15 years was non-inferior to that in young people aged 16-25 years, while a stronger immune response was detected with 3g CoronaVac injection. Only one single RCT showed the efficacy of BNT162b2 was 100% (95% CI: 75.3 to 100). Of the 28 ongoing clinical trials, twenty-three are interventional studies. Fifteen countries are conducting interventional clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents. Among them, China (10, 43.5%) and United Stated (9, 39.1%) were the top two countries with the most trials. BNT162b2 was the most common vaccine, which is under testing. Conclusion Some of the COVID-19 vaccines have potential protective effects in children and adolescents, but awareness is needed to monitor possible adverse effects after injection. Clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine in children and adolescents with long follow-up, large sample size, and different vaccines are still urgently needed.","Lv, M.; Luo, X.; Shen, Q.; Lei, R.; Liu, X.; Liu, E.; Li, Q.; Chen, Y.",,71,1

High-throughput quantification of small-molecules in bio-samples, i.e. metabolomics, is steadily gaining popularity, as it is highly informative for various phenotypical characteristics. Here we aim to leverage metabolomics to impute missing data in clinical variables routinely assessed in large epidemiological and clinical studies. To this end, we have employed ~25,000 1H-NMR metabolomics samples from 28 Dutch cohorts collected within the BBMRI-NL consortium, to create 19 metabolomics-based predictors for clinical variables, including diabetes status (AUC5-Fold CV = 0.94) and lipid medication usage (AUC5-Fold CV = 0.90). Subsequent application in independent cohorts confirmed that our metabolomics-based predictors can indeed be used to impute a wide array of missing clinical variables from a single metabolomics data resource. In addition, application highlighted the potential use of our predictors to explore the effects of totally unobserved confounders in omics association studies. Finally, we show that our predictors can be used to explore risk factor profiles contributing to mortality in older participants. To conclude, we provide 1H-NMR metabolomics-based models to impute clinical variables routinely assessed in epidemiological studies and illustrate their merit in scenarios when phenotypic variables are partially incomplete or totally unobserved.","Bizzarri, D.; Reinders, M.

Genetic testing often reveals variants of uncertain significance (VUS), for which association with disease risk is unclear. The ambiguity of this finding creates a dilemma for patients and providers and has been associated with significant communication error and distress. In this retrospective observational study, we seek to characterize the indications, outcomes, and trends in patients undergoing genetic testing in a community hospital in Cambridge, MA. As our study spanned the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also assessed its impact on care accessibility. Methods: We included patients undergoing genetic testing at our hospital between December 2019 and October 2020 (n=371). Medical charts were abstracted to identify patient characteristics, family history, indication for genetic testing, genetic findings, and subsequent management. Results: Our population had a mean age of 48 years (SD=15), was predominantly female (88.1%), and had a high proportion of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (15.3%). The vast majority (351, 94.6%) had a family history of cancer, while 123 (33.2%) had a personal history of cancer, most commonly breast (n=89). The most common indications for genetic testing were Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC in 280, 75%), Lynch Syndrome (LS in 22, 5.9%), and Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP in 7, 2%). Of patients who met HBOC, LS, or FAP criteria for genetic testing, pathogenic mutations were identified in 9.5% and VUS in 28.6%. Out of total 35 (9.4%) pathogenic mutations found in our entire study population, the most common were in BRCA (9, 25.7%), MUTYH (5, 14.2%), and Lynch genes (3, 8.6%). Out of 103 patients with VUS (27.8%), the most common sites were APC (14) and MSH3 (9). We found no significant trend in genetic counseling consultations over our 11 months study period despite the COVID-19 pandemic (R = 0.006). Conclusions: Among patients who met criteria for genetic cancer screening at a community hospital, 9.5% were found to have a pathogenic mutation while 28.6% were found to have VUS. These numbers are comparable to previously published estimates. Despite advances in our understanding of genetic colon and gynecological cancers, the majority of patients presenting for genetic cancer counseling continue to do so due to breast cancer concerns.

Vitamin D influences in-vitro gene expression and cancer cell growth. We sought to determine whether oral vitamin D induces beneficial gene expression effects in human rectal epithelium and identify biomarkers of response. Methods Blood and rectal mucosa was sampled from 191 human subjects and mucosa gene expression (HT12) correlated with plasma vitamin D (25-OHD) to identify differentially expressed genes. Fifty subjects were then administered 3200IU/day oral vitamin D3 and matched blood/mucosa resampled after 12 weeks. Transcriptomic changes (HT12/RNAseq) after supplementation were tested against the prioritised genes for gene-set and GO-process enrichment. To identify blood biomarkers of mucosal response, we derived receiver-operator curves and C-statistic (AUC) and tested biomarker reproducibility in an independent Supplementation Trial (BEST-D). Results 629 genes were associated with 25-OHD level (P<0.01), highlighting 453 GO-term processes (FDR<0.05). In the whole intervention cohort, vitamin D supplementation enriched the prioritised mucosal gene-set (upregulated gene-set P<1.0E-07; downregulated gene-set P<2.6E-05) and corresponding GO terms (P=2.90E-02), highlighting gene expression patterns consistent with anti-tumour effects. However, only 9 individual participants (18%) showed a significant response (NM gene-set enrichment P<0.001) to supplementation. Expression changes in HIPK2 and PPP1CC expression served as blood biomarkers of mucosal transcriptomic response (AUC=0.84 [95%CI:0.66-1.00]), and replicated in BEST-D trial subjects (HIPK2 AUC=0.83 [95%CI:0.77-0.89]; PPP1CC AUC=0.91 [95%CI:0.86-0.95]). Conclusions Higher plasma 25-OHD correlates with rectal mucosa gene expression patterns consistent with anti-tumour effects and this beneficial signature is induced by short-term vitamin D supplementation. Heterogenous gene expression responses to vitamin D may limit the ability of randomised trials to identify beneficial effects of supplementation on CRC risk. However, in the current study blood expression changes in HIPK2 and PPP1CC identify those participants with significant anti-tumor transcriptomic responses to supplementation in the rectum. These data provide compelling rationale for a trial of vitamin D and CRC prevention using easily assayed blood gene expression signatures as intermediate biomarkers of response.","Vaughan-Shaw, P.

Impact network analysis (INA) is a new framework for evaluating the likely success of regional interventions before, during, and after projects, for project implementers, policy makers, and funders. INA integrates across three key system components in a multilayer network analysis: (a) the quality of a management technology and the quality of research supporting it, (b) the socioeconomic networks through which managers learn about management technologies and decide whether to use them, and (c) the linked biophysical network for target species success or failure in the management landscape that results from managers’ decisions. The specific objectives of this paper are (1) to introduce the INA framework and INA R package, (2) to illustrate identification of key nodes for smart surveillance, for networks where the likelihood of invasive species entry into the biophysical network at a given node may be based on information available to the corresponding node in the socioeconomic network, (3) to illustrate application of the INA framework for evaluating the likely degree of success of a project in intervention ecology, before, during and after an intervention, and (4) to illustrate the use of INA for evaluating adaptation strategies under global change scenarios with pulse and press stressors, introducing ‘adaptation functions’ for sustainability and resilience. Examples of use of the INA package show one of the key outcomes of analyses: identifying when systems may be non-responsive to the system components that are readily changed through management decisions, to explore what additional adaptations may be necessary for intervention success. The broader goal for the development of impact network analysis and the INA package is to provide a common framework that integrates across intervention ecology, to enhance opportunities for lessons learned across systems and scientific disciplines, to support the development of a community of practice, and to create a general platform for analysis of sustainability, resilience, and economic viability in intervention ecology applications.","Garrett, K.

As case numbers started to rise, what ensued was government-led interventions similar to those instituted across the world in the form of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, curfews, restrictions on mass gatherings and other physical distancing measures. These measures negatively affected blood donor mobilisation activities. Nigeria, like many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa prior to COVID-19 had encountered challenges with recruiting sufficient voluntary blood donors to meet the huge blood needs in the country, and so dire consequences of these infection prevention measures on national blood supplies were anticipated. A noticeable decline in blood donations and available safely screened blood for transfusions thus followed. We aimed to assess the blood service activities across seventeen (17) National Blood Transfusion Service centres in Nigeria, including numbers of blood donations, mobile blood drives, blood units screened, outcomes of screening, number of hospitals the NBTS provided services to and number of blood units discarded over the study period. Method: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood services in seventeen (17) NBTS centres in Nigeria, comparing the months of January to December 2019 (pre-COVID-19) to the months of January to December 2020 (peri-COVID-19). Results: A 100% decline was observed in mobile blood donation drives in the first two months following government-imposed lockdowns, and numbers of all blood donations and voluntary blood donations declined by 9.8%. An 11.9% decline was also observed in the number of blood units screened;while the number of blood units that screened positive for transfusion-transmissible infections reduced by 28.6%. The number of discarded blood units declined by 3.1%;however, a 32.6% increase was observed in the number of hospitals that accessed blood for transfusion purposes from NBTS. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic affected NBTS operations in Nigeria. However, by strengthening hospital linkages and employing innovative strategies, NBTS ensured continuity of operations, thereby significantly managing the challenges of COVID-19 to voluntary blood donor recruitment and the availability of safe blood for transfusion.","Oreh, A.; Irechukwu, C.; Biyama, F.; Nnabuihe, A.; Ihimekpen, A.; Oshiame, D.; Bozegha, T.; Izedonmwen, O.; Oga, E.; Suberu, E.; Odiabara, K.; Amedu, O.",Transfusion Medicine,71,16

We collected paired longitudinal blood and respiratory tract samples (endotracheal aspirate, sputum or pleural fluid) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 controls. Cellular, humoral and cytokine responses were analysed and correlated with clinical data. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies were detected using ELISA and multiplex assay in both the respiratory tract and blood of COVID-19 patients, although a higher receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgM and IgG seroconversion level was found in respiratory specimens. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity in respiratory samples was detected only when high levels of RBD-specific antibodies were present. Strikingly, cytokine/chemokine levels and profiles greatly differed between respiratory samples and plasma, indicating that inflammation needs to be assessed in respiratory specimens for the accurate assessment of SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology. Diverse immune cell subsets were detected in respiratory samples, albeit dominated by neutrophils. Importantly, we also showed that dexamethasone and/or remdesivir treatment did not affect humoral responses in blood of COVID-19 patients. Overall, our study unveils stark differences in innate and adaptive immune responses between respiratory samples and blood and provides important insights into effect of drug therapy on immune responses in COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, W.; Chua, B.; John Selva, K.; Kedzierski, L.; Ashhurst, T.; Heycraft, E.; Shoffner, S.; Hensen, L.; Boyd, D.; James, F.; Mouhtouris, E.; Kwong, J.

So far, most serosurvey data have been analysed with cut-off based methods, which dichotomize individual measurements into sero-positives or negatives based on a predefined cutoff. However, mixture model methods can gain additional information from the same serosurvey data. Such methods refrain from dichotomizing individual values and instead use the full distribution of the serological measurements from pre-pandemic and COVID-19 controls to estimate the cumulative incidence. This study presents an application of mixture model methods to SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey data from the SEROCoV-POP study from April and May 2020 (2766 individuals). Besides estimating the total cumulative incidence in these data (8.1% (95% CI: 6.8% - 9.8%)), we applied extended mixture model methods to estimate an indirect indicator of disease severity, which is the fraction of cases with a distribution of antibody levels similar to hospitalised COVID-19 patients. This fraction is 51.2% (95% CI: 15.2% - 79.5%) across the full serosurvey, but differs between three age classes: 21.4% (95% CI: 0% - 59.6%) for individuals between 5 and 40 years old, 60.2% (95% CI: 21.5% - 100%) for individuals between 41 and 65 years old and 100% (95% CI: 20.1% - 100%) for individuals between 66 and 90 years old.

We also consider the paradoxes of online teaching, which have made visible the digital gap between local and international Global South students in the context of their stays. In this sense, pre-existing inequalities are more at the centre of students? concerns than new issues raised by COVID-19, a pandemic that served to reveal former injustice in the context of global capitalism. In our conclusion, we argue that there is a need for greater recognition of the vulnerabilities facing certain African and Brazilian students at Global North universities in the context of contemporary neo-liberalism, including their dependence upon precarious work.

The lung contamination is found automatically by chest Computed Tomography images that help to tackle COVID-19. During the separation of the diseased portion from the X-ray slices, it produces lots of demands which include huge difference in the disease attribute and low intensity difference in the middle of infected tissue and usual tissues. The collection of huge quantity of information is impossible in a short period of time and pedagogy of the deep model. For overcoming the Lung disease separation of COVID-19 by using S eg-Net is suggested to analyze the affected portions automatically from chest X-ray scan. Here, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation named as Semantic Network is utilized. S eg-Net segmentation is a core trainable engine that contains an encoder network and also a corresponding decoder network that is continued by a pixel-wise classification layer. The structure of the encoder network is physiographic and it is equal with the 13 convolutional layers in the Visual Geometry Group 16 network. The originality of the semantic network is located in this method of decoder up samples with the lower resolution input map features. Exactly, the pooling was applied by the decoder that indicates max pooling process in the corresponding encoder for behaving like the non-linear up sampling.

Therefore, the teachers’ Technological, Pedagogical, Content Knowledge (TPACK), and attitude to conduct online distance learning are crucial. Thus, this study intends to identify chemistry teachers’ TPACK and attitude in online distance learning during the Covid-19 outbreak. Purposed-design survey method was used with 109 participants in Java, Indonesia. The data were collected using online questionnaires then analyzed quantitatively using factor analysis and qualitatively based on the teachers’ response to online distance learning during the Covid-19. The questionnaire used consisted of 36 close-ended statements with a Likert scale and 10 open-ended questions to find out challenges and opportunities for implementing chemistry online distance learning. The results show that the teachers try to adapt their way of teaching and assessment by using various technology platforms for online distance learning. The attitude and TPACK of the teachers tend to be positive in responding to online distance learning even though some senior teachers have a negative tendency to the aspects of attitude and technological knowledge. It can be implied that training in the use of various technologies, and enhancement of chemistry teachers’ TPACK skills are needed to produce better online distance learning. These results are expected to provide an overview of the challenges and opportunities of online distance learning in chemistry during or beyond the Covid-19 outbreak. © 2021 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.","Kartimi, Gloria R.

However, their development in infected patients remain unknown. Here, we report on the dynamic development of a potent and protective ZIKV-specific human antibody ZK2B10 initially isolated from a ZIKV convalescent individual using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The unbiased repertoire analysis showed dramatic changes in many families of heavy and light chain variable regions. However, lineage tracing of ZK2B10 revealed limited somatic hypermutation throughout the 12 months since the onset of symptom. In particular, NGS-derived germline-like somatic variants neutralized and protected mice from lethal challenge of ZIKV without detectable cross-reactivity with Dengue virus (DENV). Site-directed mutagenesis identified two residues within λ chain, N31 and S91 that are essential to the functional maturation. The dynamic features unveiled here will assist us to better understand the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection and inform rational design of vaccines. Author summary Recently emerged ZIKV is associated with severe neurological complications such as Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults and congenital microcephaly in newborns. No ZIKV-specific therapeutics or vaccines are currently available. We and others have identified a number of neutralizing antibodies capable of protecting experimental animals from ZIKV infection. However, the development of these potent antibodies during ZIKV natural infection remains unknown. Here, we report on the longitudinal analysis of one such antibody ZK2B10 using next-generation sequencing (NGS), bioinformatics and functional analysis. We found that the ZK2B10 germline-like antibodies possess strong neutralizing activity in vitro and impressive protectivity against lethal ZIKV infection in vivo. These findings suggest that the potent and protective antibody response against ZIKV can be generated within relative short term with high germline identity which provide great hope and promise for successful vaccine development against ZIKV.","Gao, Fei; Lin, Xiaohe; He, Linling; Wang, Ruoke; Wang, Han; Shi, Xuanling; Zhang, Fuchun; Yin, Chibiao; Zhang, Linqi; Zhu, Jiang; Yu, Lei",bioRxiv,71,17

The problem comes from the irregular ordering of cans from different customers;not only national companies, but also from companies abroad. This causes fluctuations in production and consequently an irregular transport regime. That is why the beverage can producer demanded a forecasting system that would help to create an annual production plan. The aim is to analyze the ordering process for the last two years and on that basis to create a forecast system of the possible ordering process for the following year. This is necessary for the introduction of regularity of production, because the frequent transitions of the line to another assortment range or other surface printing requires long downtimes due to the technological setting, thus creating large losses due to inactivity of the production line. As drinking habits of final customers reflect the sale of cans, it was expected that sale data would have a seasonable character;this was proved after a brief analysis of the former data. After that, the appropriate forecasting methods were chosen. The methodology was created to combine multiple forecast results into one to increase the forecast objectivity. Forecasting is performed at three different levels: forecasting of assortment, forecasting of region sale and total forecasting of all orders. In spite of the change in market behavior in 2020, due to the pandemic situation in the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis, the sale of beverage cans is expected to stabilize and return to pre-crisis level as early as 2021.

It is agreed that a stockpile of appropriate polio vaccines will need to be established, and a surveillance and response capacity will need to be maintained, in order to protect the world against any possible future outbreaks attributable either to the persistence of wild poliovirus or vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) or to the unintentional or intentional release of poliovirus from a laboratory or vaccine store. Although it has been suggested that the stockpile should consist of monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine (mOPV), many questions remain concerning its nature, financing, management, and use--in particular, because of uncertainties over future national vaccination policies, and over the availability of different vaccines, after the certification of wild poliovirus eradication. There are further uncertainties concerning the possible role and efficacy of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) used either routinely or in outbreak control in low-hygiene settings, the potential for rapid geographical spread of polioviruses should an outbreak occur after certification, and the risks inherent in introducing additional oral polio vaccine (OPV) viruses into populations in which the vaccine coverage and prevalence of immunity have declined, and which may thus favour the spread of VDPVs.

Based on studies of Schistosoma japonicum transmission in irrigated agricultural environments in western China, a mathematical model was used to quantify environmental impacts on transmission intensity. The model was calibrated by using field data from intervention studies in three villages and simulated to predict the effects of alternative control options. Both the results of these interventions and earlier epidemiological findings confirm the central role of environmental factors, particularly those relating to snail habitat and agricultural and sanitation practices. Moreover, the findings indicate the inadequacy of current niclosamide-praziquantel strategies alone to achieve sustainable interruption of transmission in some endemic areas. More generally, the analysis suggests a village-specific index of transmission potential and how this potential is modulated by time-varying factors, including climatological variables, seasonal water-contact patterns, and irrigation practices. These time-variable factors, a village's internal potential, and its connectedness to its neighbors provide a framework for evaluating the likelihood of sustained schistosomiasis transmission and suggest an approach to quantifying the role of environmental factors for other parasitic diseases.","Liang, Song; Seto, Edmund Y W; Remais, Justin V; Zhong, Bo; Yang, Changhong; Hubbard, Alan; Davis, George M; Gu, Xueguang; Qiu, Dongchuan; Spear, Robert C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,71,14

Expression of nsp1, the most N-terminal gene 1 protein, prevented Sendai virus-induced endogenous IFN-beta mRNA accumulation without inhibiting dimerization of IFN regulatory factor 3, a protein that is essential for activation of the IFN-beta promoter. Furthermore, nsp1 expression promoted degradation of expressed RNA transcripts and host endogenous mRNAs, leading to a strong host protein synthesis inhibition. SCoV replication also promoted degradation of expressed RNA transcripts and host mRNAs, suggesting that nsp1 exerted its mRNA destabilization function in infected cells. In contrast to nsp1-induced mRNA destablization, no degradation of the 28S and 18S rRNAs occurred in either nsp1-expressing cells or SCoV-infected cells. These data suggested that, in infected cells, nsp1 promotes host mRNA degradation and thereby suppresses host gene expression, including proteins involved in host innate immune functions. SCoV nsp1-mediated promotion of host mRNA degradation may play an important role in SCoV pathogenesis.","Kamitani, Wataru; Narayanan, Krishna; Huang, Cheng; Lokugamage, Kumari; Ikegami, Tetsuro; Ito, Naoto; Kubo, Hideyuki; Makino, Shinji",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,71,1

OBJECTIVES To describe the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of SARS in the first large group of patients in North America; to describe how these patients were treated and the variables associated with poor outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Retrospective case series involving 144 adult patients admitted to 10 academic and community hospitals in the greater Toronto, Ontario, area between March 7 and April 10, 2003, with a diagnosis of suspected or probable SARS. Patients were included if they had fever, a known exposure to SARS, and respiratory symptoms or infiltrates observed on chest radiograph. Patients were excluded if an alternative diagnosis was determined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Location of exposure to SARS; features of the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests at admission to the hospital; and 21-day outcomes such as death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission with or without mechanical ventilation. RESULTS Of the 144 patients, 111 (77%) were exposed to SARS in the hospital setting. Features of the clinical examination most commonly found in these patients at admission were self-reported fever (99%), documented elevated temperature (85%), nonproductive cough (69%), myalgia (49%), and dyspnea (42%). Common laboratory features included elevated lactate dehydrogenase (87%), hypocalcemia (60%), and lymphopenia (54%). Only 2% of patients had rhinorrhea. A total of 126 patients (88%) were treated with ribavirin, although its use was associated with significant toxicity, including hemolysis (in 76%) and decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL (in 49%). Twenty-nine patients (20%) were admitted to the ICU with or without mechanical ventilation, and 8 patients died (21-day mortality, 6.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9%-11.8%). Multivariable analysis showed that the presence of diabetes (relative risk [RR], 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-7.2; P =.01) or other comorbid conditions (RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.8; P =.03) were independently associated with poor outcome (death, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation). CONCLUSIONS The majority of cases in the SARS outbreak in the greater Toronto area were related to hospital exposure. In the event that contact history becomes unreliable, several features of the clinical presentation will be useful in raising the suspicion of SARS. Although SARS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with diabetes or other comorbid conditions, the vast majority (93.5%) of patients in our cohort survived.","Booth, Christopher M; Matukas, Larissa M; Tomlinson, George A; Rachlis, Anita R; Rose, David B; Dwosh, Hy A; Walmsley, Sharon L; Mazzulli, Tony; Avendano, Monica; Derkach, Peter; Ephtimios, Issa E; Kitai, Ian; Mederski, Barbara D; Shadowitz, Steven B; Gold, Wayne L; Hawryluck, Laura A; Rea, Elizabeth; Chenkin, Jordan S; Cescon, David W; Poutanen, Susan M; Detsky, Allan S",JAMA,71,19

Chinese hamster ovary cells cotransfected with a construct expressing nucleocapsid protein from susceptible strains and with a luciferase reporter construct containing the fgl2 promoter showed a 6-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with nontransfected cells or cells cotransfected with a construct expressing nucleocapsid protein from resistant strains. Two deletions found at coding sites 111-123 and 1143-1145 of structural domains I and III, respectively, of the nucleocapsid gene may account for the differences between pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains. Preliminary mapping of the fgl2 promoter has defined a region from -372 to -306 upstream from the ATG translation initiation site to be responsive to nucleocapsid protein. Hence, mapping of genetic determinants in parental and recombinant strains demonstrates that the nucleocapsid protein of strains that induce fulminant hepatitis is responsible for transcription of the fgl2 prothrombinase gene. These studies provide new insights into the role of the nucleocapsid gene in the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis.","Ning, Q; Liu, M; Kongkham, P; Lai, M M; Marsden, P A; Tseng, J; Pereira, B; Belyavskyi, M; Leibowitz, J; Phillips, M J; Levy, G",The Journal of biological chemistry,71,17

These are commonly seen in sudden profound hypotension either from severe blood loss from “shock” in the widest sense and, even more often, in combination with brain injuries. Case Outline We present a case of a 38-year-old man, injured as a car driver in a frontal collision, who died c. 45 minutes after the accident. The autopsy revealed severe chest trauma, including multiple right-sided direct rib fractures with the torn parietal pleura and right-sided pneumothorax, several right lung ruptures, and a rupture of one of the lobar bronchi with pneumomediastinum, and prominent subcutaneous emphysema of the trunk, shoulders, neck and face. The patchy subendocardial hemorrhage of the left ventricle was observed. The cause of death is attributed to severe blunt force chest trauma. Conclusion We postulate pneumomediastinum leading to extrapericardial tamponade as the underlying mechanism of this subendocardial hemorrhage.","Nikolić, Slobodan; Živković, Vladimir",Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo,71,5

The IgG ELISA kits compared very well with each other except for the influenza A and B IgG ELISAs. The IgG ELISAs, in general, did not agree with CF In contrast, the IgM ELISAs compared well with CF and each other except for the consensus parainfluenza panel from ELISA B. The poor agreement of the IgG ELISAs with the CF test can be explained by the increased sensitivity of the ELISAs and differences between CF antigens and the ELISA antigens. The influenza A and influenza B ELISA antigens differed between both kits, which may explain their poor agreement. The ELISA is a suitable replacement for CF, providing greater sensitivity, isotype specificity, and ease of use.","Taggart, Edward W; Hill, Harry R; Martins, Thomas B; Litwin, Christine M",American journal of clinical pathology,71,31

Such viability assays have been used increasingly to determine oocyst inactivation following treatment with chemical, physical, or environmental stresses. Defining the relationship between in vitro viability assays and oocyst infectivity in susceptible hosts is critical for determining the significance of existing oocyst inactivation data for these in vitro assays and their suitability in future studies. In this study, four viability assays were compared with mouse infectivity assays, using neonatal CD-1 mice. Studies were conducted in the United States and United Kingdom using fresh (<1 month) or environmentally aged (3 months at 4 degrees C) oocysts, which were partially inactivated by ozonation before viability and/or infectivity analyses. High levels of variability were noted within and between the viability and infectivity assays in the U.S. and United Kingdom studies despite rigorous control over oocyst conditions and disinfection experiments. Based on the viability analysis of oocyst subsamples from each ozonation experiment, SYTO-59 assays demonstrated minimal change in oocyst viability, whereas 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole-propidium iodide assays, in vitro excystation, and SYTO-9 assays showed a marginal reduction in oocyst viability. In contrast, the neonatal mouse infectivity assay demonstrated significantly higher levels of oocyst inactivation in the U.S. and United Kingdom experiments. These comparisons illustrate that four in vitro viability assays cannot be used to reliably predict oocyst inactivation following treatment with low levels of ozone. Neonatal mouse infectivity assays should continue to be regarded as a ""gold standard"" until suitable alternative viability surrogates are identified for disinfection studies.","Bukhari, Z; Marshall, M M; Korich, D G; Fricker, C R; Smith, H V; Rosen, J; Clancy, J L",Applied and environmental microbiology,71,16

The seven viral RNAs are also 5' coterminal, since they all contain a 206-nucleotide common leader sequence which is identical to the 5' end of the genome. A conserved penta-nucleotide sequence motif, 5' UCAAC 3', was shown to be present at the junctions between the leader and body sequences in each of the mRNAs. In addition, two alternative junction sites were detected for mRNA 3. Seven replicative-form (RF) RNAs (RFs I to VII), corresponding to the genomic RNA and each of the subgenomic EAV mRNAs, could be prepared from lysates of infected cells. The minus-strand RNA contents of these RF RNAs were analyzed by using an RNase protection assay with an RNA probe containing the mRNA 2 leader-body junction. It was established that RF II contained a negative-stranded copy of mRNA 2, including a complementary leader sequence. The presence of subgenomic minus-strand RNA in RFs is indicative of a function as a transcription template during the production of EAV subgenomic mRNAs.","den Boon, J A; Kleijnen, M F; Spaan, W J; Snijder, E J",Journal of virology,71,1
191258,191258,191258,Influenza: current evidence and informed predictions.,12.910394,6.6229887,2004,"BACKGROUND The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) was considered a ""hot zone"" for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. In accordance with mandated city-wide infection control measures, the Hospital for Sick Children (HSC) drastically reduced all services while maintaining a fully operational emergency department. Because of the GTA health service suspensions and the overlap of SARS-like symptoms with many common childhood illnesses, this introduced the potential for a change in the volumes of patients visiting the emergency department of the only regional tertiary care children's hospital. METHODS We compared HSC emergency department patient volumes, admission rates and length of stay in the emergency department in the baseline years of 2000-2002 (non-SARS years) with those in 2003 (SARS year). The data from the prior years were modeled as a time series. Using an interrupted time series analysis, we compared the 2003 data for the periods before, during and after the SARS periods with the modeled data for significant differences in the 3 aforementioned outcomes of interest. RESULTS Compared with the 2000-2002 data, we found no differences in visits, admission rates or length of stay in the pre-SARS period in 2003. There were significant decreases in visits and length of stay (p < 0.001) and increases in admission rates (p < 0.001) during the periods in 2003 when there were new and active cases of SARS in the GTA. All 3 outcomes returned to expected estimates coincident with the absence of SARS cases from September to December 2003. INTERPRETATION During the SARS outbreak in the GTA, the HSC emergency department experienced significantly reduced volumes of patients with low-acuity complaints. This gives insight into utilization rates of a pediatric emergency department during a time when there was additional perceived risk in using emergency department services and provides a foundation for emergency department preparedness policies for SARS-like public health emergencies.","Boutis, Kathy; Stephens, Derek; Lam, Kelvin; Ungar, Wendy J; Schuh, Suzanne",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,71,30

Beside acute respiratory distress syndrome found in acute phase of infection, there is also pulmonary fibrosis as a chronic complication due to COVID-19. With the global pandemic of COVID-19, more and more autopsy and puncture histopathological results have been published.Until now there is no specific therapy to handle post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis due to COVID-19 infection. Several studies are ongoing to determine an effective treatment for this chronic complication. While ARDS appears to be the main cause of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19, the pathogenesis of ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 is different from the typical ARDS. Some therapies may be considered for reducing the fibrosis process in lung after COVI-19 infection namely pirfenidone, nintedanib and mesenchymal stem cells. Many patients are still recovering spontaneously in the first six weeks after acute COVID-19 infection and do not generally require fast-track entry into a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. However, those who have significantly persistent respiratory illness may need to be supported by pulmonary rehabilitation. Multidisciplinary intervention based on personalized evaluation and treatment which includes exercise training, education and behavioral modification can be given to improve the physical and psychological condition of patients with post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis.","Rumende, Cleopas Martin",Acta medica Indonesiana,71,1

BDs are leading causes of pediatric hospitalizations, medical expenditures, and infant mortality. To estimate national hospital charges and rates of in-hospital deaths for a greater number of specific BDs than estimated in previous reports, investigators at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and CDC used the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 2003 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), developed and distributed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. KID is a 10% sample of hospital discharges after uncomplicated births and an 80% sample of all other pediatric discharges from 36 participating states. Data are weighted to represent all pediatric hospitalizations in the United States. The investigators analyzed hospital stays during 2003 for newborn infants with any of 35 BDs. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated substantial variation among BDs regarding average length of stay, average hospital charge, and the incidence of in-hospital deaths. Average length of stay was greatest for infants with surgically repaired gastroschisis or omphalocele. Average hospital charges were highest for infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and common truncus arteriosus. Although anencephaly, trisomy 13, and trisomy 18 were associated with the highest rates of in-hospital death, the largest total numbers of deaths associated with neonatal hospitalizations occurred in infants with diaphragmatic hernia and renal agenesis.

Although the rat cells bound as much virus as the mouse cells. Their ability to internalize it was 40-fold less efficient than the mouse cells. This lower internalization efficiency was not enhanced by pH shock of infected cells, but was by treatment with polyethylene glycol. In all cell types there appeared to be no major differences in the ability of the internalized virus to replicate the viral RNA as determined by slot-blot analysis with a radiolabelled viral cDNA. A similar genetic mechanism appears to be operative in the lines because somatic cell hybrids formed between these lines in various combinations were also deficient in the ability to internalize bound virus. Taken together these results imply that rat cell lines in general share a common deficiency in their inability to internalize murine coronaviruses efficiently.

After laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), diabetes remission occurs early and independently of weight loss. Previous research has identified preoperative factors for remission, such as duration of diabetes and HbA1c. Understanding factors that predict diabetes remission can help to select patients who will benefit most from bariatric surgery. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all T2DM patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or LRYGB between January 2008 and July 2014. The primary outcome was diabetes remission, defined as the absence of hypoglycemic medications, fasting blood glucose < 7.0 mmol/L and HbA1c < 6.5%. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify predictive factors of diabetes remission. Results We included 207 patients in this analysis; 84 (40.6%) had LSG and 123 (59.4%) had LRYGB. Half of the patients (49.8%) achieved diabetes remission at 1 year. Multivariable logistic analysis showed that LRYGB had higher odds of diabetes remission than LSG (odds ratio [OR] 6.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.79–15.50, p < 0.001). Shorter duration of diabetes (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83–0.99, p = 0.032) and the absence of long-acting insulin (OR 0.0011, 95% CI < 0.000–0.236, p = 0.013) predicted remission.

As a consequence, in this insular habitat some wild bird species developed endemic forms, some of which are currently threatened. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible animal health risk associated with a potential avian influenza virus (AIV) circulation in Sardinian wild bird populations. Overall, 147 cloacal swabs were sampled in the Sardinia region from June 2009 to September 2011. Samples were obtained from 12 taxonomic orders, including 16 families and 40 species of birds. Based on the endangered host status or on the ecology of the host-virus interaction, samples were categorized into three groups of species: 1) endemic, endangered, or both (17 species); 2) potential reservoir (21 species); and 3) potential spillover (two species). Cloacal swabs were tested by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for influenza A virus matrix gene amplification. Forty-one serum samples were tested by nucleoprotein-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NP-ELISA) for antibodies against influenza A virus nucleoprotein and by hemagglutination inhibition assay for detection of seropositivity against H5 and H7 AIV subtypes. No cloacal swabs tested RT-PCR positive for AIV, whereas two weak seropositive results were detected by NP-ELISA in a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and in a yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis). The low or absent AIV circulation detected in Sardinia's wild birds during the study suggests a naïve status in these avian populations. These data provide new information on AIV circulation in Sardinia's wild birds that could be applied to implement conservation strategies for threatened species.","Delogu, Mauro; Piredda, Isabella; Pintore, Antonio; Cabras, Pierangela; Cotti, Claudia; Ghetti, Giulia; Raffini, Elisabetta; De Marco, Maria A",Avian diseases,71,19

Risk factors for fatal asthma attacks that have been described include excessive use of short acting beta-agonists, errors in clinical judgement, poor compliance, psychosocial disorders, use of three or more groups of asthma medication and indicators of asthma severity. AIM We aim to study the incidence of asthma deaths occurring in the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital in Singapore. METHODS Of the total number of patients at the Department of Emergency Medicine in Singapore General Hospital from January 1999 to June 2005, eight fatalities were attributed to exacerbation of bronchial asthma. The characteristics of these patients are described. RESULTS A low incidence of asthma-related deaths is found in Singapore.","Chew, Huck-Chin; Eng, Philip",European journal of emergency medicine : official journal of the European Society for Emergency Medicine,71,27

We describe our experience using a mobile CT scanner in an improvised isolation ward with life-support systems, portable lead shielding, and strict barrier nursing. This scanner was used exclusively for patients with SARS and patients with other illnesses who were also thought to have SARS. This arrangement freed the other CT scanners in the main department for non-SARS patients. In 5 weeks, 90 studies were performed; no cases of cross infection of health care workers were reported. CONCLUSION Mobile CT may be used to provide dedicated radiology services to seriously ill patients requiring strict isolation during an infectious disease outbreak.","Parmar, Hemant A; Lim, Tchoyoson C C; Goh, Jeffrey Seow-Kuang; Tan, Jau Tsair; Sitoh, Yih Yian; Hui, Francis",AJR.

Studies report that the lifetimerate of developing DFU is 25% for patients with diabetes mellitus. In addition, peripheral artery disease (PAD) is seen in approximately 50% of patients with DFU. PAD increases the risk of amputation in patients with DFU and complicates treatment. This study aimed to compare the effects of cilostazol and aspirin on wound healing in patients with DFU and PAD. In the study, DFU patients with PAD were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into two groups. One group was administeredcilostazoland the other was administeredaspirin. Patients were evaluated according to their demographic characteristics, wound characteristics, PAD symptoms, duration of treatment, and treatment grades. There were 30 patients in the cilostazol group and 20 patients in the aspirin group. Of the patients in the cilostazol group, seven(23.3%) had Wagner's grade 2, 16 (53.3%) had grade 3, and seven (23.3%) had grade 4 DFU. In the aspirin group this rate was 25%, 55%, and 20%, respectively. The mean size of the wound in the cilostazol group was 8.1 cm (2-25 cm), whereas it was 7.6 cm (5-25 cm) in the aspirin group. The mean ankle-brachial index (ABI) of the patients was 0.90 in the cilostazol group and 0.96 in the aspirin group. Five (23.3%) of the patients in the cilostazol group had triphasic, 19 (63.3%) biphasic, and six(20%) monophasic currents in the distal popliteal vein. In the aspirin group, these rates were 35%, 50%, and 20%, respectively. Of the patients in the cilostazol group, according to the Fontaine classification, six(20%) had stage 2A, 11 (36.7%) had stage 2B, 10 (33.3%) had stage 3, and three(10%) had stage 4 symptoms. In the aspirin group, these rates were 45%, 40%, 15%, and 0%, respectively. There was a complete response to treatment in 27 patients (90%) in the cilostazol group and 11 patients (55%) in the aspirin group. Partial response was present in the other patients. The mean duration of treatment was 1.31 months (1-2 months) in the cilostazol group and 1.82 months (1-2.5 months) in the aspirin group. In this study, it was observed that wound healing was faster in the cilostazol group, complete response to treatment was higher, and improvement in PAD symptoms was better compared to the aspirin group.

Mononuclear cells were prepared from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), bronchial lymph nodes (BLN), and spleens of pigs and tested for virus-specific responses by use of lymphocyte proliferation assays. Vigorous MLN and BLN proliferation responses to virulent TGEV and PRCV, respectively, at postinoculation days 8 to 24 were strongly associated with prior detection of TGEV in rectal swab samples and PRCV in nasal swab samples. Gastrointestinal disease and intestinal virus replication, assessed on the basis of rectal virus shedding, were almost exclusively found in the virulent TGEV-inoculated pigs, even though virulent TGEV and a high dose of attenuated TGEV elicited the highest proliferation responses in MLN. Pigs exposed to PRCV or attenuated TGEV did not have clinical signs of disease, and only 1 pig given a high dose of attenuated TGEV shed virus in feces. Porcine respiratory coronavirus replicated in the respiratory tract after either oronasal or aerosol inoculation of virus and induced strong BLN, but not MLN, proliferation responses.

The similar clinical symptoms in the course of different viral and bacterial respiratory infections make the proper diagnosis difficult. An accurate and prompt diagnostics is crucial for infection control and patient management decisions, especially regarding the use of antibacterial or antiviral therapy and hospitalization. Moreover, the identification of the causative agent eliminates inappropriate use of antibiotics and may reduce the cost of healthcare. A wide variety of diagnostic procedures is applied for the detection of viral agents responsible for respiratory tract infections. For many years, the viral antigen detection and standard isolation technique in cell culture was the main method used in routine diagnostics. However, in recent years the nucleic acid amplification techniques have become widely used and have significantly improved the sensitivity of viral detection in clinical specimens. Molecular diagnostic assays have contributed to revealing high rates of co-infection (multiplex reactions) and allow identification of agents that are difficult to culture. This paper discusses a number of technical aspects of the current most commonly used techniques, their general principles, main benefits and diagnostic value, but also some of their limitations.","Stefańska, Ilona; Romanowska, Magdalena; Brydak, Lidia B",Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej,71,1

National guidelines for non-pharmaceutical interventions focus mainly on the interference with viral transmission via droplets and surface by hygiene measures, limitation of human contact, and social distancing. There is growing evidence that a third route of transmission by aerosols - exhaled tiny particles with viable infectious virus that remain airborne for hours - may be relevant. This route may even be the predominant way of viral transmission in the case of so-called superspreading events. It implies the need for adequate ventilation at indoor spaces without recirculation of virus containing aerosols. Here, the use of face-masks might be of added value too. These measures appear to be especially pivotal during episodes of colder weather, when people spend significantly more time indoors.","In 't Veen, J C C M; de Hond, M; Boerstra, A C",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,71,21

The aim of this work was to study the composition and distribution of the film covering the surfaces of Mahurkar Maxid and Palindrome catheters, which were removed from the body of long-term hemodialysis patients. Moreover, the roughness and contact angle of the catheters were evaluated. METHODS Two brand new (as a reference) and thirty used catheters were the subject of the study. Their implantation period lasted from 4 months to a year and the reason for removal was the production of another vascular access or obstruction. Surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope and goniometer. RESULTS The inner surfaces of the used catheters were covered with a film of various complexity which includes a plurality of protein, blood cell counts and the crystals. The closer to the distal part the film becomes more complex and multi-layered. Even the surfaces of brand new catheter were not completely smooth. The only significant difference between analyzed models was the presence of thrombus in the distal part of Mahurkar Maxid catheters, not in the Palindrome. CONCLUSIONS The distal part of the catheters is the place most exposed to obstruction and infection, which may be due to not reaching the anticoagulant agent into this part. Not only the occurrence of side holes affects the formation of thrombus, but also their quantity, geometry and distribution which effect on fluid mechanics. The surface of the catheters needs to improvement to minimize the occurrence of defects and cracks.","Nycz, Marta; Paradowska, Ewa; Arkusz, Katarzyna; Kudliński, Bartosz; Krasicka-Cydzik, Elżbieta",Acta of bioengineering and biomechanics,71,1

There are to our knowledge only 3 reported cases in the literature. We describe a case of chylous ascites post open cholecystectomy in a patient with recent severe pancreatitis. We propose a potential relationship between acute biliary pancreatitis and the development of chylous ascites. CASE REPORT We present a 37 year old man with a history of severe biliary pancreatitis 10 months prior. He was electively admitted for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His surgery was converted to open cholecystectomy due to adhesions. A closed, non suction drain was placed intraoperatively draining serosanguinous fluid. Two days post operatively the draining fluid changed to a milky colour fluid with high triglyceride level. Chylous ascites was confirmed clinically with a 24 hour fast. He was treated with total parenteral nutrition. His chylous ascites resolved with conservative management and his drain was removed. CONCLUSION We describe the diagnosis and management of chylous ascites post cholecystectomy. We propose the hypothesis to the aetiology of this rare condition, based on ours and one previous case, that a history of recent severe acute pancreatitis poses a risk factor in the development of chylous ascites.","Cheung, Cherry X; Kelly, Michael E; El Tayeb, Omer; Torregianni, William C; Ridgway, Paul F",JOP : Journal of the pancreas,71,16

We have recently demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of E1 (residues 469 to 481, KCLYYLRGAIAPR) is required for virus release. Alteration of cysteine 470 to alanine did not affect virus release, whereas mutation of leucine 471 to alanine reduced virus production by 90%. In the present study, substitutions of remaining amino acids in the E1 cytoplasmic domain were made in order to investigate the role of each amino acid in regulating rubella virus release. Generated mutants were analyzed in the context of infectious full-length cDNA clone and virus-like particles using combined genetic, biochemical, and electron microscopic approaches. Substitution of a single residue of tyrosine 472 to alanine or tyrosine 473 to serine resulted in a block in virus release without affecting protein transport and virus budding into the lumen of the Golgi complexes. Infectious RNA transcripts bearing these mutations were incapable of forming plaques. Mutants with substitutions at the amino-terminal region (leucine 474, arginine 475, and glycine 476) in the E1 cytoplasmic domain had reduced virus release and small-plaque phenotype, while mutants with substitutions at the carboxy-terminal region (alanine 477, isoleucine 478, alanine 479, proline 480, and arginine 481) had only marginal defects in virus release. Plaque-forming revertants could be isolated from mutants Y472A and Y473S. Sequencing analysis revealed that the substituted serine residue in mutant Y473S reverted to the original tyrosine residue, whereas the substituted alanine residue in mutant Y472A was retained. These results indicate that the E1 cytoplasmic domain modulates virus release in a sequence-dependent manner and that the tyrosine residues are critical for this function. We postulate that residues YYLRG constitute a domain in the E1 tail that may interact with other proteins and this interaction is involved in regulating virus release.","Yao, J; Gillam, S",Journal of virology,71,30

Methods: From February 5 to March 8, 2020, 73 patients (male to female, ratio of 43:30; mean age, 51 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively enrolled and followed up until discharge from three institutions in China. The patients were divided into the severe and non-severe groups according to treatment option. The patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores, single ground-glass opacity (GGO) CT scores, single consolidation CT scores, single reticular CT scores and the amounts of zones involved were reviewed by 2 radiologists. These features were analyzed for temporal changes. Results: In non-severe group, total CT scores (median, 9.5) and the amounts of zones involved were slowly increased and peaked in disease week 2. In the severe group, the increase was faster, with scores also peaking at 2 weeks (median, 20). In both groups, the later parameters began to decrease in week 4 (median values of 9 and 19 in the non-severe and severe groups, respectively). In the severe group, the dominant residual lung lesions were reticular (median single reticular CT score, 10) and consolidation (median single consolidation CT score, 7). In the non-severe group, the dominant residual lung lesions were GGO (median single GGO CT score, 7) and reticular (median single reticular CT score, 4). In both non-severe and severe groups, the GGO pattern was dominant in week 1, with a higher proportion in the severe group compared with the non-severe group (72% vs. 65%).

Planning to ensure there is capability to treat those that become ill with the virus has led to an almost complete moratorium on elective work. This study evaluates the impact of COVID-19 on cancer, in particular surgical intervention, in patients with esophago-gastric cancer at a high-volume tertiary center. METHODS: All patients undergoing potential management for esophago-gastric cancer from 12 March to 22 May 2020 had their outcomes reviewed. Multi-disciplinary team (MDT) decisions, volume of cases, and outcomes following resection were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall 191 patients were discussed by the MDT, with a 12% fall from the same period in 2019, including a fall in new referrals from 120 to 83 (P = 0.0322). The majority of patients (80%) had no deviation from the pre-COVID-19 pathway. Sixteen patients had reduced staging investigations, 4 had potential changes to their treatment only, and 10 had a deviation from both investigation and potential treatment. Only one patient had palliation rather than potentially curative treatment. Overall 19 patients underwent surgical resection. Eight patients (41%) developed complications with two (11%) graded Clavien-Dindo 3 or greater. Two patients developed COVID-19 within a month of surgery, one spending 4 weeks in critical care due to respiratory complications; both recovered. Twelve patients underwent endoscopic resections with no complications. CONCLUSION: Care must be taken not to compromise cancer treatment and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a retrospective study of 65 patients treated with LPV/r and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for severe forms of COVID-19 (median age: 67; males: 41 [63.1%]), 33 (50.8%) displayed a grade &#8805;2 increase in plasma levels of hepatobiliary markers, lipase and/or triglycerides. A causal relationship between LPV/r and the AE was suspected in 9 of the 65 patients (13.8%). At 400 mg b.i.d., the plasma trough concentrations of LPV/r were high and showed marked interindividual variability (median [interquartile range]: 16,600 [11,430-20,842] ng/ml for lopinavir and 501 [247-891] ng/ml for ritonavir).

Understanding the proportion of the population at risk of severe infection, including among those with heart disease, could assist current vaccine strategy efforts. Methods: Using data from the 2015-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we estimated the weighted prevalence of any of eight of eleven increased-risk conditions (including age &#8805;65) in U.S. adults aged &#8805;18 (N=10,581) and extrapolated these results to a population of 233.8 million U.S. adults &#8805;18, and subgroups from the overall population defined by race/ethnicity, education, income and history of heart disease. Results: An estimated 176.1 million individuals representing 75.4% of U.S. adults had at least one increased-risk condition, 40.3% &#8805;2 and, 18.5% &#8805;3 conditions. Approximately 129 million adults aged <65 (69.2%) were also estimated to be at increased-risk. Compared to Whites, similar proportions of Blacks in the overall population (78.0 vs. 75.6%, p>0.05) and Hispanics in the younger population (70.8 vs 68.4%) were estimated to be at increased-risk. Conversely, a greater proportion of individuals with lower education and income levels were estimated to be at increased-risk both in the overall and younger population. In addition, an estimated 6.2 million individuals (14.5%) had heart disease. Among these, virtually all had at least one additional CDC risk factor (97.9%) and most had &#8805;2 or &#8805;3 risk factors (83.8% and 58.5%, respectively). Conclusions: As vaccination strategies are being explored, these results demonstrate that >75% of adults in the U.S. would be considered at increased-risk for severe COVID-19 infection by CDC criteria. Risk factor prevalence alone may not adequately capture the totality of risk, particularly among Black and Hispanic racial/ethnic groups and those with heart disease.","Ajufo, Ezimamaka; Rao, Shreya; Navar, Ann Marie; Pandey, Ambarish; Ayers, Colby R; Khera, Amit",Am J Prev Cardiol,71,6

Researchers in different fields have been working on finding explanations for the unequal impact of the virus and deaths from the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across geographical areas. Demographers and other social scientists have hinted at the importance of demographic factors, such as age structure and intergenerational relationships. Our aim is to reflect on the possible link between intergenerational relationships and spread and lethality of COVID-19 in a critical way. We show that with available aggregate data it is not possible to draw robust evidence to support these links. In fact, despite a higher prevalence of intergenerational coresidence and contacts that is broadly positively associated with COVID-19 case fatality rates at the country level, the opposite is generally true at the subnational level. While this inconsistent evidence demonstrates neither the existence nor the absence of a causal link between intergenerational relationships and the severity of COVID-19, we warn against simplistic interpretations of the available data, which suffer from many shortcomings. We conclude by arguing that intergenerational relationships are not only about physical contacts between family members. Theoretically, different forms of intergenerational relationships may have causal effects of opposite sign on the diffusion of COVID-19. Policies should also take into account that intergenerational ties are a source of instrumental and emotional support, which may favor compliance to the lockdown and ""phase-2"" restrictions and may buffer their negative consequences on mental health.","Arpino, Bruno; Bordone, Valeria; Pasqualini, Marta",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,71,22

We propose to select these parameters so as to minimize a criterion consistent with the traditional requirements of the validation of a probability density forecast. These requirements are both the uniformity and the independence of the so-called probability integral transforms, which are the forecast time-varying cumulated distributions applied to the observations. We thus build a new numerical criterion incorporating both the uniformity and independence properties by the mean of an adapted Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. We apply this method to financial markets during the COVID-19 crisis. We determine the time-varying density of daily price returns of several stock indices and, using various divergence statistics, we are able to describe the chronology of the crisis as well as regional disparities.

The process is initiated by fusion peptides that are small, hydrophobic components of viral membrane-embedded glycoproteins and are typically conserved within virus families. Here, we attempted to identify the correct fusion peptide region in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of dual membrane systems with varied oligomeric units of putative candidate peptides. Of all of the systems tested, only a trimeric unit of a 40-amino-acid region (residues 816-855 of SARS-CoV-2 Spike) was effective in triggering the initial stages of membrane fusion, within 200 ns of simulation time. Association of this trimeric unit with dual membranes resulted in the migration of lipids from the upper leaflet of the lower bilayer toward the lower leaflet of the upper bilayer to create a structural unit reminiscent of a fusion bridge. We submit that residues 816-855 of Spike represent the bona fide fusion peptide of SARS-CoV-2 and that computational methods represent an effective way to identify fusion peptides in viral glycoproteins.","Borkotoky, Subhomoi; Dey, Debajit; Banerjee, Manidipa",J Chem Inf Model,71,16

We estimated the burden and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 over the two waves. MethodsWe conducted a prospective cohort study during July 2020-March 2021 in one rural and one urban community. Mid-turbinate nasal swabs were collected twice-weekly from consenting household members irrespective of symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Serum was collected every two months and tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Household cumulative infection risk (HCIR) was defined as the proportion of household members with infection following SARS-CoV-2 introduction. FindingsAmong 71,759 nasal specimens from 1,189 members (follow-up rate 93%), 834 (1%) were SARS-CoV-2-positive. By PCR detection and serology combined, 34% (406/1189) of individuals experienced [≥]1 SARS-CoV-2 infection episode, and 3% (12/406) experienced reinfection. Infection by PCR and/or serology before the second wave was 84% (95% confidence interval (CI) 65%-93%) protective against re-infection. Of 254 PCR-confirmed episodes with available data, 17% (n=43) were associated with [≥]1 symptom, of which 21% (9/43) were medically attended. Among 222 included households, 161 (73%) had [≥]1 SARS-CoV-2-positive individual. HCIR was 16% (66/411). On multivariable analysis, index case lower cycle threshold value (OR 5.8, 95% CI 1.8-19.1), urban community (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.2) and infection with Beta variant (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.6-8.4) were associated with increased HCIR. HCIR was similar for symptomatic (8/67,12%) and asymptomatic (61/373, 16%) index cases (p-0.302). InterpretationIn this study, 83% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were asymptomatic and index case symptom status did not affect HCIR, suggesting a limited role for control measures targeting symptomatic individuals. Previous infection was protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the second wave although household transmission increased following the emergence of Beta variant. FundingUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPrevious studies have generated wide-ranging estimates of the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections which are asymptomatic. A recent systematic review found that 20% (95% CI 3%-67%) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remained asymptomatic throughout infection and that transmission was lower from asymptomatic individuals.1 A systematic review and meta-analysis of 54 household transmission studies of SARS-CoV-2 found an estimated secondary attack rate of 17% (95% CI 14-19).2 The review also found that household secondary attack rates were increased from symptomatic index cases and that adults were more likely to acquire infection. South Africa experienced two waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections; the second wave was larger and associated with emergence of 501Y.V2 lineage. Modelling studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 variant 501Y.V2 may be more transmissible than other variants or that past exposure may provide limited protection, however, they were not able to establish which of these may be more important. A community study from Denmark and two healthcare worker cohorts estimated protection conferred by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection against reinfection to be between 81% and 89%. Data on protection conferred against infection with the 501Y.V2 variant are limited. Studies to quantify the burden of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic fraction, duration of shedding and household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatically infected individuals have mostly been conducted as part of outbreak investigations or in specific settings. Comprehensive systematic community studies and studies of 501Y.V2 are lacking. Added value of this studyWe found that from the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in March 2020 through March 2021 in South Africa, 406 (34%) of 1189 individuals from 222 randomly sampled households in a rural and an urban community in South Africa had at least one confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, detected on rRT-PCR- and/or serology, and 3% (12/406) experienced reinfection. Individuals with evidence of infection identified by PCR and/or serology before the onset of the second wave (14 December 2020) experienced 84% (95% CI 65%-93%) protection against re-infection compared to individuals without evidence of previous infection. Symptom data were analysed for 254 rRT-PCR-confirmed infection episodes that occurred >14 days after the start of follow-up (of a total of 310 episodes), of these, 17% (n=43) were associated with one or more symptom, of which 14% (n=6) were hospitalised and 2% (n=1) died. Seventy three percent (161/222) of included households, had one or more individual infected with SARS-CoV-2 within the household. SARS-CoV-2 infected index cases transmitted the infection to 16% (66/411) of susceptible household contacts. Index case ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load estimated through cycle threshold value as proxy was strongly predictive of household transmission. Index case or household contact age group and presence of symptoms in the index case were not associated with household transmission. Household transmission was four times greater from index cases infected with Beta variant compared to non-variant infection. Implications of all the available evidenceWe found a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in households in a rural community and an urban community in South Africa, with the majority of infections being asymptomatic in individuals of all ages. The household cumulative infection risk was 16% and did not differ by index case or contact age or presence of symptoms but was higher in households where the index case had potentially higher viral RNA and during the second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The majority of infections were asymptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals transmitted SARS-CoV-2 at similar levels to symptomatic individuals suggesting that interventions targeting symptomatic individuals such as contact tracing of individuals tested because they report symptoms may have a limited impact as a control measure. The high level of heterologous protection from natural immunity evidenced in our study also informs our understanding of possible effects of population-level immunity on SARS-CoV-2 burden and transmission, although key questions remain regarding the durability of protection in the face of continued viral evolution.","Cohen, Cheryl; Kleynhans, Jackie; Gottberg, Anne von; McMorrow, Meredith; Wolter, Nicole; Bhiman, Jinal; Moyes, Jocelyn; Plessis, Mignon du; Carrim, Maimuna; Buys, Amelia; Martinson, Neil A; Kahn, Kathleen; Tollman, Stephen; Lebina, Limakatso; Wafawanaka, Floidy; Toit, Jacques du; Gomez-Olive, Francesc Xavier; Dawood, Fatima; Mkhencele, Thulisa; Sun, Kaiyuan; Viboud, Cecile; Tempia, Stefano",,71,1

True T cell crossreactivity, defined as the recognition by a single TCR of more than one distinct peptide-MHC ligand, has never been shown in the context of SARS-CoV-2.METHODSWe used the viral functional expansion of specific T cells (ViraFEST) platform to identify T cell responses crossreactive for the spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs at the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype level in convalescent COVID-19 patients (CCPs) and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2/CCC crossreactivity and assessments of functional avidity were performed using a TCR cloning and transfection system.RESULTSMemory CD4+ T cell clonotypes that crossrecognized the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and at least one other CCC were detected in 65% of CCPs and unexposed donors. Several of these TCRs were shared among multiple donors. Crossreactive T cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific proliferation in vitro relative to monospecific CD4+ T cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 relative to CCC.CONCLUSIONSOur data confirm, for what we believe is the first time, the existence of unique memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes crossrecognizing SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs. The lower avidity of crossreactive TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 may be the result of antigenic imprinting, such that preexisting CCC-specific memory T cells have reduced expansive capacity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to determine how these crossreactive T cell responses affect clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.FUNDINGNIH funding (U54CA260492, P30CA006973, P41EB028239, R01AI153349, R01AI145435-A1, R21AI149760, and U19A1088791) was provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Cancer Institute, and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

We first coarsely detect 5 facial keypoints corresponding to the center of the eyes, the nosetip and the ears. Then we compute a sparse 2D-3D points correspondence using a 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM). This correspondence is used to project the entire 3D face onto the image, and subsequently locate the inner eye canthus. Detecting this location allows to obtain the most precise body temperature measurement for a person using a thermal camera. We evaluated the approach on a thermal face dataset provided with manually annotated landmarks. However, such manual annotations are normally conceived to identify facial parts such as eyes, nose and mouth, and are not specifically tailored for localizing the eye canthus region. As additional contribution, we enrich the original dataset by using the annotated landmarks to deform and project the 3DMM onto the images. Then, by manually selecting a small region corresponding to the eye canthus, we enrich the dataset with additional annotations. By using the manual landmarks, we ensure the correctness of the 3DMM projection, which can be used as ground-truth for future evaluations.

This study examines the evolution of anxiety over the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, testing for differential experiences among vulnerable populations. METHODS: Phase 1 of the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey details the frequency of anxiety among a nationally representative sample of adults from April 23, 2020 through July 21, 2020. Negative binomial regression assessed differences in the frequency of anxiety among demographic, income, health and employment status cohorts. Propensity score matching to the 2019 National Health Interview Survey allowed previous anxiety and health status to be included in the model. RESULTS: Anxiety frequency for 944,719 individuals was observed over three months. Whites, blacks and Hispanics showed increasing frequency of anxiety over the time period, particularly blacks. Prior to COVID-19, 13% of respondents reported regular or semiregular anxiety, compared to 25-35% during the pandemic. Regression analysis suggests that frequent anxiety was highly and positively correlated with COVID-19 case fatality rate and higher levels of frequency were observed among those with poor health, incomes below $25,000, and without paid employment. LIMITATIONS: Causal inference was not able to be investigated due to the cross-sectional study design. CONCLUSIONS: While blacks showed lower levels of anxiety initially, the proportion of the population experiencing regular anxiety increased nearly 20% over the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. This rapid increase in anxiety could be due to inequity in health and economic outcomes among blacks.","Jacobs, Molly; Burch, Ashley E",J Affect Disord,71,24

In some studies, for example, education was neither a significant determinant of vaccination knowledge nor consistently linked with the intention to get vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases. Trust in the healthcare system is also known to be a determinant of health-related attitudes and behaviours. However, it remains unclear whether trust in the healthcare system moderates the effect of education on vaccination knowledge and vaccine uptake intention. In our study, we examined whether in Slovenia education is linked to higher levels of knowledge about vaccination, whether education is linked with a greater intention to get vaccinated against Covid-19, and whether trust in the healthcare system moderates the effect of education. We analysed two non-representative samples obtained through online surveys in November 2019 (Study 1;N = 661;76% women) and in March/April 2020 (Study 2;N = 851;84% women). We compared three educational groups (1 = secondary school or lower;2 = up to the first-cycle Bologna degree;3 = second-cycle Bologna degree or higher). Multivariate analyses showed that, when controlling for other determinants (gender, age, employment/activity status, self-rated health and political orientation), the mid-level education group showed the lowest level of vaccination knowledge (Study 1) and the lowest Covid-19 vaccine uptake intention (Study 2). Additionally, we found that trust in the healthcare system moderated the effects of education. Among high-trust groups, higher education had a significant positive impact only on Covid-19 vaccine uptake intention (Study 2) but had no significant impact on vaccine knowledge (Study 1). Among low-trust groups, the educational impact was similar for both outcomes;the mid-level educational groups had significantly lower Covid-19 vaccine uptake intention and vaccine knowledge, while the highest and the lowest educational group had the most vaccine knowledge and uptake intention. The implications of the results are discussed.","Lamot, M.; Krecic, M. J.; Kirbis, A.",Sodobna Pedagogika-Journal of Contemporary Educational Studies,71,12

We aimed to evaluate whether ibuprofen use in individuals with COVID-19 was associated with more severe disease, compared with individuals using paracetamol or no antipyretics. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 from Shamir Medical Centre, Israel, we monitored any use of ibuprofen from a week before diagnosis of COVID-19 throughout the disease. Primary outcomes were mortality and the need for respiratory support, including oxygen administration and mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: The study included 403 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with a median age of 45 years. Of the entire cohort, 44 patients (11%) needed respiratory support and 12 (3%) died. One hundred and seventy-nine (44%) patients had fever, with 32% using paracetamol and 22% using ibuprofen, for symptom-relief. In the ibuprofen group, 3 (3.4%) patients died, whereas in the non-ibuprofen group, 9 (2.8%) patients died (p 0.95). Nine (10.3%) patients from the ibuprofen group needed respiratory support, compared with 35 (11%) from the non-ibuprofen group (p 1). When compared with exclusive paracetamol users, no differences were observed in mortality rates or the need for respiratory support among patients using ibuprofen. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of COVID-19 patients, ibuprofen use was not associated with worse clinical outcomes, compared with paracetamol or no antipyretic.","Rinott, E; Kozer, E; Shapira, Y; Bar-Haim, A; Youngster, I",Clin. microbiol. infect,71,1

Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, infrared thermography (IRT) has been considered a gold standard method for screening febrile individuals at the time of pandemics. The objective of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of IRT for screening infectious diseases with specific applications to COVID-19. Approach: A literature review was performed in Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect to search for studies evaluating IRT screening from 2002 to present using relevant keywords. Additional literature searches were done to evaluate IRT in comparison to traditional core body temperature measurements and assess the benefits of measuring additional vital signs for infectious disease screening. Results: Studies have reported on the unreliability of IRT due to poor sensitivity and specificity in detecting true core body temperature and its inability to identify asymptomatic carriers. Airport mass screening using IRT was conducted during occurrences of SARS, Dengue, Swine Flu, and Ebola with reported sensitivities as low as zero. Other studies reported that screening other vital signs such as heart and respiratory rates can lead to more robust methods for early infection detection. Conclusions: Studies evaluating IRT showed varied results in its efficacy for screening infectious diseases. This suggests the need to assess additional physiological parameters to increase the sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive biosensors.","Khaksari, Kosar; Nguyen, Thien; Hill, Brian; Quang, Timothy; Perreault, John; Gorti, Viswanath; Malpani, Ravi; Blick, Emily; González Cano, Tomás; Shadgan, Babak; Gandjbakhche, Amir H",J Med Imaging (Bellingham),71,1

It was found that a protein recovery of about 30% could be achieved. Increases in pH (pH 10.5, 11, and 11.5) not only improved protein recovery, but also increased protein denaturation evidenced by decreased solubility, decreased &#945;-helix, increased ß-sheet, and increased random coil. The color and texture of gels made from protein isolate were greatly affected by the pH values used for protein extraction. For the gels made from fillet mince, and protein isolates extracted at pH 10.5, 11, and 11.5, the ""L"" values were 78.96, 60.38, 57.74, and 54.39, the breaking forces were 205, 492, 585, and 458 g, and deformation values were 10.59, 8.07, 6.73, and 5.04 mm, respectively. Electrophoresis revealed protein degradation during alkali-aided extraction with MHC, the most predominant band, showing about 50% decrease in comparison with fillet mince. It also demonstrated that gelation not only caused cross-linking, but also autolysis with 53%, 56%, 59%, and 81% decrease in MHC intensity for fillet mince, protein isolates extracted at pH 10.5, 11, and 11.5, respectively. Fillet mince and protein isolates exhibited different storage modulus patterns during temperature sweep, implying different gelation mechanisms. This study proved the protein extracted from catfish byproducts was potential to be utilized as edible food components especially in gel making. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Catfish byproducts, which account for 70% of total weight and 50% of total protein of catfish, are normally used as animal feed, fertilizer, or even waste. This study demonstrated the potential of the utilization of catfish wastes to develop edible food components. This could reduce the total processing waste being discarded into the environment and nutrient loss, therefore increasing profitability of catfish industry.","Zhang, Yan; Chang, Sam K C",J. food sci,71,3

Despite the current focus of worldwide research being the characterization of post-COVID-19 sequelae, the level of functional impact that this disease causes in the elderly who have presented moderate, severe or critical manifestations is still unknown. ObjectiveTo identify the main consequences/sequelae on functional respiratory capacity in the elderly after CoViD-19. MethodologyA cross-sectional study was carried out in the community. Functional aerobic capacity (2min step test), dyspnea perception (modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Questionnaire), respiratory and peripheral muscle strength (maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure, grip strength) and the Frailty Index (Clinical Fragility Scale) were assessed in 25 community-dwelling individuals aged [≥]65 years, who have had a diagnosis of CoViD-19 for up to 6 months, and in an equal number of elderly people with the same characteristics without a known diagnosis of CoViD-19. ResultsThe elderly with a diagnosis of CoViD-19 up to 6 months presented a decrease in the values of maximum inspiratory pressure (p=0.001) and maximum expiratory pressure (p=0.015), in aerobic capacity (p<0.001) with significant presence of desaturation on exertion (p<0.001), and increased values of dyspnea perception (p=0.001) and Frailty Index (p=0.026). ConclusionSignificant changes were found in the functional respiratory capacity of elderly patients diagnosed with CoViD-19 for up to 6 months, when compared with elderly individuals without a known diagnosis of CoViD-19. It is not possible to extrapolate the results obtained to the Portuguese population, however these results may be an important indicator in the characterization of sequelae in the elderly after infection by SARS-CoV-2.","Pereira, Filipe Alexandre; Tomas, Maria Teresa",,71,16

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was rapidly identified as the critical functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is well-known as a counter-regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and plays a key role in the cardiovascular system. Given that ACE2 functions as both a SARS-CoV-2 receptor and a RAS modulator, the treatment for COVID-19 presents a dilemma of how to limit virus entry but protect ACE2 physiological functions. Thus, an in-depth summary of the recent progress of ACE2 research and its relationship to the virus is urgently needed to provide possible solution to the dilemma. Here, we summarize the complexity and interplay between the coronavirus, ACE2 and RAS (including anti-RAS drugs). We propose five novel working modes for functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the routes of ACE2-mediated virus entering host cells, as well as its regulatory mechanism. For the controversy of anti-RAS drugs application, we also give theoretical analysis and discussed for drug application. These will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex mechanisms of underlying the relationship between the virus and ACE2, and provide guidance for virus intervention strategies.","Bian, Jingwei; Li, Zijian",,71,5

Globally understanding the humoral immunity in asymptomatic carriers will provide scientific knowledge for developing serological tests, improving early identification, and implementing more rational control strategies against the pandemic. MEASURE: Utilizing both NAT and commercial kits for serum IgM and IgG antibodies, we extensively screened 11 766 epidemiologically suspected individuals on enrollment and 63 asymptomatic individuals were detected and recruited. Sixty-three healthy individuals and 51 mild patients without any preexisting conditions were set as controls. Serum IgM and IgG profiles were further probed using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray, and neutralizing antibody was detected by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay system. The dynamics of antibodies were analyzed with exposure time or symptoms onset. RESULTS: A combination test of NAT and serological testing for IgM antibody discovered 55.5% of the total of 63 asymptomatic infections, which significantly raises the detection sensitivity when compared with the NAT alone (19%). Serum proteome microarray analysis demonstrated that asymptomatics mainly produced IgM and IgG antibodies against S1 and N proteins out of 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Different from strong and persistent N-specific antibodies, S1-specific IgM responses, which evolved in asymptomatic individuals as early as the seventh day after exposure, peaked on days from 17 days to 25 days, and then disappeared in two months, might be used as an early diagnostic biomarker. 11.8% (6/51) mild patients and 38.1% (24/63) asymptomatic individuals did not produce neutralizing antibody. In particular, neutralizing antibody in asymptomatics gradually vanished in two months. CONCLUSION: Our findings might have important implications for the definition of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, diagnosis, serological survey, public health, and immunization strategies.","Lei, Qing; Li, Yang; Hou, Hong-Yan; Wang, Feng; Ouyang, Zhu-Qing; Zhang, Yandi; Lai, Dan-Yun; Banga Ndzouboukou, Jo-Lewis; Xu, Zhao-Wei; Zhang, Bo; Chen, Hong; Xue, Jun-Biao; Lin, Xiao-Song; Zheng, Yun-Xiao; Yao, Zong-Jie; Wang, Xue-Ning; Yu, Cai-Zheng; Jiang, He-Wei; Zhang, Hai-Nan; Qi, Huan; Guo, Shu-Juan; Huang, Sheng-Hai; Sun, Zi-Yong; Tao, Sheng-Ce; Fan, Xiong-Lin",Allergy,71,22

The molecular mechanisms used by GBS to survive and proliferate in blood are not well understood. Here, using a highly virulent GBS strain and Transposon Directed Insertion-site Sequencing (TraDIS), we performed genome-wide screens to discover novel GBS genes required for bacterial survival in human whole blood and plasma. The screen identified 85 and 41 genes that are required for GBS growth in whole blood and plasma, respectively. A common set of 29 genes was required in both whole blood and plasma. Targeted gene deletion confirmed that (i) genes encoding methionine transporter (metP) and manganese transporter (mtsA) are crucial for GBS survival in whole blood and plasma, (ii) gene W903_1820 encoding a small multi-drug export family protein contributes significantly to GBS survival in whole blood, (iii) the shikimate pathway gene aroA is essential for GBS growth in whole blood and plasma, and (iv) deletion of srr1 encoding a fibrinogen-binding adhesin increases GBS survival in whole blood.

The aim of this study was to analyze and report the data of transferred refractory ARDS patients managed with venovenous (VV) ECMO at a national referral center over the last 11 years. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Referral center in Italy. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 100 patients treated from May 2009-November 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The mean age was 54 ± 14 years, and 65% of patients were male. Patients were treated throughout the year, with seasonal peaks in the winter months. The majority of patients were referred from hospitals within the Lombardia region (81%), mainly from the city of Milan and surrounding area (36% of the total). The most common etiology of refractory ARDS was H1N1 influenza A (42 patients [42%]), followed by bacterial pneumonia (35 patients [35%]), and severe acute respiratory syndrome due to Sars-CoV-2 infection (five patients [5%]). All patients were severely hypoxic at the time of VV ECMO treatment. No transport-related complication was recorded. The most common configuration used in the authors' clinical practice was a bicaval dual-lumen configuration (61 patients [61%]), followed by a femoro-jugular configuration (38 patients [38%]). The intensive care unit survival rate was 55%. CONCLUSIONS: Referral to a specialized center for VV ECMO treatment should be considered expeditiously in case of refractory ARDS, which often is lethal. Transport of patients with an unstable condition, although challenging, is feasible, and centralization of patient care is associated with good outcomes.","Pieri, Marina; Vettorello, Francesco; Calabrò, Maria Grazia; Zangrillo, Alberto; Scandroglio, Anna Mara",J. cardiothoracic vasc. anest,71,7

The outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus (CoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19. Within one month, cases were reported from 25 countries. In view of the novel viral strain with reported high morbidity, establishing early countrywide diagnosis to detect imported cases became critical. Here we describe the role of a countrywide network of VRDLs in early diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, established screening as well as confirmatory assays for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 13 VRDLs were provided with the E gene screening real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. VRDLs were selected on the basis of their presence near an international airport/seaport and their past performance. The case definition for testing included all individuals with travel history to Wuhan and symptomatic individuals with travel history to other parts of China. This was later expanded to include symptomatic individuals returning from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South Korea. Results: Within a week of standardization of the test at NIV, all VRDLs could initiate testing for SARS-CoV-2. Till February 29, 2020, a total of 2,913 samples were tested. This included both 654 individuals quarantined in the two camps and others fitting within the case definition. The quarantined individuals were tested twice - at days 0 and 14. All tested negative on both occasions. Only three individuals belonging to different districts in Kerala were found to be positive. Interpretation & conclusions: Sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential to cause a pandemic posed an unsurmountable challenge to the public health system of India. However, concerted efforts of various arms of the Government of India resulted in a well-coordinated action at each level. India has successfully demonstrated its ability to establish quick diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 at NIV, Pune, and the testing VRDLs.","Gupta, Nivedita; Potdar, Varsha; Praharaj, Ira; Giri, Sidhartha; Sapkal, Gajanan; Yadav, Pragya; Choudhary, Manohar Lal; Dar, Lalit; Sugunan, A P; Kaur, Harmanmeet; Munivenkatappa, Ashok; Shastri, Jayanthi; Kaveri, Krishnasamy; Dutta, Shanta; Malhotra, Bharti; Jain, Amita; Nagamani, Kammilli; Shantala, G B; Raut, Sharmila; Vegad, M M; Sharma, Ajanta; Choudhary, Aashish; Brijwal, Megha; Balakrishnan, Anukumar; Manjunatha, Jayaswamy; Pathak, Manish; Srinivasan, Sivasubramanian; Banu, Hasina; Sharma, Himanshu; Jain, Parul; Sunita, Pakalpati; Ambica, R; Fageria, Babita; Patel, Disha; Rajbongshi, Gitika; Vijay, Neetu; Narayan, Jitendra; Aggarwal, Neeraj; Nagar, Anu; Gangakhedkar, Raman R; Abraham, Priya",Indian J Med Res,71,1

COVID-19 has been associated with a number of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias. The aim of the current study was to evaluate P-wave dispersion (PWD) as a predictor of atrial fibrillation in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. In addition, the relationship between the PWD and inflammation parameters was investigated. METHODS: A total of 140 newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and 140 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were included in the study. The risk of atrial fibrillation was evaluated by calculating the electrocardiographic PWD. C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell, neutrophil and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were measured in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. RESULTS: PWD, white blood cell, NLR and CRP levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than the control group. There was a significant positive correlation between PWD and CRP level (rsâ=â0.510, Pâ<â0.001) and NLR in COVID-19 group (rsâ=â0.302, Pâ=â0.001). In their follow-up, 13 (9.3%) patients, 11 of whom were in the ICU, developed new atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSION: Our study showed for the first time in literature that the PWD, evaluated electrocardiographically in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19, was prolonged compared with normal healthy individuals. A positive correlation was found between PWD, CRP level and NLR. We believe that pretreatment evaluation of PWD in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 would be beneficial for predicting atrial fibrillation risk.","Yenerçag, Mustafa; Arslan, Ugur; Seker, Onur O; Dereli, Seçkin; Kaya, Ahmet; Dogdus, Mustafa; Öztürk, Çagatay E; Akpinar, Çetin K; Sen, Ahmet",J. cardiovasc. med.

Diagnostic interventionRT-PCR was used as gold standard for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs, study subjects were tested in parallel either with the COVISTIX or with Panbio rapid antigen test. Main outcomeDiagnostic performance of the COVISTIX assay is adequate in all commers since its accuracy parameters were not affected in samples collected after 7 days of symptom onset, and it detected almost 65% of samples with a Ct-value between 30 and 34. ResultsFor the population tested with COVISTIX (n=783), specificity and sensitivity of the was 96.0% (CI95% 94.0-98.0) and 81% (CI95% 76.0-85.0), as for the Panbio (n=2202) population, was 99.0% (CI95%: 0.99-1.00) and 62% (CI%: 58.0-64.0%), respectively. Conclusions and relevanceThe COVISTIX rapid antigen test shows a high performance in all comers, thus, this test is also adequate for testing patients who have passed the peak of viral shedding or for asymptomatic patients.","Garcia-Cardenas, Francisco; Franco, Alba; Cortes, Ricardo; Bertin, Jenny; Valdez, Rafael; Penaloza, Fernando; Frias-Jimenez, Emmanuel; Cedro-Tanda, Alberto; Mendoza-Vargas, Alfredo; Reyes-Grajeda, Juan P; Hidalgo-Miranda, Alfredo; Herrera, Luis A",,71,1

The disease, named COVID-19, has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic or mild to critical, and for some patients the disease is even fatal. Apparently, being a child or being pregnant does not represent an additional risk for adverse outcomes. The purpose of this mini-review was to investigate what is in the scientific literature, so far, in regard to vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Data were obtained independently by the two authors, who carried out a systematic search in the PubMed, Embase, LILACS, Cochrane, Scopus and SciELO databases using the Medical Subject Heading terms “coronavirus,” “COVID-19,” and “vertical transmission.” Few studies about the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are found in the literature. In all case reports and case series, the mothers' infection occurred in the third trimester of pregnancy, there were no maternal deaths, and most neonates had a favorable clinical course. The virus was not detected in the neonate nasopharyngeal swab samples at birth, in the placenta, in the umbilical cord, in the amniotic fluid, in the breast milk or in the maternal vaginal swab samples in any of these articles. Only three papers reported neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there is a bias that positive pharyngeal swab samples were collected at 36 h and on the 2nd, 4th, and 17th days of life. The possibility of intrauterine infection has been based mainly on the detection of IgM and IL-6 in the neonates' serum. In conclusion, to date, no convincing evidence has been found for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Simões e Silva, Ana Cristina; Leal, Caio Ribeiro Vieira",Front. Pediatr.,71,24

METHOD: We created a web-based survey regarding the changes in clinical, research, and educational activity of Neurology trainees in Italy during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the preventive measures undertaken by local Institutions to reduce the risk of contagion. RESULTS: 79 residents working in Italy completed the survey. 87.3% of trainees reported a substantial reduction in their neurological duties since SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Italy, and 17.8% were also recruited or volunteered for COVID-19-dedicated wards. Likewise, more than 60% of trainees experienced a reduction or interruption in research activity. As regards the perceived impact of COVID-19 outbreak on their neurological training, almost 70% of surveyed trainees believe that SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had or will have a negative impact on their formation as neurologists, for different reasons. Furthermore, trainees reported a consistent exposure (69.6%) to confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 cases at work, with divergent surveillance and preventive measures taken by local institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the survey shows that SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy has had a subjective negative impact for Neurology residents on didactics, clinical, and research training as well as training abroad. SARS-CoV-2 outbreak poses many challenges to our academic institutions and training programs, and addressing these issues promptly is crucial to ensure continued quality of trainees' neurological education. Sharing solutions and ideas among the international neurological community might help Neurology training programs worldwide to better counteract these problems.","Abati, Elena; Costamagna, Gianluca",Neurology,71,16

Recently, taste disturbance is also considered as one of the predominant symptoms of COVID-19 although its pathogenesis requires further research. Localized taste disorders may be overlooked considering that whole-mouth taste perception is insured through several mechanisms. Individuals often fail to discern taste from flavor, and interviews/surveys are insufficient to properly assess taste function. Hence, various taste assessment methods have been developed. Among them, psychophysical methods are most widely applied in a clinical context. Less-biased electrophysiological, imaging, or morphological methods are used to a much lesser degree. Overall, more research is needed in the field of taste.","Zhu, Y; Hummel, T",,71,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine patients (31 males and 28 females ranging from 25 to 70 years old) with confirmed COVID-19 infection performed follow-up thin-section thorax CT. After 31.5±7.9 days (range, 24 to 39 days) of hospital admission, the results of CT were analyzed for parenchymal abnormality (ground-glass opacification, interstitial thickening, and consolidation) and evidence of fibrosis (parenchymal band, traction bronchiectasis, and irregular interfaces). Patients were analyzed based on the evidence of fibrosis and divided into two groups namely, groups A and B (with and without CT evidence of fibrosis), respectively. Patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, peak C-reactive protein level, and CT score were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Among the 59 patients, 89.8% (53/59) had a typical transition from early phase to advanced phase and advanced phase to dissipating phase. Also, 39% (23/59) patients developed fibrosis (group A), whereas 61% (36/59) patients did not show definite fibrosis (group B). Patients in group A were older (mean age, 45.4±16.9 vs. 33.8±10.2 years) (Pâ=â0.001), with longer LOS (19.1±5.2 vs. 15.0±2.5 days) (Pâ=â0.001), higher rate of ICU admission (21.7% (5/23) vs. 5.6% (2/36)) (Pâ=â0.061), higher peak C-reactive protein level (30.7±26.4 vs. 18.1±17.9âmg/L) (Pâ=â0.041), and higher maximal CT score (5.2±4.3 vs. 4.0±2.2) (Pâ=â0.06) than those in group B. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary fibrosis may develop early in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge. Older patients with severe illness during treatment were more prone to develop fibrosis according to thin-section CT results.","Wei, Jiangping; Yang, Hong; Lei, Pinggui; Fan, Bing; Qiu, Yingying; Zeng, Bingliang; Yu, Peng; Lv, Jian; Jian, Yinchao; Wan, Chengfeng",J Xray Sci Technol,71,16

Although it is well known that a balanced diet which satisfies the daily intake of vitamin C positively affects the immune system and reduces susceptibility to infections, available data do not support the theory that oral vitamin C supplements boost immunity. No current clinical recommendations support the possibility of significantly decreasing the risk of respiratory infections by using high-dose supplements of vitamin C in a well-nourished general population. Only in restricted subgroups (e.g., athletes or the military) and in subjects with a low plasma vitamin C concentration a supplementation may be justified. Furthermore, in categories at high risk of infection (i.e., the obese, diabetics, the elderly, etc.), a vitamin C supplementation can modulate inflammation, with potential positive effects on immune response to infections. The impact of an extra oral intake of vitamin C on the duration of a cold and the prevention or treatment of pneumonia is still questioned, while, based on critical illness studies, vitamin C infusion has recently been hypothesized as a treatment for COVID-19 hospitalized patients. In this review, we focused on the effects of vitamin C on immune function, summarizing the most relevant studies from the prevention and treatment of common respiratory diseases to the use of vitamin C in critical illness conditions, with the aim of clarifying its potential application during an acute SARS-CoV2 infection.","Cerullo, Giuseppe; Negro, Massimo; Parimbelli, Mauro; Pecoraro, Michela; Perna, Simone; Liguori, Giorgio; Rondanelli, Mariangela; Cena, Hellas; D039,; Antona, Giuseppe",Front Immunol,71,16

METHODS: Through prospective surveillance, we identified adult and pediatric patients in hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 using a standard definition between Mar. 1 and Aug. 31, 2020, through the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP), a network of 78 hospitals. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics and data on treatment, interventions and outcomes were reviewed and described. RESULTS: As of Aug. 31, 2020, the CNISP had received data for 1906 patients in hospital with COVID-19 in 49 sentinel hospitals in 9 provinces. The majority of patients in hospital with COVID-19 were older (median age 71 yr) and had underlying medical conditions (85.8%). Few children with COVID-19 were admitted to a participating hospital (n = 37, 1.9%). Acquisition of COVID-19 in hospitals was infrequent (6.4% of all cases).

This review examines the methods used and results of recent studies on the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. WBE becomes essential, especially with virus transmission path uncertainty, limitations on the number of clinical tests that could be conducted, and a relatively long period for infected people to show symptoms. Wastewater surveillance was used to show the effect of lockdown on the virus spread. A WBE framework tailored for SARS-CoV-2 that incorporates lessons learnt from the reviewed studies was developed. Results of the review helped outline challenges facing the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples. A comparison between the various studies with regards to sample concentration and virus quantification was conducted. Five different primers sets were used for qPCR quantification; however, due to limited data availability, there is no consensus on the most sensitive primer. Correlating the slope of the relationship between the number of gene copies vs. the cumulative number of infections normalized to the total population served with the average new cases, suggests that qPCR results could help estimating the number of new infections. The correlation is improved when a lag period was introduced to account for asymptomatic infections. Based on lessons learnt from recent studies, it is recommended that future applications should consider the following: 1) ensuring occupational safety in managing sewage collection and processing, 2) evaluating the effectiveness of greywater disinfection, 3) measuring viral RNA decay due to biological and chemical activities during collection and treatment, 4) assessing the effectiveness of digital PCR, and 5) conducting large scale international studies that follow standardized protocols.","Hamouda, Mohamed; Mustafa, Farah; Maraqa, Munjed; Rizvi, Tahir; Aly Hassan, Ashraf",Sci Total Environ,71,33

Unavailability of personal protective equipment (PPE), fear of transmitting the disease to their families, and social stigma were the most frequently reported reasons for increased risk perception. The overall knowledge level of HCWs was generally good especially among physicians. A positive attitude was detected among allied health professionals more than physicians. Risk perception was high among HCWs.

Numerous ongoing and recently published studies about the disease have emerged. However, the research regarding COVID-19 is largely ongoing and inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: A potential way to accelerate COVID-19 research is to use existing information gleaned from research into other viruses that belong to the coronavirus family. Our objective is to develop a natural language processing method for answering factoid questions related to COVID-19 using published articles as knowledge sources. METHODS: Given a question, first, a BM25-based context retriever model is implemented to select the most relevant passages from previously published articles. Second, for each selected context passage, an answer is obtained using a pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) question-answering model. Third, an opinion aggregator, which is a combination of a biterm topic model and k-means clustering, is applied to the task of aggregating all answers into several opinions. RESULTS: We applied the proposed pipeline to extract answers, opinions, and the most frequent words related to six questions from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge. By showing the longitudinal distributions of the opinions, we uncovered the trends of opinions and popular words in the articles published in the five time periods assessed: before 1990, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, 2010-2018, and since 2019. The changes in opinions and popular words agree with several distinct characteristics and challenges of COVID-19, including a higher risk for senior people and people with pre-existing medical conditions; high contagion and rapid transmission; and a more urgent need for screening and testing. The opinions and popular words also provide additional insights for the COVID-19-related questions. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other methods of literature retrieval and answer generation, opinion aggregation using our method leads to more interpretable, robust, and comprehensive question-specific literature reviews. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method in answering COVID-19-related questions with main opinions and capturing the trends of research about COVID-19 and other relevant strains of coronavirus in recent years.","Lu, Zhao-Hua; Wang, Jade Xiaoqing; Li, Xintong",J Med Internet Res,71,16

Here we show that, just before its 2013 spread to the Americas, Zika virus (ZIKV) underwent an envelope protein V473M substitution (E-V473M) that increased neurovirulence, maternal-to-fetal transmission, and viremia to facilitate urban transmission. A preepidemic Asian ZIKV strain (FSS13025 isolated in Cambodia in 2010) engineered with the V473M substitution significantly increased neurovirulence in neonatal mice and produced higher viral loads in the placenta and fetal heads in pregnant mice. Conversely, an epidemic ZIKV strain (PRVABC59 isolated in Puerto Rico in 2015) engineered with the inverse M473V substitution reversed the pathogenic phenotypes. Although E-V473M did not affect oral infection of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, competition experiments in cynomolgus macaques showed that this mutation increased its fitness for viremia generation, suggesting adaptive evolution for human viremia and hence transmission. Mechanistically, the V473M mutation, located at the second transmembrane helix of the E protein, enhances virion morphogenesis. Overall, our study revealed E-V473M as a critical determinant for enhanced ZIKV virulence, intrauterine transmission during pregnancy, and viremia to facilitate urban transmission.","Shan, Chao; Xia, Hongjie; Haller, Sherry L; Azar, Sasha R; Liu, Yang; Liu, Jianying; Muruato, Antonio E; Chen, Rubing; Rossi, Shannan L; Wakamiya, Maki; Vasilakis, Nikos; Pei, Rongjuan; Fontes-Garfias, Camila R; Singh, Sanjay Kumar; Xie, Xuping; Weaver, Scott C; Shi, Pei-Yong",Proc.

Conceptually we take our cue from Norbert Elias and the way something as physiologically fundamental as coughing becomes the focus of etiquette and technique, touching also on themes central to Mary Douglas' anthropology of pollution. This is explored through four themes. First, we show how coughing becomes a matter of biopolitical citizenship expressed through etiquettes that also displace pollution anxieties to surroundings. Second, coughing is a question of being assisted to cough through the mediation of professional skills, interventions and devices. Third, coughing is seen to be central to the sonographic soundscape of the healthcare environment whereby people learn to recognise (and sometimes misrecognise) each other through the 'sound' of the cough. Finally, coughing properly can be seen to have both a 'time and a place' including the retreat of the cough from public space into risky confined spaces. Our conclusion speculates on the way these insights shed light on aspects of life that, until the Covid-19 pandemic, lay largely hidden.","Brown, Nik; Nettleton, Sarah; Buse, Chrissy; Lewis, Alan; Martin, Daryl",Biosocieties,71,25

METHODOLOGY: Review of medical records of 120 children (58.4% males), aged 1 month to 18 years, admitted between 1 March and 31 December, 2020 with at least one positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and demographic variables were compared between children with and without co-morbidities. RESULTS: 62 (51.7%) children had comorbidities. The most common comorbidity was tuberculosis (32.3%) followed by other infections (27.4%) and hematological (19.4%) conditions. Fever (89.2%) was the most common clinical feature followed by respiratory (52.5%) and gastrointestinal (32.5%) manifestations. There was no significant difference in the severity of COVID illness, length of hospital stay and adverse outcomes (ventilation and mortality) among children with and without comorbidities.

Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptor of human to initiate host invasion. Plethora of studies demonstrate the inhibition of Spike-ACE2 interactions to impair infection. The ancient Indian traditional medicine has been of great interest of Virologists worldwide to decipher potential antivirals. Hence, in this study, phytochemicals (1,952 compounds) from eight potential medicinal plants used in Indian traditional medicine were meticulously collated, based on their usage in respiratory disorders, along with immunomodulatory and anti-viral potential from contemporary literature. Further, these compounds were virtually screened against Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of Spike protein. The potential compounds from each plant were prioritized based on the binding affinity, key hotspot interactions at ACE2 binding region and glycosylation sites. Finally, the potential hits in complex with spike protein were subjected to Molecular Dynamics simulation (450 ns), to infer the stability of complex formation. Among the compounds screened, Tellimagrandin-II (binding energy of -8.2 kcal/mol and binding free energy of -32.08 kcal/mol) from Syzygium aromaticum L. and O-Demethyl-demethoxy-curcumin (binding energy of -8.0 kcal/mol and binding free energy of -12.48 kcal/mol) from Curcuma longa L. were found to be highly potential due to their higher binding affinity and significant binding free energy (MM-PBSA), along with favorable ADMET properties and stable intermolecular interactions with hotspots (including the ASN343 glycosylation site). The proposed hits are highly promising, as these are resultant of stringent in silico checkpoints, traditionally used, and are documented through contemporary literature. Hence, could serve as promising leads for subsequent experimental validations.","Umashankar, V.; Deshpande, S. H.; Hegde, H. V.; Singh, I.; Chattopadhyay, D.",Frontiers in Medicine,71,24
264295,264295,264295,Advances in local and systemic drug delivery systems for post-surgical cancer treatment,12.807429,6.5314503,2020,": Methadone regulations have changed minimally since 1974, despite advances in the understanding of the nature of opioid use disorder (OUD) and the role of medications in its treatment. At that time, most patients with OUD were considered to have anti-social personality disorders and the regulations aimed to exert maximal control over medication access. Six- or seven-day clinic attendance is required for months, regardless of distance, or childcare and other social responsibilities. Take home medications are not allowed unless rigid and formulaic conditions are met. Although addiction medicine has rejected the ""criminal"" paradigm in favor of OUD as a treatable medical disorder, methadone regulations have not kept pace with the science.Pregnancy is characterized by an ultra-rapid metabolic state, but regulations prevent the use of daily divided doses of methadone to maintain stability. This results in repeated episodes of maternal/fetal opioid withdrawal, as well as other fetal physiologic abnormalities. Interference with dose regimen adjustments prevents optimal outcomes.Further, methadone clinics are mostly urban, leaving patients in rural areas without access. This led to excessive morbidity and mortality when the opioid crisis hit. The response of merely expanding capacity in overcrowded urban clinics created a contagion menace when Covid-19 arrived. Pregnant women (and parents with children) were forced to negotiate dosing in dangerous conditions.A revised methadone system must provide treatment that is local, flexible, and limited in size to manage viral contagion risks. This regulatory change can most easily be started by changing regulations that adversely affect pregnant women.","McCarthy, John J; Jones, Hendree E; Terplan, Mishka; Rudolf, Vania P; von Klimo, Melinda Campopiano",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),71,16

We performed this meta-analysis to find conclusive evidence. METHODS: We searched published articles through PubMed, EMBASE and medRxiv from 5 January 2020 to 3 August 2020. Studies that reported clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19, stratified by the class of antihypertensives, were included. Random and fixed-effects models were used to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: A total 36 studies involving 30,795 patients with COVID-19 were included. The overall risk of poor patient outcomes (severe COVID-19 or death) was lower in patients taking RAAS inhibitors (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: [0.67, 0.95]) compared with those receiving non-RAAS inhibitor antihypertensives. However, further sub-meta-analysis showed that specific RAAS inhibitors did not show a reduction of poor COVID-19 outcomes when compared with any class of antihypertensive except beta-blockers (BBs). For example, compared to calcium channel blockers (CCBs), neither angiotensin-I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: [0.67, 1.23]) nor angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: [0.62, 1.33]) showed a reduction of poor COVID-19 outcomes. When compared with BBs, however, both ACEIs (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: [0.73, 0.99) and ARBs (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: [0.55, 0.94]) showed an apparent decrease in poor COVID-19 outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: RAAS inhibitors did not increase the risk of mortality or severity of COVID-19. Differences in COVID-19 clinical outcomes between different class of antihypertensive drugs were likely due to the underlying comorbidities for which the antihypertensive drugs were prescribed, although adverse effects of drugs such as BBs could not be excluded.","Bezabih, Yihienew M; Bezabih, Alemayehu; Alamneh, Endalkachew; Peterson, Gregory M; Bezabhe, Woldesellassie",BMC Infect Dis,71,26

III-V semiconductor materials are an attractive alternative to silicon for this application, as they have some superior physical properties. They could meet the demands for fast timing detectors allowing time-of-flight measurements with ps resolution while being radiation tolerant and cost-efficient. As a material with a larger density, higher atomic number Z and much higher electron mobility than silicon, GaAs exhibits faster signal collection and a larger signal per {\mu}m of sensor thickness. In this work, we report on the fabrication of n-in-n GaAs thin-film devices intended to serve next-generation high-energy particle tracking detectors. Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) was used to grow high-quality GaAs films with doping levels sufficiently low to achieve full depletion for detectors with an active thickness of 10 {\mu}m. The signal collection speed of the detector structures was assessed using the transient current technique (TCT). To elucidate the structural properties of the detector, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was used, which confirmed the formation of the junction in the detector and revealed residual doping in the intrinsic layer. Our results suggest that GaAs thin films are suitable candidates to achieve thin and radiation-tolerant tracking detectors.","Rangel-Kuoppa, Victor; Ye, Sheng; Noori, Yasir J; Holmkvist, William; Young, Robert J; Muenstermann, Daniel",,71,1

Specifically, the paper investigates consumer pandemic-related isolation behavior (which manifests itself via preference for shopping without leaving home, and avoiding contact with other people while shopping offline) as a consequence of consumer interdependent self-construal, with the mediating role of consumer pandemic-related emotions of disgust, fear for oneself, fear for others, and sadness. The results of two surveys conducted in different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland (October 2020, and January 2021, respectively) suggest two opposing indirect effects of interdependent self-construal on isolation behavior: a positive effect through disgust, and a negative effect through sadness. Additionally, a positive indirect effect through fear was visible in the second study. Moreover, two dimensions of interdependent self-construal (i.e., vertical and horizontal) are demonstrated to have opposing effects (a positive effect and a negative one, respectively) on pandemic-related disgust, and in turn on isolation behavior. The above results indicate that, in the context of the pandemic, consumer self-construal influences pandemic-related emotions, and in turn consumers’ tendency to isolate themselves.

We reported nodal and breast downstaging rates with NET, and compared axillary response rates following NET and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). METHODS: Consecutive stage I-III breast cancer patients treated with NET and surgery from January 2009 to December 2019 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Nodal pCR rates were compared between biopsy-proven node-positive patients treated with NET, and HR+/HER2- patients treated with NAC from November 2013 to July 2019. RESULTS: 127 cancers treated with NET and 338 with NAC were included. NET recipients were older, more likely to have lobular and lower-grade tumors, and higher HR expression. With NET, the nodal pCR rate was 11% (4/38) of biopsy-proven cases, and the breast pCR rate was 1.6% (2/126). Nodal-dowstaging rates with NET and NAC were not significantly different (11% vs 18%; P = 0.37). Patients achieving nodal pCR with NET versus NAC were older (median age 70 vs 50, P = 0.004) and had greater progesterone receptor (PR) expression (85% vs 13%, P = 0.031), respectively. Of patients not candidates for BCS due to a large tumor relative to breast size, 36/47 (77%) became BCS-eligible with NET (median PR expression 55% vs 5% in those remaining ineligible, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although nodal pCR is more frequent than breast pCR, NET is more likely to de-escalate breast surgery than axillary surgery. However, with a nodal pCR rate of 11%, NET remains an option for downstaging node-positive patients without clear indications for NAC.","Montagna, Giacomo; Sevilimedu, Varadan; Fornier, Monica; Jhaveri, Komal; Morrow, Monica; Pilewskie, Melissa L",Ann. surg. oncol,71,15

We discuss this vulnerability among LTCF residents using an ecological framework, on levels spanning from the individual to families and caregivers, institutions, health services and systems, communities, and contextual government policies. Challenges abound for fully understanding the burden of COVID-19 in LTCF, including differences in nomenclature, data collection systems, cultural differences, varied social welfare models, and (often) under-resourcing of the LTC sector. Registration of cases and deaths may be limited by testing capacity and policy, record-keeping and reporting procedures. Hospitalization and death rates may be inaccurate depending on atypical presentations and whether or not residents' goals of care include escalation of care and transfer to hospital. Given the important contribution of frailty, use of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is discussed as a readily implementable measure, as are lessons learned from the study of frailty in relation to influenza. Biomarkers hold emerging promise in helping to predict disease severity and address the puzzle of why some frail LTCF residents are resilient to COVID-19, either remaining test-negative despite exposure or having asymptomatic infection, while others experience the full range of illness severity including critical illness and death. Strong and coordinated surveillance and research focused on LTCFs and their frail residents is required. These efforts should include widespread assessment of frailty using feasible and readily implementable tools such as the CFS, and rigorous reporting of morbidity and mortality in LTCFs.","Andrew, Melissa; Searle, Samuel D; McElhaney, Janet E; McNeil, Shelly A; Clarke, Barry; Rockwood, Kenneth; Kelvin, David J",J Infect Dev Ctries,71,16

Recent experience with developing and testing viral vaccine candidates can inform expectations regarding the development of safe and effective vaccines. OBJECTIVE: To estimate timelines and probabilities of success for recent vaccine candidates. DESIGN: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify trials testing viral vaccines that had not advanced to phase 2 before 2005, and the progress of each vaccine from phase 1 through to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure was tracked. Trial characteristics were double-coded. (Registration: Open Science Framework [https://osf.io/dmuzx/]). SETTING: Trials launched between January 2005 and March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Preventive viral vaccine candidates for 23 emerging or reemerged viral infectious diseases. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was the probability of vaccines advancing from launch of phase 2 to FDA licensure within 10 years. RESULTS: In total, 606 clinical trials forming 220 distinct development trajectories (267 343 enrolled participants) were identified. The probability of vaccines progressing from phase 2 to licensure within 10 years was 10.0% (95% CI, 2.6% to 16.9%), with most approvals representing H1N1 or H5N1 vaccines. The average timeline from phase 2 to approval was 4.4 years (range, 6.4 weeks to 13.9 years). The probabilities of advancing from phase 1 to 2, phase 2 to 3, and phase 3 to licensure within the total available follow-up time were 38.2% (CI, 30.7% to 45.0%), 38.3% (CI, 23.1% to 50.5%), and 61.1% (CI, 3.7% to 84.3%), respectively. LIMITATIONS: The study did not account for preclinical development and relied primarily on ClinicalTrials.gov and FDA resources. Success probabilities do not capture the varied reasons why vaccines fail to advance to regulatory approval. CONCLUSION: Success probabilities and timelines varied widely across different vaccine types and diseases. If a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is licensed within 18 months of the start of the pandemic, it will mark an unprecedented achievement for noninfluenza viral vaccine development.

Previous research has found that some people who use drugs [PWUDs] trained in overdose response might cut social ties with frequent overdosers, leading to more solitary opioid use and risk of death if someone overdoses alone. To examine the phenomenon of social distancing of people who overdose frequently, we used data from fifty-two in-depth qualitative interviews collected in Southern California with PWUDs who had recently witnessed an opioid overdose. Transcripts were reviewed and coded thematically, using the Integrated Threat Theory (ITT) to conceptualize the observed phenomenon. ITT outlines how realistic and symbolic threats are experienced by a group. We found that while some participants acknowledged the role of adulterated street drugs in overdoses, individualized blame was nonetheless imposed. Accusations of careless drug use practices fostered negative stereotyping towards frequent overdosers. This was attributed to the need to summon 911 for rescue, which often resulted in police dispatch. The intergroup relationship between police and PWUDs is precarious as police pose realistic threats onto PWUDs - such as incarceration, eviction, and manslaughter charges - leading to intragroup anxiety among PWUDs about future overdose events, and labelled frequent overdosers as liabilities. These threats, and inter/intra-group conflict, explained one reason how and why non-fatal overdoses led to social distancing events. People who overdose frequently were also accused of breaking the norm of drug user surreptitiousness; a symbolic threat that endangered the group due to police exposure. Social distancing might dampen exposure to the protective effect of peer-led interventions such as take-home naloxone programs, increasing risk of overdose death. This phenomenon highlights how intergroup dynamics are driving intragroup processes. Suggestions for tailoring public health interventions are discussed.","Bowles, J M; Smith, L R; Verdugo, S R; Wagner, K D; Davidson, P J",Soc Sci Med,71,16

We propose that subjects with metabolic syndrome, old age, and male gender have the greatest morbidity and mortality and have low stress proteins, in particular, low intracellular heme oxygenase (HO-1), making them particularly vulnerable to the disease. Additionally, COVID-19's heme reduction may contribute to even lower HO-1. Low-grade inflammation associated with these risk factors contributes to triggering a cytokine storm that spreads to multi-organ failure and near death. The high mortality of those treated with ventilator assistance may partially be explained by ventilator-induced inflammation. The cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of HO-1 can limit the infection's damage. A paradox of COVID-19 hospital admissions data suggests that fewer cigarette-smokers are admitted compared with non-smokers in the general population. This unexpected observation may result from smoke induction of HO-1. Therapies with anti-viral properties that raise HO-1 include certain anesthetics (sevoflurane or isoflurane), hemin, estrogen, statins, curcumin, resveratrol, and melatonin. Controlled trials of these HO-1 inducers should be done in order to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease.","Hooper, Philip L",Cell Stress Chaperones,71,27

Additionally, we demonstrate the endogenous interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in human cells and validate ACE2 as a TMPRSS2 substrate. Further, Camostat - a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, blocked the cleavage of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike without disrupting TMPRSS2-ACE2 interaction. Thus providing evidence for the first time a direct role of TMPRSS2 in priming the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, required for viral fusion to the host cell.

If all capillaries contribute equally to tissue oxygenation at all times, this physical limitation would render vasodilation and increased blood flow insufficient means to meet increased metabolic demands in the heart, muscle, and other organs. In 1920, Danish physiologist August Krogh was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his mathematical and quantitative, experimental demonstration of a solution to this conceptual problem: capillary recruitment, the active opening of previously closed capillaries to meet metabolic demands. Today, capillary recruitment is still mentioned in textbooks. When we suspect symptoms might represent hypoxia of a vascular origin, however, we search for relevant, flow-limiting conditions in our patients and rarely ascribe hypoxia or hypoxemia to short capillary transit times. This review describes how natural changes in capillary transit-time heterogeneity (CTH) and capillary hematocrit (HCT) across open capillaries during blood flow increases can account for a match of oxygen availability to metabolic demands in normal tissue. CTH and HCT depend on a number of factors: on blood properties, including plasma viscosity, the number, size, and deformability of blood cells, and blood cell interactions with capillary endothelium; on anatomical factors including glycocalyx, endothelial cells, basement membrane, and pericytes that affect the capillary diameter; and on any external compression. The review describes how risk factor- and disease-related changes in CTH and HCT interfere with flow-metabolism coupling and tissue oxygenation and discusses whether such capillary dysfunction contributes to vascular disease pathology.","Østergaard, Leif",J Appl Physiol (1985),71,10

Recent evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits neurotropic properties and causes neurological diseases. Here, we review the literature on neurological involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infections and the possible mechanisms of invasion of the nervous system by this virus, to provide a summary and critical analysis of the early reporting of neurological involvement in COVID-19. An exhaustive search of scientific articles on neurological involvement in COVID-19 was performed in the Web of Science, Scopus, Medline/PubMed, and several other databases. Nineteen relevant articles that had been published or were in preprint were carefully selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on our research, we found that patients with COVID-19 can present with neurological symptoms that can be broadly divided into central nervous system involvement, such as headache, dizziness, altered mental state, and disorientation, and peripheral nervous system involvement, such as anosmia and hypogeusia. Most of these patients are in the older age group and exhibit comorbidities, especially hypertension, and severe infection. In extreme presentations of COVID-19, some patients exhibit seizures, stroke, flaccid paraparesis, corticospinal weakness, and even coma. Moreover, the neurological man-ifestations can occur independently of the respiratory system. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause multiple neurological syndromes in a more complex presentation. Therefore, this review elucidated the involvement of the nervous system in SARS-CoV-2 infection and will hopefully help improve the management of COVID-19.","Payus, Alvin Oliver; Liew Sat Lin, Constance; Mohd Noh, Malehah; Jeffree, Mohammad Saffree; Ali, Raymond Azman",Bosn J Basic Med Sci,71,1

We examined the accuracy of AI ECG for identification of LVSD (defined as LVEF &#8804;40% by transthoracic echocardiogram [TTE]) in cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) patients. METHOD: We included unique Mayo Clinic CICU patients admitted from 2007 to 2018 who underwent AI-ECG and TTE within 7 days, at least one of which was during hospitalization. Discrimination of the AI-ECG for LVSD was determined using receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) values. RESULTS: We included 5680 patients with a mean age of 68 ± 15 years (37% females). Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was present in 55%. LVSD was present in 34% of patients (mean LVEF 48 ± 16%). The AI-ECG had an AUC of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.82-0.84) for discrimination of LVSD. Using the optimal cut-off, the AI-ECG had 73%, specificity 78%, negative predictive value 85% and overall accuracy 76% for LVSD. AUC values were higher for patients aged <70 years (0.85 versus 0.80), males (0.84 versus 0.79), patients without ACS (0.86 versus 0.80), and patients who did not undergo revascularization (0.84 versus 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: The AI-ECG algorithm had very good discrimination for LVSD in this critically-ill CICU cohort with a high prevalence of LVSD. Performance was better in younger male patients and those without ACS, highlighting those CICU patients in whom screening for LVSD using AI ECG may be more effective. The AI-ECG might potentially be useful for identification of LVSD in resource-limited settings when TTE is unavailable.","Jentzer, Jacob C; Kashou, Anthony H; Attia, Zachi I; Lopez-Jimenez, Francisco; Kapa, Suraj; Friedman, Paul A; Noseworthy, Peter A",Int. j. cardiol,71,26

The need for transactions is difficult to avoid so a design is needed that can minimize the spread of the virus while creating a sense of security and comfort for its users when carrying out these activities. The interaction barrier is a partition or divider that can limit one side to another which can be a solution to this problem. Using qualitative methods to identify and analyze visitor needs when transacting during the pandemic this design begins with conducting interviews and observations of users when carrying out transactions at the cashier as initial data to formulate problems which are then developed based on theories related to color shape and materials to analyze existing design needs. The design result is a functional interaction barrier which emphasizes the aspects of shape and color according to the needs of transaction activities at the cashier facility to help users stay healthy free from the risk of being exposed to germs and viruses.

However, these trials usually experience many challenges, such as extensive time frames, high financial cost, regulatory and administrative barriers, and insufficient workforce. In addition, CTs face several data management challenges pertaining to protocol compliance, patient enrollment, transparency, traceability, data integrity, and selective reporting. Blockchain can potentially address such challenges because of its intrinsic features and properties. Although existing literature broadly discusses the applicability of blockchain-based solutions for CTs, only a few studies present their working proof-of-concept. METHODS: We propose a blockchain-based framework for CT data management, using Ethereum smart contracts, which employs IPFS as the file storage system to automate processes and information exchange among CT stakeholders. CT documents stored in the IPFS are difficult to tamper with as they are given unique cryptographic hashes. We present algorithms that capture various stages of CT data management. We develop the Ethereum smart contract using Remix IDE that is validated under different scenarios. RESULTS: The proposed framework results are advantageous to all stakeholders ensuring transparency, data integrity, and protocol compliance. Although the proposed solution is tested on the Ethereum blockchain platform, it can be deployed in private blockchain networks using their native smart contract technologies. We make our smart contract code publicly available on Github. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the proposed framework can be highly effective in ensuring that the trial abides by the protocol and the functions are executed only by the stakeholders who are given permission. It also assures data integrity and promotes transparency and traceability of information among stakeholders.","Omar, Ilhaam A; Jayaraman, Raja; Salah, Khaled; Simsekler, Mecit Can Emre; Yaqoob, Ibrar; Ellahham, Samer",BMC Med Res Methodol,71,20

One question of debate is the relevance of grab versus composite samples when surveying for SARS-CoV-2 at various catchment scales. This study assessed the impact of grab versus composite sampling on the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in catchment basins with flow rates ranging from high-flow (wastewater treatment plant influent), to medium-flow (neighborhood-scale micro-sewershed), to low-flow (city block-scale micro-sewershed) and down to ultra-low flow (building scale). At the high-flow site, grab samples were reasonably comparable to 24-h composite samples with the same non-detect rate (0%) and SARS-CoV-2 concentrations that differed by 32% on the Log10 scale. However, as the flow rates decreased, the percentage of false-negative grab samples increased up to 44% and the SARS-CoV-2 concentrations of grab samples varied by up to 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to their respective composite sample concentrations. At the ultra-low-flow site, increased sampling frequencies down to every 5 min led to composite samples with higher fidelity to the SARS-CoV-2 load.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, RT-HNC patients were surveyed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for anxiety and depression and the distress thermometer (DT) for distress. HADS scores were compared with data pre-COVID-19. Additionally, we evaluated the COVID-19 impact on daily routines, treatment, and cancer care through a questionnaire. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included. The HADS mean score and estimated rates were 4.34 (±4.06)/22% for anxiety and 5.08 (±4.82)/22% for depression; in comparison, our historical control had 4.04 (±3.59)/20% for anxiety (p = .79) and 4.03 (±3.62)/17% for depression (p = .49). Mean DT score was 3.68 (±2.77). Responders were aware of COVID-19, afraid of having medical complications, believed it was life-threatening, did not miss appointments, believed their treatment was not impacted, and felt safe at the hospital amid the pandemic. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that anxiety, depression, and distress levels found in RT-HNC patients did not increase during the pandemic. Patients were afraid of being infected by COVID-19; however, they complied with their cancer treatment.","Rodrigues-Oliveira, Leticia; Kauark-Fontes, Elisa; Alves, Carolina Guimarães Bonfim; Tonaki, Juliana Ono; Gueiros, Luiz Alcino; Moutinho, Karina; Marta, Gustavo Nader; Barros, Luciana Rodrigues Carvalho; Santos-Silva, Alan Roger; Brandão, Thaís Bianca; Prado-Ribeiro, Ana Carolina",Oral dis,71,16

Despite this, organ failure and the need for transplant continues throughout the United States. Considering the perpetual scarcity of deceased donor organs, Kates et al present a viewpoint that advocates for the utilization of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive donors in selected cases. We present a review of the current literature that details the potential negative consequences of COVID-19-positive donors. The factors we consider include (1) the risk of blood transmission of SARS-CoV-2, (2) involvement of donor organs, (3) lack of effective therapies, (4) exposure of health care and recovery teams, (5) disease transmission and propagation, and (6) hospital resource utilization. While we acknowledge that transplant fulfills the mission of saving lives, it is imperative to consider the consequences not only to our recipients but also to the community and to health care workers, particularly in the absence of effective preventative or curative therapies. For these reasons, we believe the evidence and risks show that COVID-19 infection should continue to remain a contraindication for donation, as has been the initial response of donation and transplant societies.","Shah, Malay B; Lynch, Raymond J; El-Haddad, Hanine; Doby, Brianna; Brockmeier, Diane; Goldberg, David S",Am J Transplant,71,16
320982,320982,320982,Light as a potential treatment for pandemic coronavirus infections: A perspective,12.742873,6.4642797,2020,"BACKGROUND: Following the emergency use authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 (international non-proprietary name tozinameran) in Israel, the Ministry of Health (MoH) launched a campaign to immunise the 6·5 million residents of Israel aged 16 years and older. We estimated the real-world effectiveness of two doses of BNT162b2 against a range of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes and to evaluate the nationwide public-health impact following the widespread introduction of the vaccine. METHODS: We used national surveillance data from the first 4 months of the nationwide vaccination campaign to ascertain incident cases of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and outcomes, as well as vaccine uptake in residents of Israel aged 16 years and older. Vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 outcomes (asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalisation, severe or critical hospitalisation, and death) was calculated on the basis of incidence rates in fully vaccinated individuals (defined as those for whom 7 days had passed since receiving the second dose of vaccine) compared with rates in unvaccinated individuals (who had not received any doses of the vaccine), with use of a negative binomial regression model adjusted for age group (16-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and &#8805;85 years), sex, and calendar week. The proportion of spike gene target failures on PCR test among a nationwide convenience-sample of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens was used to estimate the prevelance of the B.1.1.7 variant. FINDINGS: During the analysis period (Jan 24 to April 3, 2021), there were 232 268 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 7694 COVID-19 hospitalisations, 4481 severe or critical COVID-19 hospitalisations, and 1113 COVID-19 deaths in people aged 16 years or older. By April 3, 2021, 4 714 932 (72·1%) of 6 538 911 people aged 16 years and older were fully vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2. Adjusted estimates of vaccine effectiveness at 7 days or longer after the second dose were 95·3% (95% CI 94·9-95·7; incidence rate 91·5 per 100 000 person-days in unvaccinated vs 3·1 per 100 000 person-days in fully vaccinated individuals) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 91·5% (90·7-92·2; 40·9 vs 1·8 per 100 000 person-days) against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 97·0% (96·7-97·2; 32·5 vs 0·8 per 100 000 person-days) against symptomatic COVID-19, 97·2% (96·8-97·5; 4·6 vs 0·3 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related hospitalisation, 97·5% (97·1-97·8; 2·7 vs 0·2 per 100 000 person-days) against severe or critical COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and 96·7% (96·0-97·3; 0·6 vs 0·1 per 100 000 person-days) against COVID-19-related death. In all age groups, as vaccine coverage increased, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes declined. 8006 of 8472 samples tested showed a spike gene target failure, giving an estimated prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant of 94·5% among SARS-CoV-2 infections. INTERPRETATION: Two doses of BNT162b2 are highly effective across all age groups (&#8805;16 years, including older adults aged &#8805;85 years) in preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalisations, severe disease, and death, including those caused by the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. There were marked and sustained declines in SARS-CoV-2 incidence corresponding to increasing vaccine coverage. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination can help to control the pandemic.

Modular approach to product development not only helps in reducing the product development time, but it also supports the automotive industry to customize the needs of consumers in an effective manner, create unique brand identity and reduce development cost. Product platform modularization is a great opportunity for the original equipment manufacturers (OEM's) to develop platform strategies across multiple brands and the ability to customize products. During current pandemic times with COVID-19, automotive manufactures will need to rethink their product strategies and focus on the platform mindset to deliver products that meet consumer demands. The paper provides a novel approach in developing modular platform solutions by defining guidelines for ""Common""and ""Unique""modules linked with critical interfaces. It also provides ways to keep ""Brand""uniqueness by maintaining modularity with the systems. A theoretical process is described in the paper with few examples to illustrate the modular approach and branding strategy. The paper also provides a basic approach for all vehicle types to allow manufacturers to focus their efforts on areas where there is high degree of modularity and commonality using the branding strategy. © 2021 SAE International.

Understanding the dynamics of the epidemic is essential for decision making, and to reduce the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic. The present study aimed to estimate the effective reproductive number (Rt) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection during the first 10 days of the outbreak in seven Latin American countries with the highest incidence of cases as of March 23, 2020. Furthermore, we chose to compare the seven countries with Spain and Italy given their history with the virus. METHODS: Incidence data retrieved from the COVID-19 data repository by Johns Hopkins University were analyzed. The Rt was calculated for the first 10 days of the epidemic in Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Mexico, and Peru. Rt estimations were compared with Spain and Italy values for the same interval. RESULTS: The median Rt for the first 10 days of the COVID-19 epidemic were 2.90 (2.67-3.14) for Spain and 2.83 (2.7-2.96) for Italy. Latin American Rt estimations were higher in Ecuador (3.95(3.7-4.21)), Panama (3.95(3.7-4.21)), and Brazil (3.95(3.7-4.21)). The smallest one was observed in Peru (2.36(2.11-2.63)). All Latin American countries had Rt greater than 2. CONCLUSIONS: The initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Latin America suggested a high Rt.

Commercial RNA extraction kits are often expensive, in limited supply, and do not always fully inactivate the virus. Together, this calls for the development of safer methods for SARS-CoV-2 extraction that utilize readily available reagents and equipment present in most standard laboratories. We optimized and simplified a RNA extraction method combining a high molar acidic guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC) solution, phenol and chloroform. First, we determined the GITC/RNA dilution thresholds compatible with an efficient two-step RT-qPCR for B2M mRNA in nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swab samples. Second, we optimized a one-step RT-qPCR against SARS-CoV-2 using NP and OP samples. We furthermore tested a SARS-CoV-2 dilution series to determine the detection threshold. The method enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). The protocol is simple, safe, and expands analysis capacity as the inactivated samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral work. The method takes about 30 min from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA and circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits.","Kalnina, Lelde; Mateu-Regué, Àngels; Oerum, Stephanie; Hald, Annemette; Gerstoft, Jan; Oerum, Henrik; Nielsen, Finn Cilius; Iversen, Astrid K N",APMIS acta pathol. microbiol. immunol. scand,71,24

The search strategy used keywords, ""etomidate,"" ""adrenal insufficiency,"" ""glucocorticoid,"" and ""intensive care."" Both authors reviewed electronic data search titles, abstracts and extracted data, which were checked by the other reviewer. Primary outcome was 28-day survival. Secondary outcome was adrenal insufficiency. RESULTS: There were 29 trials of etomidate versus comparators in 8584 patients. Etomidate was associated with adrenal insufficiency (risk ratio (rr) = 1·54, 95% CI; 1·42, 1·67, p < 0.001) and increased overall relative mortality rates (rr = 1.09, CI;1.04,1.16, p = 0.001). Meta-regression showed that with etomidate there was a continuous progressive relative risk of mortality associated with increasing severity of illness (predefined in each article by standard critical illness scores). In those patients who had a predicted mortality rate > the median for this analysis (predicted mortality 44%) the relative mortality rate (rr) = 1.20, Ci;1.12,1.29, p < 0.001, the absolute risk difference (rd) = 0.08, CI;0.05,0.11, p < 0.0001 and the number needed to harm (1/rd) was 12.5. In those with a calculated predicted mortality <44% there was no increase in relative mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas etomidate causes adrenal insufficiency, it was not shown to increase mortality in many analyzed here in ICU settings. However, etomidate associated relative mortality rates increased progressively and correlated with the severity of critical illness scores. Intensivists should anticipate the need for glucocorticoid supplementation after etomidate in those with severe critical illness and in those with acute deterioration of vital signs.","Albert, Stewart G; Sitaula, Sujata",J Intensive Care Med,71,3

To investigate the possible structural differences at basic levels for the three viruses, genomic and proteomic sequences were downloaded and converted to polynomial datasets. Seven attribute weighting (feature selection) models were employed to find the key differences in their genome's nucleotide sequence. Most attribute weighting models selected the final nucleotide sequences (from 29,000th nucleotide positions to the end of the genome) as significantly different among the three virus classes. The genome and proteome sequences of this hot zone area (which corresponds to the 3'UTR region and encodes for nucleoprotein (N)) and Spike (S) protein sequences (as the most important viral protein) were converted into binary images and were analyzed by image processing techniques and Convolutional deep Neural Network (CNN). Although the predictive accuracy of CNN for Spike (S) proteins was low (0.48%), the machine-based learning algorithms were able to classify the three members of coronaviridae viruses with 100% accuracy based on 3'UTR region. For the first time ever, the relationship between the possible structural differences of coronaviruses at the sequential levels and their pathogenesis are being reported, which paves the road to deciphering the high pathogenicity of the SARS-COV-2 virus.","Ahsan, Reza; Tahsili, Mohammad Reza; Ebrahimi, Faezeh; Ebrahimie, Esmaeil; Ebrahimi, Mansour",Comput Biol Med,71,29

In this study, the cumulative incidence rate (CIR) and cumulative mortality rate (CMR) of all countries affected by the new corona outbreak were calculated at the end of March and April, 2020. Prior to the implementation of hot spot analysis, the spatial autocorrelation results of CIR were obtained. Hot spot analysis and Anselin Local Moran's I indices were then applied to accurately locate high and low-risk clusters of COVID-19 globally. San Marino and Italy revealed the highest CMR by the end of March, though Belgium took the place of Italy as of 30th April. At the end of the research period (by 30th April), the CIR showed obvious spatial clustering. Accordingly, southern, northern and western Europe were detected in the high-high clusters demonstrating an increased risk of COVID-19 in these regions and also the surrounding areas. Countries of northern Africa exhibited a clustering of hot spots, with a confidence level above 95%, even though these areas assigned low CIR values. The hot spots accounted for nearly 70% of CIR. Furthermore, analysis of clusters and outliers demonstrated that these countries are situated in the low-high outlier pattern. Most of the surveyed countries that exhibited clustering of high values (hot spot) with a confidence level of 99% (by 31st March) and 95% (by 30th April) were dedicated higher CIR values. In conclusion, hot spot analysis coupled with Anselin local Moran's I provides a scrupulous and objective approach to determine the locations of statistically significant clusters of COVID-19 cases shedding light on the high-risk districts.","Shariati, Mohsen; Mesgari, Tahoora; Kasraee, Mahboobeh; Jahangiri-Rad, Mahsa",J Environ Health Sci Eng,71,16

Chronic metabolic diseases are known risk factors for increased mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In turn, COVID pandemics imposed sudden changes in lifestyle and social isolation with consequent potential cardiometabolic sequelae. The present study aimed at investigating the impact of changes in lifestyle and social life on metabolic profile in hyperprolactinemic or osteoporotic patients without pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases at the time of COVID-19. METHODS: The primary study outcome measurement was the prevalence of obesity, arterial hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome after COVID-19 outbreak. Seventy-four patients (21 men and 53 women, aged 51.8 ± 17.8 years) were admitted to the outpatient clinic of the Neuroendocrine Disease Unit at University ""Federico II"" of Naples, Italy, as per their routine clinical practice because of tumoral and non-tumoral hyperprolactinemia in 52 patients (70.3%), and osteoporosis/osteopenia in 22 (29.7%). Among female patients, 25 (47.2%) were at menopausal age. RESULTS: At the end of lockdown, prevalence of obesity (from 37.8% to 51.3%, p < 0.0001), dyslipidemia (from 28.4 to 48.6%, p = 0.003) and metabolic syndrome (from 14.9 to 27%, p < 0.0001) significantly increased compared to pre-COVID evaluation. No significant change was found in the prevalence of arterial hypertension and IGT/DM. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has led to a rapid increase in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, potentially contributing to the increased COVID-19 related mortality.","Auriemma, R S; Pirchio, R; Liccardi, A; Scairati, R; Del Vecchio, G; Pivonello, R; Colao, A",J. endocrinol. invest,71,12

Drug adherence by the patient but also adherence to guidelines by the physician are suboptimal. This review highlights aspects of DOAC treatment during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and selected challenging scenarios. RECENT FINDINGS: For patients with a newly diagnosed indication for oral anticoagulation, a new interim clinical guidance recommends starting DOAC instead of vitamin K antagonists if DOAC are not contraindicated. The goal is to reduce the potential exposure of patients to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus during the routine coagulation monitoring visits. As COVID-19 can lead to kidney failure, we discuss the challenges of DOAC dosing in kidney failures. Finally, we discuss two common challenges - when to start a DOAC after an ischemic stroke linked to atrial fibrillation, and whether cerebral microbleeds, including their count, are per se a contraindication to DOAC.

The critical habitat area below which the disease dies out is directly proportion to the time taken to identify and hospitalise infected individuals. Results also show that disease persistence in the community is guaranteed even with minimal admission of infected individuals. Our results further show that as the level of compliance to standard operating procedures (SOPs) increases, then the disease prevalence peaks are greatly reduced and delayed.

Available guidance is discordant, ranging from standard care to the use of therapeutic anticoagulation for enhanced thromboprophylaxis (ET). Local ET protocols have been empirically determined and are generally intermediate between standard prophylaxis and full anticoagulation. Concerns have been raised in regard to the potential risk of haemorrhage associated with therapeutic anticoagulation. This report describes the prevalence and safety of ET strategies in European Intensive Care Unit (ICUs) and their association with outcomes during the first wave of the COVID pandemic, with particular focus on haemorrhagic complications and ICU mortality. METHODS: Retrospective, observational, multi-centre study including adult critically ill COVID-19 patients. Anonymised data included demographics, clinical characteristics, thromboprophylaxis and/or anticoagulation treatment. Critical haemorrhage was defined as intracranial haemorrhage or bleeding requiring red blood cells transfusion. Survival was collected at ICU discharge. A multivariable mixed effects generalised linear model analysis matched for the propensity for receiving ET was constructed for both ICU mortality and critical haemorrhage. RESULTS: A total of 852 (79% male, age 66 [37-85] years) patients were included from 28 ICUs. Median body mass index and ICU length of stay were 27.7 (25.1-30.7) Kg/m2 and 13 (7-22) days, respectively. Thromboembolic events were reported in 146 patients (17.1%), of those 78 (9.2%) were PE. ICU mortality occurred in 335/852 (39.3%) patients. ET was used in 274 (32.1%) patients, and it was independently associated with significant reduction in ICU mortality (log odds = 0.64 [95% CIs 0.18-1.1; p = 0.0069]) but not an increased risk of critical haemorrhage (log odds = 0.187 [95%CI - 0.591 to - 0.964; p = 0.64]). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of critically ill patients with a high prevalence of thromboembolic events, ET was associated with reduced ICU mortality without an increased burden of haemorrhagic complications. This study suggests ET strategies are safe and associated with favourable outcomes. Whilst full anticoagulation has been questioned for prophylaxis in these patients, our results suggest that there may nevertheless be a role for enhanced / intermediate levels of prophylaxis. Clinical trials investigating causal relationship between intermediate thromboprophylaxis and clinical outcomes are urgently needed.","Lavinio, Andrea; Ercole, Ari; Battaglini, Denise; Magnoni, Sandra; Badenes, Rafael; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Helbok, Raimund; Thomas, William; Pelosi, Paolo; Robba, Chiara",Crit Care,71,16

We evaluated the extent of environmental contamination in the ICU and correlated this with patient and disease factors, including the impact of different ventilatory modalities. METHODS: In this observational study, surface environmental samples collected from ICU patient rooms and common areas were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Select samples from the common area were tested by cell culture. Clinical data were collected and correlated to the presence of environmental contamination. Results were compared to historical data from a previous study in general wards. RESULTS: In total, 200 samples from 20 patient rooms and 75 samples from common areas and the staff pantry were tested. The results showed that 14 rooms had at least 1 site contaminated, with an overall contamination rate of 14% (28 of 200 samples). Environmental contamination was not associated with day of illness, ventilatory mode, aerosol-generating procedures, or viral load. The frequency of environmental contamination was lower in the ICU than in general ward rooms. Eight samples from the common area were positive, though all were negative on cell culture. CONCLUSION: Environmental contamination in the ICU was lower than in the general wards. The use of mechanical ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen was not associated with greater surface contamination, supporting their use and safety from an infection control perspective. Transmission risk via environmental surfaces in the ICUs is likely to be low. Nonetheless, infection control practices should be strictly reinforced, and transmission risk via droplet or airborne spread remains.","Ong, Sean Wei Xiang; Lee, Pei Hua; Tan, Yian Kim; Ling, Li Min; Ho, Benjamin Choon Heng; Ng, Ching Ging; Wang, Dong Ling; Tan, Boon Huan; Leo, Yee-Sin; Ng, Oon-Tek; Wong, Michelle Su Yen; Marimuthu, Kalisvar",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,71,17

BACKGROUND: Improving health equity for Maori, similar to other colonised Indigenous peoples globally, requires urgent attention. Improving the quality of health practitioners' engagement with Indigenous Maori accessing health services is one area that could support improving Maori health equity. While the Fundamentals of Care framework offers a promising relational approach, it lacks consideration of culture, whanau or family, and spirituality, important for Indigenous health and wellbeing. DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative literature review on Maori models of health and wellbeing yielded nine models to inform a Maori-centred relational model of care. We followed the PRISMA guidelines for reporting literature reviews. RESULTS: Four overarching themes were identified that included dimensions of health and wellbeing; whanaungatanga (connectedness); whakawhanaungatanga (building relationships); and socio-political health context (colonisation, urbanisation, racism, and marginalisation). Health and wellbeing for Maori is a holistic and relational concept. Building relationships that include whanau (extended family) is a cultural imperative. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance and relevance of relational approaches to engaging Maori and their whanau accessing health services. It signals the necessary foundations for health practitioners to build trust-based relationships with Maori. Key elements for a Maori-centred model of relational care include whakawhanaungatanga (the process of building relationships) using tikanga (cultural protocols and processes) informed by cultural values of aroha (compassion and empathy), manaakitanga (kindness and hospitality), mauri (binding energy), wairua (importance of spiritual wellbeing). RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Culturally-based models of health and wellbeing provide indicators of important cultural values, concepts and practices and processes. These can then inform the development of a Maori-centred relational model of care to address inequity.","Wilson, Denise; Moloney, Eleanor; Parr, Jenny M; Aspinall, Cathleen; Slark, Julia",J. clin. nurs,71,16

This study aimed to compare levels of physical activity, stress, and fear and quality of life and sleep quality between patients with asthma and healthy individuals during the pandemic. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with asthma and 22 healthy individuals aged between 18 and 65 years were included. Physical activity level using ""International Physical Activity Questionnaire""; stress level, using ""Perceived Stress Scale-14""; fear level, using ""Fear of COVID-19 Scale""; sleep quality, using ""Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index""; and quality of life, using ""World Health Organization Quality of Life"" were evaluated. RESULTS: Total physical activity level, vigorous physical activity level, and walking score of patients with asthma were lower than healthy individuals (p < .05). Sitting time of patients with asthma was higher than healthy individuals (p < .05). Subjective sleep quality, latency, duration, efficiency, sleeping medication use, and daytime dysfunction of both were similar (p > .05). Only sleep disturbance score of patients with asthma were higher than healthy individuals (p < .05). Quality of life, stress, and fear levels of both were similar (p > .05). CONCLUSION: During pandemic, patients with asthma are more inactive than healthy individuals regardless of the presence of a chronic disease; pandemic negatively affected stress, fear levels, sleep, and quality of life. To minimize the effects of restrictions and psychological burden caused by pandemic and to encourage patients with asthma to perform physical activities, conducting studies to control stress levels and increasing quality of life and sleep of all individuals are important.","Dasdemir, Kübra Ayse; Suner-Keklik, Sinem",J Asthma,71,16

Based on our combined two decades of teaching in feminist studies, as well as the work of Audre Lorde, Paulo Freire, and Michel Foucault, we argue that, because of its disciplinary functions, grading cannot be a feminist practice. While much has been written about how grades discipline students, we argue that the grading regime implemented in US universities and colleges also disciplines individual faculty members as well as their programs and departments. Grading is one way in which a rhetoric of excellence is perpetuated, a rhetoric that enforces a capitalist ethic of production and profitability. Grading is also a means through which the liberatory power of social justice–oriented programs and departments is co-opted by the neoliberal university. The article concludes that a feminist approach to teaching and learning requires a move toward alternative modes of learning assessment as part of a larger reconfiguring of the university. It closes by inviting the readers to join the authors in an organized movement against grading.","Carolina Alonso, Bejarano Soderling Stina",Feminist Formations,71,16

Average costs per HIVST kit distributed were $15 for FSW (Côte d'Ivoire: $13, Senegal: $17, Mali: $16), $23 for MSM (Côte d'Ivoire: $15, Senegal: $27, Mali: $28), and $80 for PWUD (Côte d'Ivoire: $16, Senegal: $144), driven by personnel costs (47-78% of total costs), and HIVST kits costs (2-20%). Average costs at scale-up were $11 for FSW (Côte d'Ivoire: $9, Senegal: $13, Mali: $10), $16 for MSM (Côte d'Ivoire: $9, Senegal: $23, Mali: $17), and $32 for PWUD (Côte d'Ivoire: $14, Senegal: $50). Cost reductions were mainly explained by the spreading of IPO costs over higher HIVST distribution volumes and progressive IPO withdrawal at scale-up. In all countries, CSO-led HIVST kit provision to KP showed relatively high costs during the study period related to the progressive integration of the programme to CSO activities and contextual challenges (COVID-19 pandemic, country safety concerns). In transition to scale-up and integration of the HIVST programme into CSO activities, this model shows large potential for substantial economies of scale. Further research will assess the overall cost-effectiveness of this model.","d039,; Elbée, Marc; Traore, Métogara Mohamed; Badiane, Kéba; Vautier, Anthony; Simo Fotso, Arlette; Kabemba, Odé Kanku; Rouveau, Nicolas; Godfrey-Faussett, Peter; Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu; Boily, Marie-Claude; Medley, Graham Francis; Larmarange, Joseph; Terris-Prestholt, Fern",Front Public Health,71,22

There is no study related to the patients' preference for systemic therapy during this pandemic. We have conducted a prospective study to analyze that aspect. METHODS: All consecutive patients who visited during the lockdown period from April 1-10, 2020, for systemic chemotherapy were included in the study for a questionnaire-based survey to evaluate the willingness to continue chemotherapy during this pandemic and factors influencing the decisions. RESULTS: A total of 302 patients were included (median age, 56 years; range, 21-77 years). Most common sites of cancer were breast (n = 114), lung (n = 44), ovary (n = 34), and colon (n = 20). Home address was within the city for 125 patients (42%), outside the city for 138 (46%), and outside the state for 37 (12%). Treatment was curative in 150 patients and palliative in 152. Educational status was primary and above for 231 patients and no formal schooling for 71. A total of 203 patients wanted to continue chemotherapy, 40 wanted to defer, and 56 wanted the physician to decide. Knowledge about COVID-19 strongly correlated with intent of treatment (P = .01), disease status (P = .02), knowledge about immunosuppression (P < .001), home location (P = .02), and education status (P = .003). The worry about catching SARS-CoV-2 was high in those with controlled disease (P = .06) and knowledge about immunosuppression (P = .02). Worry about disease progression was more with palliative intent (P < .001). CONCLUSION: This study shows that oncology patients in our country are more worried about disease progression than the SARS-CoV-2 and wish to continue chemotherapy during this pandemic. The treatment guidelines in the COVID-19 scenario should incorporate patients' perspectives.","Ghosh, Joydeep; Ganguly, Sandip; Mondal, Debapriya; Pandey, Prashant; Dabkara, Deepak; Biswas, Bivas",JCO Glob Oncol,71,3

Mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) might be used for risk assessment. This study investigates MR-proADM for RRT prediction in ICU patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We analysed data of consecutive patients with COVID-19, requiring ICU admission at a university hospital in Germany between March and September 2020. Clinical characteristics, details on AKI, and RRT were assessed. MR-proADM was measured on admission. RESULTS: 64 patients were included (49 (77%) males). Median age was 62.5y (54-73). 47 (73%) patients were ventilated and 50 (78%) needed vasopressors. 25 (39%) patients had severe ARDS, and 10 patients needed veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 29 (45%) patients required RRT; median time from admission to RRT start was 2 (1-9) days. MR-proADM on admission was higher in the RRT group (2.491 vs. 1.23 nmol/l; p = 0.002) and showed the highest correlation with renalSOFA. ROC curve analysis showed that MR-proADM predicts RRT with an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.543-0.828; p = 0.019). In multivariable logistic regression MR-proADM was an independent predictor (OR: 3.813, 95% CI 1.110-13.102, p<0.05) for RRT requirement. CONCLUSION: AKI requiring RRT is frequent in ICU patients with COVID-19. MR-proADM on admission was able to predict RRT requirement, which may be of interest for risk stratification and management.","Roedl, Kevin; Jarczak, Dominik; Fischer, Marlene; Haddad, Munif; Boenisch, Olaf; de Heer, Geraldine; Burdelski, Christoph; Frings, Daniel; Sensen, Barbara; Karakas, Mahir; Kluge, Stefan; Nierhaus, Axel",Biomarkers,71,15

Physician trainees and the education system that serves them adapted quickly so that trainees could finish the academic year on time and advance to the next phase of training without compromising clinical competency or public safety. Systemic changes have had the most significant impact on telemedicine training, virtual learning, secure testing, and the interview process for residency and fellowship training positions. Trainees are now getting regular, supervised practice experience with telemedicine. Some secure testing is being done remotely, without jeopardizing examination test items or trainee assessment. Attending physicians are experimenting with novel ways to engage learners with video for virtual rounds to keep the rounding team safe. Finally, the interview process for medical school, residency, and fellowship programs, which has traditionally been an expensive and travel-laden process, has been made completely virtual for the first time ever. These changes have disadvantages, including a lack of social connection, potential distraction when learning remotely, and limited contact with a potential training program when interviewing by video.

Yang et al., medRxiv 2020; W. Wang et al., 2020.3786; A Senok et al., Infect Drug Resist 2020). Currently, the gold standard for virus identification is the nasopharyngeal (NP) swab (N. Sethuraman et al., JAMA 2020; A.J. Jamal et al Clinical Infect Disease 2021). Saliva samples, however, offer clear practical and logistical advantages (K.K.W To et al, Clinical Microb and Infect; A.L. Wylle et al. N Engl J Med 2020; N. Matic et al, Eur J Clin 2021) but due to lack of collection, transport, and storage solutions, high-throughput saliva-based laboratory tests are difficult to scale up as a screening or diagnostic tool (D. Esser et al., Biomark Insights 2008; E. Kaufman et al., Crit Rev Oral Biol Med2002). With this study, we aimed to validate an intra-laboratory molecular detection method for SARS-CoV-2 on saliva samples collected in a new storage saline solution, comparing the results to NP swabs to determine the difference in sensitivity between the two tests. MethodsIn this study, 156 patients (cases) and 1005 asymptomatic subjects (controls) were enrolled and tested simultaneously for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome by RT-PCR on both NP swab and saliva samples. Saliva samples were collected in a preservative and inhibiting saline solution (Biofarma Srl). Internal method validation was performed to standardize the entire workflow for saliva samples. ResultsThe identification of SARS-CoV-2 conducted on saliva samples showed a clinical sensitivity of 95.1% and specificity of 97.8% compared to NP swabs. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 81% while the negative predictive value (NPV) was 99.5%. Test concordance was 97.6% (Cohens Kappa=0.86; 95% CI 0.81-0.91). The LoD of the test was 5 viral copies for both samples. ConclusionsRT-PCR assays conducted on a stored saliva sample achieved similar performance to those on NP swabs and this may provide a very effective tool for population screening and diagnosis. Collection of saliva in a stabilizing solution makes the test more convenient and widely available; furthermore, the denaturing properties of the solution reduce the infective risks belonging to sample manipulation.","Bulfoni, Michela; Sozio, Emanuela; Marcon, Barbara; Martino, Maria De; Cesselli, Daniela; Carlo, Chiara De; Martinella, Romina; Migotti, Angelica; Vania, Eleonora; Zanus-Fortes, Agnese; Piero, Jessica De; Nencioni, Emanuele; Tascini, Carlo; Isola, Miriam; Curcio, Francesco",,71,3

Unfortunately, sIgA remains challenging to produce in large quantities, and easily aggregates, which prevented their use in clinical applications. To develop sIgA-like tetravalent antibodies that are stable and can be easily produced in large quantities, we designed two IgGs possessing 4 identical Fab domains, with the Fabs arranged either in serial or in the diametrically opposite orientation. As a proof-of-concept, we engineered these tetravalent IgG constructs to bind a ubiquitous sperm antigen using a Fab previously isolated from an immune infertile woman. Both constructs possess at least 4-fold greater agglutination potency and induced much more rapid sperm agglutination than the parent IgG, while exhibiting comparable production yields and identical thermostability as the parent IgG. These tetravalent IgGs offer promise for non-hormonal contraception and underscores the multimerization of IgG as a promising strategy to enhance antibody effector functions based on immune exclusion.","Shrestha, Bhawana; Schaefer, Alison; Chavez, Elizabeth C; Kopp, Alexander J; Jacobs, Timothy M; Moench, Thomas R; Lai, Samuel K",Acta biomater,71,19

Assuming skill acquisition is the target of training, programs should include time and space for repeated practice opportunities structured through evidence-based learning theories (Amodeo et al. in Adm Soc Work 33:423-438, 2009). Essential learning attributes derived from Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller in Cognit Sci 12:257-285, 1988) and the Theory of Deliberate Practice (Ericsson et al. in Psychol Rev 100:363-406, 1993) can effectively integrate into virtual simulations intended to build expertise. Virtual Home Simulation (VHS) and Virtual Motivational Interviewing (VMI) are presented in this paper as an approach to develop virtual simulations that provide child welfare workers a means to deliberately practice essential skills toward competence before entering the workforce. This paper reviews the development process, specific design aspects, and lessons learned as a guide on how to integrate effective learning attributes.

However, risks associated with CVC may be high in the initial phase of severe sepsis because of patient instability. The timing of CVC itself has not been fully evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to assess the association between CVC in the initial care of patients with severe sepsis and corresponding mortality rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a nationwide retrospective analysis using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2016. We identified patients who received CVC within 30 days from hospital admission. We compared the 30-day mortality between two groups: patients who received CVC within two days (early) after admission and those who received CVC three or more days (delayed) after admission, using marginal structural models with inverse probability treatment weighting. RESULTS: We identified 6,028 eligible patients from 911 hospitals among 27,497 patients with severe sepsis for this study; 4,544 (75.4%) received early CVC. Patients with early CVC had poor prognostic baselines and received more intense treatment than patients with delayed CVC. After adjusting for baseline and time-dependent treatment variables, we found that there were no significant differences between patients who received CVC within two days after admission and those who received CVC three or more days after admission (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% Confidence interval 0.62-1.10). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with severe sepsis, early CVC was not associated with improved in-hospital mortality rates.","Edakubo, Shunsuke; Inoue, Norihiko; Fushimi, Kiyohide",Shock (Augusta Ga.),71,29

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the content and characteristics of TikTok videos that are related to an important aspect of community mitigation-the use of masks as a method for interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In total, 100 trending videos with the hashtag #WearAMask (ie, a campaign on TikTok), along with 32 videos that were posted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and involved masks in any way (ie, all related WHO videos at the time of this study), were included in our sample. We collected the metadata of each post, and created content categories based on fact sheets that were provided by the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We used these fact sheets to code the characteristics of mask use. RESULTS: Videos that were posted on TikTok and had the hashtag #WearAMask garnered almost 500 million views, and videos that were posted by the WHO garnered almost 57 million views. Although the ratio of the number of trending #WearAMask videos to the number of WHO videos was around 3:1, the #WearAMask videos received almost 10 times as many cumulative views as the WHO videos. In total, 68% (68/100) of the trending #WearAMask videos involved humor and garnered over 355 million cumulative views. However, only 9% (3/32) of the WHO videos involved humor. Furthermore, 27% (27/100) of the trending #WearAMask videos involved dance and garnered over 130 million cumulative views, whereas none of the WHO videos involved dance. CONCLUSIONS: This study is one of the first to describe how TikTok is being used to mitigate the community spread of COVID-19 by promoting mask use.

There are reports of breathlessness in patients many months post-infection. Purpose This study aimed to determine if hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI (XeMRI) imaging could identify the possible cause of breathlessness in patients three months after hospital discharge following COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods This prospective study was undertaken between August and December 2020, with patients and healthy control volunteers enrolled. All patients underwent: lung function tests; ventilation and dissolved phase XeMRI, with the mean Red Blood Cell (RBC):Tissue Plasma (TP) ratio to be calculated; and a low dose chest CT scored for the degree of post-COVID-19 abnormalities. Healthy controls underwent XeMRI. The intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated for volunteer and patient scans, to assess repeatability. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Cohen's effect size calculated to assess for differences between RBC:TP in patient and controls. Results 9 patients (mean age 57±7 years, Male = 6) and 5 volunteers (29 ± 3 years, Female = 5) were enrolled. Patient mean time from hospital discharge was 169, range 116-254 days. There was a difference in RBC:TP between patients and controls (0.3 ± 0.1 versus 0.5 ± 0.1, respectively, p = 0.001, effect size = 1.36). There was significant difference between the RBC and gas phase spectral full width at half maximum (FWHM) between volunteers and patients (median ± 95 % confidence interval, 567 ± 1 vs 507 ± 81, p = 0.002 and 104 ± 2 vs 122 ± 17, p = 0.004, respectively). Results were reproducible with Intraclass Correlation Coefficients of 0.82 and 0.88 for patients and volunteers respectively. Participants had normal or near normal CT scans, mean 7/25, range 0-10/25. Conclusion Xe MRI showed alveolar-capillary diffusion limitation in all 9 post COVID-19 pneumonia patients despite normal or nearly normal CT scans.

This cell surface receptor with its disseminated expression is important in angiogenesis, tumor progression, viral entry, axonal guidance, and immune function. NRP-1 is implicated in several aspects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection including possible spread through the olfactory bulb and into the central nervous system and increased NRP-1 RNA expression in lungs of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Up-regulation of NRP-1 protein in diabetic kidney cells hint at its importance in a population at risk of severe COVID-19. Involvement of NRP-1 in immune function is compelling, given the role of an exaggerated immune response in disease severity and deaths due to COVID-19. NRP-1 has been suggested to be an immune checkpoint of T cell memory. It is unknown whether involvement and up-regulation of NRP-1 in COVID-19 may translate into disease outcome and long-term consequences, including possible immune dysfunction. It is prudent to further research NRP-1 and its possibility of serving as a therapeutic target in SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Although collective activity can be modified through imposed measures to control epidemic progression, spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here we introduce a stochastic epidemic model that implements population responses driven by individual- and time-dependent risk-taking propensity. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude without the need to consider external modulation of parameters. Successive waves tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value $R=1$. This process is a consequence of the interplay of the fractions of susceptible and infected population and the average risk-taking propensity, as shown by a mean-field approach. The proposed mechanism also shows how, under the threat of contagion, the distribution of individual risk propensities evolves towards a well-defined profile. Successive waves trigger selective sweeps of risk-taking propensity at a pace determined by individual risk reaction rates. This kind of collective, self-generated pressure, may therefore shape risk-aversion profiles associated to epidemics in human groups. The final state is self-organized and generic, independent of the parameter values. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behavior can, by themselves, explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, as the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around $R=1$ observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.","Manrubia, Susanna; Zanette, Dami'an H.",,71,16

Although such measures are effective in preventing the spread of the virus, medical professionals strongly voiced a caveat concerning the pandemic emotional burnout at the individual level. Although the lockdown limited individuals' interpersonal communication with people in their social networks, it is common that individuals turn to social media to seek and share health information, exchange social support, and express pandemic-generated feelings. OBJECTIVE: Based on a holistic and multilevel perspective, this study examines how pandemic-related emotional exhaustion enacts intrapersonal, interpersonal, and hyperpersonal emotional regulation strategies, and then evaluates the effectiveness of these strategies, with a particular interest in understanding the role of hyperpersonal-level regulation or social media-based regulation. METHODS: Using an online panel, this study sampled 538 Chinese internet users from Hubei Province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Survey data collection lasted for 12 days from February 7-18, 2020, two weeks after Hubei Province was placed under quarantine. The sample had an average age of 35 (SD 10.65, range 18-78) years, and a majority were married (n=369, 68.6%). RESULTS: Using structural equation modeling, this study found that intrapersonal-level (B=0.22; ß=.24; P<.001) and interpersonal-level (B=0.35; ß=.49; P<.001) emotional regulation strategies were positively associated with individuals' outcome reappraisal. In contrast with intrapersonal and interpersonal regulations, hyperpersonal (social media-based) regulation strategies, such as disclosing and retweeting negative emotions, were negatively related to the outcome reappraisal (B=-1.00; ß=-.80; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous literature, intrapersonal-level regulation (eg, cognitive reappraisal, mindfulness, and self-kindness) and interpersonal-level supportive interaction may generate a buffering effect on emotional exhaustion and promote individuals' reappraisal toward the stressful situation. However, hyperpersonal-level regulation may exacerbate the experienced negative emotions and impede reappraisal of the pandemic situation. It is speculated that retweeting content that contains pandemic-related stress and anxiety may cause a digital emotion contagion. Individuals who share other people's negative emotional expressions on social media are likely to be affected by the negative affect contagion. More importantly, the possible benefits of intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulations may be counteracted by social media or hyperpersonal regulation. This suggests the necessity to conduct social media-based health communication interventions to mitigate the social media-wide negative affect contagion if lockdown policies related to highly infectious diseases are initiated.","Shao, Ruosi; Shi, Zhen; Zhang, Di",J Med Internet Res,71,1

METHODS: Using an online panel, this study sampled 538 Chinese internet users from Hubei Province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Survey data collection lasted for 12 days from February 7-18, 2020, two weeks after Hubei Province was placed under quarantine. The sample had an average age of 35 (SD 10.65, range 18-78) years, and a majority were married (n=369, 68.6%). RESULTS: Using structural equation modeling, this study found that intrapersonal-level (B=0.22; ß=.24; P<.001) and interpersonal-level (B=0.35; ß=.49; P<.001) emotional regulation strategies were positively associated with individuals' outcome reappraisal. In contrast with intrapersonal and interpersonal regulations, hyperpersonal (social media-based) regulation strategies, such as disclosing and retweeting negative emotions, were negatively related to the outcome reappraisal (B=-1.00; ß=-.80; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous literature, intrapersonal-level regulation (eg, cognitive reappraisal, mindfulness, and self-kindness) and interpersonal-level supportive interaction may generate a buffering effect on emotional exhaustion and promote individuals' reappraisal toward the stressful situation. However, hyperpersonal-level regulation may exacerbate the experienced negative emotions and impede reappraisal of the pandemic situation. It is speculated that retweeting content that contains pandemic-related stress and anxiety may cause a digital emotion contagion. Individuals who share other people's negative emotional expressions on social media are likely to be affected by the negative affect contagion. More importantly, the possible benefits of intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulations may be counteracted by social media or hyperpersonal regulation. This suggests the necessity to conduct social media-based health communication interventions to mitigate the social media-wide negative affect contagion if lockdown policies related to highly infectious diseases are initiated.","Shao, Ruosi; Shi, Zhen; Zhang, Di",J Med Internet Res,71,33

Recently, because of its positive results in clinical trials, remdesivir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 through Emergency Use Authorization. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We first constructed the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 RdRp (with a sequence identity of 95.8%). We then built a putative preinsertion binding structure by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp without the RNA template. The putative binding structure was further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting stable preinsertion state of remdesivir appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the RNA template when aligned with the newly solved cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The relative binding free energy between remdesivir and ATP was calculated to be -2.80 ± 0.84 kcal/mol, where remdesivir bound much stronger to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp than the natural substrate ATP. The â¼100-fold improvement in the Kd from remdesivir over ATP indicates an effective replacement of ATP in blocking of the RdRp preinsertion site. Key residues D618, S549, and R555 are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir. These findings suggest that remdesivir can potentially act as a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-chain terminator, effectively stopping its RNA replication, with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and/or drug resistance studies.","Zhang, Leili; Zhou, Ruhong",J. phys. chem.

We explain how tacit (or overt) endorsement of unbridled economic growth (the growth imperative) has pernicious practical effects and how it tends to restrict the intellectual base of the field. We argue that notions of degrowth present scholars with challenges as well as opportunities to reframe core assumptions and develop new directions in theory and research. Envisioning a post-COVID 19 world where societies and organizations can flourish without growth is one of the most difficult tasks facing theorists. We approach this challenge first by discussing the hegemonic properties of growth ideology and second by sketching an alternative political economy as a context for reimagining social and economic relations within planetary capacities in a post-growth era. Drawing on degrowth literature in ecological economics, sociology and political ecology, we identify key principles relevant to processes of organizing for a more just and environmentally sustainable future: frugal abundance, conviviality, care, and open relocalization. We conclude by introducing the three articles we feature in this issue along with some thoughts about theorizing policy and regulatory changes needed to generate transformational change and a future research agenda.","Banerjee, Subhabrata Bobby Jermier John M.; Peredo, Ana Maria Perey Robert Reichel André",Organization,71,0

It started in China in December 2019, and it rapidly spread throughout Italy, which has been the most affected country after China. The pandemia touched all countries with similarly negative effects on population, countries and healthcare structures. OBJECTIVE: Evolution of the Covid-19 infection as well as the way such a phenomena can be characterized in terms of resources and planning, has to be considered. One of the most critical resource items has been the less of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) places with respect to the infection trend and critical hospitalization. METHODS: We propose a model to estimate the needed number of places in ICUs during the most acute phase of the infection. We also define a scalable geographic model to plan emergency and future Covid-19 patients management by planning their reallocation in health structures of other region. RESULTS: We apply and assess the prediction method both at national and regional scale. ICU beds prediction has been tested with respect to real data provided by the Italian gouvernement. We show that our model is able to predict with a reliable error in terms of complexity of resources related to estimation parameters used for healthcare structures. Also, the proposed method is scalable at geographic level. This is relevant for pandemic phenomena as Covid-19 that have shown their different incidence even among northern and southern Italian regions. CONCLUSIONS: The contribution can be useful for decision-makers to plan resources to guarantee patients management, but it can be considered a reference model for the potential upcoming and feared virus increasing phase as well as for similar coronavirus diffusion.","Guzzi, Pietro H; Tradigo, Giuseppe; Veltri, Pierangelo",,71,15

Objective: To assess the complications, safety, and timing of tracheotomy performed for critically ill patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study assessed consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) who had COVID-19 that required tracheotomy. Patients were recruited from March 16 to April 10, 2020, at a tertiary referral center. Exposures: A surgical tracheotomy was performed for all patients following recommended criteria for use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Main Outcomes and Measures: The number of subthyroid operations, the tracheal entrance protocol, and use of PPE. Infections among the surgeons were monitored weekly by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swab samples. Short-term complications, weaning, and the association of timing of tracheotomy (early [&#8804;10 days] vs late [>10 days]) with total required days of invasive ventilation were assessed. Results: A total of 50 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.8 [9.2] years; 33 [66%] male) participated in the study. All tracheotomies were performed at the bedside. The median time from intubation to tracheotomy was 9 days (interquartile range, 2-24 days). A subthyroid approach was completed for 46 patients (92%), and the tracheal protocol was adequately achieved for 40 patients (80%). Adequate PPE was used, with no infection among surgeons identified 4 weeks after the last tracheotomy. Postoperative complications were rare, with minor bleeding (in 6 patients [12%]) being the most common complication. The successful weaning rate was higher in the early tracheotomy group than in the late tracheotomy group (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.55; 95% CI, 0.96-6.75), but the difference was not statistically significant. There was less time of invasive mechanical ventilatory support with early tracheotomy compared with late tracheotomy (mean [SD], 18 [5.4] vs 22.3 [5.7] days). The reduction of invasive ventilatory support was achieved at the expense of the pretracheotomy period. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, with the use of a standardized protocol aimed at minimizing COVID-19 risks, bedside open tracheotomy was a safe procedure for patients and surgeons, with minimal complications. Timing of tracheotomy may be important in reducing time of invasive mechanical ventilation, with potential implications to intensive care unit availability during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Avilés-Jurado, Francesc Xavier; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel; González-Sánchez, Nesly; de Ossó, José; Arancibia, Claudio; Rojas-Lechuga, María Jesús; Ruiz-Sevilla, Laura; Remacha, Joan; Sánchez, Irene; Lehrer-Coriat, Eduardo; López-Chacón, Mauricio; Langdon, Cristóbal; Guilemany, Josep María; Larrosa, Francisco; Alobid, Isam; Bernal-Sprekelsen, Manuel; Castro, Pedro; Vilaseca, Isabel",JAMA otolaryngol.-- head neck surg.

It is unclear whether the response of the virus to vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the prototypic strain will be affected by the mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assess the immune responses of individuals after vaccination with the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralizing antibody responses after the first and second immunizations using pseudoviruses that expressed the wild-type spike protein or a mutated spike protein that contained the eight amino acid changes found in the B.1.1.7 variant. The sera from individuals who received the vaccine exhibited a broad range of neutralizing titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against the B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident in sera from some patients who had recovered from COVID-19. Decreased neutralization of the B.1.1.7 variant was also observed for monoclonal antibodies that target the N-terminal domain (9 out of 10) and the receptor-binding motif (5 out of 31), but not for monoclonal antibodies that recognize the receptor-binding domain that bind outside the receptor-binding motif. Introduction of the mutation that encodes the E484K substitution in the B.1.1.7 background to reflect a newly emerged variant of concern (VOC 202102/02) led to a more-substantial loss of neutralizing activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies and monoclonal antibodies (19 out of 31) compared with the loss of neutralizing activity conferred by the mutations in B.1.1.7 alone. The emergence of the E484K substitution in a B.1.1.7 background represents a threat to the efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine.","Collier, Dami A; De Marco, Anna; Ferreira, Isabella A T M; Meng, Bo; Datir, Rawlings P; Walls, Alexandra C; Kemp, Steven A; Bassi, Jessica; Pinto, Dora; Silacci-Fregni, Chiara; Bianchi, Siro; Tortorici, M Alejandra; Bowen, John; Culap, Katja; Jaconi, Stefano; Cameroni, Elisabetta; Snell, Gyorgy; Pizzuto, Matteo S; Pellanda, Alessandra Franzetti; Garzoni, Christian; Riva, Agostino; Elmer, Anne; Kingston, Nathalie; Graves, Barbara; McCoy, Laura E; Smith, Kenneth G C; Bradley, John R; Temperton, Nigel; Ceron-Gutierrez, Lourdes; Barcenas-Morales, Gabriela; Harvey, William; Virgin, Herbert W; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Piccoli, Luca; Doffinger, Rainer; Wills, Mark; Veesler, David; Corti, Davide; Gupta, Ravindra K",Nature,71,1

An epidemiologic study conducted in Brazil reported a high incidence of IFD in haematologic patients, and invasive fusariosis was the leading IFD. A limitation of that study was that galactomannan was not available for at least half of the study period. In order to characterise the epidemiology and burden of IFD in three cohorts, HCT, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS), and acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), we conducted a prospective multicentre cohort study in four haematologic Brazilian centres. From August 2015 to July 2016, all patients receiving induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed or relapsed AML, MDS or ALL, and all HCT recipients receiving conditioning regimen were followed during the period of neutropenia following chemotherapy or the conditioning regimen. During a 1-year period, 192 patients were enrolled: 122 HCT recipients (71 allogeneic, 51 autologous), 46 with AML, and 24 with ALL. The global incidence of IFD was 13.0% (25 cases, 11 proven and 14 probable). Invasive aspergillosis (14 cases) was the leading IFD, followed by candidemia (6 cases) and fusariosis (3 cases). The incidence of IFD was 26.1% in AML/MDS, 16.7% in ALL, 11.3% in allogeneic HCT, and 2.0% in autologous HCT. The burden of IFD in haematologic patients in Brazil is high, with a higher frequency in AML and ALL. Invasive aspergillosis is the leading IFD, followed by invasive candidiasis and fusariosis.","Souza, Luciana; Nouér, Simone A; Morales, Hugo; Simões, Belinda; Solza, Cristiana; Queiroz-Telles, Flavio; Nucci, Marcio",Mycoses,71,24

The abnormal expression of MALT1 is closely associated with lymphomagenesis and other diseases, including solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. MALT1 is the only protease in the underlying pathogenesis of these diseases, and its proteolytic activity can be pharmacologically regulated. Therefore, MALT1 is a potential and promising target for anti-lymphoma and other MALT1-related disease treatments. Currently, the development of MALT1 inhibitors is still in its early stages. This review presents an overview of MALT1, particularly its X-ray structures and biological functions, and elaborates on the pathogenesis of diseases associated with its dysregulation. We then summarize previously reported MALT1 inhibitors, focusing on their molecular structure, biological activity, structure-activity relationship, and limitations. Finally, we propose future research directions to accelerate the discovery of novel MALT1 inhibitors with clinical applications. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of MALT1-related research advances and serves as a theoretical basis for drug discovery and research.","Liang, Xuewu; Cao, YiChun; Li, Chunpu; Yu, Haolan; Yang, Chenghua; Liu, Hong",Med. res. rev,71,32

The key problem of the conventional ultrasonic and infra-red-based dispensers is their malfunctioning due to the interference of sunlight, vehicle sound, etc. when deployed in busy public places. To overcome such limitations, this study introduced a laser-based sensing device to dispense sanitizer in an automated touchless process. METHOD: The dispensing system is based on an Arduino circuit breadboard where an ATmega328p microcontroller was pre-installed. To sense the proximity, a light-dependent resistor (LDR) is used where the laser light is to be blocked after the placement of human hands, hence produced a sharp decrease in the LDR sensor value. Once the LDR sensor value exceeds the lower threshold, the pump is actuated by the microcontroller, and the sanitizer dispenses through the nozzle. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A novel design and subsequent fabrication of a low-cost, touchless, automated sanitizer dispenser to be used in public places, was demonstrated. The overall performance of the manufactured device was analyzed based on the cost and power consumption, and environmental factors by deploying it in busy public places as well as in indoor environment in major cities in Bangladesh, and found to be more efficient and cost-effective compared to other dispensers available in the market. A comprehensive discussion on this unique design compared to the conventional ultrasonic and infra-red based dispensers, is presented to show its suitability over the commercial ones. The guidelines of the World Health Organization are followed for the preparation of sanitizer liquid. A clear demonstration of the circuitry connections is presented herein, which facilitates the interested individual to manufacture a cost-effective dispenser device in a relatively short time and use it accordingly. Conclusion: This study reveals that the LDR-based automated hand sanitizer dispenser system is a novel concept, and it is cost-effective compared to the conventional ones. The presented device is expected to play a key role in contactless hand disinfection in public places, and reduce the spread of infectious diseases in society.","Das, A.; Barua, A.; Mohimin, M.

Pseudotyped viruses that mimic SARS-CoV-2 have been widely used for in vitro evaluation because they are available in BSL-2 containment laboratories; however, in vivo application is inadequate. Therefore, animal models that can be instigated with animal BSL-2 will increase opportunities for in vivo evaluations. MethodsHamsters (6-to 10-week-old males) were intratracheally inoculated with luciferase-expressing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus. The lungs were harvested 24 h after inoculation, and luminescence was measured using an in vivo imaging system. ResultsLung luminescence after inoculation with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus increased in a dose-dependent manner. VSV-G (envelope [G]) pseudotyped virus also induced luminescence; however, a 100-fold concentration was required to reach a level similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus. ConclusionsThe SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus is applicable to SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections in a hamster model. Because of the single-round infectious virus, the model can be used to study the steps from viral binding to entry, which will be useful for future research regarding SARS-CoV-2 entry without using live SARS-CoV-2 or transgenic animals.","Yamada, Hiroshi; Sasaki, Soichiro; Tani, Hideki; Somekawa, Mayu; Kawasuji, Hitoshi; Saga, Yumiko; Yoshida, Yoshihiro; Yamamoto, Yoshihiro; Hayakawa, Yoshihiro; Morinaga, Yoshitomo",,71,26

The SARS-CoV-2 rapidly disseminated throughout the world via community spread, acquiring pandemic status with significant fatality. OBSERVATIONS: Rapid SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was soon perceived critical for arresting community spread and effective therapy development. Human SARS-CoV-2 infection can be diagnosed either by nucleic acid identification or specific antibody detection. Contrary to nucleic acid identification confirmed active SARS-CoV-2 infection; antibody detection confirms a past infection, even in asymptomatic subjects. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies augment the ability to effectively counter the virus. A crucial hurdle limiting the steadfast implementation of antibody detection is the time required for threshold B lymphocyte population generation. This process is dependent on precise antigen recognition and MHC class I molecules presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, nucleic acid and antibody dependent tests complement each other in identifying human SARS-CoV-2 infection and shaping up subsequent immunological responses. This article discusses the complimentary association of nucleic acid identification (corresponding to an active infection) and antibody testing (the yester CoV-2 infection vulnerability) as the diagnostic and screening measures of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Highlights Nucleic acid (RNA) identification and specific antibody detection against SARS-CoV-2 are the noted diagnostic mechanisms for screening human SARS-CoV-2 infection. While nucleic acid identification screens prevailing SARS-CoV-2 infection, detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies signifies a past infection, even in asymptomatic subjects. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 provide a potential therapeutic option via transfer from antibody rich plasma of a recovered subject to an infected individual. Nucleic acid identification may not absolutely confirm the infection because of frequent SARS-CoV-2 genome mutations and possible technical errors, while specific antibody detection also needs at least (8-14) days for detectable screening of B-cell generated antibodies. Nucleic acid and antibody tests are complementary to each other as an early stage diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible therapy (antibodies). Sufferers with a high clinical suspicion but negative RT-PCR screening could be examined via combined imaging and repeated swab test.","Mukherjee, Tapan K; Malik, Parth; Maitra, Radhashree; Hoidal, John R",Curr Med Res Opin,71,1

However, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics, stroke mechanism, and outcomes of patients who have a stroke and COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020, and April 19, 2020, within a major health system in New York, the current global epicenter of the pandemic. We compared the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with a concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19 to stroke patients without COVID-19 (contemporary controls). In addition, we compared patients to a historical cohort of patients with ischemic stroke discharged from our hospital system between March 15, 2019, and April 15, 2019 (historical controls). RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, out of 3556 hospitalized patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, 32 patients (0.9%) had imaging proven ischemic stroke. Cryptogenic stroke was more common in patients with COVID-19 (65.6%) as compared to contemporary controls (30.4%, P=0.003) and historical controls (25.0%, P<0.001). When compared with contemporary controls, COVID-19 positive patients had higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and higher peak D-dimer levels. When compared with historical controls, COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to be younger men with elevated troponin, higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had significantly higher mortality than historical and contemporary controls. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a low rate of imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Most strokes were cryptogenic, possibly related to an acquired hypercoagulability, and mortality was increased. Studies are needed to determine the utility of therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke and other thrombotic event prevention in patients with COVID-19.","Yaghi, Shadi; Ishida, Koto; Torres, Jose; Mac Grory, Brian; Raz, Eytan; Humbert, Kelley; Henninger, Nils; Trivedi, Tushar; Lillemoe, Kaitlyn; Alam, Shazia; Sanger, Matthew; Kim, Sun; Scher, Erica; Dehkharghani, Seena; Wachs, Michael; Tanweer, Omar; Volpicelli, Frank; Bosworth, Brian; Lord, Aaron; Frontera, Jennifer",Stroke,71,18

Currently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the infectious agent that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has spread from its epicenter in Wuhan China to all parts of the globe. Real-time mapping of new infections across the globe has revealed that variable transmission patterns and pathogenicity are associated with differences in SARS-CoV-2 lineages, clades, and strains. Thus, we reviewed how changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and its structural architecture affect viral replication, immune evasion, and transmission within different human populations. We also looked at which immune dominant regions of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses are recognized by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)/Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) genes and how this could impact on subsequent disease pathogenesis. Efforts were also placed on understanding immunological changes that occur when exposed individuals either remain asymptomatic or fail to control the virus and later develop systemic complications. Published autopsy studies that reveal alterations in the lung immune microenvironment, morphological, and pathological changes are also explored within the context of the review. Understanding the true correlates of protection and determining how constant virus evolution impacts on host-pathogen interactions could help identify which populations are at high risk and later inform future vaccine and therapeutic interventions.","Olwenyi, Omalla A; Dyavar, Shetty Ravi; Acharya, Arpan; Podany, Anthony T; Fletcher, Courtney V; Ng, Caroline L; Reid, St Patrick; Byrareddy, Siddappa N",J Mol Med (Berl),71,16

In this study, the presence of these viruses in palatine tonsils was comprehensively studied in both children and adults. A cross-sectional analysis of 181 patients (median age 22 years; range, 2.6-66) operated for a benign tonsillar disease was conducted. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect 27 distinct viruses in all: eight human herpesviruses, 16 respiratory viruses, parvo B19, and polyoma BK/JC viruses. Clinical characteristics of the patients and underlying conditions were evaluated. In total, 92% of patients had virus detected in tonsils (Epstein-Barr virus 72%, human herpesvirus 7, and 6B 54% and 16%, respectively, enterovirus 18%, parvovirus B19 7% and the rest <4%). No herpes simplex virus 2, varicella zoster virus, polyoma JC virus, parainfluenza-, metapneumo-, or coronaviruses were found. Enterovirus was more common in children and was frequently observed in the presence of HHV6B. None of the viruses showed a positive association to the tonsillar disease. Respiratory symptoms were not associated with the prevalence of viruses. This study comprehensively reports a cross-sectional view of intratonsillar virus infections in elective tonsillectomy patients in a wide age range cohort. Tonsils are a major virus reservoir for distinct herpes and respiratory viruses without a positive association with tonsillar disease or respiratory symptoms.","Silvoniemi, Antti; Mikola, Emilia; Ivaska, Lotta; Jeskanen, Marja; Löyttyniemi, Eliisa; Puhakka, Tuomo; Vuorinen, Tytti; Jartti, Tuomas",J. med. virol,71,7

Several autopsy studies have found microthrombi in pulmonary circulation. METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, phase II study, we randomized COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation to receive either therapeutic enoxaparin or the standard anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. We evaluated the gas exchange over time through the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at baseline, 7, and 14 days after randomization, the time until successful liberation from mechanical ventilation, and the ventilator-free days. RESULTS: Ten patients were assigned to the therapeutic enoxaparin and ten patients to prophylactic anticoagulation. There was a statistically significant increase in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio over time in the therapeutic group (163 [95% confidence interval - CI 133-193] at baseline, 209 [95% CI 171-247] after 7 days, and 261 [95% CI 230-293] after 14 days), p = 0.0004. In contrast, we did not observe this improvement over time in the prophylactic group (184 [95% CI 146-222] at baseline, 168 [95% CI 142-195] after 7 days, and 195 [95% CI 128-262] after 14 days), p = 0.487. Patients of the therapeutic group had a higher ratio of successful liberation from mechanical ventilation (hazard ratio: 4.0 [95% CI 1.035-15.053]), p = 0.031 and more ventilator-free days (15 days [interquartile range IQR 6-16] versus 0 days [IQR 0-11]), p = 0.028 when compared to the prophylactic group.

The aim of this study was to assess the differences between men and women in the main measures of infection and mortality by COVID-19, considering its temporal evolution, raising awareness about the weaknesses and contradictions between sources of information. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis based on the microdata on COVID cases notified by the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENAVE), the Death Statistics of the National Statistical Institute (INE) and the estimates of excess mortality from the INE and the Daily Mortality Monitoring System (MoMo) microdata. Standardized rates, prevalences and and ratios by sex were calculated for each indicator. The percentage of excess mortality without COVID-19 diagnosis in each sex was calculated. Male/female ratios for symptoms and risk factors of COVID-19 were also calculated. RESULTS: The rate of infection by COVID-19 was higher in women in the three waves of the pandemic, reaching 65% of infections during April and May 2020. Complications were between 1.5 and 2.5 times higher in men, especially in ICU admissions, which were 2.5 times more frequent than in women. Although mortality rates and excess mortality were also higher in men (around 1.8 times), the percentage of excess mortality without COVID-19 diagnosis was higher in women (44% in men vs. 52% in women the first wave). With regard to the symptoms of COVID-19, fever, cough, and dyspnoea were more frequent in men (20%, 10% and 19% more, respectively) compared to sore throat, vomiting or diarrhea that were more prevalent in women (90%, 40% and 10% more, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The analysis disaggregated by sex has made it possible to identify differences between men and women in the diagnosis, presentation and severity of the COVID-19 that can help a better clinical and epidemiological approach to the disease. However, official sources present important gaps when presenting information disaggregated by sex. It is therefore necessary to advance in the inclusion of a gender perspective in the statistics on COVID-19, starting with a necessary but not sufficient condition such as the disaggregation by sex of the data.","Martin, U.; Bacigalupe, A.; Jimenez Carrillo, M.",Revista Espanola de Salud Publica,71,18

The role of tracheotomy is debated for the possible risks for patients and staff. We are going to describe here our experience with surgical tracheotomy in COVID-19 positive patients. METHODS: We enrolled all intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring longer than 10 days of IMV. Demographic, clinical, respiratory, complications, and outcomes data were collected, in a particular length of weaning from sedation and IMV, in-ICU and in-hospital mortality rate. All healthcare operators involved were tested for SARS-CoV2 by pharyngeal swab and blood test (antibody test). RESULTS: 13 out of 68 ICU patients (19.1%) underwent surgical tracheotomy after a median intubation period of 14 days. The mean age was 60 (56-65) years. 85% were male patients. Postoperative mild bleeding was seen in 30.7%, pneumothorax in 7.7%. Mean weaning from sedation required 3 days, 19 days from IMV.

DESIGN: After undertaking a literature review, we used the RAND/UCLA methodology with a multi-step process to reach consensus about treatment options, onward referral, and imaging. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An expert panel consisting of 15 members was assembled. A literature review was undertaken prior to the study and evidence was summarised for the panellists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The panel undertook a process of ranking and classifying appropriateness of different investigations and treatment options for new onset loss of sense of smell during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a 9-point Likert scale, panellists scored whether a treatment was: Not recommended, optional, or recommended. Consensus was achieved when more than 70% of responses fell into the category defined by the mean. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on the majority of statements after 2 rounds of ranking. Disagreement meant no recommendation was made regarding one treatment, using Vitamin A drops. Alpha-lipoic acid was not recommended, olfactory training was recommended for all patients with persistent loss of sense of smell of more than 2 weeks duration, and oral steroids, steroid rinses, and omega 3 supplements may be considered on an individual basis. Recommendations regarding the need for referral and investigation have been made. CONCLUSION: This study identified the appropriateness of olfactory training, different medical treatment options, referral guidelines and imaging for patients with COVID-19-related loss of sense of smell.

In the outbreak of COVID-19, we generated a lipopeptide EK1V1 by modifying EK1 with cholesterol, which exhibited significantly improved antiviral activity. In this study, we surprisingly found that EK1V1 also displayed potent cross-inhibitory activities against divergent HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates. Consistently, the recently reported EK1 derivative EK1C4 and SARS-CoV-2 derived fusion inhibitor lipopeptides (IPB02 â¼ IPB09) also inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion and infection efficiently. In the inhibition of a panel of HIV-1 mutants resistant to HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, EK1V1 and IPB02-based inhibitors exhibited significantly decreased or increased activities, suggesting the heptad repeat-1 region (HR1) of HIV-1 gp41 being their target. Furthermore, the sequence alignment and molecular docking analyses verified the target site and revealed the mechanism underlying the resistance. Combined, we conclude that this serendipitous discovery provides a proof-of-concept for a common mechanism of viral fusion and critical information for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals.","Yu, Danwei; Zhu, Yuanmei; Yan, Hongxia; Wu, Tong; Chong, Huihui; He, Yuxian",Emerg Microbes Infect,71,23

In response, the Division of General Surgery at the University of Washington Department of Surgery in Seattle has designed and implemented an emergency restructuring of the facility's general surgery resident care teams in an attempt to optimize workforce well-being, comply with physical distancing requirements, and continue excellent patient care. This article introduces a unique approach to general surgery resident allocation by dividing patient care into separate inpatient care, operating care, and clinic care teams. Separate teams made up of all resident levels will work in each setting for a 1-week period. By creating this emergency structure, we have limited the number of surgery residents with direct patient contact and have created teams working in isolation from one another to optimize physical distancing while still performing required work. This also provides a resident reserve without exposure to the virus, theoretically flattening the curve among our general surgery resident cohort. Surgical resident team restructuring is critical during a pandemic to optimize patient care and ensure the well-being and vitality of the resident workforce while ensuring the entire workforce is not compromised.","Nassar, Amer H; Zern, Nicole K; McIntyre, Lisa K; Lynge, Dana; Smith, Caitlin A; Petersen, Rebecca P; Horvath, Karen D; Wood, Douglas E",JAMA Surg,71,33

We describe the switch from in-person didactic sessions to videoconferencing in a Neurology department. We analyse the opinions and satisfaction of participants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Narrative description of the adopted measures; Online survey among participants. RESULTS: One of the three weekly sessions was cancelled, and two switched to videoconferencing. There were more participants online than in the conference hall. 49 users answered the survey, 51% women, mean age 40.5 years (range 25-65). Satisfaction was higher for previous face-to-face meetings (8.68) than for videoconferencing (8.12) (p=0.006). There was a significant inverse correlation between age and satisfaction with virtual sessions (r=-0.37; p=0.01), that was not found for in-person attendance. Most users (75.5%) would prefer to continue with online sessions when the pandemic is over, and 87.8% support inter-hospital remote meetings, but the safety of web platforms is a concern (53.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The change from in-person to virtual sessions is an easy measure to implement in a neurology department, with a good degree of satisfaction among users. There are some unsolved problems with the use of commercial web platforms and inter-hospital connection.

On one hand, diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. On the other hand, new onset diabetes and severe metabolic complications of pre-existing diabetes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have been observed in patients with COVID-19. In this report, we describe two patient with diabetes mellitus who presented to our hospital with DKA. We also reviewed almost all published cases of DKA that had been precipitated by COVID-19. METHODS: Two patients were admitted with DKA, who were diagnosed to have COVID-19 on the basis of real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Detailed history, anthropometry, laboratory investigations, imaging studies, clinical course and management outcomes were documented. RESULTS: First patient (30-year-male) had undiagnosed diabetes and no other comorbidities, and COVID-19 precipitated DKA. He also had COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Second patient (60-year-male) had long duration hypertension with no prior history of diabetes and developed cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was also diagnosed with COVID-19 (RT-PCR assay) and DKA in the hospital. CVA and COVID-19 could have precipitated DKA. Both patients responded well to treatment and were discharged in a stable condition. CONCLUSIONS: These cases show that COVID-19 can precipitate DKA in a significant number of patients. DKA can occur in patients with pre-existing diabetes or newly diagnosed diabetes. As COVID-19 and diabetes are prevalent conditions, high degree of suspicion is required to diagnose DKA timely in order to improve the prognosis of COVID-19-related diabetic ketoacidosis.","Reddy, Pavan Kumar; Kuchay, Mohammad Shafi; Mehta, Yatin; Mishra, Sunil Kumar",Diabetes Metab Syndr,71,9

Evidence on the experience of those receiving or providing maternity care is important to guide practice through this challenging time. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Australia. Five key stakeholder cohorts were included to explore and compare the experiences of those receiving or providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, their partners, midwives, medical practitioners and midwifery students who had received or provided maternity care from March 2020 onwards in Australia were recruited via social media and invited to participate in an online survey released between 13th May and 24th June 2020; a total of 3701 completed responses were received. FINDINGS: While anxiety related to COVID-19 was high among all five cohorts, there were statistically significant differences between the responses from each cohort for most survey items. Women were more likely to indicate concern about their own and family's health and safety in relation to COVID-19 whereas midwives, doctors and midwifery students were more likely to be concerned about occupational exposure to COVID-19 through working in a health setting than those receiving care through attending these environments. Midwifery students and women's partners were more likely to respond that they felt isolated because of the changes to the way care was provided. Despite concerns about care received or provided not meeting expectations, most respondents were satisfied with the quality of care provided, although midwives and midwifery students were less likely to agree. CONCLUSION: This paper provides a unique exploration and comparison of experiences of receiving and providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Findings are useful to support further service changes and future service redesign. New evidence provided offers unique insight into key stakeholders' experiences of the rapid changes to health services.","Bradfield, Zoe; Wynter, Karen; Hauck, Yvonne; Vasilevski, Vidanka; Kuliukas, Lesley; Wilson, Alyce N; Szabo, Rebecca A; Homer, Caroline S E; Sweet, Linda",PLoS One,71,16

With the COVID-19 pandemic having impacted healthcare systems and regimes globally, the aim of this study is to understand how treatment management of knee OA patients and prescribing behavior across US healthcare professionals (HCPs) was affected, and how they adapt towards a potential ‘new norm’ in treating this condition. Methods: A cross-sectional chart review survey was conducted in both Q2 2019 and Q2 2020 among US board-certified rheumatologists (rheums), orthopedic surgeons (orthos), primary care physicians with a focus in sports medicine (SM PCPs), and pain specialists, all practicing across hospital and private practices. Recruited from a large access panel, physicians were screened for duration of practice in their specialty (3-50 years) and caseload (35 or more knee OA patients personally managed, at least 10 of which must be classified as moderate-severe). Participants were asked to complete a 3-part online survey: (1) a doctor demographic questionnaire, (2) a perceptual questionnaire, assessing perception of available and upcoming OA therapies, and (3) patient record charts for the next 5 knee OA patients seen following receipt of the survey, capturing demographics and treatment history. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: The total number of sampled physicians recruited in this survey with their reported patient totals are stated in Table 1. [Formula presented] When focusing on the current prescription medication reported patients are receiving, oral medications, particularly NSAIDs, are widely used, regardless of the physician specialty. Here we see a directional increase in the proportion of reported patients deriving from sampled primary care SM PCPs from pre-COVID (Q219) to during COVID (Q220) (not statistically significantly different), whilst the same is not true for the other three secondary care sampled specialties, namely rheums, orthos and pain specialists (not statistically significantly different) - see Fig. 1. [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Conclusions: From the sample surveyed, it appears that primary care SM PCPs adopted their treatment adjustment during COVID-19 pandemic differently, by prescribing more orals while other secondary care physicians (rheums, orthos, pain specialists) focused on injection treatment for longer pain relief. Considering movement restrictions and limited elective surgeries during the pandemic, the lack of targeted treatment options for knee OA has been made more apparent. With a burgeoning pipeline, many of which are targeted therapies, it is hopeful that knee OA treaters will be less reliant on symptom remedies and can readily offer patients’ longer-acting pain relief or disease modifying options to combat joint deterioration.","Hamdan, H.; Baldock, D.",Osteoarthritis and Cartilage,71,1

The objectives were to evaluate the outcome of COVID-19 and factors predicting the outcome. RESULTS: A total of 145 patients were included with a median age of 58 years (range, 20-81 years). Treatment was curative in 60 (42%) patients. Of all symptomatic cases (n = 88, 61%), 50 had mild, 27 had moderate and 19 had severe COVID-19–related symptoms as per WHO criteria. Fifty (34%) patients required hospitalization with a median duration of hospital stay of 12 days (range, 4-25 days); five patients required intensive care unit admission. The rest were treated with home isolation and did not require further hospitalization. Twenty-two (15%) patients died, and the risk of death was significantly associated with severity of symptoms (odds ratio, 91.3; 95% CI, 9.1 to 919.5, P = .0001) but not with any other clinical factors. Drug holiday was given to 63 (44%) patients with a median duration of 25 days (range, 7-88 days). The median duration to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction–negative was 16 days (range, 7-62 days). CONCLUSION: COVD-19–related death rate was 15% among patients with solid organ malignancies. The severity of the symptoms was related to mortality. The majority of patients with mild symptoms were treated at home isolation.","Roy, Somnath; Ghosh, Joydeep; Ganguly, Sandip; Mondal, Debapriya; Dabkara, Deepak; Chatterji, Soumyadip; Biswas, Bivas",JCO Glob Oncol,71,1

In order to achieve this ambition, there is a need for new and more mineral extraction which is necessary for the technology for this low-carbon transition. These minerals are known as critical minerals and this article examines the role of justice needed in their development. The literature to-date lacks any holistic yet focused examination of the key elements of justice in the development of this industry. This conceptual article makes an original contribution that utilises an interdisciplinary perspective, legal geography, and explores key issues of justice that include distributive, procedural, restorative, recognition and cosmopolitan. The research identifies the key questions that need to be resolved under each element of justice and the unfortunate limited timeframes for action. Critical justice areas include taxation, environmental impact assessments, waste management, social license to operate, and cross-border actions. Resolving these issues will directly address societal issues of inequality and ensure a just transition to a low-carbon economy. Already there is a global race for critical minerals, and justice needs a stronger role in its development based on evidence to-date.","Heffron, Raphael J",Extr Ind Soc,71,3

These nanofibers can be further functionalized with bioactive agents. In the food industry, for example, edible films can be formed from chitosan-based composite fibers filled with nanoparticles, exhibiting excellent antioxidant and antimicrobial properties for a variety of products. Processing ‘pure’ chitosan into nanofibers can be challenging due to its cationic nature and high crystallinity; therefore, chitosan is often modified or blended with other materials to improve its processability and tailor its performance to specific needs. Chitosan can be blended with a variety of natural and synthetic polymers and processed into fibers while maintaining many of its intrinsic properties that are important for textile, cosmeceutical, and biomedical applications. The abundance of amine groups in the chemical structure of chitosan allows for facile modification (e.g., into soluble derivatives) and the binding of negatively charged domains. In particular, high-surface-area chitosan nanofibers are effective in binding negatively charged biomolecules. Recent developments of chitosan-based nanofibers with biological activities for various applications in biomedical, food packaging, and textiles are discussed herein.","Tien, Nguyen D.; Lyngstadaas, Ståle Petter; Mano, João F.; Blaker, Jonathan James; Haugen, Håvard J.",Molecules,71,1

Disease phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2 exposure occurring around the time of vaccine administration have not been described. METHODS: Two-dose (14 days apart) vaccination regimen with a formalin-inactivated whole virion SARS-CoV-2 in golden Syrian hamster model was established. To investigate the disease phenotypes of a one-dose regimen given 3 days prior (D-3), 1 (D1) or 2 (D2) days after, or on the day (D0) of virus challenge, we monitored the serial clinical severity, tissue histopathology, virus burden, and antibody response of the vaccinated hamsters. RESULTS: The one-dose vaccinated hamsters had significantly lower clinical disease severity score, body weight loss, lung histology score, nucleocapsid protein expression in lung, infectious virus titres in the lung and nasal turbinate, inflammatory changes in intestines and a higher serum neutralizing antibody or IgG titre against the spike receptor-binding domain or nucleocapsid protein when compared to unvaccinated controls. These improvements were particularly noticeable in D-3, but also in D0, D1 and even D2 vaccinated hamsters to varying degrees. No increased eosinophilic infiltration was found in the nasal turbinate, lung, and intestine after virus challenge. Significantly higher serum titre of fluorescent foci microneutralization inhibition antibody was detected in D1 and D2 vaccinated hamsters at day 4 post-challenge compared to controls despite undetectable neutralizing antibody titre. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination just before or soon after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 does not worsen disease phenotypes and may even ameliorate infection.","Li, Can; Chen, Yan-Xia; Liu, Fei-Fei; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Zhao, Yan; Ye, Zhan-Hong; Cai, Jian-Piao; Chu, Hin; Zhang, Rui-Qi; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Chiu, Kelvin Hei-Yeung; Lung, David Christopher; Sridhar, Siddharth; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Zhang, Anna Jin-Xia; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Clin Infect Dis,71,6

Proteomic deconvolution of the circulating IgG repertoire (Ig-Seq1) to the spike ectodomain (S-ECD2) in four convalescent study subjects revealed that the plasma response is oligoclonal and directed predominantly (>80%) to S-ECD epitopes that lie outside the receptor binding domain (RBD). When comparing antibodies directed to either the RBD, the N-terminal domain (NTD) or the S2 subunit (S2) in one subject, just four IgG lineages (1 anti-S2, 2 anti-NTD and 1 anti-RBD) accounted for 93.5% of the repertoire. Although the anti-RBD and one of the anti-NTD antibodies were equally potently neutralizing in vitro, we nonetheless found that the anti-NTD antibody was sufficient for protection to lethal viral challenge, either alone or in combination as a cocktail where it dominated the effect of the other plasma antibodies. We identified in vivo protective plasma anti-NTD antibodies in 3/4 subjects analyzed and discovered a shared class of antibodies targeting the NTD that utilize unmutated or near-germline IGHV1-24, the most electronegative IGHV gene in the human genome. Structural analysis revealed that binding to NTD is dominated by interactions with the heavy chain, accounting for 89% of the entire interfacial area, with germline residues uniquely encoded by IGHV1-24 contributing 20% (149 Å2). Together with recent reports of germline IGHV1-24 antibodies isolated by B-cell cloning3,4 our data reveal a class of shared IgG antibodies that are readily observed in convalescent plasma and underscore the role of NTD-directed antibodies in protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Voss, William N.; Hou, Yixuan J.; Johnson, Nicole V.; Kim, Jin Eyun; Delidakis, George; Horton, Andrew P.; Bartzoka, Foteini; Paresi, Chelsea J.; Tanno, Yuri; Abbasi, Shawn A.; Pickens, Whitney; George, Katia; Boutz, Daniel R.; Towers, Dalton M.; McDaniel, Jonathan R.; Billick, Daniel; Goike, Jule; Rowe, Lori; Batra, Dhwani; Pohl, Jan; Lee, Justin; Gangappa, Shivaprakash; Sambhara, Suryaprakash; Gadush, Michelle; Wang, Nianshuang; Person, Maria D.; Iverson, Brent L.; Gollihar, Jimmy D.; Dye, John; Herbert, Andrew; Baric, Ralph S.; McLellan, Jason S.; Georgiou, George; Lavinder, Jason J.; Ippolito, Gregory C.",bioRxiv,71,18

Using an adjusted Cobb-Douglas production function, with labour divided into two complementary groups, this article attempts to provide some answers. By applying the model to current immigration data from Germany, this study finds that refugee immigration can lead to long-term per capita growth in the host country and that the growth is higher if refugee immigrants are relatively young and have sufficiently high qualifications. Further, capital inflows are a prerequisite for boosting per capita growth. These findings can inform policymakers of countries that continue to grapple with refugee immigration.","Manthei, Gerrit",Inter Econ,71,20

Our objective was to determine the effects of COVID‐19 on emergency medicine (EM) training programs and residents. METHODS: We performed a mixed‐methods cross‐sectional survey study of faculty and residents at programs registered with Foundations of Emergency Medicine. Participants completed an online survey consisting of closed and open‐ended response items. We reported descriptive statistics for discrete and continuous data. Free‐response data were analyzed qualitatively using a thematic approach. RESULTS: Ninety‐two percent of faculty (119/129) and 47% (1,965/4,154) of residents responded to our survey. We identified three major themes related to effects on learning: 1) impact on clinical training, 2) impact on didactic education, and 3) impact on the trainee. Nearly all residencies (96%, 111/116) allowed residents to work with patients suspected of having COVID‐19, although fewer (83%, 96/115) allowed residents to intubate them. We found that 99% (1918/1928) of residents experienced virtual didactics. Faculty and trainees noted multiple educational challenges and strategies for adaptation. Trainees also expressed concerns about stress and safety. CONCLUSION: COVID‐19 has impacted EM education in many ways including clinical training, didactic education, and trainee emotional state and concentration. Challenges and suggested solutions for learning in the virtual environment were also identified. While the pandemic continues to evolve and impact EM residents in various ways, our results may inform strategies to support medical educators and trainees during pandemics or other periods of significant disruption or crisis.","Weygandt, Paul L.; Jordan, Jaime; Caretta‐Weyer, Holly; Osborne, Anwar; Grabow Moore, Kristen",AEM Educ Train,71,16

However, various facets of diarrheal disease caused by rotavirus in calves in the world are inadequately understood, considering that diarrheal disease caused by rotavirus is a vital health problem in calves that interrupts production benefits with reduced weight gain and increased mortality, and its potential for zoonotic spread. The pathological changes made by rotavirus are almost exclusively limited to the small intestine that leads to diarrhea. It is environmentally distributed worldwide and was extensively studied. Reassortment is one of the important mechanisms for generating genetic diversity of rotaviruses and eventually for viral evolution. So, the primary strategy is to reduce the burden of rotavirus infections by practicing early colostrum's feeding in newborn calves, using vaccine, and improving livestock management. Rotaviruses have a wide host range, infecting many animal species as well as humans. As it was found that certain animal rotavirus strains had antigenic similarities to some human strains, this may be an indication for an animal to play a role as a source of rotavirus infection in humans. Groups A to C have been shown to infect both humans and animals. The most commonly detected strains in both human and animals are G2, G3, G4, and G9, P [6].

This report summarizes progress toward global polio eradication during January 1, 2019-June 30, 2021 and updates previous reports (1,2). In 2020, 140 cases of WPV1 were reported, including 56 in Afghanistan (a 93% increase from 29 cases in 2019) and 84 in Pakistan (a 43% decrease from 147 cases in 2019). As GPEI focuses on the last endemic WPV reservoirs, poliomyelitis outbreaks caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) have emerged as a result of attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) virus regaining neurovirulence after prolonged circulation in underimmunized populations (3). In 2020, 32 countries reported cVDPV outbreaks (four type 1 [cVDPV1], 26 type 2 [cVDPV2] and two with outbreaks of both); 13 of these countries reported new outbreaks. The updated GPEI Polio Eradication Strategy 2022-2026 (4) includes expanded use of the type 2 novel oral poliovirus vaccine (nOPV2) to avoid new emergences of cVDPV2 during outbreak responses (3).

However, clinical practice may warrant the use of corticosteroids outside the context of a clinical trial. Such data are rarely, if ever, reported. We explored the use of corticosteroids for adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) indications in patients with non-COVID ARDS. METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) between January 2018 and March 2020. KEY FINDINGS: Of the 91 patients with ARDS identified, 80% were treated with a corticosteroid during their ICU admission. Of these, 73 (82%) had corticosteroids administered for reasons other than ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid use for non-ARDS indications is commonplace in ARDS patients in our ICU. The use of corticosteroids outside a randomisation process in randomised clinical trials may be more common than appreciated and needs to be routinely reported.","Shulman, Rob; Montanari, Cecilia; Pinheiro, Inês; Longobardo, Alessia; Benhalm, Suzanne; Polhill, Sara; Singer, Mervyn; Bellingan, Geoff; Arulkumaran, Nishkantha",Int J Pharm Pract,71,3

Here, we investigated the impact of age on neutrophil diapedesis. Using confocal intravital microscopy, we found that in aged mice, neutrophils adhered to vascular endothelium in inflamed tissues but exhibited a high frequency of reverse transendothelial migration (rTEM). This retrograde breaching of the endothelium by neutrophils was governed by enhanced production of the chemokine CXCL1 from mast cells that localized at endothelial cell (EC) junctions. Increased EC expression of the atypical chemokine receptor 1 (ACKR1) supported this pro-inflammatory milieu in aged venules. Accumulation of CXCL1 caused desensitization of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 on neutrophils and loss of neutrophil directional motility within EC junctions. Fluorescent tracking revealed that in aged mice, neutrophils undergoing rTEM re-entered the circulation and disseminated to the lungs where they caused vascular leakage. Thus, neutrophils stemming from a local inflammatory site contribute to remote organ damage, with implication to the dysregulated systemic inflammation associated with aging.","Barkaway, Anna; Rolas, Loïc; Joulia, Régis; Bodkin, Jennifer; Lenn, Tchern; Owen-Woods, Charlotte; Reglero-Real, Natalia; Stein, Monja; Vázquez-Martínez, Laura; Girbl, Tamara; Poston, Robin N.; Golding, Matthew; Saleeb, Rebecca S.; Thiriot, Aude; von Andrian, Ulrich H.; Duchene, Johan; Voisin, Mathieu-Benoit; Bishop, Cleo L.; Voehringer, David; Roers, Axel; Rot, Antal; Lämmermann, Tim; Nourshargh, Sussan",Immunity,71,11

After admission for pneumonia, her average daily blood glucose (BG) levels remained at 300–400 mg/dL, although the required dosage of subcutaneous insulin markedly increased (~ 150 units/day; ~ 2.63 units/kg/day). Furthermore, the patient had generalized edema along with hypoalbuminemia, developed extensive abdominal purpuras, and had increased plasma D-dimer levels during treatment, suggestive of coagulation abnormalities. Therefore, intravenous infusion of regular insulin was initiated. The BG level subsequently decreased to < 200 mg/dL 2 days after administering 18 units/day of insulin infusion and 118 units/day of subcutaneous insulin, suggesting that subcutaneous insulin alone might have been ineffective in reducing hyperglycemia, which is clinically consistent with the characteristics of an SIR syndrome. Impaired skin microcirculation arising from coagulation abnormalities, subcutaneous edema associated with inflammation-related hypoalbuminemia or vascular hyperpermeability, and/or reduction in subcutaneous blood flow due to COVID-19-induced downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 might be associated with the development of pathological conditions that resemble SIR syndrome, leading to impaired subcutaneous insulin absorption.

There were disproportionate decreases in the numbers of ED visits for children in early childhood (66.5%), low-acuity children (55.2-63.8%), those who did not use an ambulance (59.0%), and those visiting the ED for noninjury complaints (64.9%). The proportion of admissions increased from 11.9% to 16.6%. For every 10-point increase in the GRSI, there was a 15.1% decrease in monthly ED visits. CONCLUSION: A striking decrease in pediatric ED visits was observed during the COVID-19 outbreak, the scale which was associated with the stringency of government policies. Changes in the number and characteristics of children visiting the ED should be considered to facilitate the effective operation of EDs during the pandemic.","Choi, Dong Hyun; Jung, Jae Yun; Suh, Dongbum; Choi, Jea Yeon; Lee, Se Uk; Choi, Yoo Jin; Kwak, Young Ho; Kim, Do Kyun",J Korean Med Sci,71,16

It is the complications of diabetes such as cardiovascular, renal, neuronal and ocular dysfunction that lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality. Of these, cardiovascular complications that can result in stroke and cardiomyopathies are 2- to 5-fold more likely in diabetes but the underlying mechanisms involved in their development are not fully understood. Emerging research suggests that members of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR/ErbB/HER) family of tyrosine kinases can have a dual role in that they are beneficially required for normal development and physiological functioning of the cardiovascular system (CVS) as well as in salvage pathways following acute cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury but their chronic dysregulation may also be intricately involved in mediating diabetes-induced cardiovascular pathologies. Here we review the evidence for EGFR/ErbB/HER receptors in mediating these dual roles in the CVS and also discuss their potential interplay with the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System heptapeptide, Angiotensin-(1-7), as well the arachidonic acid metabolite, 20-HETE (20-hydroxy-5, 8, 11, 14-eicosatetraenoic acid). A greater understanding of the multi-faceted roles of EGFR/ErbB/HER family of tyrosine kinases and their interplay with other key modulators of cardiovascular function could facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating diabetes-induced cardiovascular complications.","Shraim, Bara A.; Moursi, Moaz O.; Benter, Ibrahim F.; Habib, Abdella M.; Akhtar, Saghir",Front Pharmacol,71,26

However, the effect of school closures during COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent sleep duration remains unclear. METHODS: We undertook a cross-sectional electronic survey in six junior and senior high schools in Shanghai, China from late June to early July 2020. We evaluated the changes of sleep duration on weekdays by comparing sleep duration hours and insufficient sleep (< 9 h for children aged 6–13 years or < 8 h for teenagers aged 14–17 years) in COVID-19 school closures and after school reopening. We also investigated possible sex differences in the changes of sleep duration. RESULTS: A total of 3265 students completed the survey, the mean age was 14.56 ± 1.99 years, 1567 (47.99%) were girls and 1344 (41.17%) were in grades 10–12. The overall sleep duration decreased from 8.88 h in school closures to 7.77 h after school reopening, and the change (difference: − 1.11 h; 95%CI: − 1.16, − 1.07; P < 0.001) was statistically significant. The prevalence of insufficient sleep increased sharply from 21.10 to 63.98%, and the change (ratio:3.03; 95%CI:2.84, 3.23; P < 0.001) was statistically significant. Besides, the changes were greater in girls than in boys. CONCLUSION: Results of this study revealed that sleep duration was longer and percentage of sufficient sleep was higher during COVID-19 school closures in adolescent students.","Lian, Qiguo; Zuo, Xiayun; Zhong, Xiangyang; Tu, Xiaowen; Zhang, Jiashuai; Shu, Chang; Yu, Chunyan; Lou, Chaohua",BMC Public Health,71,16

The main symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are dry cough, fever, and fatigue. COVID-19 appears to affect all systems, including renal, cardiovascular, circulatory, and respiratory systems, causing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We report on a 14-year-old male adolescent, who presented with thrombocytopenia (platelet count 92 × 10(9) /L) and leukopenia (white blood count 4.2 × 10(3) /μL) that was observed two months ago. Ten days before the first blood test, a viral infection with nasal congestion and runny nose was reported, without other accompanying symptoms. Viral antibodies screening revealed positivity for all the three specific COVID-19 antibodies. Further haematological evaluation with bone marrow aspiration revealed non-specific dysplastic features of the red cell and megakaryocyte progenitors. Although haematological alterations due to COVID-19 infection are available from adult patients’ reports, the effect of COVID-19 infection in the pediatric population is underestimated and this is the first case with such haematological involvement. Noteworthy, in the current case, the impact of the COVID-19 infection was not related to the severity of the disease, as the symptoms were mild. In similar cases, bone marrow aspiration would not be performed as a part of routine work-up. Thus, it is important when evaluating pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection to search and report those alterations in order to better understand the impact and the spectrum of clinical manifestations of the specific viral infection in children and adolescents.","Kossiva, Lydia; Thirios, Athanasios; Panagouli, Eleni; Panos, Alexandros; Lampidi, Stavroula; Bacopoulou, Flora; Tsolia, Maria; Tsitsika, Artemis",Children (Basel),71,16

Recent studies on the disease have evaluated different variables, namely, quarantine models, mitigation efforts, damage to mental health, mortality of the population with chronic diseases, diagnosis, use of masks and social distancing, and mortality based on age. This study focused on the four NHSs recognized by the WHO. These systems are as follows: (1) The Beveridge model, (2) the Bismarck model, (3) the National Health Insurance (NHI) model, and (4) the “Out-of-Pocket” model. The study analyzes the response of the health systems to the pandemic by comparing the time in days required to double the number of disease-related deaths. The statistical analysis was limited to 56 countries representing 70% of the global population. Each country was grouped into the health system defined by the WHO. The study compared the median death toll DT, between health systems using Mood's median test method. The results show high variability of the temporal trends in each group; none of the health systems for the three analyzed periods maintain stable interquartile ranges (IQRs). Nevertheless, the results obtained show similar medians between the study groups. The COVID-19 pandemic saturates health systems regardless of their management structures, and the result measured with the time for doubling death rate variable is similar among the four NHSs.","Alfaro, Miguel; Muñoz-Godoy, Diego; Vargas, Manuel; Fuertes, Guillermo; Duran, Claudia; Ternero, Rodrigo; Sabattin, Jorge; Gutierrez, Sebastian; Karstegl, Natalia",Front Public Health,71,3

Here, we tested whether high-dose vitamin C infusion was effective for severe COVID-19. METHODS: This randomized, controlled, clinical trial was performed at 3 hospitals in Hubei, China. Patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the ICU were randomly assigned in as 1:1 ratio to either the high-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) or the placebo. HDIVC group received 12 g of vitamin C/50 ml every 12 h for 7 days at a rate of 12 ml/hour, and the placebo group received bacteriostatic water for injection in the same way within 48 h of arrival to ICU. The primary outcome was invasive mechanical ventilation-free days in 28 days (IMVFD28). Secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, organ failure (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score), and inflammation progression (interleukin-6). RESULTS: Only 56 critical COVID-19 patients were ultimately recruited due to the early control of the outbreak. There was no difference in IMVFD28 between two groups (26.0 [9.0–28.0] in HDIVC vs 22.0 [8.50–28.0] in control, p = 0.57). HDIVC failed to reduce 28-day mortality (P = 0.27). During the 7-day treatment period, patients in the HDIVC group had a steady rise in the PaO(2)/FiO(2) (day 7: 229 vs. 151 mmHg, 95% CI 33 to 122, P = 0.01), which was not observed in the control group.

E protein ion channel (IC) activity is specifically correlated with enhanced pulmonary damage, edema accumulation and death. IL-1β driven proinflammation is associated with those pathological signatures, however its link to IC activity remains unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV E protein forms protein–lipid channels in ERGIC/Golgi membranes that are permeable to calcium ions, a highly relevant feature never reported before. Calcium ions together with pH modulated E protein pore charge and selectivity. Interestingly, E protein IC activity boosted the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to IL-1β overproduction. Calcium transport through the E protein IC was the main trigger of this process. These findings strikingly link SARS-CoV E protein IC induced ionic disturbances at the cell level to immunopathological consequences and disease worsening in the infected organism.","Nieto-Torres, Jose L.; Verdiá-Báguena, Carmina; Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M.; Regla-Nava, Jose A.; Castaño-Rodriguez, Carlos; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Torres, Jaume; Aguilella, Vicente M.; Enjuanes, Luis",Virology,71,1

However, its prevalence and association with sociodemographic factors and psychological process variables has not been explored in frontline workers under surveillance in a Bornean population. This study was a cross-sectional study using a sociodemographic questionnaire incorporating two specific epidemiological risk variables, namely specific questions about COVID-19 surveillance status (persons under investigation (PUI), persons under surveillance (PUS), and positive cases) and the nature of frontline worker status. Furthermore, five other instruments were used, with three measuring psychopathology (namely depression, anxiety and stress, fear of COVID-19, and stress due to COVID-19) and two psychological process variables (namely psychological flexibility and mindfulness). Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney tests were performed to assess if there were significant differences in psychopathology and psychological process variables between sociodemographic and epidemiological risk variables. Hierarchical multiple regression was further performed, with depression, anxiety, and stress as dependent variables. There were significant differences in the fear of COVID-19 between positive cases, PUI, and PUS. The fear of COVID-19 scores were higher in positive cases compared to in PUS and PUI groups. Upon hierarchical multiple regression, mindfulness and psychological flexibility were significant predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress after controlling for sociodemographic and epidemiological risk factors. This study demonstrates that exposure to COVID-19 as persons under investigation or surveillance significantly increases the fear of COVID-19, and brief psychological interventions that can positively influence mindfulness and psychological flexibility should be prioritized for these at-risk groups to prevent undue psychological morbidity in the long run.","Pang, Nicholas Tze Ping; Nold Imon, Gracyvinea; Johoniki, Elisa; Mohd Kassim, Mohd Amiruddin; Omar, Azizan; Syed Abdul Rahim, Syed Sharizman; Hayati, Firdaus; Jeffree, Mohammad Saffree; Ng, Jun Rong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,71,23

It has been suggested that Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) can be another possible receptor for this virus. The present study aimed to establish if the DPP4 levels and DPP4 polymorphisms are associated with COVID-19 disease and its severity. METHODS: The study included 107 COVID-19 patients and 263 matched-healthy controls. Fifty patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The DPP4 was quantified in serum using the Bioplex system. Based on the previous results and the functional prediction analysis, we select for the study 5 DPP4 polymorphisms (rs12617336, rs12617656, rs1558957, rs3788979, and rs17574) and these were determined using the 5´exonuclease TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Low levels of DPP4 were observed in COVID-19 patients (46.5 [33.1–57.7] ng/mL) when compared to healthy controls (125.3 [100.3–157.3] ng/mL) (P < 0.0001). Also, patients that required mechanical ventilation showed lower DPP4 levels (42.8 [29.8–56.9] ng/mL) than those that did not need this procedure (49.2 [39.9–65.6] ng/mL) (P = 0.012). DPP4 levels correlated negatively with age, fibrinogen, and platelet levels, and positively with albumin, alanine aminotransferase, and percentage of neutrophils. The DPP4 rs3788979 polymorphism was associated with a high risk of COVID-19 disease and, the TT genotype carriers had the lowest DPP4 levels. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, in the present study, an association of low levels of DDP4 with COVID-19 disease and severity was found.

To date, there has been a lack of data on COVID-19 vaccination willingness, vaccine hesitancy, and vaccination coverage in China since the vaccine has become available. Methods We designed and implemented a cross-sectional, population-based online survey to evaluate the willingness, hesitancy, and coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine among the Chinese population. 8742 valid samples were recruited and classified as the vaccine-priority group (n = 3902; 44.6%) and the non-priority group (n = 4840; 55.4%). Results The proportion of people’s trust in the vaccine, delivery system, and government were 69.0%, 78.0% and 81.3%, respectively. 67.1% of the participants were reportedly willing to accept the COVID-19 vaccination, while 9.0% refused it. 834 (35.5%) reported vaccine hesitancy, including acceptors with doubts (48.8%), refusers (39.4%), and delayers (11.8%). The current coverage was 34.4%, far from reaching the requirements of herd immunity. The predicted rate of COVID-19 vaccination was 64.9%, 68.9% and 81.1% based on the rates of vaccine hesitancy, willingness, and refusal, respectively. Conclusions The COVID-19 vaccine rate is far from reaching the requirements of herd immunity, which will require more flexible and comprehensive efforts to improve the population’s confidence and willingness to vaccinate.

OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively explore the prevalence and reliable risk prediction for VTE in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS/RESULTS: This retrospective study enrolled all COVID‐19 patients with a subsequent VTE in 16 centers in China from January 1 to March 31, 2020. A total of 2779 patients were confirmed with COVID‐19. In comparison to 23,434 non‐COVID‐19 medical inpatients, the odds ratios (ORs) for developing symptomatic VTE in severe and non‐severe hospitalized COVID‐19 patients were 5.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.91–10.09) and 2.79 (95% CI 1.43–5.60), respectively. When 104 VTE cases and 208 non‐VTE cases were compared, pulmonary embolism cases had a higher rate for in‐hospital death (OR 6.74, 95% CI 2.18–20.81). VTE developed at a median of 21 days (interquartile range 13.25–31) since onset. Independent factors for VTE were advancing age, cancer, longer interval from symptom onset to admission, lower fibrinogen and higher D‐dimer on admission, and D‐dimer increment (DI) ≥1.5‐fold; of these, DI ≥1.5‐fold had the most significant association (OR 14.18, 95% CI 6.25–32.18, p = 2.23 × 10(−10)). A novel model consisting of three simple coagulation variables (fibrinogen and D‐dimer levels on admission, and DI ≥1.5‐fold) showed good prediction for symptomatic VTE (area under the curve 0.865, 95% CI 0.822–0.907, sensitivity 0.930, specificity 0.710). CONCLUSIONS: There is an excess risk of VTE in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients.

Nonetheless, little research has so far been aimed at understanding the best human-AI interaction protocols in collaborative tasks, even in currently more viable settings, like independent double-reading screening tasks. METHODS: To this aim, we report about a retrospective case–control study, involving 12 board-certified radiologists, in the detection of knee lesions by means of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, in which we simulated the serial combination of two Deep Learning models with humans in eight double-reading protocols. Inspired by the so-called Kasparov’s Laws, we investigate whether the combination of humans and AI models could achieve better performance than AI models alone, and whether weak reader, when supported by fit-for-use interaction protocols, could out-perform stronger readers. RESULTS: We discuss two main findings: groups of humans who perform significantly worse than a state-of-the-art AI can significantly outperform it if their judgements are aggregated by majority voting (in concordance with the first part of the Kasparov’s law); small ensembles of significantly weaker readers can significantly outperform teams of stronger readers, supported by the same computational tool, when the judgments of the former ones are combined within “fit-for-use” protocols (in concordance with the second part of the Kasparov’s law). CONCLUSION: Our study shows that good interaction protocols can guarantee improved decision performance that easily surpasses the performance of individual agents, even of realistic super-human AI systems. This finding highlights the importance of focusing on how to guarantee better co-operation within human-AI teams, so to enable safer and more human sustainable care practices.","Cabitza, Federico; Campagner, Andrea; Sconfienza, Luca Maria",Health Inf Sci Syst,71,1

We therefore conducted a population survey to describe: 1) stress, concerns and quality of life 2) access to healthcare and cancelled/delayed healthcare and 3) productivity during the first 8 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in the general population. Methods: An online survey was conducted in a representative sample after 8 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in Belgium and the Netherlands. The survey included questions about stress, concerns, quality of life delayed/cancelled medical care and productivity loss using validated questionnaires. Results: In total, 2099 Belgian and 2058 Dutch respondents completed the survey with a mean age of 46.4 and 42.0 years, respectively. Half of the respondents were female in both countries. A small proportion tested positive for COVID-19, 1.4% vs 4.7%, respectively. The majority of respondents with a medical condition was worried about their current health state due to the pandemic (53%) vs (63%), respectively. Respondents experienced postponed/cancelled care (26%) and were concerned about the availability of medication (32%) for both countries. Productivity losses due to the COVID-19 restrictions were calculated in absenteeism (36%) and presenteeism (30%) for Belgium, and (19%) and (35%) for the Netherlands. Most concerns and productivity losses were reported by respondents with children <12 years, respondents aged 18-35 and respondents with an (expected) COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: This study describes stress, quality of life, medical resource loss and productivity losses in Belgium and the Netherlands after 8 weeks of coronavirus lockdown.

A large portion of our everyday social interactions is non-verbal. Of the sensory modalities we use for non-verbal communication, olfaction (i.e., the sense of smell) is often considered the most enigmatic medium. Outside of our awareness, smells provide information about our identity, emotions, gender, mate compatibility, illness, and potentially more. Yet, body odors are astonishingly complex, with their composition being influenced by various factors. Is there a chemical basis of olfactory communication? Can we identify molecules predictive of psychological states and traits? We propose that answering these questions requires integrating two disciplines: psychology and chemistry. This new field, coined sociochemistry, faces new challenges emerging from the sheer amount of factors causing variability in chemical composition of body odorants on the one hand (e.g., diet, hygiene, skin bacteria, hormones, genes), and variability in psychological states and traits on the other (e.g., genes, culture, hormones, internal state, context). In past research, the reality of these high-dimensional data has been reduced in an attempt to isolate unidimensional factors in small, homogenous samples under tightly controlled settings. Here, we propose big data approaches to establish novel links between chemical and psychological data on a large scale from heterogeneous samples in ecologically valid settings. This approach would increase our grip on the way chemical signals non-verbally and subconsciously affect our social lives across contexts.","de Groot, Jasper H.

The aim of this study was to predict antigenic peptides of SARS-CoV-2 for designing the COVID-19 vaccine using immunoinformatic analysis. In this study, T and B-cell epitopes of S protein were predicted and screened based on the antigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, and cross-reactivity with human proteomes. The epitopes were joined by the appropriate linker. LT-IIc as an adjuvant was attached to the end of the structure. The secondary and 3D structure of the vaccine was predicted. The refinement process was performed to improve the quality of the 3D model structure; the validation process is performed using the Ramachandran plot and ProSA z-score. The proposed vaccine's binding affinity to the HLA-A11: 01 and HLA-DRB1_01: 01 molecule was evaluated by molecular docking. Using molecular dynamics, the stability of vaccine-HLA complexes was also evaluated. Finally, in silico gene cloning was performed in the pET30a (+) vector.

Recent clinical reports suggested that the pulmonary failure seen in COVID-19 may not be solely driven by acute ARDS, but also microvascular thrombotic events, likely driven by complement activation4,5. However, it is not fully understood how the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms mediate thrombotic events, and whether such mechanisms and responses are unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other respiratory infections. We address these questions here, in the context of normal lung epithelia, in vitro and in vivo, using publicly available data. Our results indicate that plasmin is a crucial mediator which primes interactions between complement and platelet-activating systems in lung epithelia upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a potential for therapeutic intervention.","Mukund, Kavitha; Mathee, Kalai; Subramaniam, Shankar",bioRxiv,71,16

Our objectives were: i) to assess malnutrition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ii) to investigate the links between malnutrition and disease severity at admission, iii) to study the impact of malnutrition on clinical outcomes such as transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Methods Consecutive patients hospitalized in a medicine ward at a university hospital were included from March 21st to April 24th 2020 (n=114, 60.5% males, age: 59.9 ± 15.9 years). Nutritional status was defined using Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. Clinical, radiological and biological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were compared according to the presence of malnutrition. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between nutritional parameters and unfavourable outcomes such as transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Results The overall prevalence of malnutrition was 42.1% (moderate: 23.7%, severe: 18.4%). The prevalence of malnutrition reached 66.7% in patients admitted from ICU. No significant association was found between nutritional status and clinical signs of COVID-19. Lower albumin levels were associated with a higher risk of transfer to ICU (for 10g/l of albumin, OR [95%CI]: 0.31 [0.1; 0.7]; p<0.01) and this association was independent of age and CRP levels. Conclusions COVID-19 in medical units dedicated to non-intensive care is associated with a high prevalence of malnutrition, especially for patients transferred from ICU. These data emphasize the importance of early nutritional screening in these patients to adapt management accordingly.","Bedock, Dorothée; Lassen, Pierre Bel; Mathian, Alexis; Moreau, Pauline; Couffignal, Julie; Ciangura, Cécile; Poitou-Bernert, Christine; Jeannin, Anne-Caroline; Mosbah, Helena; Fadlallah, Jehane; Amoura, Zahir; Oppert, Jean-Michel; Faucher, Pauline",Clin Nutr ESPEN,71,1

We aimed to evaluate the effect of age on functional outcome and mortality following an acute ischemic event. METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospectively maintained database from comprehensive stroke centers in Canada and the United States was analyzed for patients with AIS from March 14 to September 30, 2020 who tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. The primary outcome was Modified Rankin Scale score at discharge, and the secondary outcome was mortality. Baseline characteristics, laboratory values, imaging, and thrombectomy workflow process times were assessed. Among all 126 patients with COVID‐19 who were diagnosed with AIS, the median age was 63 years (range, 27–94). There were 35 (27.8%) patients with AIS in the aged ≤55 years group, 47 (37.3%) in the aged 56 to 70 group, and 44 (34.9%) in the aged >70 group. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and thrombectomy rates were comparable across these groups, (P=0.331 and 0.212, respectively). There was a significantly lower rate of mortality between each group favoring younger age (21.9% versus 45.0% versus 48.8%, P=0.047). After multivariable adjustment for possible confounders, a 1‐year increase in age was significantly associated with fewer instances of a favorable outcome of Modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2 (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95 CI%, 0.90–0.99; P=0.048) and higher mortality (OR, 1.06; 95 CI%, 1.02–1.10; P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: AIS in the context of COVID‐19 affects young patients at much greater rates than pre‐pandemic controls. Nevertheless, instances of poor functional outcome and mortality are closely tied to increasing age.","Dmytriw, Adam A.; Dibas, Mahmoud; Schirmer, Clemens M.; Settecase, Fabio; Heran, Manraj K.

Participants who reported that they did not feel physically normal were then asked by the app to complete a series of questions, including 14 potential COVID-19 symptoms and about hospital attendance. The main study outcome was the development of ‘classic’ symptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic defined as fever, new persistent cough and breathlessness and their association with current smoking. The number of concurrent COVID-19 symptoms was used as a proxy for severity and the pattern of association between symptoms was also compared between smokers and non-smokers.

Little is known about the acceptability and compliance with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine among HCWs during the current campaign. Between 23 December 2009 and 13 January 2010, once the workplace vaccination program was over, we conducted a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey at the University Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain). Five hundred twenty-seven HCWs were asked about their influenza immunization history during the 2009–2010 season, as well as the reasons for accepting or declining either the seasonal or pandemic vaccines. Multiple logistic-regression analysis was preformed to identify variables associated with immunization acceptance. A total of 262 HCWs (49.7%) reported having received the seasonal vaccine, while only 87 (16.5%) affirmed having received the pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 vaccine. “Self-protection” and “protection of the patient” were the most frequently adduced reasons for acceptance of the pandemic vaccination, whereas the existence of “doubts about vaccine efficacy” and “fear of adverse reactions” were the main arguments for refusal. Simultaneous receipt of the seasonal vaccine (odds ratio [OR]: 0.27; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.14–0.52) and being a staff (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.04–0.19) or a resident physician (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.05–0.50) emerged as independent predictors for pandemic vaccine acceptance, whereas self-reported membership of a priority group was associated with refusal (OR: 5.98; 95% CI: 1.35–26.5). The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccination coverage among the HCWs in our institution was very low (16.5%), suggesting the role of specific attitudinal barriers and misconceptions about immunization in a global pandemic scenario.","Vírseda, Silvia; Restrepo, María Alejandra; Arranz, Elena; Magán-Tapia, Purificación; Fernández-Ruiz, Mario; de la Cámara, Agustín Gómez; Aguado, José María; López-Medrano, Francisco",Vaccine,71,30

We explored the risk factors that influence patient outcomes, including treatment regimens, which can provide a reference for further treatment. MATERIAL/METHODS: A retrospective cohort study analysis was performed using data from 97 patients with COVID-19 who visited Wuhan Union Hospital from February 2020 to March 2020. We collected data on demographics, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, treatment methods, outcomes, and complications. Patients were divided into a recovered group and a deceased group. We compared the differences between the 2 groups and analyzed risk factors influencing the treatment effect. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients recovered and 21 died. The average age and body mass index (BMI) of the deceased group were significantly higher than those of the recovered group (69.81±6.80 years vs 60.79±11.28 years, P<0.001 and 24.95±3.14 kg/m(2) vs 23.09±2.97 kg/m(2), P=0.014, respectively).

Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that age, BMI, H-CRP, shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were independent risk factors for patients with COVID-19 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients and those with a high BMI, as well as patients who experience shock and ARDS, may have a higher risk of death from COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to evaluate the sequelae up to 6 months after hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, considering 1) the recovery of pulmonary function and radiological abnormalities, physical and mental health status, and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL); and 2) the predictors of the most clinically relevant sequelae. METHODS Patients were evaluated at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months after hospitalization with pulmonary function testing, radiological evaluation, and online questionnaires on physical and mental health status and HR-QoL. Outcomes were analyzed with repeated measurements analyses. RESULTS Ninety-two patients were included; mean age 58.2±12.3 years, and 58 (63.0%) males. The estimated percentage of patients with impaired FVC improved from 25% at 6 weeks to 11% at 6 months; for impaired diffusion capacity this percentage improved from 63% to 46%.. Radiologically ground glass decreased, but fibrosis persisted. The majority of patients (89.1%) still reported >1 symptom 6 months after discharge. Fatigue decreased significantly over time (p=0.006). Nonetheless, fatigue remained present in 51% of the patients at 6 months. HR-QoL (nearly) normalized in most domains at 6 months, except for physical role functioning, with persistent fatigue and length of hospitalization as most important predictors. CONCLUSIONS During the first 6 months after hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 most patients demonstrated continuing recovery across all health domains, but persistent sequelae were frequent.

We present a case of a child with serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection whose onset was a massive right cerebral artery ischemia that led to a malignant cerebral infarction. The patient underwent a life-saving decompressive hemicraniectomy, with good functional recovery, except for residual hemiplegia. During rehabilitation, the patient also developed a lower extremity peripheral nerve neuropathy, likely related to a long-Covid syndrome.","Scala, Maria Rosaria; Spennato, Pietro; Cicala, Domenico; Piccolo, Veronica; Varone, Antonio; Cinalli, Giuseppe",Childs Nerv Syst,71,1

However, in the context of an ongoing pandemic there is an interplay between infection and vaccination. While infection can grow exponentially, vaccination rates are generally limited by supply and logistics. With the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccines receiving medical approval requiring two doses, there has been scrutiny on the spacing between doses; an elongated period between doses allows more of the population to receive a first vaccine dose in the short-term generating wide-spread partial immunity. Focusing on data from England, we investigated prioritization of a one dose or two dose vaccination schedule given a fixed number of vaccine doses and with respect to a measure of maximizing averted deaths. We optimized outcomes for two different estimates of population size and relative risk of mortality for at-risk groups within the Phase 1 vaccine priority order. Vaccines offering relatively high protection from the first dose favour strategies that prioritize giving more people one dose, although with increasing vaccine supply eventually those eligible and accepting vaccination will receive two doses. While optimal dose timing can substantially reduce the overall mortality risk, there needs to be careful consideration of the logistics of vaccine delivery.","Hill, Edward M.; Keeling, Matt J.",J R Soc Interface,71,28

Although respiratory disease remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID patients, myocardial damage is a common finding. Many possible biological pathways may explain the relationship between COVID-19 and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Increased immune and inflammatory responses, and procoagulant profile have characterized COVID patients. All these responses may induce endothelial dysfunction, myocardial injury, plaque instability, and AMI. Disease severity and mortality are increased by cardiovascular comorbidities. Moreover, COVID-19 has been associated with air pollution, which may also represent an AMI risk factor. Nonetheless, a significant reduction in patient admissions following containment initiatives has been observed, including for AMI. The reasons for this phenomenon are largely unknown, although a real decrease in the incidence of cardiac events seems highly improbable. Instead, patients likely may present delayed time from symptoms onset and subsequent referral to emergency departments because of fear of possible in-hospital infection, and as such, may present more complications. Here, we aim to discuss available evidence about all these factors in the complex relationship between COVID-19 and AMI, with particular focus on psychological distress and the need to increase awareness of ischemic symptoms.","Gorini, Francesca; Chatzianagnostou, Kyriazoula; Mazzone, Annamaria; Bustaffa, Elisa; Esposito, Augusto; Berti, Sergio; Bianchi, Fabrizio; Vassalle, Cristina",Int J Environ Res Public Health,71,28

Here we used the patient data from the multicenter Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2 - Infected Patients (LEOSS) and applied a technique of variable selection in order to develop a simplified score to identify patients at increased risk of critical illness or death. A total of 1,946 patients, who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included in the initial analysis. They were split into a derivation and a validation cohort (n=1,297 and 649, respectively). A stability selection among a total of 105 baseline predictors for the combined endpoint of progression to critical phase or COVID-19-related death allowed us to develop a simplified score consisting of five predictors: CRP, Age, clinical disease phase (uncomplicated vs. complicated), serum urea and D-dimer (abbreviated as CAPS-D score). This score showed an AUC of 0.81 (CI95%: 0.77-0.85) in the validation cohort for predicting the combined endpoint within 7 days of diagnosis and 0.81 (CI95%: 0.77-0.85) during the full follow-up. Finally, we used an additional prospective cohort of 682 patients, who were diagnosed largely after the ""first wave"" of the pandemic to validate predictive accuracy of the score, observing similar results (AUC for an event within 7 days: 0.83, CI95%, 0.78-0.87; for full follow-up: 0.82, CI95%, 0.78-0.86).

However, their prevalence in different patient populations still needs to be clarified. METHODS: : A cross‐sectional study was performed from March 27 to April 1 2020 in Northern Italy. Physicians administered a survey‐based questionnaire to SARS‐CoV‐2 positive patients with the aim of assessing symptoms, focusing on OD and GD. Two groups were studied: patients hospitalized at ASST Spedali Civili University Hospital of Brescia (A); home‐quarantined subjects (B). RESULTS: : A total of 508 patients were enrolled: 295 in Group A and 213 in Group B. Mean age (±SD) was 55±15 years; 56% were men. Overall, OD and GD were present in 56% (95% CI 51‐60%) and 63% (59‐67%) of cases, respectively. In Group A, the prevalence of OD and GD was 44% (38‐50%) and 52% (46‐58%). In Group B, the prevalence of OD and GD was 72% (65‐79%) and 79% (73‐84%). In the entire cohort, total loss of olfaction and taste was reported in 64% and 60% of cases, respectively. OD and GD occurred as the first symptom in 10% and 11% of cases; in the remaining cases, they occurred after a mean of 4±3 days following the first symptom. At the time of the questionnaire, complete resolution of OD and GD was reported in 52% and 55% of cases (mean duration: 9±5 in both). CONCLUSIONS: : OD and GD are more prevalent in home‐quarantined subjects, and they are independently associated with younger age and female gender. This article is protected by copyright.

In this regard, we herein propose the specific and highly sensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection based on nanoyeast single-chain-variable fragment (scFv) and ultrasensitive plasmonic nanobox-integrated nanomixing microassay. Importantly, this designed platform showcases the utility of nanoyeast-scFvs as specific capture reagents targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the virus and as monoclonal antibody alternatives suitable for cost-effective mass production and frequent testing. By capitalizing on single-particle active nanoboxes as plasmonic nanostructures for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), the microassay utilizes highly sensitive Raman signals to indicate virus infection. The developed microassay further integrated nanomixing for accelerating molecular collisions. Through the synergistic working of nanoyeast-scFv, plasmonic nanoboxes, and nanomixing, the highly specific and sensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection is achieved as low as 17 virus/μL without any molecular amplification. We successfully demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva samples of simulated patients at clinically relevant viral loads, suggesting the possibility of this platform for accurate and noninvasive patient screening.","Li, Junrong; Wuethrich, Alain; Edwardraja, Selvakumar; Lobb, Richard J.; Puttick, Simon; Rose, Stephen; Howard, Christopher B.; Trau, Matt",Anal Chem,71,6

Rehabilitation coordinators, a new function in Swedish healthcare, support people in the RTW process. The present study had two aims: to explore what problems and barriers people with multimorbidity experience during their rehabilitation and RTW process and to explore in which domains the coordinators’ support is perceived to be of importance. METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 12 persons with multimorbidity who had contact with a rehabilitation coordinator during their sickness absence. Thematic analysis was guided by the case-management ecological model; this analysis was revised and adapted to the Swedish context. RESULTS: The participants experienced problems in all domains of the model, namely: “the healthcare system”, “the labor market and the workplace system”, “the sickness insurance system”, and “the personal system”. Rehabilitation programs that did not accommodate combinations of diseases, social complexities and needs were felt to lead to worse symptoms, thus hindering rather than promoting RTW. An overall finding regarding support by coordinators is that interventions, regardless of domain, were felt to be valuable for people with multimorbidity. The coordinator was perceived to give most support by providing advice about and coordination with healthcare and employers. Sometimes the coordinator gave advice and coordination regarding the Social Insurance Agency, very occasionally the Public Employment Services. The coordinator gave least advice and coordination about social difficulties that hindered rehabilitation and RTW processes. CONCLUSION: People with multimorbidity perceive rehabilitation coordinator interventions as important in all domains investigated. Lack of advice and coordination, or rehabilitation programs that were not modified to the complexities of individual’s circumstances, were associated with prolonged sickness absence, worse health, or social risk factors not being recognized.","Svärd, Veronica; Friberg, Emilie; Azad, Azadé",J Multidiscip Healthc,71,26

Various factors such as a cytokine storm due to an excessive immune response to inflammation, hypoxemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation are considered predisposing factors for thrombotic complications. A 55-year-old Japanese man intubated eight days previously was referred to our hospital because of a severe COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis after his pharyngeal swab tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The patient continued to remain hypoxic (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio <100 mmHg) at the referring hospital. On admission, we initiated veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). Unfractionated heparin and nafamostat mesylate were used as anticoagulants during VV-ECMO. Despite adequate anticoagulant therapy, he developed pulmonary infarction due to pulmonary embolism followed by hemoptysis. On day 10 following admission, his oxygen saturation dropped from 95% to 88%, with a marked decrease in his ventilator tidal volume, accompanied by an inability to ventilate the patient. Thereafter, we increased the VV-ECMO flow and exchanged his endotracheal tube. The lumen of the removed tracheal tube was found to be occluded by a large-sized blood coagulum. There was no further episode of tube occlusion. The patient was discharged in a walkable state on day 39 following admission. Endotracheal tube obstruction secondary to hemoptysis should be suggested in patients with COVID-19 requiring ventilator support, as they are unable to perform frequent endotracheal tube suctions owing to the risk of infection.","Maruhashi, Takaaki; Wada, Tatsuhiko; Masuda, Tomonari; Yamaoka, Kunihiro; Asari, Yasushi",Cureus,71,6

We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. Development Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. Conclusion Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS.","Matías-Guiu, J.; Gomez-Pinedo, U.; Montero-Escribano, P.; Gomez-Iglesias, P.; Porta-Etessam, J.; Matias-Guiu, J.

The latter suggests the presence of a possible sex-dependent susceptibility. An enzymatic system involved in this different predisposition could be represented by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is activated and down-regulated by the spike protein of the virus and allows the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into epithelial cells and myocardium. Data on the experimental animal have shown that 17ß-estradiol increases the expression and activity of ACE2 in both adipose tissue and kidney. Spontaneously hypertensive male mice have a higher myocardial ACE2 expression than females and its levels decrease after orchiectomy. In addition to this first aspect, the recent evidence of an increased frequency of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 (a clinical element associated with a worse prognosis) calls the attention on the safety of treatment with testosterone, in particular in hypogonadal men with greater genetic predisposition. Evidence that sex hormones are able to modulate the expression of ACE2 could help in interpreting epidemiological results and in designing more appropriate intervention strategies. Moreover, the vitamin D deficiency in elderly men may be worthy of further study regarding the epidemiological aspects of this different susceptibility and lethality between sexes.","La Vignera, Sandro; Cannarella, Rossella; Condorelli, Rosita A.; Torre, Francesco; Aversa, Antonio; Calogero, Aldo E.",Int J Mol Sci,71,20

Natural initial enteric FCoV infection may remain subclinical, or result in mild enteric signs or the development of FIP; cats may also carry the virus systemically with no adverse effect. This study screened mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), the presumed first site of FCoV spread from the intestine regardless of viraemia, for changes in the transcription of a panel of innate immune response mediators in response to systemic FCoV infection and with FIP, aiming to identify key pathways triggered by FCoV. Cats with and without FIP, the latter with and without FCoV infection in the MLN, were compared. Higher expression levels in FIP were found for toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2, 4 and 8. These are part of the first line of defence and suggest a response to both viral structural proteins and viral nucleic acid. Expression of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-15, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, CXCL10, CCL8, interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ, was higher in cats with FIP, consistent with inflammatory pathway activation. Expression of genes encoding transcription factors STAT1 and 2, regulating signalling pathways, particularly of the interferons, was also higher. Among cats without FIP, there were few differences between virus-positive and virus-negative MLNs; however, TLR9 and STAT2 expression were higher with infection, suggesting a direct viral effect. The study provides evidence for TLR involvement in the response to FCoV. This could open up new avenues for therapeutic approaches.","Malbon, A.J.; Meli, M.L.; Barker, E.N.; Davidson, A.D.; Tasker, S.; Kipar, A.",J Comp Pathol,71,1

Analytical performance was established on a pool of healthy donors’ saliva samples spiked with the 2019-nCoV/Italy-INMI1 isolate, whereas clinical performance was assessed on fresh saliva specimens collected from hospitalized patients with suspect or confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.65 Log TCID50/mL, corresponding to 18,197 copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Antigen concentrations and SARS-CoV-2 RNA were highly correlated (r = 0.99; p < 0.0001).

Sensitivity exceeded 90.0% when calculated on samples with Ct < 25, and specificity was 100% when excluding samples from recovered patients with previous COVID-19 diagnosis.

Understanding symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pre-clinical, community-based populations may improve clinical screening, particularly during flu season. We sought to identify key symptoms and symptom combinations in a community-based population using robust methods. METHODS: We pooled community-based cohorts of individuals aged 12 and older screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in April and June 2020 for a statewide prevalence study. Main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for individual symptoms as well as symptom combinations. We further employed multivariable logistic regression and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine symptoms and combinations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Among 8214 individuals screened, 368 individuals (4.5%) were RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although two-thirds of symptoms were highly specific (>90.0%), most symptoms individually possessed a PPV <50.0%. The individual symptoms most greatly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever (OR = 5.34, p<0.001), anosmia (OR = 4.08, p<0.001), ageusia (OR = 2.38, p = 0.006), and cough (OR = 2.86, p<0.001). Results from EFA identified two primary symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: (1) ageusia, anosmia, and fever; and (2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Moreover, being non-white (13.6% vs. 2.3%, p<0.001), Hispanic (27.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001), or living in an Urban area (5.4% vs. 3.8%, p<0.001) was associated with infection. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms can help distinguish SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses, especially in community or urgent care settings where rapid testing may be limited. Symptoms should further be structured in clinical documentation to support identification of new cases and mitigation of disease spread by public health. These symptoms, derived from asymptomatic as well as mildly infected individuals, can also inform vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials.","Dixon, Brian E.; Wools-Kaloustian, Kara K.; Fadel, William F.; Duszynski, Thomas J.; Yiannoutsos, Constantin; Halverson, Paul K.; Menachemi, Nir",PLoS One,71,20

Since SadA is a highly promiscuous TA-producing decarboxylase in Firmicutes, the skin microbiome was specifically examined for the presence of sadA-homologous genes. By mapping the reads of certain genes, we found that, although there were less reads mapping to sadA than to ubiquitous housekeeping genes (arcC and mutS), normalized reads counts were still >1000 times higher than those of rare control genes (icaA, icaB, and epiA). At protein sequence level SadA homologs were found in at least 7 phyla: Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Cyanobacteria, and in 23 genera of the phylum Firmicutes. A high proportion of the genera that have a SadA homolog belong to the classical skin and intestinal microbiota. The distribution of sadA in so many different phyla illustrates the importance of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We show that the sadA gene is widely distributed in the human skin microbiome. When comparing the sadA read counts in the probands, there was no correlation between age and gender, but an enormous difference in the sadA read counts in the microbiome of the individuals. Since sadA is involved in TA synthesis, it is likely that the TA content of the skin is correlated with the amount of TA producing bacteria in the microbiome. In this way, the microbiome-generated TA could influence signal transmission in the epithelial and nervous system.","Luqman, Arif; Zabel, Susanne; Rahmdel, Samane; Merz, Britta; Gruenheit, Nicole; Harter, Johannes; Nieselt, Kay; Götz, Friedrich",Front Microbiol,71,11

We report a pilot study in 13 patients with previously untreated advanced carcinoma of the digestive tract to assess the impact of high-dose pyridoxine (PN) on the antitumor activity of regimens comprising FUra and FA. Five patients had colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC); 5 had pancreas adenocarcinoma (PC); and 3 had squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (EC). Patients with CRC and with PC received oxaliplatin, irinotecan, FUra and FA, and patients with EC had paclitaxel, carboplatin, FUra and FA. PN iv from 1000 to 3000 mg/day preceded each administration of FA and FUra. Eleven patients responded. Two patients with CRC attained CRs and 3 had PRs with reduction rates ≥ 78%. Two patients with PC attained CRs, and 2 had PRs with reduction rates ≥ 79%. Responders experienced disappearance of most metastases. Of 3 patients with EC, 2 attained CRs. Median time to attain a response was 3 months. Unexpected toxicity did not occur. Results suggest that high-dose vitamin B6 enhances antitumor potency of regimens comprising FUra and FA.","Machover, David; Almohamad, Wathek; Castagné, Vincent; Desterke, Christophe; Gomez, Léa; Gaston-Mathé, Yann; Boucheix, Claude; Goldschmidt, Emma",Sci Rep,71,20

We also report on experiences and success stories from a state-wide EDTP program in South Carolina during the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: We identified 12 peer-reviewed articles published between January 2019 and February 2021 that evaluated EDTP interventions and their impact on patient outcomes. The recent evidence on EDTP shows a significant association between EDTP implementation or use and decreased patients’ wait time in emergency department (ED), shorter length of stay in certain settings, reduced ED revisit rates, improved ED patient disposition (e.g., more discharge to home, less observational stays, and decreased inpatient admissions), and reduced follow-up encounters involving self-harm diagnosis. SUMMARY: The EDTP virtual delivery model can help healthcare systems reduce burden of public health emergencies on providers, staff, and patients alike. While a disruption of magnitude seen by COVID-19 may be infrequent, strategies used during the pandemic may be implemented to enhance care in rural settings, and/or enhance preparedness of communities and healthcare systems during more commonly occurring natural disasters.","Natafgi, Nabil; Childers, Casey; Pollak, Amanda; Blackwell, Shanikque; Hardeman, Suzanne; Cooner, Stewart; Bank, Robert; Ratliff, Brenda; Gooch, Victoria; Rogers, Kenneth; Narasimhan, Meera",Curr Psychiatry Rep,71,20

Specifically, the vicious cycle of MDRPUs is triggered by the sustained tissue deformations induced by a skin-contacting device. The primary, deformation-inflicted cell damage leads to a secondary inflammatory-oedema-related damage and then to tertiary ischaemic damage. Each of these three factors contributes to cumulative cell death and tissue damage under and near the applied device. The damage therefore develops in an escalated manner, as a result of the added contributions of the above three factors. This phenomenon is exemplified through two common clinical scenarios. First, through the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) masks, which are being applied extensively in the current COVID-19 pandemic, and, second, through the use of doughnut-shaped head positioners, which are applied to surgical patients and sometimes to bedridden individuals who receive intensive care in a supine position. These two medical devices cause intense, localised mechanical loads in the facial skin and underlying tissues (CPAP mask) and at the occipital scalp (doughnut-shaped positioner), where the soft tissues cannot swell in response to the inflammatory oedema as, in both cases, the tissues are sandwiched between the device and the skull. Accordingly, the two device types result in characteristic MDRPUs that are avoidable through appropriate prophylactic interventions, that is, preventive dressings under the CPAP mask and replacement of the doughnut device by a soft, shape-conforming support aid to alleviate and disperse the localised soft tissue deformations. Hence, understanding the aetiology of MDRPUs targets and focuses effective clinical interventions.","Gefen, Amit",British journal of nursing,71,20

Casa Ippolito, now in ruins, is typical of 17th-century Maltese aristocratic country residences. It represents an illustration of secondary or anthropogenic geodiversity. This paper scrutinises these ruins as a primary source in reconstructing the building’s architecture. The methodology involved on-site geographical surveying, including visual inspection and non-invasive tests, a geological survey of the local lithostratigraphy, and examination of notarial deeds and secondary sources to support findings about the building’s history as read from its ruins. An unmanned aerial vehicle was used to digitally record the parlous state of the architectural structure and karsten tubes were used to quantify the surface porosity of the limestone. The results are expressed from four perspectives. The anatomy of Casa Ippolito, as revealed in its ruins, provides a cross-section of its building history and shows two distinct phases in its construction. The tissue of Casa Ippolito—the building elements and materials—speaks of the knowledge of raw materials and their properties among the builders who worked on both phases. The architectural history of Casa Ippolito reveals how it supported its inhabitants’ wellbeing in terms of shelter, water and food. Finally, the ruins in their present state bring to the fore the site’s potential for cultural tourism. This case study aims to show that such ruins are not just geocultural remains of historical built fabric. They are open wounds in the built structure; they underpin the anatomy of the building and support insights into its former dynamics. Ruins offer an essay in material culture and building physics. Architectural ruins of masonry structures are anthropogenic discourse rendered in stone which facilitate not only the reconstruction of spaces but also places for human users; they are a statement on the wellbeing of humanity throughout history.","Bianco, Lino",Herit Sci,71,1

This study aimed to investigate the stress and burnout levels of psychiatrists working in MH services in Turkey and determine the relationship between stress, workload, and support during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS An online questionnaire was sent to child and adult psychiatrists registered with Turkish professional mail groups. 217 psychiatrists replied, with equal numbers from child (n=108) and adult (n=109) MH services. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and study-specific questionnaire were used. RESULTS 60.8% of psychiatrists (n=132) experienced medium-or high-intensity work-related burnout, 49.8% (n=108) experienced patient-related burnout, and 31.8% (n=69) experienced medium-or high-intensity personal burnout. Patient-related burnout scores were significantly higher in the child psychiatry group than in the adult psychiatry group. The majority (n=126, 58.1%) reported either moderate or higher stress levels linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Turnover intention, reluctance to retrain in psychiatry and sense of lack of value in the job are all associated with higher levels of burnout. CONCLUSIONS The current COVID-19 pandemic is likely to bring additional stressors to psychiatrists. This study shows that psychiatrists in Turkey already exhibit high levels of work-related stress. Organizational interventions to ameliorate psychiatrists' wellbeing and work conditions are required.","Öğütlü, Hakan; McNicholas, Fiona; Türkçapar, Hakan",Psychiatria Danubina,71,16

Binding of ACE2 by SARS‐CoV‐2 in COVID‐19 also suggests that prolonged uncontrolled hyperglycemia, and not just a history of diabetes mellitus, may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease. It is tempting to consider that the same mechanism acts in COVID‐19 as in SARS, where an overactive macrophage M1 inflammatory response, as neutralizing antibodies to the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein form at day 7 to 10, results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in susceptible patients. It also allows consideration of agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, which may interfere with this overly brisk macrophage inflammatory response and perhaps influence the course of the disease, in particular, those that blunt but do not completely abrogate the M1 to M2 balance in macrophage polarization, as well as viral load, which in SARS appears to be temporally related to the onset of ARDS.","Brufsky, Adam",J Med Virol,71,33

Therefore, there is a recognized need to identify risk factors for COVID-19 severity and mortality. A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) for studies published before September 29, 2020, was performed. Studies that investigated risk factors for progression and mortality in COVID-19 patients were included. A total 344,431 participants from 34 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Regarding comorbidities, cerebrovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), coronary heart disease (CHD), and malignancy were associated with an increased risk of progression and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Regarding clinical manifestations, sputum production was associated with a dramatically increased risk of progression and mortality. Hemoptysis was a risk factor for death in COVID-19 patients. In laboratory examinations, increased neutrophil count, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased platelet count, increased C-reactive protein (CRP), coinfection with bacteria or fungi, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK), increased N-terminal pronatriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and bilateral pneumonia in CT/X-ray were significantly more frequent in the severe group compared with the non-severe group. Moreover, the proportion of patients with increased CRP and total bilirubin (TBIL) was also significantly higher in the deceased group than in the survival group.

Clearance guidelines have been proposed, but expected time to clearance has not been established. METHODS: We identified all patients at a tertiary care hospital cancer center between 25 March 2020 and 6 June 2020 with a positive nasopharyngeal reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) test for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), a cancer‐related visit within 3 years, and at least one follow‐up assay. We determined the time to clearance using American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK‐NICE), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. A matched non‐cancer comparison cohort was also identified. RESULTS: Thirty‐two cancer patients were identified. Nineteen were cleared by ASCO criteria, with estimated median time to clearance of 50 days. Fourteen patients resumed chemotherapy prior to clearance. Using UK‐NICE criteria, median time to clearance would have been 31 days, and using CDC criteria, it would have been 13 days. The matched non‐cancer cohort had similar clearance time, but with less frequent testing. CONCLUSION: SARS‐CoV‐2 clearance times differ substantially depending on the criteria used and may be prolonged in cancer patients. This could lead to a delay in cancer care, increased use of clearance testing, and extension of infection control precautions.","Xu, Wenxin; Piper‐Vallillo, Andrew J.; Bindal, Poorva; Wischhusen, Jonathan; Patel, Jaymin M.; Costa, Daniel B.; Peters, Mary Linton B.",Cancer Med,71,33

METHODS: Any relevant studies with or without comparator were included, with outcomes of: COVID-19 incidence, hospitalisation rates, illness severity, death rates, other health and well-being. Six databases (platforms) were searched—CINAHL Plus (Ovid), Cochrane Central (Cochrane Library), Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Science Citation Index (Web of Science) and Scopus between 2019 and 2020 in December 2020, using synonyms for sexual and gender minorities and COVID-19 search terms. Data extraction and quality assessment (using the relevant Joanna Briggs checklist) were in duplicate with differences resolved through discussion. Results were tabulated and synthesis was through narrative description. RESULTS: No published research was found on any outcomes. Eleven grey literature reports found to be of low quality were included, mostly conducted by small LGBT+ charities. Only four had heterosexual/cisgender comparators. Mental health and well-being, health behaviours, safety, social connectedness and access to routine healthcare all showed poorer or worse outcomes than comparators. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of research gives significant concern, given pre-existing health inequities. Social and structural factors may have contributed to poorer outcomes (mental health, well-being and access to healthcare). Paucity of evidence is driven by lack of routinely collected sexual orientation and gender identity data, possibly resulting from institutional homophobia/transphobia which needs to be addressed. Men are more at risk of serious illness from COVID-19 than women, so using data from trans women and men might have started to answer questions around whether higher rates were due to sex hormone or chromosomal effects. Routine data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity is required to examine the extent to which COVID-19 is widening pre-existing health inequalities.

The delivery of therapeutic proteins, in particular, can be achieved by anchoring them to the bacterial surface, and various anchoring domains have been described for this application. Here, we investigated a new cell anchoring domain (CAD4a) isolated from a Lactobacillus protein, containing repeats of a SH3_5 motif that binds non-covalently to peptidoglycan in the LAB cell wall. Using a fluorescent reporter, we showed that C-terminal CAD4a bound Lactobacillus fermentum selectively out of a panel of LAB strains, and cell anchoring was uniform across the cell surface. Conditions affecting CAD4a anchoring were studied, including temperature, pH, salt concentration, and bacterial growth phase. Quantitative analysis showed that CAD4a allowed display of 10(5) molecules of monomeric protein per cell. We demonstrated the surface display of a functional protein with superoxide dismutase (SOD), an antioxidant enzyme potentially useful for treating gut inflammation. SOD displayed on cells could be protected from gastric digestion using a polymer matrix. Taken together, our results show the feasibility of using CAD4a as a novel cell anchor for protein surface display on LAB.","Tay, Pei Kun Richie; Lim, Pei Yu; Ow, Dave Siak-Wei",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,71,16

The present study utilized the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS), and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) methods, while the gradual shift and wavelet coherence techniques are utilized to determine the direction of the causality. The ARDL bounds test reveals a long-run linkage between the variables of interest. Empirical evidence shows that CO(2) emissions trigger economic growth. Thus, based on increasing environmental awareness across the globe, it is necessary to change the energy mix in South Korea to renewables to enable the use of sustainable energy sources and establish an environmentally sustainable ecosystem. Moreover, the energy-induced growth hypothesis is validated. This result is supported by the causality analysis, which shows a one-way causality running from energy consumption to GDP in South Korea. This suggests that South Korea cannot embark on conservative energy policies, as such actions will damage economic progress. Additionally, a unidirectional causality is seen from CO(2) emissions and energy consumption to economic growth. These findings have far-reaching consequences for GDP growth and macroeconomic indicators in South Korea.","Adebayo, Tomiwa Sunday; Awosusi, Abraham Ayobamiji; Kirikkaleli, Dervis; Akinsola, Gbenga Daniel; Mwamba, Madhy Nyota",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,71,16

However, the need for anaesthetic and surgical care is escalating owing to the increasing size and ageing of the Swiss population. In addition, to address the persistent and recurrent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic crisis, the speciality of anaesthesia is under tremendous pressure to maintain an effective workforce in order to address population needs. The current number, characteristics and future evolution of the physician anaesthesia workforce in Switzerland are currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the size and professional and sociodemographic characteristics of the current anaesthesia workforce in Switzerland and to forecast its development up to 2034. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using a 150-item questionnaire prepared by the National Anaesthesia Workforce Study Group (NAWOS). We included all physicians (trainees and certified) practising anaesthesia in Switzerland. We collected demographic and professional information, such as the current position, hospital characteristics, workload, number of shifts and future life plans. We built a computer-based Markov model with Monte Carlo simulations to project both supply and demand for physician anaesthesia provider positions. RESULTS: Of the 2661 distributed questionnaires, 1985 (74.2%) were completed and returned. We found that the average age of anaesthesiologists practising in Switzerland was 45.2 years, with 44.3% of them being women and 76.9% holding a Swiss specialist title. Only 59.6% of respondents worked full time. The forecasting model showed a steady increase in the number of anaesthesiologists retiring by 2034, with 27% of full-time equivalent jobs being lost in the next 8 years. Even if existing full-time equivalent training positions are all filled, a gradual deficit of anaesthesiologists is to be expected after 2022, and the deficit should culminate in 2034 with a deficit ratio of 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the upcoming high retirement rate of anaesthesiologists, Switzerland is likely to face a shortage of anaesthesiologists in the near future. To compensate for the shortage, the country will likely increase its reliance on medical staff trained abroad. Southern and eastern cantons of Switzerland are particularly at risk, given that they already heavily rely on foreign anaesthesia workforce. This reliance should be considered a national priority because anaesthesiologists are heavily involved in both the treatment of patients with respiratory complications of SARS-CoV2 infection and the care of surgical patients, the number of which is expected to rise steadily in upcoming years.","Haller, Guy; Heim, Christoph; Meier, Kaspar; Clerici, Nicola; Combescure, Christophe; Ganter, Michael T; Schliessbach, Jürg; Kindler, Christoph; Eichenberger, Urs; Kern, Christian",Swiss med. wkly,71,16

Of these pathogens, 29 were viruses (15%), 38 were bacteria (20%), 8 were mixed (4%), and the rest were “unknown.” Influenza (n = 7), hMPV (n = 7), and RSV (n = 5) accounted for most viral infections; other infections included rhinovirus (n = 4), parainfluenza (n = 3), coronavirus (n = 4), and adenovirus (n = 2). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacterial infection (37%). Compared with bacterial infection, patients with viral infection were older (76 vs 64 years, respectively; p = 0.01), were more likely to have cardiac disease (66% vs 32%, respectively; p = 0.006), and were more frail (eg, 48% with limited ambulation vs 21% of bacterial infections; p = 0.02). There were few clinically meaningful differences in presentation and no differences in outcomes according to the presence or absence of viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Viral infections are common in adults with pneumonia. Easily transmissible viruses such as influenza, hMPV, and RSV were the most common, raising concerns about infection control. Routine testing for respiratory viruses may be warranted for adults who have been hospitalized with pneumonia.","Johnstone, Jennie; Majumdar, Sumit R.; Fox, Julie D.; Marrie, Thomas J.",Chest,71,22

By using insights from behavioral ethics, we argue that sometimes people engage in unethical behavior that increases the likelihood of foodborne illness outbreaks without necessarily intending to or being consciously aware of it. We demonstrate these insights in an analysis of the 2011 Listeriosis outbreak in the U.S. from the consumption of contaminated cantaloupes.

In a pilot study, we investigated donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) in plasma using a clinical-grade “next-generation sequencing” assay. METHODS. dd-cfDNA levels determined in biorepository venous plasma samples obtained during the lung allograft rejection gene expression observation study, implementing a clinical-grade next-generation sequencing assay. Sixty-nine unique LT patients encompassing 9 LT centers, with associated clinical-histopathologic diagnoses, were examined—allograft infection (n = 26), normal histopathology without infection (n = 30), and acute cellular rejection (ACR; n = 13). RESULTS. dd-cfDNA in ACR patients were significantly elevated (1.52%; interquartile range [IQR], 0.520-2.2550) compared with the normal stable patients (0.485%; IQR, 0.220-0.790) (P = 0.026). During allograft infection, dd-cfDNA values were not different (0.595; IQR, 0.270-1.170) from normal (P = 0.282) and ACR (P = 0.100). AUC-receiver operator characteristics curve analysis for allograft ACR was 0.717 (95% confidence interval, 0.547-0.887; P = 0.025). At a 0.87% threshold dd-cfDNA—sensitivity = 73.1%, specificity = 52.9%, positive predictive value = 34.1%, and negative predictive value = 85.5%. CONCLUSIONS. dd-cfDNA assessment holds promise as a noninvasive biomarker of “allograft injury” with acute rejection following LT while prospective, multicenter studies should further refine utility across the spectrum of allograft rejection and infection.","Sayah, David; Weigt, S.

BACKGROUND: COVID‐19 created an increased demand for isolation beds and nursing workforce globally. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of bed capacity, bed occupancy and nursing workforce data from the isolation units of a tertiary hospital in Singapore from 23 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. R v4.0.1 and Tidyverse 1.3.0 library were used for data cleaning and plotly 4.9.2.1 library for data visualization. RESULTS: In January to March 2020, isolation bed capacity was low (=<203 beds). A sharp increase in bed capacity was seen from 195 to 487 beds during 25 March to 29 April 2020, after which it plateaued. Bed occupancy remained lower than bed capacity throughout January to May 2020. After 16 April 2020, we experienced a shortage of 1.1 to 70.2 nurses in isolation wards. Due to low occupancy rates, nurse:patient ratio remained acceptable (minimum nurse:patient ratio = 0.26). CONCLUSION: COVID‐19 caused drastic changes in isolation bed capacity and nursing workforce requirements.

The role of other viral respiratory pathogens has not been studied in this population. YK Delta children <3 years of age hospitalized with respiratory infections and same aged community control children were prospectively enrolled between October 2005 and September 2007. Polymerase chain reaction detection of viruses was performed on nasopharyngeal samples. Characteristics of hospitalized and asymptomatic control children were analyzed. From October 2005 to September 2007, 440 hospitalized and 425 control children were analyzed. Respiratory viruses were detected in 90% (395) of hospitalized children: 194 (44%) rhinovirus, 131 (30%) adenovirus, 102 (23%) RSV, 77 (18%) para influenza viruses (PIV), 66 (15%) human metapneumovirus (hMPV), 23 (5%) influenza, and 25 (6%) coronavirus. Fifty‐two percent (221) of control children had a virus detected, most commonly rhinovirus (33%), and adenovirus (16%). RSV, PIV, hMPV, and influenza were significantly more common in hospitalized cases than control children, but rhinovirus, adenovirus, and coronavirus were not. RSV and hMPV were associated with higher severity of illness. In this study, RSV remains the most important virus associated with respiratory hospitalization, although hMPV and PIV were also common.

Proteolytic cleavage of TLR7 protein is required for its functional maturation in the endosomal compartment. Structural studies demonstrated that the N- and C-terminal domains of TLR7 are connected and involved in ligand binding after cleavage. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial drug, has been studied for its antiviral effects. HCQ increases pH in acidic organelles and has been reported to potently inhibit endosomal TLR activation. Whether HCQ can prevent endogenous TLR7 cleavage in primary immune cells, such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), had never been examined. Here, using a validated anti-TLR7 antibody suitable for biochemical detection of native TLR7 protein, we show that HCQ-treatment of fresh PBMCs, CAL-1 leukemic and primary human pDCs inhibits TLR7 cleavage and results in accumulation of full-length protein. As a consequence, we observe an inhibition of pDC activation in response to TLR7 stimulation with synthetic ligands and viruses including inactivated SARS-CoV2, which we show herein activates pDCs through TLR7-signaling. Together, our finding suggests that the major pathway by which HCQ inhibits ssRNA-sensing by pDCs may rely on its capacity to inhibit endosomal acidification and the functional maturation of TLR7 protein.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: HCP were surveyed in November–December 2020 about their intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: The survey measured the intent among HCP to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, timing of vaccination, and reasons for or against vaccination. Among patient-facing HCP, multivariate regression evaluated the associations between healthcare positions (medical doctor, nurse practitioner or physician assistant, and registered nurse) and vaccine hesitancy (intending to decline, delay, or were unsure about vaccination), adjusting for demographic characteristics, reasons why or why not to receive the vaccine, and prior receipt of routine vaccines. RESULTS: Among 5,929 HCP (2,253 medical doctors [MDs] and doctors of osteopathy [DOs], 582 nurse practitioners [NPs], 158 physician assistants [PAs], and 2,936 nurses), a higher proportion of nurses (47.3%) were COVID-vaccine hesitant compared with 30.0% of PAs and NPs and 13.1% of MDs and DOs. The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy included concerns about side effects, the newness of the vaccines, and lack of vaccine knowledge. Regardless of position, Black HCP were more hesitant than White HCP (odds ratio [OR], ∼5) and females were more hesitant than males (OR, ∼2). CONCLUSIONS: Although most clinical HCP intended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, intention varied by healthcare position. Consistent with other studies, hesitancy was also significantly associated with race or ethnicity across all positions. These results highlight the importance of understanding and effectively addressing reasons for hesitancy, especially among frontline HCP who are at increased risk of COVID exposure and play a critical role in recommending vaccines to patients.","Browne, Safa K.; Feemster, Kristen A.; Shen, Angela K.; Green-McKenzie, Judith; Momplaisir, Florence M.; Faig, Walter; Offit, Paul A.; Kuter, Barbara J.",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,71,1

Design and participants: A mixed methods study involving 26 qualitative interviews with users of telemedicine consultations from a national sample, complemented by a quantitative registry study of data from 10,400 users in a Swedish region. RESULTS: Users mainly described telemedicine consultations as a positive experience and perceived that the service met their current health care needs. Users also valued high accessibility, timesaving, and the contribution to ecological sustainability. Users felt competent about choosing when to use telemedicine consultations, most commonly for less severe health care concerns. This was confirmed by the quantitative results; only a few users had other care contacts within physical primary care before, or after, the telemedicine consultation, attended acute care or phoned 1177 Health Care Guidance. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a rare account of users’ experiences of telemedicine consultations. Users expressed satisfaction with this up-to-date use of health care resources for them as individuals, the health care system, and the environment. Telemedicine consultations were perceived as efficient and safe according to users. In addition, the study shows a low degree of further physical contacts in primary care or in acute care related to the telemedicine consultations.

We created web-based questionnaires with validated health instruments and conducted spatial analyses in a geographic information system (GIS). We collected data (n = 1184) on people’s patterns of nature exposure, associated health and wellbeing responses, and potential socioecological drivers such as relative deprivation, access to greenspaces, and land-cover greenness. The majority of responses came from England, UK (n = 993). We applied a range of statistical analyses including bootstrap-resampled correlations and binomial regression models, adjusting for several potential confounding factors. We found that respondents significantly changed their patterns of visiting nature as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. People spent more time in nature and visited nature more often during the pandemic. People generally visited nature for a health and wellbeing benefit and felt that nature helped them cope during the pandemic.

However, their roles in the disease have not been determined. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of WUPyV and KIPyV in the Chinese population suffering from ARTIs in Beijing, China, and to examine their possible role in causing disease. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates, nasal swabs and throat swabs were collected from 415 children and 297 immunocompetent adults with lower ARTIs (LARTIs). The specimens were screened by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of WUPyV, KIPyV, and other common respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: Although none of the adults sampled were positive for either virus, WUPyV in 10 (2.4%) children and KIPyV was detected in 2 (0.5%) of the children sampled, respectively. Eleven of the positive cases were co-detected with either rhinovirus (6/11), respiratory syncytial virus (4/11), parainfluenzavirus virus (3/11) or Mycoplasma pneumoniae (2/11). Phylogenetic analysis of the WUPyV and KIPyV isolates showed that the nucleotide sequences were homologous to those of previously reported strains. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of WUPyV and KIPyV in samples from children but not from immunocompetent adults suffering from LARTIs suggests that these viruses primarily infect the young population. Co-detection of additional respiratory pathogens in most of the specimens containing either WUPyV or KIPyV suggests that these viruses do not cause disease independently.","Ren, Lili; Gonzalez, Richard; Xie, Zhengde; Zhang, Jing; Liu, Chunyan; Li, Jianguo; Li, Yongjun; Wang, Zhong; Kong, Xiaohui; Yao, Yuan; Hu, Yinghui; Qian, Suyun; Geng, Rong; Yang, Yan; Vernet, Guy; Paranhos-Baccalà, Gláucia; Jin, Qi; Shen, Kunling; Wang, Jianwei",J Clin Virol,71,5

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among Hubei pediatric nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the potential factors associated with them. Materials and Methods: A self-designed online questionnaire survey, which consisted of the demographic and selected features, the occupational protection knowledge, attitudes, and practices of COVID-19, and the Chinese version of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, were used to assess the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress among Hubei pediatric nurses during COVID-19 pandemic. The logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the potential factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results: A total of 617 pediatric nurses were included in the survey. A considerable proportion of pediatric nurses reported symptoms of depression (95 [15.4%]), anxiety (201 [32.6%]), and stress (111 [18.0%]). Results of multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that the good occupational protection practices (for depression: OR = 0.455, 95%CI: 0.281 to 0.739; for anxiety: OR = 0.597, 95%CI: 0.419 to 0.851; for stress: OR = 0.269, 95%CI: 0.166 to 0.438) and the personal protective equipment (PPE) meeting work requirements (for depression: OR = 0.438, 95%CI: 0.246 to 0.778; for anxiety: OR = 0.581, 95%CI: 0.352 to 0.959; for stress: OR = 0.504, 95%CI: 0.283 to 0.898) were independent protective factors against depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Yet, working in an isolation ward or fever clinic was an independent risk factor associated with depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively (for depression: OR = 1.809, 95%CI: 1.103 to 2.966; for anxiety: OR = 1.864, 95%CI: 1.221 to 2.846; for stress: OR = 2.974, 95%CI: 1.866 to 4.741).

Prevention strategies focused on lifestyle modification help to reduce long-term complications. Self-management technology-based interventions can support behaviour change and diabetes control. The Baby Steps programme, a randomised controlled trial intervention offering group education and access to a mobile web application, was evaluated to explore user experience of the app and barriers and facilitators to app usability. METHODS: Ten semi-structured interviews and four focus group discussions were conducted with 23 trial participants between 2018 and 2019. Interviews and focus group discussions were audiotaped, transcribed and independently analysed. The analysis was informed by thematic analysis, with the use of the Nvivo 12 software. RESULTS: Themes identified were: (1) GDM and post-pregnancy support from healthcare services; (2) Impact of Baby Steps app on lifestyle changes; (3) Facilitators and barriers to the usability of the Baby Steps app. The Baby Steps app served as a motivator for increasing self-management activities and a tool for monitoring progress. Peer support and increased awareness of GDM and T2DM enhanced engagement with the app, while poor awareness of all the components of the app and low technical skills contributed to low usability. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents experiences from existing GDM support, user experiences from using the Baby Steps app, and the barriers and facilitators to app usability. The app was both a motivational and a monitoring tool for GDM self-management and T2DM prevention. Peer support was a key trait for enhanced engagement, while barriers were low technical skills and poor awareness of the app components. A digital app, such as the Baby Steps app, could strengthen existing face-to-face support for the prevention of T2DM. The results also have wider implications for digital support technologies for all self-management interventions. Further research on the effect of specific components of apps will be required to better understand the long term impact of apps and digital interventions on self-management behaviours and outcomes.

Delirium is frequent in SARS-COV2 patients and it is associated with increased mortality; however, no information is available on the association between delirium duration in SARS-COV2 patients and related outcomes. AIMS: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the duration of delirium symptoms and in-hospital mortality in older patients with SARS-COV2 infection. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients 65 years of age and older with SARS-CoV 2 infection admitted to two acute geriatric wards and one rehabilitation ward. Delirium symptoms duration was assessed retrospectively with a chart-based validated method. In-hospital mortality was ascertained via medical records. RESULTS: A total of 241 patients were included. The prevalence of delirium on admission was 16%. The median number of days with delirium symptoms was 4 (IQR 2–6.5) vs. 0 (IQR 0–2) in patients with and without delirium on admission. In the multivariable Cox regression model, each day with a delirium symptom in a patient with the same length of stay was associated with a 10% increase in in-hospital mortality (Hazard ratio 1.1, 95% Confidence interval 1.01–1.2; p = 0.03). Other variables associated with increased risk of in-hospital death were age, comorbidity, CPAP, CRP levels and total number of drugs on admission. CONCLUSIONS: The study supports the necessity to establish protocols for the monitoring and management of delirium during emergency conditions to allow an appropriate care for older patients.

Up to one-third of hospitalised patients develop severe pulmonary complications and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pulmonary outcomes following COVID-19 are unknown. METHODS: The Swiss COVID-19 lung study is a multicentre prospective cohort investigating pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19. We report on initial follow-up 4 months after mild/moderate or severe/critical COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization severity classification. RESULTS: 113 COVID-19 survivors were included (mild/moderate n=47, severe/critical n=66). We confirmed several comorbidities as risk factors for severe/critical disease. Severe/critical disease was associated with impaired pulmonary function, i.e. diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (D(LCO)) % predicted, reduced 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation. After adjustment for potential confounding by age, sex and body mass index (BMI), patients after severe/critical COVID-19 had a D(LCO) 20.9% pred (95% CI 12.4–29.4% pred, p=0.01) lower at follow-up. D(LCO) % pred was the strongest independent factor associated with previous severe/critical disease when age, sex, BMI, 6MWD and minimal peripheral oxygen saturation at exercise were included in the multivariable model (adjusted odds ratio per 10% predicted 0.59, 95% CI 0. 37–0.87; p=0.01). Mosaic hypoattenuation on chest computed tomography at follow-up was significantly associated with previous severe/critical COVID-19 including adjustment for age and sex (adjusted OR 11.7, 95% CI 1.7–239; p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: 4 months after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, severe/critical COVID-19 was associated with significant functional and radiological abnormalities, potentially due to small-airway and lung parenchymal disease.

Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is adopted as biopsy tool for confirmation of virus infection. However, its accuracy is as low as 60-70%, which is inefficient to uncover the infected. In comparison, the chest CT has been considered as the prior choice in diagnosis and monitoring progress of COVID-19 infection. Although the COVID-19 diagnostic systems based on artificial intelligence have been developed for assisting doctors in diagnosis, the small sample size and the excessive time consumption limit their applications. To this end, this paper proposed a diagnosis prototype system for COVID-19 infection testing. The proposed deep learning model is trained and is tested on 2267 CT sequences from 1357 patients clinically confirmed with COVID-19 and 1235 CT sequences from non-infected people. The main highlights of the prototype system are: (1) no data augmentation is needed to accurately discriminate the COVID-19 from normal controls with the specificity of 0.92 and sensitivity of 0.93; (2) the raw DICOM image is not necessary in testing. Highly compressed image like Jpeg can be used to allow a quick diagnosis; and (3) it discriminates the virus infection within 6 seconds and thus allows an online test with light cost. We also applied our model on 48 asymptomatic patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We found that: (1) the positive rate of RT-PCR assay is 63.5% (687/1082). (2) 45.8% (22/48) of the RT-PCR assay is negative for asymptomatic patients, yet the accuracy of CT scans is 95.8%. The online detection system is available: http://212.64.70.65/covid.

This study reports the enteric infections with porcine astrovirus type 4 (PAstV4), porcine group A rotavirus (GARV), porcine group C rotavirus (GCRV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine kobuvirus (PKoV) in 419 pigs, comprising both healthy and diarrheic animals, from 49 farms in five European countries (Austria, Germany, Hungary, Spain and Sweden). Real-time RT-PCR assays were developed to test fecal samples and to compare the prevalence and viral load in relation to health status, farms of origin and age groups. The results showed that PAstV4 (70.4%) was the dominant virus species, followed by PKoV (56.7%), PCV2 (42.2%), GCRV (3%) and GARV (0.9%). Diarrheic pigs had a higher viral load of PAstV4 in the nursery and growing-finishing groups. Rotaviruses were mainly detected in diarrheic pigs, whereas PCV2 was more often detected in clinically healthy than in diarrheic pigs, suggesting that most PCV2 infections were subclinical. PAstV4, PCV2 and PKoV were considered ubiquitous in the European pig livestock and co-infections among them were frequent, independently of the disease status, in contrast to a low prevalence of classical rotavirus infections.","Zhou, Weiguang; Ullman, Karin; Chowdry, Vinay; Reining, Márta; Benyeda, Zsófia; Baule, Claudia; Juremalm, Mikael; Wallgren, Per; Schwarz, Lukas; Zhou, Enmin; Pedrero, Sonia Pina; Hennig-Pauka, Isabel; Segales, Joaquim; Liu, Lihong",Vet Microbiol,71,24

The recent emergence of novel lineages carrying several mutations in the spike protein has raised additional public health concerns worldwide. The present study describes the temporal spreading and evolution of SARS-CoV2 in the beginning of the second pandemic wave in Brazil, highlighting the fast dissemination of the two major concerning variants (P.1 and P.2). A total of 2,507 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences (WGSs) with available information from country (Brazil) and sampling date (July 2020 to February 2021), were obtained and the frequencies of the lineages were evaluated in the period of the growing second pandemic wave. The results demonstrated the increasing prevalence of P.1 and P.2 lineages in the period evaluated. P.2 lineage was first detected in the middle of 2020, but a high increase occurred only in the last trimester of this same year and the spreading to all Brazilian regions. P.1 lineage emerged even later, first in the North region in December 2020 and really fast dissemination to all other Brazilian regions in January and February 2021. All SARS-CoV-2 WGSs of P.1 and P.2 were further separately evaluated with a Bayesian approach. The rates of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions were statistically higher in P.1 than P.2 (p<0.01). The phylodynamic analysis demonstrated that P.2 gradually spread in all the country from September 2020 to January 2021, while P.1 disseminated even faster from December 2020 to February 2021. Skyline plots of both lineages demonstrated a slight rise in the spreading for P.2 and exponential growth for P.1. In conclusion, these data demonstrated that the P.1 (recently renamed as Gamma) and P.2 lineages have predominated in the second pandemic wave due to the very high spreading across all geographic regions in Brazil at the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021.","Wolf, Jonas Michel; Kipper, Diéssy; Borges, Gabriela Ribeiro; Streck, André Felipe; Lunge, Vagner Ricardo",Journal of medical virology,71,16

While studies report that approximately 5–15% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation, a substantially higher number need non-invasive ventilation and are subject to prolonged hospitalizations, with long periods of immobility and isolation. The purpose of this study is to describe the post-infectious sequelae of severe viral illness and the post-acute complications of intensive care treatments in critically ill patients who have recovered from severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of adult patients initially hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection, who recovered and were transferred to a general medical ward or discharged home between March 15, 2020 and May 15, 2020, dates inclusive, after an intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) admission in a designated COVID-19 hospital in the United Arab Emirates. Demographic data, underlying comorbidities, treatment, complications, and outcomes were collected. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 71 patients transferred out of ICU (n = 38, 54%) and HDU (n = 33, 46%), mean age was 48 years (SD, 9.95); 96% men; 54% under age 50. Mean ICU stay was 12.4 days (SD, 5.29), HDU stay was 13.4 days (SD, 4.53). Pre-existing conditions were not significantly associated with developing post-acute complications (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41, 2.93, p = 1.00). Fifty nine percent of patients had complications; myopathy, swallowing impairments, and pressure ulcers were most common. Delirium and confusion were diagnosed in 18% (n = 13); all were admitted to the ICU and required mechanical ventilation. Of note, of all patients studied, 59.2% (n = 42/71) had at least 1 complication, 32.4% (n = 23) had at least 2 complications, and 19.7% (n = 14) suffered 3 or more sequelae. Complications were significantly more common in ICU patients (n = 33/38, 87%), compared to HDU patients (n = 9/33, 27%) (OR 17.6, 95% CI 5.23, 59.21, p <0.05).

To avoid early information bias, we used detailed age and gender stratified death certificate and hospitalisation data to evaluate the epidemic's trajectory and infer the cause of its decline using a stochastic model. Our results are consistent with heterogenous transmission reducing over time due to the development of herd immunity. Relative to a baseline model that assumed homogenous mixing across Manaus, a model that permitted a small, self-isolated population fraction raised the estimated herd-immunity threshold from 28% to 30% and reduced the final attack rate from 86% to 65%. In the latter scenario, a substantial proportion of vulnerable, older individuals remained susceptible to infection. Given uncertainties regarding the distancing behaviours of population subgroups with different social and economic characteristics, and the duration of sterilising or transmission-modifying immunity in exposed individuals, we conclude that the potential for epidemic outbreaks remains, but that future waves of infection are likely to be much less pronounced than that already experienced.","Prowse, T.; Purcell, T.; Clarys Baia-da-Silva, D.; Sampaio, V.; Marcelo Monteiro, W.; Wood, J.; Mueller, I.; McVernon, J.; Lacerda, M.; Ross, J.",,71,15

Methods: Women born between 1986 and 1992 vaccinated at 15–25 years of age (at least one dose of 4-valent HPV vaccine) and screened at 24–27 years of age were included. Frequency of opportunistic vaccination, overall and by birth cohort, was calculated; screening outcomes were compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Results: Overall, 4718 (4.9%) HPV-vaccinated, and 91,512 unvaccinated, women were studied. The frequency of vaccination increased by birth cohort, ranging between 1.8% and 9.8%; age at vaccination decreased progressively by birth cohort (p < 0.0001). Participation in screening was 60.8% among vaccinated, and 56.6% among unvaccinated, women (p < 0.0001).

Despite this, many aspects of hydroxyurea are either unknown or understudied; specifically, its usefulness in β-thalassaemia major and haemoglobin E β-thalassaemia is unclear. However, during COVID-19 pandemic, it has become a valuable adjunct to transfusion therapy in patients with β-haemoglobinopathies. In this review, we aim to explore the available in vitro and in vivo mechanistic data and the clinical utility of hydroxyurea in β-haemoglobinopathies with a special emphasis on its usefulness during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN BODY: Hydroxyurea is an S-phase-specific drug that reversibly inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme which catalyses an essential step in the DNA biosynthesis. In human erythroid cells, it induces the expression of γ-globin, a fetal globin gene that is suppressed after birth. Through several molecular pathways described in this review, hydroxyurea exerts many favourable effects on the haemoglobin content, red blood cell indices, ineffective erythropoiesis, and blood rheology in patients with β-haemoglobinopathies. Currently, it is recommended for sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia. A number of clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate its usefulness in transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was widely used as an adjunct to transfusion therapy due to limitations in the availability of blood and logistical disturbances. Thus, it has become clear that hydroxyurea could play a remarkable role in reducing transfusion requirements of patients with haemoglobinopathies, especially when donor blood is a limited resource. CONCLUSION: Hydroxyurea is a well-tolerated oral drug which has been in use for many decades. Through its actions of reversible inhibition of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme and fetal haemoglobin induction, it exerts many favourable effects on patients with β-haemoglobinopathies. It is currently approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia. Also, there are various observations to suggest that hydroxyurea is an important adjunct in the treatment of transfusion dependent β-thalassaemia which should be confirmed by randomised clinical trials.","Yasara, Nirmani; Premawardhena, Anuja; Mettananda, Sachith",Orphanet J Rare Dis,71,1

Relationships between nurses' attitudes towards bereavement support, need for bereavement training and hospital policy are explored. Research method: 110 nurses recruited from the OAG unit of a large Hong Kong public hospital completed a structured questionnaire. Outcome measures: Attitudes towards perinatal bereavement support; required support and training needs for nurses on bereavement care. Results: Two-step cluster analysis yielded two clusters. Cluster A consisted of 55.5% (n=61) and cluster B consisted of 44.5% (n=49) of nurses. Cluster A nurses were younger, had less OAG experience, more junior ranking and less education than cluster B nurses. Cluster B nurses had additional midwifery and bereavement care training, personal grieving experiences and experience handling grieving clients. The majority held positive bereavement care attitudes. Significant differences towards perinatal bereavement support were found. Only 25.5% (n=28) had bereavement related training. Attitudes towards bereavement care were positively correlated with training needs (r(s)=0.59) and hospital policy support (r(s)=0.60). Conclusion: Hong Kong nurses emphasized need for increased bereavement care knowledge and experience, improved communication skills, and greater hospital and team members' support. Findings may be used to improve support of nurses, to ensure sensitive bereavement care in perinatal settings, and to enhance nursing curricula.","Chan, Moon Fai; Chan, Suk Hing; Day, Mary Christine",Nurse Educ Today,71,3

The serology characteristics and complement diagnosis value of the antibody test to RNA test need to be demonstrated. METHOD: Serial sera of 80 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, China. Total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected, and the antibody dynamics during the infection were described. RESULTS: The seroconversion rates for Ab, IgM and IgG were 98.8%, 93.8% and 93.8%, respectively. The first detectible serology marker was Ab, followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20 days post exposure (d.p.e) or 9, 10 and 12 days post onset (d.p.o), respectively. The antibody levels increased rapidly beginning at 6 d.p.o. and were accompanied by a decline in viral load. For patients in the early stage of illness (0–7 d.p.o), Ab showed the highest sensitivity (64.1%) compared to IgM and IgG (33.3% for both, p<0.001). The sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG increased to 100%, 96.7% and 93.3% 2 weeks later, respectively. When the same antibody type was detected, no significant difference was observed between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and other forms of immunoassays. CONCLUSIONS: A typical acute antibody response is induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serology testing provides an important complement to RNA testing in the later stages of illness for pathogenic specific diagnosis and helpful information to evaluate the adapted immunity status of patients.","Lou, Bin; Li, Ting-Dong; Zheng, Shu-Fa; Su, Ying-Ying; Li, Zhi-Yong; Liu, Wei; Yu, Fei; Ge, Sheng-Xiang; Zou, Qian-Da; Yuan, Quan; Lin, Sha; Hong, Cong-Ming; Yao, Xiang-Yang; Zhang, Xue-Jie; Wu, Ding-Hui; Zhou, Guo-Liang; Hou, Wang-Heng; Li, Ting-Ting; Zhang, Ya-Li; Zhang, Shi-Yin; Fan, Jian; Zhang, Jun; Xia, Ning-Shao; Chen, Yu",Eur Respir J,71,1

However, the detailed molecular mechanism of the membrane fusion mediated by the spike (S) protein of HCoV-229E remains elusive. Here, we report, for the first time, a rationally designed fusion core of HCoV-229E (HR1-SGGRGG-HR2), which was in vitro produced in GST prokaryotic expression system. Multiple lines of experimental data including gel-filtration, chemical cross-linking, and circular diagram (CD) demonstrated that the HCoV-229E fusion core possesses the typical properties of the trimer of coiled-coil heterodimer (six α-helix bundle). 3D structure modeling presents its most-likely structure, similar to those of coronaviruses that have been well-documented. Collectively, HCoV-229E S protein belongs to the type I fusion protein, which is characterized by the existence of two heptad-repeat regions (HR1 and HR2), furthermore, the available knowledge concerning HCoV-229E fusion core may make it possible to design small molecule or polypeptide drugs targeting the membrane fusion, a crucial step of HCoV-229E infection.","Liu, Cheng; Feng, Youjun; Gao, Feng; Zhang, Qiangmin; Wang, Ming",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,71,21

In this study, we sought to leverage this uneven viral antagonism to identify critical host factors that govern disease outcome. Utilizing a systems-based approach, we examined differential regulation of IFN-γ–dependent genes following infection with robust respiratory viruses including influenza viruses [A/influenza/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1-VN1203) and A/influenza/California/04/2009 (H1N1-CA04)] and coronaviruses [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV)]. Categorizing by function, we observed down-regulation of gene expression associated with antigen presentation following both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Further examination revealed global down-regulation of antigen-presentation gene expression, which was confirmed by proteomics for both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Importantly, epigenetic analysis suggested that DNA methylation, rather than histone modification, plays a crucial role in MERS-CoV–mediated antagonism of antigen-presentation gene expression; in contrast, H5N1-VN1203 likely utilizes a combination of epigenetic mechanisms to target antigen presentation. Together, the results indicate a common mechanism utilized by H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV to modulate antigen presentation and the host adaptive immune response.","Menachery, Vineet D.; Schäfer, Alexandra; Burnum-Johnson, Kristin E.; Mitchell, Hugh D.; Eisfeld, Amie J.; Walters, Kevin B.; Nicora, Carrie D.; Purvine, Samuel O.; Casey, Cameron P.; Monroe, Matthew E.; Weitz, Karl K.; Stratton, Kelly G.; Webb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo M.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Metz, Thomas O.; Smith, Richard D.; Waters, Katrina M.; Sims, Amy C.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Baric, Ralph S.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,71,16

From January 23, 2020, the number of affected individuals from this virus rapidly increased in Wuhan and other countries. This research proposes a system for classifying and analyzing the predictions obtained from symptoms of this virus. The proposed system aims to determine those attributes that help in the early detection of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) using the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). This work computes the accuracy of different machine learning classifiers and selects the best classifier for COVID-19 detection based on comparative analysis. ANFIS is used to model and control ill-defined and uncertain systems to predict this globally spread disease’s risk factor. COVID-19 dataset is classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) because it achieved the highest accuracy of 100% among all classifiers. Furthermore, the ANFIS model is implemented on this classified dataset, which results in an 80% risk prediction for COVID-19.","Iwendi, Celestine; Mahboob, Kainaat; Khalid, Zarnab; Javed, Abdul Rehman; Rizwan, Muhammad; Ghosh, Uttam",Multimed Syst,71,11

AM can be conceptualized as a disorder of motivation wherein patients exhibit a loss of speech and spontaneous movement, owing to disruption of underlying frontal-subcortical circuits. OBJECTIVES: Review the concept and differential diagnosis of AM, as well as the clinical literature on AM in COVID-19. Discuss potential implications for underlying functional neuroanatomy and mechanistic pathways, as well as clinical management. METHODS: A narrative literature review was performed using PubMed querying published articles for topics associated with AM and its occurrence in COVID-19. RESULTS: AM has been described in case reports and a prospective cohort study of COVID patients with neurological complaints. Three COVID-19 AM subgroups can be distinguished, including individuals with severe respiratory illness, those with meningoencephalitis, and those with delirium and pre-existing neuropsychiatric illness. Electrophysiology and functional imaging suggest COVID-19 AM may result from underlying frontal lobe dysfunction and disruption of associated distributed circuits subserving goal-directed behavior. Distinctive combinations of pathophysiological mechanisms may be at play in the different subgroups of COVID-19 AM cases. CONCLUSION: AM has been described in association with COVID-19 and may manifest in clinically heterogenous subgroups with distinct underlying mechanisms. The diagnosis of AM and evaluation of potential etiologies can be complex. The occurrence of AM contributes evidence to the hypothesis of frontal lobe dysfunction in COVID-19.","Fusunyan, Mark; Praschan, Nathan; Beach, Scott; Fricchione, Gregory",J Acad Consult Liaison Psychiatry,71,20

However, the extent to which these phenotypes share genetic architecture is unclear. This question is of great relevance to determining key risk factors for suicide, and to alleviate the societal burden of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). To help address the question of heterogeneity, consortia efforts have recently shifted from a focus on suicide within the context of major psychopathology (e.g. major depressive disorder, schizophrenia) to suicide as an independent entity. Recent molecular studies of suicide risk by members of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and the International Suicide Genetics Consortium have identified genome-wide significant loci associated with SA and with suicide death, and have examined these phenotypes within and outside of the context of major psychopathology. This review summarizes important insights from epidemiological and biometrical research on suicide, and discusses key empirical findings from molecular genetic examinations of STBs. Polygenic risk scores for these phenotypes have been observed to be associated with case−control status and other risk phenotypes. In addition, estimated shared genetic covariance with other phenotypes suggests specific medical and psychiatric risks beyond major depressive disorder. Broadly, molecular studies suggest a complexity of suicide etiology that cannot simply be accounted for by depression. Discussion of the state of suicide genetics, a growing field, also includes important ethical and clinical implications of studying the genetic risk of suicide.","DiBlasi, Emily; Kang, Jooeun; Docherty, Anna R.",Psychological medicine,71,1

The first factor contained politically conservative sources (PCS) of information. The second factor included eight news sources representing mainstream sources (MS). Multivariable logistic regression models were used. Trust in Dr. Fauci was also examined. High trust in MS was associated with intention to encourage family members to get COVID-19 vaccines, altruistic beliefs that more vulnerable people should have vaccine priority, and belief that racial minorities with higher rates of COVID-19 deaths should have priority. High trust in PCS was associated with intention to discourage friends from getting vaccinated. Higher trust in PCS was also associated with participants more likely to disagree that minorities with higher rates of COVID-19 deaths should have priority for a vaccine.

These challenges are due to the high genomic variation and immunomodulatory mechanisms inherent to these diseases. Passive transfer of broadly neutralizing antibodies may offer partial protection, but these treatments require repeated dosing. Some recombinant viral vectors, such as those based on lentiviruses and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), can confer long-term transgene expression in the host after a single dose. Particularly, recombinant (r)AAVs have emerged as favorable vectors, given their high in vivo transduction efficiency, proven clinical efficacy, and low immunogenicity profiles. Hence, rAAVs are being explored to deliver recombinant antibodies to confer immunity against infections or to diminish the severity of disease. When used as a vaccination vector for the delivery of antigens, rAAVs enable de novo synthesis of foreign proteins with the conformation and topology that resemble those of natural pathogens. However, technical hurdles like pre-existing immunity to the rAAV capsid and production of anti-drug antibodies can reduce the efficacy of rAAV-vectored immunotherapies. This review summarizes rAAV-based prophylactic and therapeutic strategies developed against infectious diseases that are currently being tested in pre-clinical and clinical studies.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the Taiwan National Health Insurance research database. A total of 1141 ACO patients aged ≥65 years during 2005–2011 were observed and followed for 2 years. The Bice and Boxerman COC index (COCI) was used to evaluate COC by considering ambulatory care visits duo to COPD or asthma in the first year; ED visits and hospitalization for COPD or asthma were identified in the subsequent year, respectively. The COCI was divided into three levels (COCI < 0.3= low, 0.3 ≤ COCI<1=medium, COCI = 1=high). The Cox model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for ED visits and hospital admissions due to COPD or asthma. RESULTS: The average COCI was 0.55. 21.3% patients received outpatient care from a single physician.

Presently, the virus infection is diagnosed primarily by a process called the real-time Reverse Transcriptase–Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) based on its genetic prints. This whole procedure takes a substantial amount of time to identify and diagnose the patients infected by the virus. The proposed research uses a wavelet-based convolution neural network architectures to detect SARS-nCoV. CNN is pre-trained on the ImageNet and trained end-to-end using thoracic X-ray images. To execute Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT), the available mother wavelet functions from different families, namely Haar, Daubechies, Symlet, Biorthogonal, Coiflet, and Discrete Meyer, were considered. Two-level decomposition via DWT is adopted to extract prominent features peripheral and subpleural ground-glass opacities, often in the lower lobes explicitly from thoracic X-ray images to suppress noise effect, further enhancing the signal to noise ratio. The proposed wavelet-based deep learning models of both, two-class instances (COVID vs. Normal) and four-class instances (COVID-19 vs. PNA bacterial vs. PNA viral vs. Normal) were validated from publicly available databases using k-Fold Cross Validation (k-Fold CV) technique. In addition to these X-ray images, images of recent COVID-19 patients were further used to examine the model’s practicality and real-time feasibility in combating the current pandemic situation. It was observed that the Symlet 7 approximation component with two-level manifested the highest test accuracy of 98.87%, followed by Biorthogonal 2.6 with an efficiency of 98.73%. While the test accuracy for Symlet 7 and Biorthogonal 2.6 is high, Haar and Daubechies with two levels have demonstrated excellent validation accuracy on unseen data. It was also observed that the precision, the recall rate, and the dice similarity coefficient for four-class instances were 98%, 98%, and 99%, respectively, using the proposed algorithm.","Verma, Amar Kumar; Vamsi, Inturi; Saurabh, Prerna; Sudha, Radhika; G.R., Sabareesh; S., Rajkumar",Expert Syst Appl,71,1

There are reports of the role of asymptomatic individuals in the transmission of MERS-CoV, however, the exact role is not known. METHOD: The MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases were searched for relevant papers published till August 2018 describing asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection. RESULTS: A total of 10 papers were retrieved and included in the final analysis and review. The extent of asymptomatic MERS infection had increased with change in the policy of testing asymptomatic contacts. In early cases in April 2012–October 2013, 12.5% were asymptomatic among 144 PCR laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases while in 2014 the proportion rose to 25.1% among 255 confirmed cases. The proportion of asymptomatic cases reported among pediatric confirmed MERS-CoV cases were higher (41.9%–81.8%). Overall, the detection rate of MERS infection among asymptomatic contacts was 1-3.9% in studies included in this review. Asymptomatic individuals were less likely to have underlying condition compared to fatal cases. Of particular interest is that most of the identified pediatric cases were asymptomatic with no clear explanation.

This provided an unprecedented opportunity to study how crowds may influence penalties awarded by referees in an ecological context. Using data from playoff games played during the COVID-19 pandemic and the previous 5 years (n = 547), we estimate the number of penalties called by referees depending on whether or not spectators were present. The results show an interaction between a team’s status (home; away) and the presence or absence of crowds. Post-hoc analyses reveal that referees awarded significantly more penalties to the away team compared to the home team when there is a crowd present. However, when there are no spectators, the number of penalties awarded to the away and home teams are not significantly different. In order to generalize these results, we took advantage of the extension of the pandemic and the unusual game setting it provided to observe the behavior of referees during the 2020–2021 regular season. Again, using data from the National Hockey League (n = 1639), but also expanding our sample to include Canadian Hockey League games (n = 1709), we also find that the advantage given to the home team by referees when in front of a crowd fades in the absence of spectators.

To our knowledge, the present study is one of the first studies to address cyberbullying among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional objectives were to reveal the causes and types of cyberbullying that university students from East and Southeast Asia have experienced because of COVID-19, and to explore the relationship between cyberbullying and self-esteem. Of the 525 university students from different East and Southeast Asian countries and varied academic backgrounds who were invited to participate in the study, 310 students agreed and were included. Moreover, a sample of 400 Jordanian undergraduate students, who participated in cyberbullying against East and Southeast Asian students on social media, answered a questionnaire to reveal their reasons for engaging in bullying during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also examined the relationship and differences between sex and nationality. The findings revealed that cyberbullying contributed to low self-esteem in students of East and Southeast Asian descent who were victims of bullying. Men were more likely to be bullies and cyberbullies than women. The bullies admitted that the main reason for cyberbullying was humor, and that they were unaware that their harsh or aggressive behaviors could be categorized as bullying. This study aimed to make a positive contribution to the scant literature on cyberbullying/cyber racism among university students in an Arab country. We believe our findings can help guide the formulation of policies and solutions that address cyberbullying, especially between resident and foreign students.","Alsawalqa, Rula Odeh",Heliyon,71,24

This process means that should the person loose capacity in the future, care can be provided, consistent with their personal values and beliefs. The ACP process is particularly relevant for older people living with frailty (frail elders) as they are vulnerable to sudden deterioration. However, ACP is rarely undertaken by frail elders. The aim of this study was to develop an intervention to increase multidisciplinary health and social care professionals’ (H&SCPs) engagement of cognitively able, domestic-dwelling frail elders with ACP. METHODS: Intervention development was guided by the Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions and the Behaviour Change Wheel. Multiple methods were used to understand ACP barriers and enablers: a systematic integrative review, a survey (n = 73 H&SCPs), and semi-structured interviews (n = 10 frail elders, n = 8 family members). A conceptual model, developed from the integrative review, underpinned data collection for the survey and interviews. Synthesis of this data, including patient and public involvement, was then used to identify H&SCPs behaviours that needed to change for ACP to be implemented and decide content and implementation for the intervention. RESULTS: Following the Behaviour Change Wheel system, and based on the findings of the review, survey and interviews, the prototype intervention, Conversations on Living and Dying (CLaD), was developed. The CLaD prototype consisted of one 3.5-hour educational skills session for H&SCPs supported by a toolkit. Content focussed on the relevance of ACP for frail elders, experience of ACP by frail elders, and strategies H&SCPs could adopt to encourage frail elders’ engagement with ACP. Strategies include recognising the importance of relationships and living well now, preparing frail elders for ACP conversations and starting ACP early. Participants who took part in initial prototype refinement reported that the intervention helped them think differently about ACP and encouraged them to engage with frail elders. CONCLUSIONS: The use of behavioural theory enabled the development of CLaD, an evidence-based, theory-driven, person-centred intervention to support ACP engagement with frail elders. While feasibility testing is required, initial prototype refinement demonstrated that H&SCPs found the intervention to be acceptable, engaging, and clinically valuable in their practice with frail elders and their families.

Within the past years, a great number of disease-modifying treatments have emerged; however, efficacious treatments and a cure for MS await discovery. Thymosins, soluble hormone-like peptides produced by the thymus gland, can mediate immune and non-immune physiological processes and have gained interest in recent years as therapeutics in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Methods: Pubmed was searched with no time constraints for articles using a combination of the keywords “thymosin/s” or “thymus factor/s” AND “multiple sclerosis”, mesh terms with no language restriction. Results: Here, we review the state-of-the-art on the effects of thymosins on MS and its experimental models. In particular, we describe what is known in this field on the roles of thymosin-α1 (Tα1) and -β4 (Tβ4) as potential anti-inflammatory as well as neuroprotective and remyelinating molecules and their mechanisms of action. Conclusion: Based on the data that Tα1 and Tβ4 act as anti-inflammatory molecules and as inducers of myelin repair and neuronal protection, respectively, a possible therapeutic application in MS for Tα1 and Tβ4 alone or combined with other approved drugs may be envisaged. This approach is reasonable in light of the current clinical usage of Tα1 and data demonstrating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Tβ4 in clinical practice.","Severa, Martina; Zhang, Jing; Giacomini, Elena; Rizzo, Fabiana; Etna, Marilena Paola; Cruciani, Melania; Garaci, Enrico; Chopp, Michael; Coccia, Eliana Marina",Mult Scler Relat Disord,71,16

This emergency situation may be cause of psychological distress in the general population. Therefore, the Italian Twins Registry has decided to carry out an epidemiological study to investigate the social and mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic on Italian adults. METHODS: The study has a longitudinal design and is aimed at twins of all ages residing in Italy. An online questionnaire was administered to collect information on socio-economic and health status of the participants, as well as of the households during the lockdown, and on the impact of the pandemic on participants' lives. Levels and prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression were measured using validated instruments, such as the STAI-6, IES-R and PHQ-9. This article shows the results of the first wave of the survey (June 2020). RESULTS: A total of 2589 twins participated in the study, with a mean age of 45 years (range 18-93 years). Covid-19's prevalence among respondents was less than 1% and about 13% of the subjects reported that, at least, one of the household's members had symptoms of covid-19. Sixty percent of the participants changed the place and way of working and a third of the sample had to completely suspend their work. About half of the sample showed symptoms of an anxiety disorder and about 10% of the subjects had symptoms of a probable post-traumatic stress or depressive disorder. Higher mean scores on the three assessment instruments were observed among women, subjects with a low level of education and those residing in the Southern of Italy. Anxiety symptoms decreased with age. CONCLUSION: The study shows that the pandemic has had important repercussions on the socio-economic condition and mental health of the Italian population and suggests that some individuals are more vulnerable than others.","Medda, Emanuela; Gigantesco, Antonella; Picardi, Angelo; Carluccio, Enrica; D039,; Ippolito, Cristina; Ferri, Maurizio; Brescianini, Sonia; Toccaceli, Virgilia; Stazi, Maria Antonietta",Riv Psichiatr,71,1

Cytology, histology, and HPV DNA genotyping results on paired FVU and cervical samples were available. Urinary median methylation levels from HR-HPV (n = 93) positive women were found to increase for all markers with severity of underlying disease.

After the outbreak of SARS CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in 2019, the disease turned into a pandemic very rapidly. Mental health is a key issue associated with such outbreaks. To explore the fatigue level among physicians working in designated public and private hospitals in Bangladesh, we conducted a matched case-control study of post-SARS-CoV-2 fatigue. Method: In this study 105 physicians who were diagnosed as COVID-19 infected, got treatment, and declared cured at least 6 weeks before the interview date, were recruited as cases and the same number of age and designation matched healthy physicians as control who are working in the same hospital. Case and control were selected in 1:1 ratio from each of the hospitals. The study population was selected by inclusion and exclusion criteria after taking informed written consent. Data collection was done by a semi-structured questionnaire. Diagnosis of COVID--19 infection was done by detection of SARS CoV-2 antigen by RT-PCR from reference laboratories in Bangladesh or by HRCT Chest. Result: Around two-thirds of the physicians were male (67.6% versus 32.4%). Most of them aged less than forty years (80.5%). The cases had a greater number of comorbid conditions than those who were negative. The FSS score (mean) was much higher for cases (36.7 with standard deviation of 5.3 versus 19.3 standard deviation of 3.8) than the control group with a statistically significant difference with no significant gender differentiation. Similarly, around 67.7% of the previously COVID positive physicians represented in the highest FSS score tertile compared to the respondents in the control group had a mean score of less than 3. The difference was also highly significant. Conclusion: Physicians, who had a previous history of COVID-19 infection had a higher total and mean FSS score, signifying a more severe level of fatigue than the physicians who had never been COVID-19 positive while working in the same hospital irrespective of their age and sex.","Hasan, A.

This is well exemplified by several recent epidemics such as those of Nipah, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian flu, Ebola, Monkeypox, and Hantaviruses. After the initial interspecies transmission per se, the viruses can disseminate into the human population through various and distinct mechanisms. Some of them are well characterized and understood, thus allowing a certain level of risk control and prevention. Surprisingly and in contrast, the initial steps that lead to the emergence of several viruses, and of their associated diseases, remain still poorly understood. Epidemiological field studies conducted in certain specific high-risk populations are thus necessary to obtain new insights into the early events of this emergence process. Human infections by simian viruses represent increasing public health concerns. Indeed, by virtue of their genetic and physiological similarities, non-human primates (NHPs) are considered to be likely the sources of viruses that can infect humans and thus may pose a significant threat to human population. This is well illustrated by retroviruses, which have the ability to cross species, adapt to a new host and sometimes spread within these new species. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies have thus clearly showed that the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 in humans have resulted from several independent interspecies transmissions of different SIV types from Chimpanzees and African monkeys (including sooty mangabeys), respectively, probably during the first part of the last century. The situation for Human T cell Lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is, for certain aspects, quite comparable. Indeed, the origin of most HTLV-1 subtypes appears to be linked to interspecies transmission between STLV-1-infected monkeys and humans, followed by variable periods of evolution in the human host. In this review, after an introduction on emerging viruses, we will briefly present the results of a large epidemiological study performed in groups of Bantus and Pygmies living in villages and settlements located in the rain forest of the South region of Cameroon. These populations are living nearby the habitats of several monkeys and apes, often naturally infected by different retroviruses including SIV, STLV and simian foamy virus. Most of the persons included in this study were hunters of such NHPs, thus at high risk of contact with infected body fluids (blood, saliva,...) during hunting activities. After reviewing the current available data on the discovery, cross-species transmission from monkeys and apes to humans of the simian foamy retroviruses, we will report the results of our study. Such infection is a unique natural model to study the different mechanisms of restriction of retroviral emergence in Humans.","Gessain, Antoine",Bulletin de l'Académie Nationale de Médecine,71,16

In the gammaretroviruses, typified by Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV), gag and pol are in the same reading frame, separated by a UAG stop codon, and termination codon readthrough is required for expression of the viral Gag-Pol fusion protein. Here, we investigated the effect on MuLV replication of modulating readthrough efficiency. We began by manipulating the readthrough signal in the context of an infectious viral clone to generate a series of MuLV variants in which readthrough was stimulated or reduced. In carefully controlled infectivity assays, it was found that reducing the MuLV readthrough efficiency only 4-fold led to a marked defect and that a 10-fold reduction essentially abolished replication. However, up to an ∼8.5-fold stimulation of readthrough (up to 60% readthrough) was well tolerated by the virus. These high levels of readthrough were achieved using a two-plasmid system, with Gag and Gag-Pol expressed from separate infectious clones. We also modulated readthrough by silencing expression of eukaryotic release factors 1 and 3 (eRF1 and eRF3) or by introducing aminoglycosides into the cells. The data obtained indicate that gammaretroviruses tolerate a substantial excess of viral Gag-Pol synthesis but are very sensitive to a reduction in levels of this polyprotein. Thus, as is also the case for ribosomal frameshifting, antiviral therapies targeting readthrough with inhibitory agents are likely to be the most beneficial. IMPORTANCE Many pathogenic RNA viruses and retroviruses use ribosomal frameshifting or stop codon readthrough to regulate expression of their replicase enzymes. These translational “recoding” processes are potential targets for antiviral intervention, but we have only a limited understanding of the consequences to virus replication of modulating the efficiency of recoding, particularly for those viruses employing readthrough. In this paper, we describe the first systematic analysis of the effect of increasing or decreasing readthrough efficiency on virus replication using the gammaretrovirus MuLV as a model system. We find unexpectedly that MuLV replication is only slightly inhibited by substantial increases in readthrough frequency, but as with other viruses that use recoding strategies, replication is quite sensitive to even modest reductions. These studies provide insights into both the readthrough process and MuLV replication and have implications for the selection of antivirals against gammaretroviruses.","Csibra, Eszter; Brierley, Ian; Irigoyen, Nerea",J Virol,71,24

A prospective study was conducted among 201 patients with COVID-19 in the Pakistan Military Hospital from April 1 to August 31, 2020, including non-critical cases and critical cases. COVID-19 patients were stratified as critical and non-critical according to the signs and symptoms severity; with those requiring intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation as critical, and those did not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation as non-critical. A total of 201 COVID-19 patients with critical and non-critical categories presented with myocardial injury. All patients with myocardial injury had an elevation in CKMB and Troponin-I levels. Of these patients, 43.7% presented with new electrocardiography (ECG) changes, and ST depression was typically observed in 36.3% patients. In addition, 18.7% patients presented with abnormal echocardiography findings, with right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction commonly seen among critical group patients. Results analyzed by a logistic regression model showing COVID-19 direct contribution to myocardial injury in these patients.

There are several challenges when defining estimands. Here, we discuss a number of these in the context of trials of treatments for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and make suggestions for how estimands should be defined for key outcomes. We suggest that treatment effects should usually be measured as differences in proportions (or risk or odds ratios) for outcomes such as death and requirement for ventilation, and differences in means for outcomes such as the number of days ventilated. We further recommend that truncation due to death should be handled differently depending on whether a patient- or resource-focused perspective is taken; for the former, a composite approach should be used, while for the latter, a while-alive approach is preferred. Finally, we suggest that discontinuation of randomised treatment should be handled from a treatment policy perspective, where non-adherence is ignored in the analysis (i.e. intention to treat).","Kahan, Brennan C.; Morris, Tim P.; White, Ian R.; Tweed, Conor D.; Cro, Suzie; Dahly, Darren; Pham, Tra My; Esmail, Hanif; Babiker, Abdel; Carpenter, James R.",BMC Med,71,20

Regional blocks are being increasingly utilized in gynecologic surgery to improve postoperative pain and decrease opioid usage, yet preoperative pudendal blocks have not been used routinely during posterior colporrhaphy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effect of preoperative regional pudendal nerve block using a combination of 1.3% liposomal and 0.25% plain bupivacaine vs 0.25% plain bupivacaine alone on vaginal pain after posterior colporrhaphy on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. We hypothesized that there would be a reduction in vaginal pain scores for the study group vs the control group over the first 72 hours. STUDY DESIGN: This was a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial that included patients undergoing a posterior colporrhaphy, either independently or in conjunction with other vaginal or abdominal reconstructive procedures. Patients were block randomized to receive 20 mL of either a combination of 1.3% liposomal and 0.25% plain bupivacaine (study) or 20 mL of 0.25% plain bupivacaine (control) in a regional pudendal block before the start of surgery. Double blinding was achieved by covering four 5-mL syringes containing the randomized local anesthetic. After induction of anesthesia, a pudendal nerve block was performed per standard technique (5 mL superiorly and 5 mL inferiorly each ischial spine) using a pudendal kit. The primary outcome was to evaluate postoperative vaginal pain using a visual analog scale on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. Secondary outcomes included total analgesic medication usage through postoperative day 3, postoperative voiding and defecatory dysfunction, and impact of vaginal pain on quality of life factors. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were enrolled (60 in each group). There were no significant differences in demographic data, including baseline vaginal pain (P=.88). Postoperative vaginal pain scores were significantly lower in the combined liposomal and bupivacaine group at all time points vs the plain bupivacaine group. Median pain scores for the study and control groups, respectively, were 0 (0-2) and 2 (0-4) for postoperative day 1 (P=.03), 2 (1-4) and 3 (2-5) for postoperative day 2 (P=.05), and 2 (1-4) and 3 (2-5) for postoperative day 3 (P=.02). Vaginal pain scores increased from postoperative day 1 to postoperative days 2 and 3 in both groups. There was a significant decrease in ibuprofen (P=.01) and acetaminophen (P=.03) usage in the study group; however, there was no difference between groups in total opioid consumption through postoperative day 3 (P=.82). There was no difference in successful voiding trials (study 72%, control 82%, P=.30), return of bowel function (P>.99), or quality of life factors (sleep, stress, mood, and activity). CONCLUSION: Preoperative regional pudendal block with a combination of liposomal and plain bupivacaine provided more effective vaginal pain control than plain bupivacaine alone for reconstructive surgery that included posterior colporrhaphy. Given the statistically significant decrease in vaginal pain in the study group, this block may be considered as a potential adjunct for multimodal pain reduction in this patient population.","Dengler, Katherine L; Craig, Eric R; DiCarlo-Meacham, Angela M; Welch, Eva K; Brooks, Daniel I; Vaccaro, Christine M; Gruber, Daniel D",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,71,17

Similarly to influenza, several authors have described a higher risk of fungal infection after COVID-19, in particular for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The main objective here is to define the prevalence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in a cohort of COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a large monocentric retrospective study investigating all the ventilated COVID-19 patients with ARDS hospitalized at Valenciennes’ general hospital, France, between March 15, 2020 and April 30, 2020. In the center a systematic IPA screening strategy was carried out for all ARDS patients, with weekly tests of serum galactomannan and beta-D-glucan. Bronchoalveolar lavage with culture and chest CT scan were performed when the serum assays were positives. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were studied. Their median age was 65 years, and 37 of the patients (71%) were male. Two patients had chronic immunosuppression and among all the patients, only 2 non-immunocompromised presented a putative IPA during their stay. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IPA in this cohort of COVID-19 patients (3.7%) is not higher than what is described in the other ARDS populations in the literature. These results are however different from the previous publications on COVID-19 patients and must therefore be confirmed by larger and multicentric studies.","Versyck, Maaike; Zarrougui, Wafa; Lambiotte, Fabien; Elbeki, Nabil; Saint-Leger, Piehr",J Mycol Med,71,24

We investigated the incidence of COVID-19 and the impact of immunosuppression and containment measures on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large IBD cohort, from a multicenter cohort from 21st of February to 30th of June, 2020. Ninety-seven patients with IBD (43 UC, 53 CD, one unclassified IBD) and concomitant COVID-19 over a total of 23,879 patients with IBD were enrolled in the study. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with IBD vs. the general population was 0.406% and 0.402% cases, respectively. Twenty-three patients (24%) were hospitalized, 21 (22%) had pneumonia, four (4%) were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and one patient died. Lethality in our cohort was 1% compared to 9% in the general population. At multivariable analysis, age > 65 years was associated with increased risk of pneumonia and hospitalization (OR 11.6, 95% CI 2.18–62.60; OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.10–23.86, respectively), treatment with corticosteroids increased the risk of hospitalization (OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.48–40.05), whereas monoclonal antibodies were associated with reduced risk of pneumonia and hospitalization (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.04–0.52; OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.10–0.90, respectively). The risk of COVID-19 in patients with IBD is similar to the general population. National lockdown was effective in preventing infection in our cohort. Advanced age and treatment with corticosteroids impacted negatively on the outcome of COVID-19, whereas monoclonal antibodies did not seem to have a detrimental effect.","Allocca, Mariangela; Chaparro, María; Gonzalez, Haidee Aleman; Bosca-Watts, Marta Maia; Palmela, Carolina; D’Amico, Ferdinando; Zacharopoulou, Eirini; Kopylov, Uri; Ellul, Pierre; Bamias, Giorgos; Ntelis, Vassilios; Lahat, Adi; Mantzaris, Gerassimos J; Papaconstantinou, Ioannis; Katsanos, Konstantinos; Uspenskaya, Yulia; Christodoulou, Dimitrios; Ben Horin, Shomron; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Torres, Joanna; Sebastian, Shaji; Gisbert, Javier P; Danese, Silvio; Fiorino, Gionata",J Clin Med,71,16

More evidence concerning extrapulmonary transmission routes such as the eyes is urgently needed. Although the humoral immune response is important in the viral containment, the local response in tears has not yet been studied. The aim of our study was twofold: to assess the prevalence of both SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies in tear fluid. METHODS: In a first series, nasopharyngeal sampling and tear sampling by Schirmer test strips were performed in 26 acutely ill patients with COVID-19 to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription PCR. In a second series, IgG and IgA responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum and tear fluid of convalescent individuals (n=22) were compared with control individuals (n=15) by ELISA. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in tears of 7/26 (26.9%) patients with COVID-19. None of them had ocular symptoms. Convalescent individuals displayed a significant higher ratio of IgG (p<0.0001) and IgA (p=0.0068) in tears compared with control individuals. A sensitivity of 77.3% and specificity of 93.3% was observed for IgG, and 59.1% and 100% for IgA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and a local IgG and IgA immune response in tear fluid. These data confirm the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through tear fluid and the importance of the eye as a first defence against SARS-CoV-2, indicating the potential of tears as a non-invasive surrogate for serum in monitoring the host immune response.","Muyldermans, Astrid; Bjerke, Maria; Demuyser, Thomas; De Geyter, Deborah; Wybo, Ingrid; Soetens, Oriane; Weets, Ilse; Kuijpers, Robert; Allard, Sabine D; Piérard, Denis; Raus, Peter P M",BMJ Open Ophthalmol,71,23

Unfortunately, due to the high infectiousness of the novel β-coronavirus, it is very likely to become an ordinary epidemic. The development of dietary supplements and functional foods might provide a strategy for the prevention and management of COVID-19. Scope and Approach: A great diversity of potential edible and medicinal plants and/or natural compounds showed potential benefits in managing SARS, which may also combat COVID-19. Moreover, many plants and compounds have currently been proposed to be protective against COVID-19. This information is based on data-driven approaches and computational chemical biology techniques. In this study, we review promising candidates of edible and medicinal plants for the prevention and management of COVID-19. We primarily focus on analyzing their underlying mechanisms. We aim to identify dietary supplements and functional foods that assist in managing this epidemic. Key findings and Conclusion: We infer that acetoside, glyasperin, isorhamnetin, and several flavonoid compounds may prevent and/or be effective in managing COVID-19 by targeting the viral infection, reducing the host cytokine storm, regulating the immune response, and providing organ protection. These bioactive dietary components (used either alone or in combination) might assist in the development of dietary supplements or functional foods for managing COVID-19.","Li, Sha; Cheng, Chien-Shan; Zhang, Cheng; Tang, Guo-Yi; Tan, Hor-Yue; Chen, Hai-Yong; Wang, Ning; Lai, Agnes Yuen-Kwan; Feng, Yibin",Front Pharmacol,71,20

Although scientists have been searching for methods to manage SARS-CoV-2, there is no specific medication against COVID-19 as of yet. Two main approaches should be followed in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2; one of which is to neutralize the virus, and the other is to inhibit the host cell membrane receptors, where SARS-CoV-2 will bind. In this study, peptides derived from beta-lactoglobulin, which inactivates both the virus and its receptors in the host cell, were identified using computer-based in silico analysis. The beta-lactoglobulin derived peptides used in this study were obtained by the treatment of goat milk whey fraction with trypsin. The structure of the peptides was characterized by the liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF/MS), and six beta-lactoglobulin derived peptides were selected as candidate peptides. Subsequently, the effects of peptides on SARS-CoV-2 and host cells were identified using virtual screening. According to the results of this in silico analysis, Ala-Leu-Pro-Met-His-Ile-Arg (ALMPHIR) and Ile-Pro-Ala-Val-Phe-Lys (IPAVFK) peptides were evaluated as potential candidates to be used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 after the future in vitro and in vivo studies.","Çakır, Bilal; Okuyan, Betül; Şener, Göksel; Tunalı-Akbay, Tuğba",Eur J Pharmacol,71,16

This study aimed to investigate MBBS international students’ perception on online TCM course, and to assess the online learning efficacy. METHODS: A total of 84 MBBS international students attending course of “Basic Traditional Chinese Medicine” during 2020 academic years at Zhejiang University were enrolled in this study. A quantitative questionnaire was respectively completed before and after the TCM course using a pretest–post-test design. By means of two online learning platforms, Learning in ZJU and DingTalk, TCM course was broadcast in both live and archived format to students. RESULTS: A total of 48 participants completed both baseline and follow-up questionnaires. The majority of participants preferred face-to-face classroom learning (26, 54.17% of total) when compared with online learning. Students felt that the course had brought in much benefits (mean 3.88, SD 0.87), and they were satisfied with the course content (mean 3.83, SD 0.95). Students’ TCM related knowledge and their behaviors of discussion and consulting were significantly improved by online TCM course (all P < 0.001). Students’ awareness of the necessity of TCM education and their feeling of difficulty in learning TCM were significantly strengthened (P = 0.042, 0.025, respectively). CONCLUSION: Online learning is a good alternative for TCM course of MBBS international students when classroom learning is suspended, whereas it cannot replace the need for onsite and face-to-face learning.","Zhang, Qing; He, Yi-Jing; Zhu, Yu-Hang; Dai, Min-Chen; Pan, Man-Man; Wu, Jia-Qi; Zhang, Xian; Gu, Ying-Er; Wang, Fang-Fang; Xu, Xiang-Rong; Qu, Fan",Integr Med Res,71,5

Both lectins have been shown to interact with a vast range of infectious agents, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiologic agent of tuberculosis in humans. In addition, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN possess a neck region, made up of a variable number of 23 amino acid tandem repeats, which plays a crucial role in the tetramerization of these proteins and support of the carbohydrate recognition domain. The length of the neck region, which shows variable levels of polymorphism, can critically influence the pathogen binding properties of these two receptors. We therefore investigated the impact of the DC-SIGN and L-SIGN neck-region length variation on the outcome of tuberculosis by screening this polymorphism in a large cohort of Coloured South African origin. The analyses of 711 individuals, including 351 tuberculosis patients and 360 healthy controls, revealed that none of the DC-SIGN and L-SIGN neck-region variants or genotypes seems to influence the individual susceptibility to develop tuberculosis.","Barreiro, Luis B.; Neyrolles, Olivier; Babb, Chantal L.; van Helden, Paul D.; Gicquel, Brigitte; Hoal, Eileen G.; Quintana-Murci, Lluís",Hum Immunol,71,1

Methods A study was conducted using an electronic survey administered to a convenient sample of 210 faculty, students, and staff at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) a historical black college and university (HBCU) in a rural community. Results The majority of participants were 18-24 years old (69%), college students (73.89%), identified as a woman (70%), and African-American (70%). Eighty-seven percent of participants were non-hesitant (received one dose or intended to be vaccinated). Approximately 54% had already received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Only 13% of participants were hesitant and did not plan to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The most common rationale for vaccine hesitancy was mistrust of the healthcare system/government towards African-Americans. Conclusion The results show that vaccine hesitancy was low in the predominantly young-adult, African-American population at a rural HBCU.

An analysis of the appropriateness of some of its novel recommendations was carried out by a group of experts representing different stakeholders. METHODS: An adaptation of the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was used to assess the level of agreement on the recommendations among 14 representatives of different stakeholders, including patients, regulators, investigators, ethics experts, and the pharmaceutical industry. The process included two rounds of rating and a virtual meeting. RESULTS: Fifty-three recommendations were evaluated. After the first round, 34 recommendations were judged “appropriate”; 19 were judged “uncertain”; and none was judged “inappropriate”. After the second round, 9 “uncertains” changed to “appropriate”. All recommendations rated medians of 6.5–9 on a 1–9 scale (1 = “extremely inappropriate”, 5 = “uncertain”, 9 = “extremely appropriate”). The sections “General recommendations” and “Gender perspective during the consent process for clinical studies” showed the highest “uncertainty” rating. The four keys to improving the understanding of the ICP in clinical studies are to: (1) consider consent a two-way continuous interaction that begins at the first contact with the potential participant and continues until the end of the study; (2) improve investigators’ communication skills; (3) co-create the information; and (4) use a layered approach, including information to compensate for the potential participant’s possible lack of health literacy and a glossary of terms.

Additionally, what factors affect those decisions? We examine all governors’ executive orders affecting local governments in the first five months of the 2020 pandemic. We find that preemption did occur, especially in the early months of the pandemic.

In 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed data from one licensed ASO3-adjuvanted influenza A(H5N1) vaccine for consideration of use during inter-pandemic periods among persons with occupational exposure. To guide vaccine policy decisions, we conducted a survey of laboratory workers to assess demand for HPAI vaccination. Methods We designed an anonymous web survey (EpiInfo 7.0) to collect information on demographics, type of work and time spent with HPAI viruses, and interest in HPAI vaccination. Eligible participants were identified from 42 entities registered with United States Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Select Agent program in 2016 and emailed electronic surveys. Personnel with Biosafety Level 3 enhanced (BSL-3E) laboratory access were surveyed. Descriptive analysis was performed. Results Overall, 131 responses were received from 33 principal investigators, 26 research scientists, 24 technicians, 15 postdoctoral fellows, 6 students, and 27 others. The estimated response rate was 15% among the laboratory personnel of responding principal investigators. One hundred respondents reported working in a BSL-3E area where HPAI experiments occurred with a mean time of 5.1–11.7 h per week. Overall, 49% were interested in receiving an A(H5N1) vaccine. By role, interest was highest among students (80%) and among those who spent >50% of their time in a BSL-3E area (64%). Most (61%) of those who said they might be or were not interested in vaccine believed it would not provide additional protection to current safety practices. Conclusions Half of responding laboratory workers was interested in receiving an influenza A(H5N1) vaccine. HPAI vaccination of laboratory workers at risk of occupational exposure could be used along with existing safety practices to protect this population.","Russell, Kate E.; Bresee, J. S.; Katz, J.

From legal to personal perspectives, there are strong arguments for its implementation and prohibition. This article intends to add to this rich discourse by exploring MAiD in the context of our current pandemic-ridden society as new pressures from social isolation and guilt threaten the autonomy of vulnerable elderly patients. Although autonomy is of chief importance, variables within our current context undermine otherwise independent decisions. Many older individuals are isolated from their social network, resulting in a decline in their mental health. Individuals in such a state are more likely to request a MAiD outcome. Furthermore, overwhelmed healthcare systems may not adequately address this state, which would normally have prompted a mental health intervention.

This is surprising as self-regulation, and thus using such strategies, is very important here. In this setting, we studied the relation between basic executive functions (i.e., working memory and shifting, measured with cognitive tests) and reported SRL-strategy use (i.e., management of time and effort, complex and simple cognitive strategy use, contacts with others, and academic thinking) within a correlational design with 889 adult online distance students. In this study, we performed regression analyses and took age and processing speed into consideration, as processing speed and EFs decrease with age, whereas self-regulation is reported to increase with age. Cognitively measured working memory was not related to reported SRL-strategy use in adult ODE students. Thus, even though the SRL-components within the strategies seem to elicit working memory, reported SRL-strategy use is not related to the functioning of this basic EF (measured with cognitive tests). This means that if SRL-strategy use needs to be increased in adult ODE students, training of working memory might not be an effective manner for achieving that goal. Better shifting and processing speed were related to less reported SRL-strategy use, which might suggest that SRL-strategies might be used to compensate for lower shifting (in academic thinking) and lower processing speed (in simple cognitive strategy use and contacts with others). With increasing age, the number of contacts with peers or teachers decreases. This latter finding might be of relevance during the pandemic since contacts with others is importance during lockdown.","Meijs, Celeste; Gijselaers, Hieronymus J.

The disease mainly affects the respiratory system of the patient, in particular, the lungs, which leads to patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute respiratory failure, with 5-15% of patients requiring observation in the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory support in the form of ventilation. This study was aimed at identifying the role of biochemical markers in the risk stratification of invasive and non-invasive ventilation of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods The study was conducted as a prospective, observational study of all admitted COVID-19 patients. A comparative analysis was performed of the survivors who were on invasive versus (vs) non-invasive ventilation and the non-survivors similarly. After computing the descriptive statistics, a multinomial logistic regression model was applied to obtain an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) at 95% confidence interval (CI), with Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit test used to predict the fitness of the data. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were obtained for each of the laboratory investigations predicting survival along with the intensive care stay and invasive ventilation.

Overall, 39% of the subjects did not need respiratory support, while 13% were on a ventilator, 16% on bilevel positive airway pressure/continuous positive airway pressure (BiPAP/CPAP), and 31% on supplemental oxygen therapy. Among the laboratory markers, mean hemoglobin was evidently lower in the invasive group, leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia were present in both invasively ventilated and non-surviving patients, while neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia were statistically indifferent among the mode of ventilation. Elevated urea, creatinine, and sodium were also significantly deranged laboratory markers amongst the invasively ventilated group. C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were elevated significantly in the invasive group, while serum ferritin was more frequently raised in the non-invasively ventilated group. Procalcitonin (PCT) was significantly associated with invasive ventilation as opposed to the non-invasive group. D-dimer was equally raised in both the groups at admission but significantly elevated in the invasive group at discharge. A multinomial regression model signified D-dimer (OR: 16.301), hypernatremia (OR: 12.738), creatinine (OR: 12.589), urea (OR: 12.576), and LDH (OR: 12.245) most significantly associated with death, while those for invasive ventilation were D-dimer (OR: 8.744), hypernatremia (OR: 4.532), PCT (OR: 3.829), neutrophilia (OR: 3.804), leukocytosis (OR: 3.330), and serum urea (OR: 3.312). Kaplan-Meier curves conclude total leucocyte count (TLC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, urea, creatinine, sodium, CRP, LDH, PCT, and D-dimer all significantly contributing to an early death. Conclusion The most significant marker for mortality was D-dimer, followed by serum sodium, urea/creatinine, LDH, ICU stay, and invasive ventilation.","Asghar, Muhammad Sohaib; Haider Kazmi, Syed J; Khan, Noman A; Akram, Mohammed; Jawed, Rumael; Rafaey, Wania; Hassan, Maira; Rasheed, Uzma; Khan, Mehak; Khan, Ali R",Cureus,71,21

While the base filtration efficiency of a material is of primary importance when a perfect seal is possible, ideal fit is not likely to be achieved by the average person preparing to enter a public space or even a healthcare worker without fit-testing before each shift. Our findings suggest that parameters including permeability and pliability can play a strong role in the filtration efficiency of a mask fabricated with various filter media, and that the filtration efficiency of loosely fitting masks/respirators against ultrafine particulates can drop by more than 60% when worn compared to the ideal filtration efficiency of the base material. Further, a test method using SARS-CoV-2 virion-sized silica nanoaerosols is demonstrated to assess the filtration efficiency against nanoparticulates that follow air currents associated with mask leakage.","Hill, W.

One such neglected health determinant is the sex of the patient. This is an essential clinical characteristic, as it can factor into a patient's clinical management and preventative measures. Some clinical studies have shown disparities in the proportion between males and females that have more severe clinical outcomes or, subsequently, die from this disease. However, this association has not been unequivocally established. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the association between male sex and COVID-19 severity. We systematically reviewed the literature, identified non-randomized studies that matched predetermined selection criteria, and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the proportion of males among four disease severity categories. Appropriate assessment strategies were implemented to assess and minimize potential biases. The results of this meta-analysis indicated that males constituted a significantly higher proportion of those who had adverse clinical outcomes and died from COVID-19. As the coronavirus spread from the East to the West, male sex remained a consistent risk factor. Our results support the establishment of the male sex as an important risk factor for this disease. Early identification and appropriate medical care for males with lab-confirmed COVID-19 may substantially change the course of clinical prognosis, resulting in greater numbers of lives saved.","Galbadage, T.; Peterson, B.

METHODS: All patients underwent real‐time polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), lung ultrasound (LUS) and clinical evaluation on the same day. In each of the 12 areas evaluated in the LUS, the LUS signs were scored to generate the aeration score. RESULTS: A total of 409 participants had positive PCR, with a median age of 41 (35‐51) years. All participants had clinical symptoms, with cough in 84.1%, fever in 69.7%, and dyspnea in 36.2% of cases. In the LUS, 72.6% of participants had B‐lines >2, 36.2% had coalescent B‐lines, and 8.06% had subpleural consolidations. The median aeration score was 3 (2‐7). The aeration score differed significantly regarding the presence of cough (P = .002), fever (P = .001), and dyspnea (P < .0001). The finding of subpleural consolidations in the LUS showed significant differences between participants with or without dyspnea (P < .0001).

L’infection ainsi que son traitement par corticoïdes pourrait décompenser, révéler ou induire un diabète sucré. Résultats Il s’agit d’une étude rétrospective portant sur 200 patients hospitalisés pour pneumopathie due au SARS-cov2 entre décembre 2020 et avril 2021. Presque la moitié avait un diabète connu (45 %). L’âge moyen était plus avancé chez cette population (66 ans pour les sujets ayant un diabète vs 63,9 ans). La moyenne des glycémies à l’admission des personnes non connues avoir un diabète était à 13. 94mmol/l et celle de l’HBA1C à 8. 58 %. 86 % d’entre eux avaient des comorbidités (HTA dans 50 % des cas). Le tableau clinique chez ces patients était marqué par la dyspnée (91 %), la fièvre (72,3 %), la toux sèche (36,4 %) et l’asthénie (27,3 %). Une hospitalisation initiale en réanimation avait intéressé 13. 6 % de ces patients. L’atteinte scanographique était sévère (>50 % du parenchyme) dans 75 % des cas.

The human Corona virus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) causes only limited CPE on different cell lines (Schildgen et al., 2006). Following infection of Vero118 cells, virus-induced CPE was too low to allow readout based on classical colorimetric methods (such as the MTS assay), even following prolonged incubation times (>7 days). To develop an antiviral screenings-assay against HCoV-NL63, we explored whether a dead-cell protease substrate could be used instead. The substrate used is a quenched peptide (bis-AAF-R110) that releases a fluorophore upon proteolytic-cleavage by proteases; the latter released from dead cells. Following different rounds of optimization a screening protocol was developed: Vero118 cells in 96-well plate format were infected with HCoV-NL63 (MOI = 0.01; 200 μL cell culture; 2.10(4) cells/mL, IMDM 5% FBS medium). Cultures were subsequently incubated for 5 days at 35 °C after which 20 μL of the peptide solution was added. Fluorescence was quantitated 2 hr after incubation at 37 °C. A roughly 3-fold increase in fluorescence intensity in the infected cultures was observed as compared to the uninfected cultures with a low well-to-well variability. Z’ factors calculated from different experiments were in the range of 0.6–0.8, indicating excellent assay quality. An anti-ACE2 polyclonal antiserum (that prevents coronavirus infection in cell cultures) was used as a positive control and allowed to validate the assay for antiviral screening purposes. In conclusion, in conditions where a viability staining is inadequate to quantitate virus-induced CPE, a novel simple and convenient method that detects cell-death and that is suitable for high-throughput screening purposes can be employed.","Jochmans, Dirk; Leyssen, Pieter; Neyts, Johan",J Virol Methods,71,13

We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government's public health efforts and citizen responses. Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. At this point, the Italian people understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This is true for all population groups we studied, with the partial exception of slightly lower compliance among young adults. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government, and those who think the government has been untruthful about the crisis mostly believe the public health message and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health. Policy Recommendations: Public health messaging is being heard and understood. The focus now should move from explaining that citizens should stay at home to what they can do at home. We need interventions that make staying at home and following public health protocols more desirable, or possibly even fun. These interventions could include virtual social interactions, such as online social reading activities, classes, exercise routines, among others - all designed to reduce the boredom of being socially isolated for long periods of time and to increase the attractiveness of following public health recommendations.

Current vaccines have failed to completely prevent PRRS outbreaks. Recently, we have shown that poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticle-entrapped inactivated PRRSV vaccine (NP-KAg) induces a cross-protective immune response in pigs. To further improve its cross-protective efficacy, the NP-KAg vaccine formulation was slightly modified, and pigs were coadministered the vaccine twice intranasally with a potent adjuvant: Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole-cell lysate. In vaccinated virulent heterologous PRRSV-challenged pigs, the immune correlates in the blood were as follows: 1) enhanced PRRSV-specific antibody response with enhanced avidity of both immunoglobulin (Ig)-G and IgA isotypes, associated with augmented virus-neutralizing antibody titers; 2) comparable and increased levels of virus-specific IgG(1) and IgG(2) antibody subtypes and production of high levels of both T-helper (Th)-1 and Th2 cytokines, indicative of a balanced Th1–Th2 response; 3) suppressed immunosuppressive cytokine response; 4) increased frequency of interferon-γ(+) lymphocyte subsets and expanded population of antigen-presenting cells; and most importantly 5) complete clearance of detectable replicating challenged heterologous PRRSV and close to threefold reduction in viral ribonucleic acid load detected in the blood. In conclusion, intranasal delivery of adjuvanted NP-KAg vaccine formulation to growing pigs elicited a broadly cross-protective immune response, showing the potential of this innovative vaccination strategy to prevent PRRS outbreaks in pigs. A similar approach to control other respiratory diseases in food animals and humans appears to be feasible.","Binjawadagi, Basavaraj; Dwivedi, Varun; Manickam, Cordelia; Ouyang, Kang; Wu, Yun; Lee, Ly James; Torrelles, Jordi B; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J",Int J Nanomedicine,71,33

The glycoprotein consists of a heavily glycosylated exterior domain, a single membrane spanning region, and a large cytoplasmic domain that contains tyrosine phosphatase activity. To investigate the function of this family, we generated T cell clones that lacked L-CA (L-CA−). The expression of the αβ T cell receptor, CD3, CD4, IL-2 receptor (p55), LFA-1, Thy-1, and Pgp-1 (CD44) was normal. The L-CA− T cell clones failed to proliferate in response to antigen or cross-linked CD3; however, they could still proliferate in response to IL-2. An L-CA+ revertant was obtained and the ability to proliferate in response to antigen and cross-linked CD3 was restored. These data indicate that L-CA is required for T cells to enter into cell cycle in response to antigen.","Pingel, Jeanette T.; Thomas, Matthew L.",Cell,71,16

This can be seen in the context of posttraumatic growth. These perceived changes refer to five main categories: Nature/Silence/Contemplation, Spirituality, Relationships, Reflection on life, and Digital media usage. A previous study with persons recruited in June 2020 directly after the lockdown in Germany showed that the best predictors of these perceived changes related to the Corona pandemic were the ability to mindfully stop and pause in distinct situations, to be “spellbound at the moment” and to become “quiet and devout,” indicating moments of wondering awe, with subsequent feelings of gratitude. Now, we intended to analyze (1) by whom and how strongly awe/gratitude was experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) how these feelings relate to perceived changes and experienced burden, and (3) whether or not feelings of awe/gratitude contribute to participants' well-being or may buffer perceived burden in terms of a resilience factor. Methods: Online survey with standardized questionnaires [i.e., WHO-Five Well-being Index (WHO5), Life satisfaction (BMLSS), Awe/Gratitude scale (GrAw-7), and Perceived Changes Questionnaire (PCQ)] among 2,573 participants (68% women; mean age 48.7 ± 14.2 years, 74% with a Christian affiliation) from Germany recruited between June and November 2020. Results: Awe/Gratitude scored significantly higher particularly among women (Cohen's d = 0.40), older persons (d = 0.88), persons who rely on their faith as a “stronghold in difficult times” (d = 0.99), those with higher well-being (d = 0.70), and lower perceptions of loneliness (d = 0.49). With respect to perceived changes during the pandemic, more intense feelings of Awe/Gratitude were particularly related to Nature/Silence/Contemplation (r = 0.41), Spirituality (r = 0.41), and Relationships (r = 0.33). Regression analyses revealed that the best predictors of Awe/Gratitude (R(2) = 0.40) were the frequency of meditation, female gender, life satisfaction and well-being, faith as a stronghold, and perceived burden and also life reflection, while Nature/Silence/Contemplation and Relationships had a further, but weaker, impact on Awe/Gratitude as a dependent variable. Awe/Gratitude was moderately associated with well-being (r = 0.32) and would predict 9% of participants' well-being variance. The best predictors of participants' well-being were multidimensional life satisfaction and low perceived burden (related to the pandemic), and further Awe/Gratitude and Nature/Silence/Contemplation; these would explain 47% of variance in well-being scores. However, Awe/Gratitude cannot be regarded as a buffer of the negative aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as it is only marginally (though negatively) related to perceived burden (r = −0.15). Mediation analysis showed that Awe/Gratitude mediates 42% of the link between well-being as a predictor on Nature/Silence/Contemplation as an outcome and has a direct effect of β = 0.15 (p < 0.001) and an indirect effect of β = 0.11 (p < 0.001). Further, Awe/Gratitude mediates 38% (p < 0.001) of the link between Nature/Silence/Contemplation as a predictor on well-being as the outcome; the direct effect is β = 0.18 (p < 0.001), and the indirect effect is β = 0.11 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The general ability to experience Awe/Gratitude particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic may sensitize to perceive the world around (including nature and concrete persons) more intensely, probably in terms of, or similar to, posttraumatic growth. As this awareness toward specific moments and situations that deeply “touch” a person was higher in persons with more intense meditation or prayer practice, one may assume that these practices may facilitate these perceptions in terms of a training. However, the experience of Awe/Gratitude does not necessarily buffer against adverse events in life and cannot prevent perceived burden due to the corona pandemic, but it facilitates to, nevertheless, perceive positive aspects of life even within difficult times. As Awe/Gratitude is further mediating the effects of Nature/Silence/Contemplation on well-being, intervention programs could help to train these perceptions, as these self-transcendent feelings are also related to prosocial behaviors with respectful treatment of others and commitment to persons in needs, and well-being.","Büssing, Arndt; Rodrigues Recchia, Daniela; Dienberg, Thomas; Surzykiewicz, Janusz; Baumann, Klaus",Front Psychiatry,71,17

In addition, it also affected the medical education of many residents and learners throughout the country. Historically, physicians undergoing their residency training were not involved in telemedicine. However, in response to the challenges faced due to COVID-19, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) released a provision in May 2020 to allow residents to participate in telemedicine. METHOD: Lincoln Medical Center, located in the South Bronx of New York City, currently has 115 Internal Medicine residents, and telemedicine clinic visits have been conducted by residents since June 2020. An anonymous 25-question survey was sent to all Internal Medicine residents between August 8, 2020 to August 14, 2020. RESULT: Of 115 residents, 95 (82.6% of the residents) replied to this questionnaire. Residents revealed feeling less confident in managing chronic diseases through telemedicine visits. The survey also shows that 83.1% of respondents prefer in-person visits during their training, 65.3% feel that the telemedicine experience will affect their future career choice, and 67.4% would prefer less than 50% of visits to be telemedicine in their future careers. OUTCOME: The purpose of the new ACGME rules allowing telemedicine was to prevent the undertraining of residents and maintain health care for the patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. This affects residency training and the experiences of residents, which in turn can influence their future career plans.","Chiu, Chia-Yu; Sarwal, Amara; Jawed, Muzamil; Chemarthi, Venkata Sireesha; Shabarek, Nehad",PLoS One,71,1

Diphyllin and diphyllinosides are known as natural blockers of cellular vacuolar ATPases, and so can act as inhibitors of the pH-dependent fusion of viral envelopes with host cell endosomal membranes. Such pH-dependent fusion is a critical early step during the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. Accordingly, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 profiles and cytotoxicities of diphyllin, diphyllinoside cleistanthin B, and two structurally related compounds, helioxanthin 8-1 and helioxanthin 5-4-2, are evaluated here using in vitro cell-based assay systems. Neither helioxanthin exhibits any obvious anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in vitro. By contrast diphyllin and cleistanthin B do exhibit anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in Vero cells, with respective 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)) values of 1.92 and 6.51 µM. Diphyllin displays anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect also in colorectal adenocarcinoma (CaCo-2) cells. Moreover, when diphyllin is added at various times post infection, a significant decrease in viral titer is observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, even at high viral multiplicities of infection. Importantly, neither diphyllin nor cleistanthin B are found cytotoxic to Vero cells in concentrations up to 100 µM. However, the cytotoxic effect of diphyllin is more pronounced in Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that diphyllin and diphyllin analogues might be perfected as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents in future preclinical studies, most especially if nanomedicine approaches may be invoked to optimize functional drug delivery to virus infected cells.","Stefanik, Michal; Strakova, Petra; Haviernik, Jan; Miller, Andrew D.; Ruzek, Daniel; Eyer, Ludek",Microorganisms,71,0

This paper considers the case study of the UK, where there are proposals to improve government and health data collection on LGBT populations, but also a degree of apparent uncertainty over the purpose and relevance of information about LGBT status in healthcare. This paper applies a health capabilities framework, arguing that the value of health information about LGBT status should be assessed according to whether it improves LGBT people’s capability to achieve good health. We draw upon 36 older LGBT people’s qualitative accounts of disclosing LGBT status within UK general practice healthcare. Participants’ accounts of the benefits and risks of disclosure could be mapped against multiple domains of capability, including those that closely align with biomedical accounts (e.g., longevity and physical health), but also more holistic considerations (e.g., emotion and affiliation). However, across all domains, individuals tend to assess capabilities at an individual level, with relatively little reference to population-level impact of disclosure. Clearer articulation of the benefits of disclosure and data collection for the collective capabilities of LGBT populations may be a beneficial strategy for improving the quality of information on LGBT populations.","Toze, Michael; Fish, Julie; Hafford-Letchfield, Trish; Almack, Kathryn",Int J Environ Res Public Health,71,22

Objectives: To synthesise existing evidence about communication practices used to discuss difficult matters, including prognosis and end of life, and to use this evidence to make recommendations for clinical practice. The aim of this study was to use rapid review methods to update findings from a previous systematic review published in 2014. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science, Scopus, ASSIA and Amed. Study eligibility criteria: Studies using conversation analysis or discourse analysis to examine recordings of actual conversations about difficult matters relating to future illness progression and end of life. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Data appraisal and extraction procedures used in the 2014 review were modified for this rapid review. Results: Following screening, 18 sources were deemed to meet eligibility criteria, which were added to the 19 sources included in the 2014 systematic review. Synthesis of study findings identified 11 communication practices: providing opportunities for patient or family members to propose matters to discuss (7 out of 37 included sources); seeking a patient or family member's perspective (6/37); discussing the future indirectly (11/37); discussing the future explicitly (7/37) linking to something previously said or done (11/37); using hypothetical scenarios (13/37); framing a difficult matter as universal (5/37); acknowledging uncertainty (3/37); exploring options (2/37); displaying sensitivity (7/37); emphasising the positive (7/37).

We use simple epidemiological models to explore estimates for the magnitude and timing of future Covid-19 cases given different impacts of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 as well as its interaction with vaccines and nonpharmaceutical interventions. We find that variations in the immune response to primary SARS-CoV-2 infections and a potential vaccine can lead to dramatically different immunity landscapes and burdens of critically severe cases, ranging from sustained epidemics to near elimination.

By conducting high-resolution CFD simulations, this paper investigates the evaporation and transport of solid-liquid mixed droplets (initial diameter 10 μm and 50 μm, solid to liquid ratio is 1:9) exhaled in a coach bus with 14 thermal manikins. Five air-conditioning supply directions and ambient relative humidity (RH = 35% and 95%) are considered. Results show that ventilation effectiveness, RH and initial droplet size significantly influence droplet transmissions in coach bus. 50 μm droplets tend to evaporate completely within 1.8 s and 7 s as RH = 35% and 95% respectively, while 0.2 s or less for 10 μm droplets. Thus 10 μm droplets diffuse farther with wider range than 50 μm droplets which tend to deposit more on surfaces. Droplet dispersion pattern differs due to various interactions of gravity, ventilation flows and the upward thermal body plume. The fractions of droplets suspended in air, deposited on wall surfaces are quantified. This study implies high RH, backward supply direction and passengers sitting at nonadjacent seats can effectively reduce infection risk of droplet transmission in buses. Besides taking masks, regular cleaning is also recommended since 85%-100% of droplets deposit on object surfaces.","Yang, Xia; Ou, Cuiyun; Yang, Hongyu; Liu, Li; Song, Tie; Kang, Min; Lin, Hualiang; Hang, Jian",J Hazard Mater,71,33

Until 2019, no dengue outbreak had been reported in Hainan Province for over 20 years. However, in early September of 2019, an increasing number of infected cases appeared and the DF outbreak lasted for over one month in Haikou City, Hainan Province. In our study, we collected 97 plasma samples from DF patients at three hospitals, as well as 1585 mosquito larvae samples from puddles in different areas of Haikou. There were 49 (50.5%) plasma samples found to be strongly positive and 9 (9.3%) plasma samples were weakly positive against the NS1 antigen. We discovered DENV both in the patient’s plasma samples and mosquito larvae samples, and isolated the virus from C6/36 cells inoculated with the acute phase serum of patients. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the new strains were the most closely related to the epidemic strain in the southern regions of China, belonging to lineage IV, genotype I, DENV-1. Compared to the seven closest strains from neighboring countries and provinces, a total of 18 amino acid mutations occurred in the coding sequences (CDS) of the new isolated strain, DENV1 HMU-HKU-2. Our data shows that dengue virus is re-emerged in Hainan, and pose new threats for public health. Thus regular molecular epidemiological surveillance is necessary for control and prevention of DENV transmission.

Additionally, the potential use of these viruses in acts of bioterrorism poses a threat to national security. Given the paucity of vaccines or postexposure therapeutics for many highly pathogenic RNA viruses, novel treatments are badly needed. Sequence-based drug design, under development for almost 20 years, is proving effective in animal models and has moved into clinical trials. Important advances in the field include the characterization of RNA interference in mammalian cells and chemical modifications that can dramatically increase the in vivo stability of therapeutic oligonucleotides. Antisense strategies utilize single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that inhibit protein production by mediating the catalytic degradation of target mRNA, or by binding to sites on mRNA essential for translation. Double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides, known as short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), also mediate the catalytic degradation of complementary mRNAs. As RNA virus infection is predicated on the delivery, replication, and translation of viral RNA, these pathogens present an obvious target for the rapidly advancing field of sequence-specific therapeutics. Antisense oligonucleotides or siRNAs can be designed to target the viral RNA genome or viral transcripts. This article reviews current knowledge on therapeutic applications of antisense and RNA interference for highly pathogenic RNA viral infections.","Spurgers, Kevin B.; Sharkey, C.

Successful control of the global SARS epidemic will require rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests to monitor its spread, as well as, the development of vaccines and new antiviral compounds including neutralizing antibodies that effectively prevent or treat this disease. METHODS: The human synthetic single-chain fragment variable (scFv) ETH-2 phage antibody library was used for the isolation of scFvs against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV using a bio panning-based strategy. The selected scFvs were characterized under genetics-molecular aspects and for SARS-CoV N protein detection in ELISA, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Human scFv antibodies to N protein of SARS-CoV can be easily isolated by selecting the ETH-2 phage library on immunotubes coated with antigen. These in vitro selected human scFvs specifically recognize in ELISA and western blotting studies distinct epitopes in N protein domains and detect in immunohistochemistry investigations SARS-CoV particles in infected Vero cells. CONCLUSION: The human scFv antibodies isolated and described in this study represent useful reagents for rapid detection of N SARS-CoV protein and SARS virus particles in infected target cells.","Flego, Michela; Di Bonito, Paola; Ascione, Alessandro; Zamboni, Silvia; Carattoli, Alessandra; Grasso, Felicia; Cassone, Antonio; Cianfriglia, Maurizio",BMC Infect Dis,71,1

Both theoretical and experimental efforts are being made to find an effective treatment to suppress the virus, constituting the forefront of current global safety concerns and a significant burden on global economies. The development of innovative materials able to prevent the transmission, spread, and entry of COVID-19 pathogens into the human body is currently in the spotlight. The synthesis of these materials is, therefore, gaining momentum, as methods providing nontoxic and environmentally friendly procedures are in high demand. Here, a highly virucidal material constructed from SiO(2)-Ag composite immobilized in a polymeric matrix (ethyl vinyl acetate) is presented. The experimental results indicated that the as-fabricated samples exhibited high antibacterial activity towards Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as well as towards SARS-CoV-2. Based on the present results and radical scavenger experiments, we propose a possible mechanism to explain the enhancement of the biocidal activity. In the presence of O(2) and H(2)O, the plasmon-assisted surface mechanism is the major reaction channel generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). We believe that the present strategy based on the plasmonic effect would be a significant contribution to the design and preparation of efficient biocidal materials.

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 individuals attending the Galway-Roscommon Mental Health Services with an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis of an anxiety disorder to determine the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on anxiety and mood symptoms, social and occupational functioning and quality of life. RESULTS: Twelve (40.0%) participants described COVID-19 restrictions as having a deleterious impact on their anxiety symptoms. Likert scale measurements noted that the greatest impact of COVID-19 related to social functioning (mean = 4.5, SD = 2.9), with a modest deleterious effect on anxiety symptoms noted (mean = 3.8, SD = 2.9). Clinician rated data noted that 8 (26.7%) participants had disimproved and 14 (46.7%) participants had improved since their previous clinical review, prior to commencement of COVID-19 restrictions. Conditions associated with no ‘trigger’, such as generalised anxiety disorder, demonstrated a non-significant increase in anxiety symptoms compared to conditions with a ‘trigger’, such as obsessive compulsive disorder. Psychiatric or physical comorbidity did not substantially impact on symptomatology secondary to COVID-19 mandated restrictions.

Moreover, viral hepatitis-related HCC imposes an important burden on public health in terms of disability-adjusted life years. In order to reduce such a burden, some major challenges must be faced. Universal vaccination against hepatitis B virus, especially in the neonatal period, is probably the most relevant primary preventive measure against the development of HCC. Moreover, considering the large adult population already infected with hepatitis B and C viruses, it is also imperative to identify these individuals to ensure their access to treatment. Both hepatitis B and C currently have highly effective therapies, which are able to diminish the risk of development of liver cancer. Finally, it is essential for individuals at high-risk of HCC to be included in surveillance programs, so that tumors are detected at an early stage. Patients with hepatitis B or C and advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis benefit from being followed in a surveillance program. As hepatitis B virus is oncogenic and capable of leading to liver cancer even in individuals with early stages of liver fibrosis, other high-risk groups of patients with hepatitis B are also candidates for surveillance. Considerable effort is required concerning these strategies in order to decrease the incidence and the mortality of viral hepatitis-related HCC.","de Mattos, Ângelo Zambam; Debes, Jose D; Boonstra, Andre; Yang, Ju-Dong; Balderramo, Domingo C; Sartori, Giovana D P; de Mattos, Angelo Alves",World J Gastroenterol,71,20

CONCLUSIONS the confinement is related to an increase in symptomatology and dysfunctional behaviours characteristic of ASD, and therefore it is necessary to implement actions that help to reduce this impact now, as well as in future crisis events.","Martínez-González, Agustín E; Moreno-Amador, Beatriz; Piqueras, José A",Research in developmental disabilities,71,20

In Australia there is public health concern relating to bats’ role as reservoirs of Australian Bat Lyssavirus (ABLV), which has clinical features identical to classical rabies. Three deaths from ABLV have occurred in Australia. A survey was conducted to determine the frequency of bat exposures amongst adults in Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales; explore reasons for handling bats; examine reported practices upon encountering injured or trapped bats or experiencing bat bites or scratches; and investigate knowledge of bat handling warnings. METHODS: A representative sample of 821 New South Wales adults aged 16 years and older were interviewed during May and June 2011, using a computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) method. Frequencies, proportions and statistical differences in proportion were performed. Using an α-value of 0.05 and power of 80%, it was calculated that a sample size of 800 was required to provide statistical significance of +/− 5% for dichotomous variables. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-twenty-seven (15.5%) respondents indicated that they had previously handled a bat, being 22% (48/218) rural and 13% (78/597) urban respondents (χ(2) = 9.8, p = 0.0018). Twenty one percent of males (63/304) had handled bats compared with 12% (64/517) of females (χ(2) = 10.2, p = 0.0014). Overall, 42.0% (n = 345) of respondents reported having seen or heard a warning about handling bats. If faced with an injured or trapped bat, 25% (206/821) indicated that they would handle the bat, with 17% (36/206) saying that they would use their bare hands. For minor scratches, 14% (117/821) indicated that they would ignore the injury while four respondents would ignore major scratches or bites. CONCLUSIONS: Previous human-bat interactions were relatively common. Bat exposures most frequently occurred with sick or injured bats, which have the highest risk of ABLV. On encountering an injured or sick bat, potentially high risk practices were commonly reported, particularly among rural males. It is important to understand why people still handle bats despite public health warnings to inform future communication strategies.","Paterson, Beverley J; Butler, Michelle T; Eastwood, Keith; Cashman, Patrick M; Jones, Alison; Durrheim, David N",BMC Public Health,71,20

We sampled feces and/or anal swabs of 1,044 insectivorous bats of 2 families and 17 species from 21 different locations within Colorado from 2007 to 2009. We detected alphacoronavirus RNA in bats of 4 species: big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), 10% prevalence; long-legged bats (Myotis volans), 8% prevalence; little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), 3% prevalence; and western long-eared bats (Myotis evotis), 2% prevalence. Overall, juvenile bats were twice as likely to be positive for CoV RNA as adult bats. At two of the rural sampling sites, CoV RNAs were detected in big brown and long-legged bats during the three sequential summers of this study. CoV RNA was detected in big brown bats in all five of the urban maternity roosts sampled throughout each of the periods tested. Individually tagged big brown bats that were positive for CoV RNA and later sampled again all became CoV RNA negative. Nucleotide sequences in the RdRp gene fell into 3 main clusters, all distinct from those of Old World bats. Similar nucleotide sequences were found in amplicons from gene 1b and the spike gene in both a big-brown and a long-legged bat, indicating that a CoV may be capable of infecting bats of different genera. These data suggest that ongoing evolution of CoVs in bats creates the possibility of a continued threat for emergence into hosts of other species. Alphacoronavirus RNA was detected at a high prevalence in big brown bats in roosts in close proximity to human habitations (10%) and known to have direct contact with people (19%), suggesting that significant potential opportunities exist for cross-species transmission of these viruses. Further CoV surveillance studies in bats throughout the Americas are warranted.","Osborne, Christina; Cryan, Paul M.; O'Shea, Thomas J.; Oko, Lauren M.; Ndaluka, Christina; Calisher, Charles H.; Berglund, Andrew D.; Klavetter, Mead L.; Bowen, Richard A.; Holmes, Kathryn V.; Dominguez, Samuel R.",PLoS One,71,8

This uncertainty concerns both the duration of vaccine immunity and the duration of natural immunity. We aim to critically review the information available today, and draw practical conclusions. Methods This is a narrative review of the recently published information on the topic, compared with the knowledge we already have of the behavior of various viral infectious agents. Results It is too early to have any meaningful information on the duration of vaccine immunity against SARS CoV-2. The rate of reinfection is very low. Most of them are due to laboratory errors, to incomplete cure of the primary infection, to the supervening immunodeficiency of the host, or to pre-existing immunodeficiency made evident by the SARS CoV-2 infection. The available studies on the immunology of the infection converge in indicating that it generates a robust and persistent immunity. This behavior does not differ from that of respiratory viruses known to date: in naturally occurring viral respiratory infections, reinfections are exceptional. Conclusions and implications The civil community awaits suggestions from scientists not only to protect the lives of susceptible people, but to be able to safely resume activities made uncertain by the pandemic. From the information we have to date, we suggest that in principle, patients who have already overcome the infection should not be prioritized to the SARS CoV-2 vaccine. Instead, they could be provided with an immunological passport that allows them to resume a normal social life.","Fiocchi, Alessandro; Jensen-Jarolim, Erika",World Allergy Organ J,71,16

Despite the high variability of its genome, the structure of viral RNA (vRNA) possesses features that remain constant between strains and are biologically important for virus replication. Therefore, conserved structural motifs of vRNA can represent a novel therapeutic target. Here, we focused on the presence of G-rich sequences within the influenza A/California/07/2009(H1N1) genome and their ability to form RNA G-quadruplex structures (G4s). We identified 12 potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) and determined their conservation among the IAV strains using bioinformatics tools. Then we examined the propensity of PQS to fold into G4s by various biophysical methods. Our results revealed that six PQS oligomers could form RNA G-quadruplexes. However, three of them were confirmed to adopt G4 structures by all utilized methods. Moreover, we showed that these PQS motifs are present within segments encoding polymerase complex proteins indicating their possible role in the virus biology.","Tomaszewska, Maria; Szabat, Marta; Zielińska, Karolina; Kierzek, Ryszard",Int J Mol Sci,71,16

While developing novel drugs and vaccines is long, repurposing existing drugs against COVID-19 can yield treatments with known preclinical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicity profiles, which can rapidly enter clinical trials. In this study, we present a novel network-based drug repurposing platform to identify candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. At the time of the initial outbreak, knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 was lacking, but based on its similarity with other viruses, we sought to identify repurposing candidates to be tested rapidly at the clinical or preclinical levels. We first analyzed the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and confirmed SARS as the closest virus by genome similarity, followed by MERS and other human coronaviruses. Using text mining and database searches, we obtained 34 COVID-19-related genes to seed the construction of a molecular network where our module detection and drug prioritization algorithms identified 24 disease-related human pathways, five modules, and 78 drugs to repurpose. Based on clinical knowledge, we re-prioritized 30 potentially repurposable drugs against COVID-19 (including pseudoephedrine, andrographolide, chloroquine, abacavir, and thalidomide).

An increase in clinical studies has reported the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). For example, intravenous Chinese medicine can significantly improve cardiac function and biomarkers in patients with CHF. However, there exists inconsistency, lack of practicality and unclear reporting of outcomes in these clinical trials causing difficulty in the comparison of results across similar studies during data synthesis. A core outcome set (COS) can help in the standardisation of outcomes reported across studies from the same healthcare area. The aim of this study is to develop a COS on TCM for CHF (COS-TCM-CHF) to reduce heterogeneity in reporting and improve quality assessment in clinical trials to support data synthesis in addressing the effectiveness of TCM treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will include constructing an outcome pool which will identify potential outcomes through systematic reviews of TCM randomised clinical trials, two clinical registry databases, semi-structured interviews of patients and the clinicians’ questionnaire. According to the characteristics of TCM and a taxonomy recommended by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative, all outcomes in the outcome pool will be classified into different domains. A preliminary list of outcomes which will then be used in the Delphi survey is generated using a certain criteria based on the length of the pool. The Delphi survey will include two rounds with seven key stakeholder groups to select candidate items for a consensus meeting. A final COS-TCM-CHF will be developed at a face-to-face consensus meeting involving representatives from the different stakeholders. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval of this study has been granted by Evidence-based Medicine Centre of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Ethics Committee (TJUTCMEC201200002). We will disseminate our research findings of the final COS on the website of Chinese Clinical Trials for Core Outcome Set, with open access publications and present at international conferences to reach a wide range of knowledge users.

Here, we extensively characterized antibodies of the SARS-CoV structural proteins for their cross-reactivity, experimental utility, and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. We assessed a total of 10 antibodies (six for Spike, two for Membrane, and one for Nucleocapsid and Envelope viral protein). We evaluated the utility of these antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of assays, including immunofluorescence, ELISA, biolayer interferometry, western blots, and micro-neutralization. Remarkably, a high proportion of the antibodies we tested showed cross-reactivity, indicating a potentially generalizable theme of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These antibodies should help facilitate further research into SARS-CoV-2 basic biology.

Little is known about effective strategies to disseminate health education messages digitally and ultimately achieve optimal audience engagement. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the difference in audience engagement with identical antismoking health messages on three social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram) and with a referring link to a tobacco prevention website cited in these messages. We hypothesized that health messages might not receive the same user engagement on these media, although these messages were identical and distributed at the same time. METHODS: We measured the effect of health promotion messages on the risk of smoking among users of three social media sites (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram) and disseminated 1275 health messages between April 19 and July 12, 2017 (85 days). The identical messages were distributed at the same time and as organic (unpaid) and advertised (paid) messages, each including a link to an educational website with more information about the topic. Outcome measures included message engagement (ie, the click-through rate [CTR] of the social media messages) and educational website engagement (ie, the CTR on the educational website [wCTR]). To analyze the data and model relationships, we used mixed effects negative binomial regression, z-statistic, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. RESULTS: Comparisons between social media sites showed that CTRs for identical antitobacco health messages differed significantly across social media (P<.001 for all). Instagram showed the statistically significant highest overall mean message engagement (CTR=0.0037; 95% CI 0.0032-0.0042), followed by Facebook (CTR=0.0026; 95% CI 0.0022-0.0030) and Twitter (CTR=0.0015; 95% CI 0.0013-0.0017). Facebook showed the highest as well as the lowest CTR for any individual message. However, the message CTR is not indicative of user engagement with the educational website content. Pairwise comparisons of the social media sites differed with respect to the wCTR (P<.001 for all). Messages on Twitter showed the lowest CTR, but they resulted in the highest level of website engagement (wCTR=0.6308; 95% CI 0.5640-0.6975), followed by Facebook (wCTR=0.2213; 95% CI 0.1932-0.2495) and Instagram (wCTR=0.0334; 95% CI 0.0230-0.0438). We found a statistically significant higher CTR for organic (unpaid) messages (CTR=0.0074; 95% CI 0.0047-0.0100) compared with paid advertisements (CTR=0.0022; 95% CI 0.0017-0.0027; P<.001 and P<.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence-based insights to guide the design of health promotion efforts on social media. Future studies should examine the platform-specific impact of psycholinguistic message variations on user engagement, include newer sites such as Snapchat and TikTok, and study the correlation between web-based behavior and real-world health behavior change.

Men are disproportionately affected by COVID‐19, having more severe disease with higher mortality rates than women. Androgens have been implicated as the underlying cause for more severe disease, as the androgen receptor has been noted to upregulate the cell surface receptors that mediate viral cell entry and infection. Unfortunately, despite testosterone’s potential role in COVID‐19 prognosis, androgen deprivation therapy is neither protective nor a treatment for COVID‐19. Interestingly, the male reproductive organs have been found to be vulnerable in moderate to severe illness, leading to reports of erectile dysfunction and orchitis. COVID‐19 viral particles have been identified in penile and testis tissue, both in live patients who recovered from COVID‐19 and post mortem in men who succumbed to the disease. Although sexual transmission remains unlikely in recovered men, moderate to severe COVID‐19 infection can lead to germ cell and Leydig cell depletion, leading to decreased spermatogenesis and male hypogonadism. The objective of this review is to describe the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on male reproductive health. There are still many unanswered questions as to the specific underlying mechanisms by which COVID‐19 impacts male reproductive organs and the long‐term sequelae of SARS‐CoV‐2 on male reproductive health.","Nassau, Daniel E.; Best, Jordan C.; Kresch, Eliyahu; Gonzalez, Daniel C.; Khodamoradi, Kajal; Ramasamy, Ranjith",BJU Int,71,16

The measured variables were needs to hospitalization, clinical and laboratory data including fever, cough, breathing rate, C‐Reactive Protein level, lymphocytes count at onset of admission and was well as at 5 days of treatments. In addition, CT findings were evaluated on admission and 14 days after initiation of treatment. RESULTS: Sixty subjects were enrolled in the study with a 1 to 1 ratio in FBX and HCQ groups. On admission, fever (66.7%), cough (87%), tachypnea (44.4%), dyspnea (35%), elevated CRP value (94.4%) and lung involvement according to chest CT (100%) were documented in enrolled patients with insignificant difference between FBX and HCQ groups. Fever, cough and tachypnea were significantly mitigated in both groups after five days of treatments without any significant differences between groups. The mean percentages of lung involvement were significantly reduced to 7.3% and 8% after 14 days of treatment with FBX and HCQ, respectively. In adult outpatients with moderate COVID‐19 infection, the effectiveness of FBX and HCQ was not different in terms of resolution of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and lung CT findings.

The newly developed recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay incorporated in a suitcase laboratory has shown promising diagnostic efficacy over real-time PCR in detection of leishmania DNA from clinical samples. For broader application of this point-of-need system, we undertook a current multi-country diagnostic evaluation study towards establishing this technique in different endemic settings which would be beneficial for the ongoing elimination programs for leishmaniasis. For this study purpose, clinical samples from confirmed visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients were subjected to both real-time PCR and RPA assay in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. Further skin samples from confirmed cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients were also included from Sri Lanka. A total of 450 clinical samples from VL patients, 429 from PKDL patients, 47 from CL patients, and 322 from endemic healthy/healthy controls were under investigation to determine the diagnostic efficacy of RPA assay in comparison to real-time PCR. A comparative sensitivity of both methods was found where real-time PCR and RPA assay showed 96.86% (95% CI: 94.45–98.42) and 88.85% (95% CI: 85.08–91.96) sensitivity respectively in the diagnosis of VL cases. This new isothermal method also exhibited promising diagnostic sensitivity (93.50%) for PKDL cases, when a skin sample was used. Due to variation in the sequence of target amplicons, RPA assay showed comparatively lower sensitivity (55.32%) than that of real-time PCR in Sri Lanka for the diagnosis of CL cases. Except for India, the assay presented absolute specificity in the rest of the sites. Excellent concordance between the two molecular methods towards detection of leishmania DNA in clinical samples substantiates the application of RPA assay incorporated in a suitcase laboratory for point-of-need diagnosis of VL and PKDL in low resource endemic settings.

We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved from a distant common ancestor with the common coronaviruses but not a branch of any of them, implying that the prevalent pandemic COVID-19 agent SARS-CoV-2 may have existed in a yet to be identified primary host for a long time.","Li, Fei-Feng; Zhang, Qiong; Wang, Gui-Yu; Liu, Shu-Lin",Aging (Albany NY),71,1
688960,688960,688960,Parallel evolution of influenza across multiple spatiotemporal scales,12.827303,6.414491,2017-06-27,"Fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA) is a commonly used, quantitative technique for detecting biochemical changes based on antigen–antibody binding reactions using a well-plate platform. As the manufacturing technology of microfluidic system evolves, FLISA can be implemented onto microfluidic disk platforms which allows the detection of trace biochemical reactions with high resolutions. Herein, we propose a novel microfluidic system comprising a disk with a three-dimensional incubation chamber, which can reduce the amount of the reagents to 1/10 and the required time for the entire process to less than an hour. The incubation process achieves an antigen–antibody binding reaction as well as the binding of fluorogenic substrates to target proteins. The FLISA protocol in the 3D incubation chamber necessitates performing the antibody-conjugated microbeads’ movement during each step in order to ensure sufficient binding reactions. Vascular endothelial growth factor as concentration with ng mL(−1) is detected sequentially using a benchtop process employing this 3D microfluidic disk. The 3D microfluidic disk works without requiring manual intervention or additional procedures for liquid control. During the incubation process, microbead movement is controlled by centrifugal force from the rotating disk and the sedimentation by gravitational force at the tilted floor of the chamber.","Kang, Dong Hee; Kim, Na Kyong; Park, Sang-Woo; Kang, Hyun Wook",Biosensors (Basel),71,1

The identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying pleiotropy has the power to reveal previously unknown biological connections between seemingly unrelated traits. Additionally, the discovery of pleiotropic genes increases our understanding of both genetic and phenotypic complexity by characterizing novel gene functions. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has been used to identify several pleiotropic regions in many organisms. However, gene knockout studies are needed to eliminate the possibility of tightly linked, non-pleiotropic loci. Here, we use a panel of 296 recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines of Caenorhabditis elegans and a high-throughput fitness assay to identify a single large-effect QTL on the center of chromosome V associated with variation in responses to eight chemotherapeutics. We validate this QTL with near-isogenic lines and pair genome-wide gene expression data with drug response traits to perform mediation analysis, leading to the identification of a pleiotropic candidate gene, scb-1, for some of the eight chemotherapeutics. Using deletion strains created by genome editing, we show that scb-1, which was previously implicated in response to bleomycin, also underlies responses to other double-strand DNA break-inducing chemotherapeutics. This finding provides new evidence for the role of scb-1 in the nematode drug response and highlights the power of mediation analysis to identify causal genes.","Evans, Kathryn S.; Andersen, Erik C.",G3 (Bethesda),71,29

We searched for clinical characteristics predicting exceptional long-term survival in HCC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. METHODS: We compared clinical characteristics of 59 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with immunotherapy with and without locoregional therapy between 2013–2019. We compared patients who lived less than 12 months with patients who lived more than 3 years. Traits of short-term (31 patients) and long-term (5 patients) survivors were compared. Patients who died between 12 months and 3 years of starting treatment on protocol were not included in the analysis. RESULTS: Two out of five patients (40%) in the long-term survival group had a partial response (PR) or a complete response (CR) per the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), while, of the 31 patients in the short-term survival group, only 2 (6.5%) had a CR or PR. Two of the 5 patients with a long-term survival had immune-related adverse events grade 3 or 4 (IrAEs-3/4). None of the patients in the short-term survival group had IrAEs-3/4. The patients, who presented with IrAEs-3/4, which included colitis and adrenal insufficiency, continued to have a response off treatment. The median overall survival (OS) was 11.8 months (95% CI: 7.8–15.4 months), with a 12-month OS of 46.6% (95% CI: 33.4–58.8%) and a 3-year OS of 12.5% (95% CI: 5.0–23.7%). CONCLUSION: We found a possible association between immune-related adverse events grade 3 and 4 and long-term survival in patients with advanced HCC. The cases in our analysis represent extraordinary defiance of the usual predicted dismal course of advanced HCC.","Monge, Cecilia; Xie, Changqing; Steinberg, Seth M; Greten, Tim F",J Hepatocell Carcinoma,71,20

All 5 cases presented with fever, cough and shortness of breath and a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. Case 1, 2, 3 and 5 patients were hypoxemic with saturation less than 90% on admission and decompensated rapidly, whereas Case 4 decompensated after day 14. Mechanical ventilation failed to provide adequate oxygenation in all 5 cases; case 2,3 and 5 were started on recruitment measures with proning while it was not possible for case 1 owing to morbid obesity. Proning was not possible in the case 4 as patient became severely hypoxemic while patient was undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. The case 1-4 remained on ECMO for 19, 17, 17 and 2 days respectively. All except case 2 had improvement in APACHEII and SOFA score after ECMO initiation. All 5 patients had elevated inflammatory markers of serum ferritin, D-dimer, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) which trended down after a few days of ECMO initiation All 5 patients received high dose steroids during their stay in the ICU. Case 4 and 5 passed away after compassionate extubation. Case 1-3 had prolonged hospital course with complication of hospital acquired pneumonia requiring multiple courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Summary Our observational report of 5 patients reports the use of ECMO in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 with ARDS and difficult to maintain saturation despite mechanical ventilation and proning with recovery for 3 patients. However, given the lack of ECMO centers; this is not a readily available option. Further studies are warranted to investigate the role of ECMO in SARRS-CoV-2 and careful identification of appropriate candidates.","Rai, D.; Tahir, M.; Pandey, R.; Kharsa, A.; Furqan, F.; Thakkar, S.; Zaheer, A.; Khodjaev, S.; Feitell, S.; Lee, E.; Parikh, V.",The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation,71,23

In the current time of COVID-19 social distancing, technology can also help organizations more safely provide services to people with compromised immune systems and to clients who might otherwise not be reached. However, technology projects implemented in harm reduction settings are frequently conceptualized and developed by researchers or technology specialists rather than by SSP staff or clients. METHODS: To more effectively meet the needs of SSPs and other CBOs across the USA, our team conducted qualitative interviews with 16 individuals who have extensive backgrounds working in the field of harm reduction. Interviews were digitally recorded and professionally transcribed, and the transcripts were checked for accuracy by the interviewers. The resulting transcripts were coded and analyzed to determine emerging themes. RESULTS: Interviewees mentioned the ability of technology to deliver consistent quality messaging to multiple clients at the same time and the potential to customize or tailor technology-based messaging to specific client populations as positive benefits. Clear barriers to technology use also emerged, in particular regarding privacy, data security, and the need to maintain client trust when discussing sensitive issues (e.g., illicit drug use). CONCLUSIONS: Technology offers the potential to deliver consistently high-quality health communication and maintain contact with clients who may have no other access to care. If designed and managed effectively, technology can also address issues related to providing services during times when physical contact is limited due to COVID-19 social distancing measures.","Aronson, Ian David; Bennett, Alex S.; Freeman, Robert",Harm Reduct J,71,20

Studies have reported that the traditional Chinese medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza possesses remarkable antiviral properties; however, the anti‐coronaviral activity of its main components, salvianolic acid A (SAA), salvianolic acid B (SAB), and salvianolic acid C (SAC) is still debated. In this study, we used Cell Counting Kit‐8 staining and flow cytometry to evaluate the toxicity of SAA, SAB, and SAC on ACE2 (angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2) high‐expressing HEK293T cells (ACE2(h) cells). We found that SAA, SAB, and SAC had a minor effect on the viability of ACE2(h) cells at concentrations below 100 μM. We further evaluated the binding capacity of SAA, SAB, and SAC to ACE2 and the spike protein of 2019‐nCoV using molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance. They could bind to the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) of the 2019‐nCoV with a binding constant (K (D)) of (3.82 ± 0.43) e−6 M, (5.15 ± 0.64)e−7 M, and (2.19 ± 0.14)e‐6 M; and bind to ACE2 with K (D) (4.08 ± 0.61)e−7 M, (2.95 ± 0.78)e−7 M, and (7.32 ± 0.42)e−7 M, respectively. As a result, SAA, SAB, and SAC were determined to inhibit the entry of 2019‐nCoV Spike pseudovirus with an EC(50) of 11.31, 6.22, and 10.14 μM on ACE2(h) cells, respectively. In conclusion, our study revealed that three Salvianolic acids can inhibit the entry of 2019‐nCoV spike pseudovirus into ACE2(h) cells by binding to the RBD of the 2019‐nCoV spike protein and ACE2 protein.","Hu, Shiling; Wang, Jue; Zhang, Yongjing; Bai, Haoyun; Wang, Cheng; Wang, Nan; He, Langchong",J Med Virol,71,28

We undertook an international consensus exercise to identify research priorities with the aim of understanding the long-term effects of acute COVID-19, with a focus on people with pre-existing airways disease and the occurrence of new-onset airways disease and associated symptoms. 202 international experts were invited to submit a minimum of three research ideas. After a two-phase internal review process, a final list of 98 research topics was scored by 48 experts. Patients with pre-existing or post-COVID-19 airways disease contributed to the exercise by weighting selected criteria. The highest-ranked research idea focused on investigation of the relationship between prognostic scores at hospital admission and morbidity at 3 months and 12 months after hospital discharge in patients with and without pre-existing airways disease. High priority was also assigned to comparisons of the prevalence and severity of post-COVID-19 fatigue, sarcopenia, anxiety, depression, and risk of future cardiovascular complications in patients with and without pre-existing airways disease. Our approach has enabled development of a set of priorities that could inform future research studies and funding decisions. This prioritisation process could also be adapted to other, non-respiratory aspects of long COVID.","Adeloye, Davies; Elneima, Omer; Daines, Luke; Poinasamy, Krisnah; Quint, Jennifer K; Walker, Samantha; Brightling, Chris E; Siddiqui, Salman; Hurst, John R; Chalmers, James D; Pfeffer, Paul E; Novotny, Petr; Drake, Thomas M; Heaney, Liam G; Rudan, Igor; Sheikh, Aziz; De Soyza, Anthony",Lancet Respir Med,71,1
