224,224,224,Antiviral resistance during pandemic influenza: implications for stockpiling and drug use,14.372412,11.408199,2009-01-22,"BACKGROUND: The anticipated extent of antiviral use during an influenza pandemic can have adverse consequences for the development of drug resistance and rationing of limited stockpiles. The strategic use of drugs is therefore a major public health concern in planning for effective pandemic responses. METHODS: We employed a mathematical model that includes both sensitive and resistant strains of a virus with pandemic potential, and applies antiviral drugs for treatment of clinical infections. Using estimated parameters in the published literature, the model was simulated for various sizes of stockpiles to evaluate the outcome of different antiviral strategies. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the emergence of highly transmissible resistant strains has no significant impact on the use of available stockpiles if treatment is maintained at low levels or the reproduction number of the sensitive strain is sufficiently high. However, moderate to high treatment levels can result in a more rapid depletion of stockpiles, leading to run-out, by promoting wide-spread drug resistance. We applied an antiviral strategy that delays the onset of aggressive treatment for a certain amount of time after the onset of the outbreak. Our results show that if high treatment levels are enforced too early during the outbreak, a second wave of infections can potentially occur with a substantially larger magnitude. However, a timely implementation of wide-scale treatment can prevent resistance spread in the population, and minimize the final size of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that conservative treatment levels during the early stages of the outbreak, followed by a timely increase in the scale of drug-use, will offer an effective strategy to manage drug resistance in the population and avoid run-out. For a 1918-like strain, the findings suggest that pandemic plans should consider stockpiling antiviral drugs to cover at least 20% of the population.","Arino, Julien; Bowman, Christopher S; Moghadas, Seyed M",BMC Infect Dis,115,3
801,801,801,Finding and removing highly connected individuals using suboptimal vaccines,14.333524,11.474277,2012-03-03,"BACKGROUND: Social networks are often highly skewed, meaning that the vast majority of the population has only few contacts whereas a small minority has a large number of contacts. These highly connected individuals may play an important role in case of an infectious disease outbreak. METHODS: We propose a novel strategy of finding and immunizing highly connected individuals and evaluate this strategy by computer simulations, using a stochastic, individual-and network-based simulation approach. A small random sample of the population is asked to list their acquaintances, and those who are mentioned most frequently are offered vaccination. This intervention is combined with case isolation and contact tracing. RESULTS: Asking only 10% of the population for 10 acquaintances each and vaccinating the most frequently named people strongly diminishes the magnitude of an outbreak which would otherwise have exhausted the available isolation units and gone out of control. It is extremely important to immunize all identified highly connected individuals. Omitting a few of them because of unsuccessful vaccination jeopardizes the overall success, unless non-immunized individuals are taken under surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: The strategy proposed in this paper is particularly successful because it attacks the very point from which the transmission network draws its strength: the highly connected individuals. Current preparedness and containment plans for smallpox and other infectious diseases may benefit from such knowledge.","Vidondo, Beatriz; Schwehm, Markus; Bühlmann, Andrea; Eichner, Martin",BMC Infect Dis,115,3
1023,1023,1023,"Leave entitlements, time off work and the household financial impacts of quarantine compliance during an H1N1 outbreak",14.27318,11.688268,2012-11-20,"BACKGROUND: The Australian state of Victoria, with 5.2 million residents, enforced home quarantine during a H1N1 pandemic in 2009. The strategy was targeted at school children. The objective of this study was to investigate the extent to which parents’ access to paid sick leave or paid carer’s leave was associated with (a) time taken off work to care for quarantined children, (b) household finances, and (c) compliance with quarantine recommendations. METHODS: We conducted an online and telephone survey of households recruited through 33 schools (85% of eligible schools), received 314 responses (27%), and analysed the subsample of 133 households in which all resident parents were employed. RESULTS: In 52% of households, parents took time off work to care for quarantined children. Households in which no resident parent had access to leave appeared to be less likely to take time off work (42% vs 58%, p=0.08) although this difference had only borderline significance. Among parents who did take time off work, those in households without access to leave were more likely to lose pay (73% vs 21%, p<0.001). Of the 26 households in which a parent lost pay due to taking time off work, 42% experienced further financial consequences such as being unable to pay a bill. Access to leave did not predict compliance with quarantine recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Future pandemic plans should consider the economic costs borne by households and options for compensating quarantined families for income losses.","Kavanagh, Anne M; Mason, Kate E; Bentley, Rebecca J; Studdert, David M; McVernon, Jodie; Fielding, James E; Petrony, Sylvia; Gurrin, Lyle; LaMontagne, Anthony D",BMC Infect Dis,115,3

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common pathogen isolated from patients with pneumonia and respiratory tract infections during Hajj. There is a significant burden of pneumococcal disease in India, which can be prevented. Guidelines for preventive measures and adult immunization have been published in India, but the implementation of the guidelines is low. Data from Bangladesh are available about significant mortality due to respiratory infections; however, literature regarding guidelines for adult immunization is limited. There is a need for extensive awareness programs across India and Bangladesh. Hence, there was a general consensus about the necessity for a rapid and urgent implementation of measures to prevent respiratory infections in pilgrims traveling to Hajj. About ten countries have developed recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination in Hajj pilgrims: France, the USA, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE (Dubai Health Authority), Singapore, Malaysia, Egypt, and Indonesia. At any given point whether it is Hajj or Umrah, more than a million people are present in the holy places of Mecca and Madina. Therefore, the preventive measures taken for Hajj apply for Umrah as well. This document puts forward the consensus recommendations by a group of twenty doctors following a closed-door discussion based on the scientific evidence available for India and Bangladesh regarding the prevention of respiratory tract infections in Hajj pilgrims.","Mathai, Dilip; Shamsuzzaman, Abul Khair Mohammad; Feroz, Ahrar Ahmed; Virani, Amin R; Hasan, Ashfaq; Ravi Kumar, KL; Ansari, Khalid; Forhad Hossain, Khandaker ATM; Marda, Mahesh; Wahab Zubair, MA; Ali, Mohammed Mukarram; Ashraf, N; Basha, Riyaz; Mirza, Shaeq; Ahmed, Shafeeq; Akhtar, Shamim; Ashraf, Syed Mustafa; Haque, Zahirul",J Glob Infect Dis,115,3

Analytic approaches have included expert review of case-only results, case–control logistic regression, latent class analysis, and attributable fraction, but each has serious limitations and none naturally integrate multiple test results. The Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study required an analytic solution appropriate for a case–control design that could incorporate evidence from multiple specimens from cases and controls and that accounted for measurement error. We describe a Bayesian integrated approach we developed that combined and extended elements of attributable fraction and latent class analyses to meet some of these challenges and illustrate the advantage it confers regarding the challenges identified for other methods.","Deloria Knoll, Maria; Fu, Wei; Shi, Qiyuan; Prosperi, Christine; Wu, Zhenke; Hammitt, Laura L.; Feikin, Daniel R.; Baggett, Henry C.; Howie, Stephen R.C.; Scott, J.

Our study investigated the level of knowledge, perceptions, and media use regarding Ebola. METHODS: In December 2014, an online questionnaire was administered to the Dutch population (n = 526) and Health Care Workers (HCW) (n = 760). RESULTS: The mean knowledge score (range 0–15) of HCW (m = 13.3;SD = 1.4) was significantly higher than the general public (m = 10.8;SD = 2.0). No significant difference was found in perceived severity and susceptibility. Perceived fear of the general public (m = 2.5; SD = 0.8) was significantly higher than among HCW (m = 2.4; SD = 0.7). Respondents primarily used television to obtain information. CONCLUSIONS: While Ebola was perceived severe, it did not lead to excessive fear or perceived susceptibility for developing the disease. Nonetheless, our research showed that knowledge with respect to human-to-human transmission is low, while this is crucial to complying with preventive measures. Our study reveals priorities for improving risk communication.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year- old patient started presenting a prodromic period with fever, dyspnea, cough and head ache. This clinical presentation was followed by a rapid respiratory, hemodynamic and renal failure leading to admission in the ICU. Biological exams revealed an increased haematocrit level with a paradoxical low protein level. Echocardiographic and hemodynamic monitoring showed a normal left ventricular function with low filling pressures, an elevated extravascular lung water index and pulmonary vascular permeability index. These findings were compatible with a capillary leak-syndrome (CLS). CONCLUSIONS: The severity of HPS caused by the virus Maripa in French Guiana can be explained by the tropism of hantavirus for the microvascular endothelial cell leading to a CLS.","Kallel, Hatem; Matheus, Séverine; Mayence, Claire; Houcke, Stéphanie; Mathien, Cyrille; Lavergne, Anne; Hommel, Didier",BMC Infect Dis,115,3

The development and commercialization of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines illustrate how licensing practices of public research organizations can contribute to high prices of the resulting product and affect accessibility to vulnerable populations. Efforts by the international community to improve access to medicines have recognised this issue and promote the public health-sensitive management of research conducted by public research organizations. This paper explores: how medical knowledge is exchanged between public and private actors; what role inventor scientists play in this process; and how they view the implementation of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies. METHODS: We conducted a systematic qualitative literature review on medical knowledge exchange and qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of public sector scientists working on HPV vaccines. We explored the strategies by which knowledge is exchanged across institutional boundaries, how these strategies are negotiated, and the views of scientists regarding public health-sensitive knowledge exchange. RESULTS: We included 13 studies in the systematic review and conducted seven semi-structured interviews with high-ranking scientists. The main avenues of public-private medical knowledge exchange were publications, formal transfer of patented knowledge, problem-specific exchanges such as service agreements, informal exchanges and collaborative research. Scientists played a crucial role in these processes but appeared to be sceptical of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies, as these were believed to deter corporate interest in the development of new medicines and thus risk the translation of the scientists’ research. CONCLUSION: Medical scientists at public research institutions play a key role in the exchange of knowledge they generate and are concerned about the accessibility of medicines resulting from their research. Their scepticism towards implementing public health-sensitive knowledge management strategies appears to be based on a biased understanding of the costs and risks involved in drug development and a perceived lack of alternatives to private engagement. Scientists could be encouraged to exchange knowledge in a public health-sensitive manner through not-for-profit drug development mechanisms, education on industry engagement, and stronger institutional and legal backing.","Jahn, Rosa; Müller, Olaf; Nöst, Stefan; Bozorgmehr, Kayvan",Global Health,115,3
6474,6474,6474,Candidemia in immunocompromised and immunocompetent critically ill patients: a prospective comparative study,14.3093,11.425399,2007-05-25,"Seasonal influenza can be a self-limiting illness in healthy individuals but is associated with short-term morbidity and economic burden. Influenza can cause significant morbidity and mortality in young children, the elderly, pregnant and post-partum women, patients with co-morbidities and the immunocompromised. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are the treatment of choice for influenza due to widespread resistance to the adamantanes. NAIs are efficacious for the treatment of influenza in ambulatory patients with mild illness, when initiated within 48 h of symptom onset. Early treatment with NAIs has been shown to reduce otitis media in children, and lower respiratory tract complications, resulting in antibiotic therapy, in adults. Evidence on the efficacy of NAIs for the prevention of influenza-related complications in at-risk populations, based on reviews of data from randomised trials is inconclusive. However, observational studies suggest that in hospitalised patients early treatment with NAIs has been associated with reduced mortality. NAIs should be initiated as soon as possible in patients at high-risk of influenza-related complications, with suspected or proven influenza, hospitalised patients and patients with severe or progressive disease. NAIs can be considered in previously healthy patients when therapy can be initiated within 48 h of symptom onset. In previously healthy patients, the therapeutic efficacy of oseltamivir is time-dependent, with maximal benefit observed when therapy is initiated within 48 h of symptom onset. However, several observational studies suggest therapeutic benefit beyond 48 h, in hospitalised patients, severe disease, and patients at high risk of complications, including pregnant women. NAIs should be considered in patients at high risk of influenza-related complications who present late. Further studies are needed to define the optimal timing of NAIs. Oseltamivir-resistant virus has been widely reported but is predominantly an issue in H1N1 seasonal influenza. Zanamivir-resistant influenza virus is rare, and inhaled or intravenous (IV) zanamivir is the treatment of choice in proven or suspected oseltamivir-resistant virus. Intubated patients with severe influenza can be treated with oseltamivir (suspension) administered via nasogastric tube. The commercial dry powder formulation of zanamivir should not be administered, via nebulisation, as it has been associated with ventilator malfunction and mortality. In intubated patients, when there are concerns about gastric absorption, IV zanamivir should be obtained under Emergency Investigational New Drug access schemes. Currently available evidence does not support the use of high-dose or extended-duration oseltamivir in patients with severe influenza, but does require further investigation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has not been shown to be superior to conventional management in patients with influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome and should be considered as salvage therapy. Corticosteriods should not be used in the treatment of severe influenza as this has been associated with increased risk of mortality and bacterial superinfection.","Rowe, Emily; Ng, Pei Yi; Chandra, Thiaghu; Chen, Mark; Leo, Yee-Sin",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,115,3

Significant efforts have been made to develop novel vaccines and therapeutics; however, the interaction of NDV with the host is not yet fully understood. Interferons (IFNs), an integral component of innate immune signaling, act as the first line of defense against invading viruses. Compared with the mammalian repertoire of IFNs, limited information is available on the antiviral potential of IFNs in chickens. Here, we expressed chicken IFN-γ (chIFN-γ) using a baculovirus expression vector system, characterized its antiviral potential against NDV, and determined its antiviral potential. Priming of chicken embryo fibroblasts with chIFN-γ elicited an antiviral environment in primary cells, which was mainly due to interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). A genome-wide transcriptomics approach was used to elucidate the possible signaling pathways associated with IFN-γ-induced immune responses. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed significant induction of ISG-associated pathways, activated temporal expression of ISGs, antiviral mediators, and transcriptional regulators in a cascade of antiviral responses. Collectively, we found that IFN-γ significantly elicited an antiviral response against NDV infection. These data provide a foundation for chIFN-γ-mediated antiviral responses and underpin functional annotation of these important chIFN-γ-induced antiviral influencers.","Yang, Xin; Arslan, Mehboob; Liu, Xingjian; Song, Haozhi; Du, Mengtan; Li, Yinü; Zhang, Zhifang",Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),115,3

New knowledge from today's West African epidemic allows a more accurate assessment of whether Ebola may have caused the Athenian outbreak than was once possible. The Athenian disease, whose etiology remains unknown, developed abruptly with fevers, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and hemorrhage. It originated in sub-Saharan Africa and was especially contagious to doctors and caregivers. No remedies were effective. But the few survivors who were reexposed to diseased patients were not attacked a second time, suggesting protective immunity. What lessons can we learn from the ancient outbreak that bears a clinical and epidemiologic resemblance to Ebola? The historian Thucydides, an eyewitness and disease sufferer, described how the unsuspecting city panicked as it struggled to handle the rapidly spreading, devastating disease. Moreover, he stressed a theme that has relevance today—namely, that fear and panic intensified the disruption of society and damage to the individual that was directly caused by the disease. Moreover, fear amplified the spread of disease. The destructive nature of fear has remained a signature feature of pestilences that have subsequently caught ill-prepared societies off-guard—Bubonic plague in medieval times, AIDS in the 1980s, and Ebola today. The ancient Athenian epidemic is relevant for today's West African Ebola outbreak because it shows how fear and panic can endanger the individual, our society, and our efforts to handle the disease.","Kazanjian, Powel",Clin Infect Dis,115,3

Previous studies in a number of fungal species have identified the requirement of several signaling pathways for anastomosis, including the so far best characterized soft (So) gene, and the MAPK pathway components MAK-1 and MAK-2 of Neurospora crassa. Despite the observations of hyphal fusions’ involvement in pathogenicity and host adhesion, the connection between cell fusion and fungal lifestyles is still unclear. Here, we address the role of anastomosis in fungal development and asexual reproduction in Zymoseptoria tritici, the most important fungal pathogen of wheat in Europe. RESULTS: We show that Z. tritici undergoes self-fusion between distinct cellular structures, and its mechanism is dependent on the initial cell density. Contrary to other fungi, cell fusion in Z. tritici only resulted in cytoplasmic mixing but not in multinucleated cell formation. The deletion of the So orthologous ZtSof1 disrupted cell-to-cell communication affecting both hyphal and germling fusion. We show that Z. tritici mutants for MAPK-encoding ZtSlt2 (orthologous to MAK-1) and ZtFus3 (orthologous to MAK-2) genes also failed to undergo anastomosis, demonstrating the functional conservation of this signaling mechanism across species. Additionally, the ΔZtSof1 mutant was severely impaired in melanization, suggesting that the So gene function is related to melanization. Finally, we demonstrated that anastomosis is dispensable for pathogenicity, but essential for the pycnidium development, and its absence abolishes the asexual reproduction of Z. tritici. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the role for ZtSof1, ZtSlt2, and ZtFus3 in cell fusions of Z. tritici. Cell fusions are essential for different aspects of the Z. tritici biology, and the ZtSof1 gene is a potential target to control septoria tritici blotch (STB) disease.","Francisco, Carolina Sardinha; Zwyssig, Maria Manuela; Palma-Guerrero, Javier",BMC Biol,115,3

The underlying mechanism of the anti-pneumococcal activity of this inhibitor remains unknown. Therefore, we tried to find the anti-pneumococcal mechanism of APDQ230122, one of the APDQ derivatives active against S. pneumoniae. We performed transcriptomic analysis (RNA-Seq) and proteomic analysis (LC–MS/MS analysis) to get differentially expressed genes (DEG) and differentially expressed proteins (DEP) of S. pneumoniae 521 treated with sub-inhibitory concentrations of APDQ230122 and elucidated the comprehensive expression changes of genes and proteins using multi-omics analysis. As a result, genes or proteins of peptidoglycan biosynthesis and DNA replication were significantly down-regulated. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that the structure of peptidoglycan was damaged by APDQ230122 in a chemical concentration-dependent manner.

We have previously shown that classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infection induces ERS-mediated autophagy for maintaining viral replication both in vivo and in vitro, however, the underlying mechanism remains unclarified. Here we found that CSFV infection activates the PERK pathway-dependent complete autophagy to promote viral replication in cultured PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells. Likewise, our results also suggested the essential roles of the IRE1/GRP78-mediated complete autophagy in CSFV replication in vitro. Furthermore, we suggested that CSFV infection induces activation of the PERK and IRE1 pathway for potential immunoregulation via promoting transcription of proinflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ and TNF-α) genes in the CSFV-infected cells. Finally, pharmacological treatment of PERK- or IRE1-pathway regulators, and the corresponding SiRNAs interventions did not affect the viabilities of the cells, excluding the potential interference elicited by altered cell viabilities. Taken together, our results suggest that CSFV infection induces complete autophagy through activation of the PERK and IRE1 pathway to facilitate viral replication in cultured cells, and modulation of proinflammatory cytokines may be a potential mechanism involved in this event. Our findings will open new horizons for molecular mechanisms of sustainable replication and pathogenesis of CSFV, and lay a theoretical foundation for the development of ERS-autophagy-targeting therapeutic strategies for clinical control of CSF.","Zhu, Erpeng; Wu, Huawei; Chen, Wenxian; Qin, Yuwei; Liu, Jiameng; Fan, Shuangqi; Ma, Shengming; Wu, Keke; Mao, Qian; Luo, Chaowei; Qin, Yixian; Yi, Lin; Ding, Hongxing; Zhao, Mingqiu; Chen, Jinding",,115,3

Levosimendan is an effective inotropic agent used to maintain cardiac output, but its usage is limited by the lack of evidence in patients with severely abnormal renal function. Therefore, we analyzed data of patients with acute heart failure with and without abnormal renal function to examine the effects of levosimendan. METHODS: We performed this retrospective cohort study using data from the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD) of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). Patients admitted for heart failure with LVEF ≤ 40% between January 2013 and December 2018 who received levosimendan or dobutamine in the critical cardiac care units (CCU) were identified. Patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were excluded. Outcomes of interest were mortality at 30, 90, and 180 days after the cohort entry date. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mortality rate at 30, 90, and 180 days after the cohort entry date between the levosimendan and dobutamine groups, or between subgroups of patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or on dialysis. The results were consistent before and after propensity score matching. CONCLUSIONS: Levosimendan did not increase short- or long-term mortality rates in critical patients with acute heart failure and reduced ejection fraction compared to dobutamine, regardless of their renal function. An eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was not necessarily considered a contraindication for levosimendan in these patients.","Chan, Cze-Ci; Lee, Kuang-Tso; Ho, Wan-Jing; Chan, Yi-Hsin; Chu, Pao-Hsien",Ann Intensive Care,115,3

This study aimed to assess the association between the cause of preterm birth and LOS in very preterm infants. METHODS: 2052 very preterm singletons from a national population-based cohort study alive at 72 h of life were included. Survival without LOS was compared by cause of preterm birth using survival analysis and Cox regression models. RESULTS: 437 (20.1%) had at least one episode of LOS. The frequency of LOS varied by cause of preterm birth: 17.1% for infants born after preterm labor, 17.9% after preterm premature rupture of membranes, 20.3% after a placental abruption, 20.3% after isolated hypertensive disorders, 27.5% after hypertensive disorders with fetal growth restriction (FGR), and 29.4% after isolated FGR. In multivariate analysis, when compared to infants born after preterm labor, the risk remained higher for infants born after hypertensive disorders (hazard ratio HR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2–2.5), hypertensive disorders with FGR (HR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.9–3.6) and isolated FGR (HR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.9–4.4). CONCLUSION: Very preterm infants born after hypertensive disorders or born after FGR had an increased risk of LOS compared to those born after preterm labor. IMPACT: Late-onset sepsis risk differs according to the cause of preterm birth. Compared with those born after preterm labor, infants born very preterm because of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and/or fetal growth restriction display an increased risk for late-onset sepsis. Antenatal factors, in particular the full spectrum of causes leading to preterm birth, should be taken into consideration to better prevent and manage neonatal infectious morbidity and inform the parents.","Letouzey, Mathilde; Foix-L’Hélias, Laurence; Torchin, Héloïse; Mitha, Ayoub; Morgan, Andrei S.; Zeitlin, Jennifer; Kayem, Gilles; Maisonneuve, Emeline; Delorme, Pierre; Khoshnood, Babak; Kaminski, Monique; Ancel, Pierre-Yves; Boileau, Pascal; Lorthe, Elsa",Pediatr Res,115,3

No literature data are available on long-term KL-6 measurements in the follow-up of IPF patients treated with Nintedanib. The aim of this study is to serially analyze KL-6 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients after 24 months of Nintedanib and to investigate its biomarker potential in patients with IPF and lung cancer with respect to fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis patients, pulmonary fibrosis associated with autoimmune diseases group and healthy controls. ABSTRACT: Background: Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) was suggested as ILD biomarker including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Lung cancer is one of the most severe comorbidity of IPF patients. This study aims to serially analyze KL-6 in IPF patients after 24 months of Nintedanib and to first investigate the biomarker behavior in IPF associated with adenocarcinoma. Materials and methods: One hundred and forty-two ILD patients (median (IQR), 69 (63–75) years; 86 males) were retrospectively enrolled. Serial serum samples were collected from IPF patients before starting antifibrotic therapy and after 12 months. Serum KL-6 levels were measured by KL-6 reagent assay (Fujirebio Europe, UK). Results: Increased KL-6 concentrations were identified in IPF-LC patients than IPF, fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pulmonary fibrosis associated with autoimmune disease groups. A cut-off value was calculated to distinguish IPF and IPF-LC patients. IPF patients monitored for 24 months with Nintedanib showed persisted increased levels of KL-6 with a progressive decline of FVC percentages. Conclusion: This preliminary study offers a first demonstration that very high serum concentrations of KL-6 in IPF-LC patients are associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, serial evaluation of serum KL-6 in IPF patients over 24 months of Nintedanib treatment revealed that most patients experienced a stabilization of lung function parameters and of serum concentrations of KL-6.","d’Alessandro, Miriana; Bergantini, Laura; Cameli, Paolo; Pieroni, Maria; Refini, Rosa Metella; Sestini, Piersante; Bargagli, Elena",Cancers (Basel),115,3

To identify risk factors for measles death, we conducted a case-control study among infants and children hospitalized for measles. METHODS: National surveillance data were used to identify hospitalized cases of laboratory-confirmed or epidemiologically linked measles in infants and children aged < 59 months with rash onset from January 2016 to July 2018. We abstracted medical records of 50 fatal cases (“cases”) and 250 non-fatal cases (“controls”) matched by age, sex, district of residence, and urban/rural place of residence. We calculated univariable and multivariable matched odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk factors. RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of case-patients and controls had not received a valid dose of a measles-containing vaccine; only 5 % received Vitamin A supplementation once diagnosed with measles. In the univariable analysis, cases were more likely than controls to have had a healthcare-related exposure to measles manifesting as inpatient admission for pneumonia during the 7 to 21 day measles incubation period (OR: 3.0; 95% CI [1.2, 7.2]), to have had a history of malnutrition (OR: 3.4; 95% CI [1.1, 9.9]), and to have had pneumonia as a complication of measles (OR:7.1; 95% CI [2.0–24.8]). In the multivariable analysis, pneumonia as a measles complication remained a risk for death (OR: 7.1; 95% CI [1.4–35.3]). CONCLUSIONS: Implementing infection prevention and control practices, ensuring immunization of healthcare workers, and hospitalizing only severe measles cases may minimize the risk of nosocomial measles transmission. Implementing World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for Vitamin A supplementation, improving immunization of children to prevent influenza, pneumococcal, and other bacterial respiratory diseases may decrease complications and deaths due to measles in Romania.

During the initial epidemic and in places where ZIKV is now considered endemic, it is difficult to disentangle the risks and contributions of sexual versus vector-borne transmission to adverse pregnancy outcomes. To examine the potential impact of sexual transmission of ZIKV on pregnancy outcome, we challenged three rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) three times intravaginally with 1 x 10(7) PFU of a low passage, African lineage ZIKV isolate (ZIKV-DAK) in the first trimester (~30 days gestational age). Samples were collected from all animals initially on days 3 through 10 post challenge, followed by twice, and then once weekly sample collection; ultrasound examinations were performed every 3-4 days then weekly as pregnancies progressed. All three dams had ZIKV RNA detectable in plasma on day 3 post-ZIKV challenge. At approximately 45 days gestation (17-18 days post-challenge), two of the three dams were found with nonviable embryos by ultrasound. Viral RNA was detected in recovered tissues and at the maternal-fetal interface (MFI) in both cases. The remaining viable pregnancy proceeded to near term (~155 days gestational age) and ZIKV RNA was detected at the MFI but not in fetal tissues. These results suggest that sexual transmission of ZIKV may represent an underappreciated risk of pregnancy loss during early gestation.","Newman, Christina M.; Tarantal, Alice F.; Martinez, Michele L.; Simmons, Heather A.; Morgan, Terry K.; Zeng, Xiankun; Rosinski, Jenna R.; Bliss, Mason I.; Bohm, Ellie K.; Dudley, Dawn M.; Aliota, Matthew T.; Friedrich, Thomas C.; Miller, Christopher J.; O’Connor, David H.",Front Immunol,115,0

METHOD: The TCMSP, TCMID and STITCH databases were used to screen the active ingredients and targets in the compound Xuanju capsule; the OMIM, TTD, PharmGKB and GeneCards databases were applied to screen the RA-related disease targets. Then, the obtained targets were imported into Cytoscape 3.7.1 software to construct the active ingredient-target network and the RA-related disease-target network. The active ingredient-target PPI network, the RA-related disease-target PPI network and the common target PPI network were built by using the STRING platform and Cytoscape 3.7.1 software. The GO and KEGG analyses of the common targets were analyzed by using the Metascape and Bioinformatics online tools. RESULTS: A total of 51 active ingredients and 513 corresponding ingredient targets were harvested from the compound Xuanju capsule; 641 RA-related disease targets were obtained. After two PPI networks were constructed and merged, 116 RA-related targets of compound Xuanju capsules were identified and analyzed. 116 RA-related targets of compound Xuanju capsules are mainly involved in the biological processes and molecular functions, such as the cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, the response to lipopolysaccharide and the blood vascular development, the cytokine activity, the cytokine receptor binding and the receptor regulator activity. Furthermore, 116 RA-related targets of compound Xuanju capsules are concentrated in signaling pathways such as the IL-17, TNF, Th17 cell differentiation, Toll receptor and RA signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: The compound Xuanju capsule had the action characteristics of multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways in the treatment of RA, which might primarily reduce the release of proinflammatory factors (such as IL-6 and TNF-α) and increase the production of anti-inflammatory factors (such as IL-10) by regulating inflammation-related signaling pathways (such as IL-17), thereby alleviating the inflammatory damage and improving the bone tissue repair.","Wei, Wenyang; Lu, Wanpeng; Chen, Xiaolong; Yang, Yunfeng; Zheng, Mengkai",Biomed Res Int,115,3

People with mental or neurodevelopmental disorders typically have cognitive limitations, including affected time management, which might lead to poor occupational balance, low self-efficacy, and poor parental sense of competence. “Let’s Get Organized” (LGO) is a recently developed manual-based group intervention to train time management skills. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficiency of the Swedish version of LGO (LGO-S) compared to treatment as usual (individual occupational therapy) to improve time management for adults with impaired time management skills due to mental or neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, to evaluate if the intervention is a cost-effective way to improve the quality of life and time management skills of these individuals, we will conduct a health economic evaluation. METHODS: The trial will have a multi-centre, open, parallel randomised controlled design. A total of 104 adults with cognitive limitations due to mental or neurodevelopmental disorders will be recruited from open psychiatric or habilitation care units. Outcomes will be measured before and after a 10-week intervention, with a follow-up 3 months after completing the intervention. The primary outcome will be self-assessed time management skills. Secondary outcomes will be e.g. self-assessed skills in organisation and planning, regulation of emotions, satisfaction with daily occupations, occupational balance, self-efficacy, and quality-adjusted life years. DISCUSSION: A recent feasibility study has shown promising results for LGO-S, and a randomised trial will provide robust evidence for the possible efficacy of LGO-S in comparison to treatment as usual.

It is well known that melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) and melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) are key regulators of appetite and energy homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the GPCR partners of MC3R and MC4R are not well understood. Our objective is to analyze single cell RNA-seq datasets of the hypothalamus to explore and identify novel GPCR partners of MC3R and MC4R and examine the pharmacological effect on the downstream signal transduction and membrane translocation of melanocortin receptors. METHODS: We conducted an integrative analysis of multiple single cell RNA-seq datasets to reveal the expression pattern and correlation of GPCR families in the mouse hypothalamus. The emerging GPCRs with important metabolic functions were selected for cloning and co-immunoprecipitation validation. The positive GPCR partners were then tested for the pharmacological activation, competitive binding assay and surface translocation ELISA experiments. RESULTS: Based on the expression pattern of GPCRs and their function enrichment results, we narrowed down the range of potential GPCR interaction with MC3R and MC4R for further confirmation. Co-immunoprecipitation assay verified 23 and 32 novel GPCR partners that interacted with MC3R and MC4R in vitro. The presence of these GPCR partners exhibited different effects in the physiological regulation and signal transduction of MC3R and MC4R. CONCLUSIONS: This work represented the first large-scale screen for the functional GPCR complex of central melanocortin receptors and defined a composite metabolic regulatory GPCR network of the hypothalamic nucleuses.","Li, Yunpeng; Wang, Xiaozhu; Lu, Liumei; Wang, Meng; Zhai, Yue; Tai, Xiaolu; Dilimulati, Diliqingna; Lei, Xiaowei; Xu, Jing; Zhang, Cong; Fu, Yanbin; Qu, Shen; Li, Qingfeng; Zhang, Chao",Mol Metab,115,1

Although many consequences of complement activation during viral infection are well established, mechanisms that determine the extent to which viruses activate complement remain elusive. Here, we investigate complement activation by human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a filamentous respiratory pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality. By engineering a strain of RSV harboring tags on the surface glycoproteins F and G, we are able to monitor opsonization of single RSV particles using fluorescence microscopy. These experiments reveal an antigenic hierarchy, where antibodies that bind toward the apex of F in either the pre- or postfusion conformation activate the classical pathway whereas other antibodies do not. Additionally, we identify an important role for virus morphology in complement activation: as viral filaments age, they undergo a morphological transformation which lowers the threshold for complement deposition through changes in surface curvature. Collectively, these results identify antigenic and biophysical characteristics of virus particles that contribute to the formation of viral immune complexes, and suggest models for how these factors may shape disease severity and adaptive immune responses to RSV.","Kuppan, Jessica P; Mitrovich, Margaret D; Vahey, Michael D",,115,1

Rapid diagnostic testing methods can alleviate some of these challenges by providing definitive diagnoses earlier in the clinical course, leading to appropriate targeted therapy, cost savings, and improved patient outcomes. The BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 plus (RP2plus; bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) is a multiplexed nucleic acid test for detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and 14 common viral and 4 bacterial respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from those meeting MERS-CoV epidemiological criteria. The aim of this study was to verify the FilmArray RP2plus for use in our biocontainment unit. Of note, the RP2plus is FDA approved but not currently available for sale in the United States. Eight patient samples were tested with known results (GenMark Respiratory Virus Panel [RVP] or Cepheid Xpert Flu/RSV). We had concordant results between the platforms for samples containing influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 2, rhinovirus, and a negative sample. We evaluated two influenza B samples from two different patients. The FilmArray RP2plus did not detect influenza B in one of the patient samples. The sample was exhausted and repeat testing could not be performed. A second rhinovirus sample was not detected by the RP2plus, but Coronavirus 229E was detected in this sample, a virus not detected by the RVP. The sample was repeated and again did not detect rhinovirus. Further investigation into this discrepancy revealed that rhinovirus was originally detected by RVP at a signal of 34.4 nA (repeat of 46.9 nA). The concordant rhinovirus sample had a signal of 226.7 nA by RVP, which was much higher than the discrepant sample. Because of the low signal by RVP in the discrepant sample, perhaps the viral load was below the limit of detection of the RP2plus. All other quality control sample pools passed verification testing, including day-to-day and operator variance. It is not uncommon for a person under investigation (PUI) for a highly communicable disease to be evaluated in our facility. The performance of the RP2plus test on clinical samples showed acceptable concordance with our current means of testing for respiratory pathogens. The RP2plus will eliminate challenges implicated in storing and transporting specimens to an off-site lab, facilitate quicker turnaround time, and streamline the often cumbersome, complex protocols and practices required to work up a serious communicable disease.","Dean, Christina L; Alvey, Emily; Evans, Crystal; Hill, Charles; Burd, Eileen; Kraft, Colleen",Am J Clin Pathol,115,3

This area is constantly in contact with the ambient air and is therefore vulnerable to contamination with airborne microbes and particles of respirable size. Due to the configuration of the respiratory tract, airborne particles having diameters in the range of 0.5-2.0 μ can reach and deposit in the terminal part of the tracheobronchial tree - most bacteria are of this size. In reality, very few bacteria cause infections by spreading via the airborne route (e.g., mycobacteria, viruses, and legionella). Most bacteria cause pneumonia by first colonizing the upper respiratory tract and later descending into the tracheobronchial tree.","Hasan, Ashfaq",Understanding Mechanical Ventilation,115,3

However, SS also affects many extraglandular systems. In SS patients, the pattern of extraglandular manifestations may have a close similarity with the vasculitic features seen in SLE patients that are mediated by immune complexes and complement. However, SS patients also have an increased frequency of lymphocytic infiltration into extraglandular tissues, as might be expected by their increased frequency of lymphoma in comparison to SLE patients. For example, SS patients need to be evaluated for interstitial nephritis (in contrast to the glomerulonephritis of SLE) or interstitial pneumonitis (in comparison to pleurisy of SLE). This chapter will focus on the clinical extraglandular manifestations of primary SS that are not specifically covered in other chapters. These extraglandular manifestations have led to a recently introduced “disease activity” and “organ damage index.” The recognition of these extraglandular manifestations is important since they have prognostic and therapeutic implications. The differential diagnosis of these extraglandular manifestations includes overlapping features with other autoimmune diseases (particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, dermatomyositis, celiac sprue, and small- and medium-sized vessel vasculitis), infectious diseases that mimic autoimmune disease (particularly hepatitis C, HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis), and predisposition to drug toxicities that may involve extraglandular organs (particularly skin rashes, nephritis, pneumonitis, myositis, and hematopoietic abnormalities).","Fox, Robert I.",Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s Syndrome,115,3

Based on data collected from 141 experienced taxpayers in Taiwan, the acceptance and the impact of quality antecedents on taxpayers' perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) of the system were assessed and evaluated. The results indicated that the model of Internet tax-filing system was accepted with a reasonable goodness-of-fit. Three important findings include the following items. First, TAM proves to be a valid model to explain the taxpayers' acceptance of the Internet tax-filers' system. Meanwhile, PU has created more impact than PEOU on taxpayers' intention to use the system. Second, PU is positively influenced by such factors as information system quality (ISQ), information quality (IQ), as well as perceived credibility (PC). Third, IQ has a positive impact on PEOU. Based on the research findings, implications and limitations are then discussed for future possible research.","Chang, I-Chiu; Li, Yi-Chang; Hung, Won-Fu; Hwang, Hisn-Ginn",Gov Inf Q,115,3

Basically, they break the hydrogen bonding between the duplex helix and translocate unidirectionally along the bound strand. Mostly all the helicases contain some conserved signature motifs, which act as an engine to power the unwinding. After the discovery of the first prokaryotic DNA helicase from Escherichia coli bacteria in 1976 and the first eukaryotic one from the lily plant in 1978, many more (>100) have been isolated. All the helicases share some common properties, including nucleic acid binding, NTP hydrolysis and unwinding of the duplex. Many helicases have been crystallized and their structures have revealed an underlying common structural fold for their function. The defects in helicases gene have also been reported to be responsible for variety of human genetic disorders, which can lead to cancer, premature aging or mental retardation. Recently, a new role of a helicase in abiotic stress signaling in plant has been discovered. Overall, helicases act as essential molecular tools for cellular machinery and help in maintaining the integrity of genome. Here an overview of helicases has been covered which includes history, biochemical assay, properties, classification, role in human disease and mechanism of unwinding and translocation.","Tuteja, Narendra; Tuteja, Renu",Physica A,115,3

Due to their computational complexity, many reachability analysis methods are restricted to systems with relatively small dimensions. One significant reason for such limitation is that those approaches, and their implementations, are not designed to leverage parallelism. They use algorithms that are designed to run serially within one compute unit and they can not utilize widely-available high-performance computing (HPC) platforms such as many-core CPUs, GPUs and Cloud-computing services. This paper presents PIRK, a tool to efficiently compute reachable sets for general nonlinear systems of extremely high dimensions. PIRK can utilize HPC platforms for computing reachable sets for general high-dimensional non-linear systems. PIRK has been tested on several systems, with state dimensions up to 4 billion. The scalability of PIRK’s parallel implementations is found to be highly favorable.","Devonport, Alex; Khaled, Mahmoud; Arcak, Murat; Zamani, Majid",Computer Aided Verification,115,1

Although no significant difference in learning outcomes between traditional classroom and online learning has been identified, students are still likely to feel distracted or bored. Thoughtful pedagogical strategies and learning design are needed to avoid disengagement which could have negative impact on their academic performance. Regarding the forms of student interactivity or features of online environments, this study examines a motivational EdTech tool - Digital Exhibition Space (DES) - which provides explorative learning experiences for students to foster meaningful peer socialisation. DES creates a 3D visual learning community aimed at enhancing connectivity amongst students, and relatedness between students and their learning artefacts so as to leverage student engagement and learning effectiveness in online education. A quasi-experimental pilot study was undertaken in an entry level class of 106 undergraduates from all faculties of the university. Quantitative results revealed that 1) students in DES learning context reported a higher level of engagement than non-DES context; 2) academic performance in DES groups was better in synoptic assessment than non-DES groups while equivalent in factual knowledge tests.","Lin, Hanyuning; Pryor, Mathew",Blended Learning,115,3

ABSTRACT: The primary aim of this study was to determine how barley responds to two pests infesting separately or at once; thus barley was inoculated with Heterodera filipjevi (Madzhidov) Stelter (cereal cyst nematode; CCN) and Aceria tosichella Keifer (wheat curl mite; WCM). To verify hypothesis about the involvement of redox metabolism and photosynthesis in barley defence responses, biochemical, photosynthesis efficiency and chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements as well as transmission electron microscopy were implemented. Inoculation with WCM (apart from or with CCN) brought about a significant suppression in the efficiency of electron transport outside photosystem II reaction centres. This limitation was an effect of diminished pool of rapidly reducing plastoquinone and decreased total electron carriers. Infestation with WCM (apart from or with CCN) also significantly restricted the electron transport on the photosystem I acceptor side, therefore produced reactive oxygen species oxidized lipids in cells of WCM and double infested plants and proteins in cells of WCM-infested plants. The level of hydrogen peroxide was significantly decreased in double infested plants because of glutathione–ascorbate cycle involvement. The inhibition of nitrosoglutathione reductase promoted the accumulation of S-nitrosoglutathione increasing antioxidant capacity in cells of double infested plants. Moreover, enhanced arginase activity in WCM-infested plants could stimulate synthesis of polyamines participating in plant antioxidant response. Infestation with WCM (apart from or with CCN) significantly reduced the efficiency of carbon dioxide assimilation by barley leaves, whereas infection only with CCN expanded photosynthesis efficiency. These were accompanied with the ultrastructural changes in chloroplasts during CCN and WCM infestation.","Labudda, Mateusz; Tokarz, Krzysztof; Tokarz, Barbara; Muszyńska, Ewa; Gietler, Marta; Górecka, Mirosława; Różańska, Elżbieta; Rybarczyk-Płońska, Anna; Fidler, Justyna; Prabucka, Beata; Dababat, Abdelfattah A.; Lewandowski, Mariusz",Plant Cell Rep,115,3

To date, a causal model of children’s vicarious traumatization has not been empirically validated in the literature. This paper fills the gap in the literature by reporting on the direct effect of vicarious trauma on children independent of caregiving impairment. Data for the study came from the National Survey of Children’s Exposure to Violence I (NATSCEV I). This unique dataset features two indicators of vicarious trauma exposure: (1) family victimization and (2) community violence. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted in order to control for nuisance variables such as caregiver impairment, defined as the degree of warmth or hostility; time elapsed since the trauma occurred and the study taking place; and other trauma exposure (i.e. direct and witnessed trauma). As expected, the study found evidence of a direct and positive relationship between learning about the trauma of close friends and family and children’s trauma symptomatology. Both adolescents and young children were found to be vulnerable to experience vicarious traumatization, with gender and ethnicity being contributing factors. Chronological age was not found to be significant in children’s vicarious traumatization. These findings support the causal model of vicarious traumatization. They demonstrate that children may be traumatized by exposure to the trauma material of others above and beyond the influence of caregiver impairment. As such, attention should be given to interventions, practices, and policies that intervene in the lives of children exposed to violence.","Howard, Stephenie",J Child Adolesc Trauma,115,3

The UNGPs were developed on the basis of global multi-stakeholder consultations, underlining legitimacy through broad inclusion. There are varying judgements as to the success of this approach. The process towards the treaty follows the traditional path of negotiations at UN level. These negotiations reveal a struggle for recognition of the legitimacy of the process itself. Both procedures have shortcomings with regard to legitimacy and show the need for a revision concerning the inclusion of stakeholders.

The debate on the end of public space, which is ongoing as the privatization in the city rises, moves on to a new phase with the Covid-19 outbreak. Since the perception of public spaces will be a determinant factor in the future of the city, the question arises: How the perception and usage of the public, virtual public and pseudo-public spaces (particularly shopping malls) have been affected by the recent Covid-19 pandemic? The aim of this study is to examine the changing perception and usage of public and pseudo-public spaces during the Covid-19 outbreak in Istanbul, Turkey. Within this scope, an online survey was conducted with 337 participants living in Istanbul between the dates of 1–5 June 2020. With this survey, the change in perceptions and usage of these spaces based on personal, residential and district characteristics were investigated. The findings of the study revealed statistically significant differences between the perceptions and usage of public spaces and pseudo-public spaces before and after the Covid-19 outbreak in terms of personal, residential and district characteristics. According to survey results, there would be a significant decrease in the frequency of possible visits to public places. The outbreak reduces interest in virtual spaces as a leisure activity, but it also increases the interest in virtual spaces as a shopping and meeting/chat platform. In addition, it was determined that the demand for shopping centres and virtual platforms as both before-after-the-outbreak leisure activities decreased significantly as the amount of green space per capita increases. Besides, the diminishing reputations of pseudo-public spaces and the increasing importance of virtual public spaces may be observed from the survey results. The longer the outbreak, the greater its impact on the design and planning of public spaces and pseudo-public spaces. Rather than planning huge and crowded spaces such as big squares and huge malls, there is likely a shift toward planning a large number of small-scale public spaces within walking distance.","Paköz, Muhammed Ziya; Sözer, Cansu; Doğan, Ayşen",Urban Des Int,115,20

INTRODUCTION. Changes in the myocardium in patients with arterial hypertension (AH) can cause fatal arrhythmias. The effects of inflammation and drugs on the heart in COVID-19 pneumonia can also increase the risk of sudden arrhythmic death. The aim of the paper is to study interrelationship of ECG markers of malignant arrhythmias and clinical and laboratory findings in patients with AH and COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS. 48 patients with AH hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia (32 women aged 34 to 83, 16 men aged 48-80) were included in the study in October-November 2020. Exclusion criteria: congestive heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, reduced ejection fraction, valvular disease, life-threatening COVID-19 and other serious diseases. Main clinical characteristics and recommended laboratory findings were taken into account. Corrected QT and Tpeak-Tend were analyzed. RESULTS. The QTc fluctuations were from 353 ms to 494 ms. The QTc values were higher than normal in 28%. The QTc duration correlated with C-reactive protein level (Kendall R = 0.59) and NYHA class (Gamma = 0.48). The Tpeak-Tend value correlated with coronary heart disease (Gamma 0.65), C-reactive protein (Kendall R = 0.57) and taking dexamethasone (Gamma 0.44) and fluoroquinolones (Gamma 0.58). Multivariate analysis has showed that high level of C-reactive protein (Wald = 7.4) and the presence of heart failure (Wald = 5.2) were independent predictors of QTc increase. Coronary heart disease (Wald = 4,8) and taking respiratory fluoroquinolones (Wald= 3.7) were independent predictors of Tpeak-Tend increase. Age, SatO2, taking betablockers and other analyzed indicators were not significantly related to QTc and Tpeak-Tend. CONCLUSION. Systemic inflammatory response, heart diseases and taking respiratory fluoroquinolones can adversely affect the myocardial repolarization indicators associated with the risk of sudden death in patients with AH hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia.","Novitskiy, A; Popov, K; Smirnova, A; Shvarts, Y",Eur J Prev Cardiol,115,20

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Very few studies analyzed the gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptors and proteases, mainly focusing on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, resulting incomplete knowledge in different specimens from female genital tract. However, no studies have analyzed the potential impact of controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) protocols during ART procedure on the endometrial gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptors and proteases STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: To address this question, we retrospectively examined the gene expression profile of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptors and proteases in endometrial biopsies of a cohort of ART candidates using Affymetrix microarray data PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Human endometrial tissue under natural (n = 62) and COS cycles (n = 42) were analyzed. A focus was particularly made on the renin-angiotensin system relates genes with a prominent role in the virus infection, and gene expression levels of receptors and proteases closely related to SARS-CoV-2 infectionwas also studied. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Using our large cohort of endometrial samples, we reported a high prevalence of genes related to the ACE2 pathway, including AGT, AGTR1, ANPEP, CTSA, ENPEP, LNPEP, MME, NLN, THOP1, BSG and CTSL during both phases(early- and mid-secretory phase), and mainly during the mid-secretory phase for ACE2. The highest signal intensities were found for CTSA, LNPEP, MME, NLN, BSG and CTSL. The most representative of dual coexpression of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptor and protease in endometrium was BSG-CSTL and BSG-CTSA. It s also important to note high variation of SARS-CoV-2 receptors inter-patients under natural cycle.Globally, the impact of COS on endometrial gene expression profile of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptors and proteases of non Covid-19 patients is low, suggesting no additional potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection during stimulated ART procedure compared with natural cycles. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Analyses of Affymetrix microarray gene expression data were performed in non-COVID-19 patients. Whether the SARS-CoV-2 infection changes the endometrial gene expression profile of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptors and proteases is under investigation WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Specimens from female genital tract may be considered as potential targets for SARS-CoV-2.

The first research perspective, which has been established for some time, deals with technology-enhanced learning. It primarily examines learning processes and outcomes as a function of media characteristics and individual learner characteristics. This research tradition has produced numerous findings. However, the question of how to integrate digital media into the classroom in a way that is effective for learning is not considered here. This is where the second, more recent research perspective on technology-enhanced teaching comes in, which addresses teaching with digital media and the professional competencies of teachers required for this. Finally, the paper argues for combining both research perspectives, especially since they have relevant commonalities in their basic assumptions. Thus, in both research perspectives, digital media are analyzed less on the basis of surface features, but rather in terms of their functions for the promotion of learning and teaching processes.","Scheiter, Katharina",Z Erziehwiss,115,17

However, the prevalence of these prognostic factors is unknown in many countries. We aimed to describe the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors of severe COVID-19 at national and county level in Sweden. We calculated the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on records from the Swedish national health care and population registers for 3 years before 1st January 2016. 9,624,428 individuals were included in the study population. 22.1% had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). We show that one in five individuals in Sweden is at increased risk of severe COVID-19. When compared with the critical care capacity at a local and national level, these results can aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the current pandemic. Findings can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning.","Gémes, Katalin; Talbäck, Mats; Modig, Karin; Ahlbom, Anders; Berglund, Anita; Feychting, Maria; Matthews, Anthony A",European journal of epidemiology,115,5

We aimed to evaluate the effect of deepening levels of sedation induced by propofol and how they compare to natural sleep. METHODS Fifty consecutive neurologically normal patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy while sedated with propofol were included. Topographic EEG spectral maps and the bispectral index (BIS) values were obtained at four time points: wakefulness, mild sedation, deep sedation and recovery. Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAA/S) score was used to assess sedation levels. RESULTS Propofol induced increased delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and gamma (25-40 Hz) power throughout sedation. In addition, there was decreased alpha power (9-11.5 Hz) in the occipital area and increased global beta (12-25 Hz)/gamma (25-40 Hz) power during mild sedation. Deep sedation was associated with increased theta (4-7 Hz)/alpha (9-11.5 Hz)/beta (12-25 Hz) power, which was maximal frontally. CONCLUSION There are distinct changes associated with deepening levels of propofol induced sedation that distinguish it from natural sleep. This suggests that different mechanisms are involved in them and warrants further investigations to clarify the nature of these changes.","Bakry, Mohamed Ali; Bakry, Radwa Ali",Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,115,5

METHODS From 2011 to 2013, 12 consecutive patients with acute type A aortic dissection were indicated for arch surgery and underwent surgical replacement of proximal aorta, arch replacement or debranching procedure, and concomitant TEVAR for distal aortic repair. RESULTS A good surgical field was obtained in all patients. No major complications developed but two hospital deaths were attributed to end-organs damage preoperatively. Good and fast remodeling of thoracic descending aorta was demonstrated in 11 patients in postoperative CT imaging and no aneurysmal dilatation of visceral aorta had been observed in 10 patients during follow-up periods. CONCLUSION Modified four-branched graft technique facilitated proximal aorta and arch repair, and provided excellent neurological outcome and favorable short-term results. Single-stage operation combined with antegrade TEVAR is feasible and effective to extend the repair down to the descending aorta, and thus achieved good remodeling of thoracic descending aorta.","Chou, Hung-Tao; Lo, Jen-Ping; Chua, Chai-Hock; Lu, Ming-Jen; Lin, Chia-Hsun",Annals of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery : official journal of the Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of Asia,115,24

In a precautionary measure, populations have been forced and kept under quarantine to contain the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease. The quarantine primary goal is to avoid the overload to the hospitals, which should be available for the care of COVID-19 patients. However, the virus does not have a uniform spread throughout the planet, and Brazil is no different. Although all the world's attention is now on the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no similar pattern of spread, and other diseases are still a real problem. Given the risks of transmission between patients and healthcare providers, there is a great challenge for healthcare institutions who must balance resources to assure safe care to patients and professionals while they take care of other disease patients, and perform surgical procedures that need to be carried out. Under such circumstances, as COVID-19 can also present pre- or asymptomatic transmission, it can be challenging to identify patients who are carrying and spreading the virus. Studies and information on mandatory testing for who are candidates to undergo elective surgery are scarce. Thus, the authors have reviewed the literature, and discuss the need to test these patients under the current context.","Silva, Leonardo Emilio; Cohen, Ricardo Vitor; Rocha, Jaime Luis Lopes; Hassel, Viviane Maria Carvalho; VON-Bahten, Luiz Carlos",Revista do Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes,115,1

Unfortunately, no successful vaccines or antiviral drugs are currently available which leaves the scientific community under huge pressure to tackle this pandemic. Among the identified promising druggable targets, specific to this virus, is the main protease (Mpro) enzyme, which is vital for viral replication, transcription and packaging within the host cells. In this study, selective inhibition of the Mpro was sought via thorough analysis of its available structural data in the Protein Data Bank. To this end, COVID-19 Mpro crystal complexes were explored and the key interacting residues (KIRs) within its active site, that are expected to be vital for effective ligand binding, were identified. Based on these KIRs, 3D pharmacophore models were generated and used in virtual screening of different databases. Retrieved hits were docked into the active site of the enzyme and their MM-PBSA based free binding energies were calculated. Finally, ADMET descriptors were calculated to aid the selection of top scoring hits with best ADMET properties. Nine compounds with different chemotypes were identified as potential Mpro inhibitors. Further, MD simulations of a virtual complex of Mpro with one of the promising hits revealed stable binding which is indicative of good inhibitory potential. The identified compounds in this study are expected to support the global drug discovery efforts in fighting against this highly contagious virus by narrowing the searchable chemical space for potential effective therapeutics.

This is considered essential to prevent disruption of the stump of the splenic vein and consequent intra-abdominal haemorrhage in the event of pancreatic fistula (PF). However, this procedure can be technically demanding, especially when the vein is firmly embedded in the pancreatic parenchyma. The objective of the COSMOS-DP trial is to confirm the non-inferiority of resection of the splenic vein embedded in the pancreatic parenchyma compared with the conventional technique of isolating the splenic vein before resection during DP using a mechanical stapler. METHODS Patients with diseases of the pancreatic body and tail whose pancreatic parenchyma and splenic vein can be divided concurrently during open or laparoscopic DP are considered eligible for inclusion. This study is designed as a multicentre prospective randomised phase III trial. Eligible patients will be centrally randomised to either Arm A (resection of the splenic vein after isolation from the pancreatic parenchyma) or Arm B (co-resection of the vein together with the pancreas). This study aims to establish the non-inferiority of the safety of Arm B compared with that of Arm A; the primary endpoint is the incidence of PF (ISGPF grade B/C). DISCUSSION The COSMOS-DP trial will establish the safety of this procedure, such that it can be recommended with more confidence.

In this work, we have designed Ce doped Cu-Al layered double hydroxide (CAC-LDH) ultrathin them through a bottom-up synthesis method, and further loaded them with indocyanine green (ICG). The synthesized ICG/CAC-LDH was used as a Fenton-catalyst and photothermal agent. With the Fenton activity, the ICG/CAC-LDH nanosheets could decompose H2O2 and exhibit a low KM value (1.57 mM) and an ultra-high Vmax (4.88 × 10-6 M s-1) value. Due to the presence of oxidized metal ions, ICG/CAC-LDH could induce intracellular GSH depletion and reduce Cu2+ and Ce4+ to Cu+ and Ce3+, respectively. The generated Cu+ and Ce3+ further reacted with local H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) via the Fenton reaction. Owing to the obviously enhanced absorption of ICG/CAC-LDH at 808 nm, the photothermal efficiency of ICG/CAC-LDH increased significantly compared with ICG (ΔT = 34.7 °C vs. 28.3 °C). In vitro studies substantiate the remarkable CDT/PTT efficacy, with complete apoptosis of HepG2 cancer cells (the cell viability is less than 2%) treated with 25 μg mL-1 of ICG/CAC-LDH. Furthermore, ICG/CAC-LDH could also act as a contrast agent for cancer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). These results demonstrate the potential of ICG/CAC-LDH as an integrated agent for dual-modal imaging and synergistic CDT/PTT.","Wang, Zhengdi; Fu, Liyang; Zhu, Yu; Wang, Sa; Shen, Guohong; Jin, Lan; Liang, Ruizheng",Journal of materials chemistry.

T-type channels have been implicated in diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes, including epilepsy, autism, and mood regulation, but the brain structures involved remain incompletely understood. The medial habenula (MHb) is an epithalamic structure implicated in anxiety-like and withdrawal behavior. Previous studies have shown that MHb neurons fire tonic APs at a frequency of ∼2-10 Hz or display depolarized low amplitude membrane oscillations. Here, we report in C57BL/6J mice that a subpopulation of MHb neurons are capable of firing transient, high frequency AP bursts mediated by T-type channels. Burst firing was observed following rebounding from hyperpolarizing current injections or during depolarization from hyperpolarized membrane potentials in ∼20% of MHb neurons. It was rarely observed at baseline but could be evoked in MHb neurons displaying different initial activity states. Further, we show that T-type channel mRNA, in particular Cav3.1, is expressed in the MHb in both cholinergic and substance P-ergic neurons. Pharmacological Cav3 antagonism blocked both burst firing and evoked Ca2+ currents in MHb neurons. Additionally, we observed high frequency AP doublet firing at sustained depolarized membrane potentials that was independent of T-type channels. Thus, there is a greater diversity of AP firing patterns in MHb neurons than previously identified, including T-type channel-mediated burst firing, which may uniquely contribute to behaviors with relevance to neuropsychiatric disease.Significance statement Previous studies have reported that medial habenula neurons solely fire tonic action potentials at ∼2-10 Hz or display depolarized low amplitude membrane oscillations. In contrast, we found that a subpopulation of medial habenula neurons fire high frequency action potential bursts that share the characteristics of T-type Ca2+ channel-mediated low threshold spikes and were blocked by pharmacological antagonism of T-type Ca2+ channels. T-type Ca2+ channel mRNA, especially Cav3.1, is expressed in the medial habenula in both cholinergic and substance P-ergic neurons. T-type channel-independent action potential doublets were also observed in medial habenula neurons at sustained depolarized membrane potentials. Thus, there is a greater diversity of AP firing patterns in MHb neurons than previously recognized, including T-type Ca2+ channel-mediated burst firing.","Vickstrom, Casey R; Liu, Xiaojie; Zhang, Yuqi; Mu, Lianwei; Kelly, Thomas J; Yan, Xudong; Hu, Meng-Ming; Snarrenberg, Shana T; Liu, Qing-Song",eNeuro,115,16

However, the capacity of SWT to influence pathophysiological processes and the morphology of affected tissues remains unclear. The objective of the current review is to evaluate changes in imaging outcomes of musculoskeletal conditions following SWT. METHODS A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, CINAHL and SportDiscus was conducted from inception to October 2018. Prospective clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of SWT based on changes in imaging outcomes were eligible for inclusion. Articles were evaluated independently for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias list and the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies. Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression with a priori determined covariates was conducted for each condition to determine potential predictors of SWT effects. RESULTS Sixty-three studies were included, with data from 27 studies available for effect size pooling. Meta-analyses and meta-regression on imaging outcomes were performed for rotator cuff calcific tendinitis (n = 11), plantar fasciitis (n = 7) and osteonecrosis of the femoral head (n = 9). There was an overall reduction in the size of measured lesion following SWT (MD 8.44 mm (95%CI -4.30, 12.57), p < 0.001) for calcium deposit diameter, (MD 0.92 mm (95%CI -0.03, 1.81), p = 0.04) for plantar fascia thickness and (MD 4.84% (95%CI -0.06, 9.75), p = 0.05) for lesion size in femoral head osteonecrosis. Meta-regression showed no influence of SWT dosage parameters, however, baseline lesion size was an independent predictor for changes in imaging outcomes. CONCLUSIONS SWT altered the morphology of musculoskeletal conditions, potentially reflecting changes in underlying pathophysiological processes. The parameters of SWT dosage are not significant predictors of changes in imaging outcomes. Lack of adequate reporting of imaging outcomes limited the conclusions that could be drawn from the current review.

METHODS We conducted a narrative review of the most significant papers published in the areas of cancer screening, incidence, mortality and palliative care in SMI. RESULTS Data from the literature confirm disparities in screening (eg, mammography; pap-smear test; colorectal cancer screening) and prevention (eg, clinical breast examination; smoking cessation). The incidence of cancer was found to be variable with a portion of the studies reporting a higher prevalence while others a similar or a lower prevalence of cancer compared to the general population. A lower percentage of patients with SMI received proper cancer treatment resulting in survival after cancer diagnosis significantly worse than people without SMI. Likewise, end-of-life care has been shown to be lacking with poorer levels of physical, psychological and spiritual care. CONCLUSIONS The problems of stigma and discrimination, poorer dignity, poorer health behavior, lack of integration in health-care services for people with SMI needs to be addressed and solved in cancer care.

Known to occur in humans and animals, MSIs deserve special consideration when studying transmission dynamics, evolution, and treatment of mycobacterial diseases, notably tuberculosis in humans and paratuberculosis (or Johne's disease) in ruminants. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to examine how MSIs are defined in the literature, how widespread the phenomenon is across the host species spectrum, and to document common methods used to detect such infections. Our search strategy identified 121 articles reporting MSIs in both humans and animals, the majority (78.5%) of which involved members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, while only a few (21.5%) examined non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). In addition, MSIs exist across various host species, but most reports focused on humans due to the extensive amount of work done on tuberculosis. We reviewed the strain typing methods that allowed for MSI detection and found a few that were commonly employed but were associated with specific challenges. Our review notes the need for standardization, as some highly discriminatory methods are not adapted to distinguish between microevolution of one strain and concurrent infection with multiple strains. Further research is also warranted to examine the prevalence of NTM MSIs in both humans and animals. In addition, it is envisioned that the accurate identification and a better understanding of the distribution of MSIs in the future will lead to important information on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of mycobacterial diseases.","Byrne, Alexander Stephen; Goudreau, Alex; Bissonnette, Nathalie; Shamputa, Isdore Chola; Tahlan, Kapil",Frontiers in genetics,115,24

METHOD A cross-sectional study was performed on 388 cats entering the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals animal shelter in Auckland, New Zealand between 7 February 2014 and 30 May 2014. Whole blood samples were collected from each cat and tested for FIV antibody and FeLV antigen using a commercial point-of-care ELISA. Information on the signalment and health status of the cat at the time of entry was also recorded. Blood and saliva samples from a subset of cats were tested for FIV and FeLV proviral DNA using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS Of the 388 cats in the study sample, 146 (37.6%) had been relinquished by owners, 237 (62.4%) were strays, and 5 (1.3%) were of unknown origin. Overall, 53/388 (13.7%) cats tested positive for FIV antibodies and 4/388 (1.0%) were positive for FeLV antigen. Stray cats had a higher FIV seroprevalence than relinquished cats (42/237 (17.8%) vs. 11/146 (7.5%); p=0.008). Of 53 cats that were FIV-seropositive, 51 (96%) tested positive for FIV proviral DNA using PCR testing of blood. Of these 51 cats, 28 (55%) were positive by PCR testing of saliva. Of the four cats that were FeLV antigen-positive by ELISA, two (50%) were positive for FeLV proviral DNA by PCR testing of blood. The odds of a cat being seropositive for FIV were greater for intact compared to desexed cats (OR=3.3; 95% CI=1.6-7.4) and for male compared to female cats (OR=6.5; 95% CI=3.2-14.0). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The seroprevalence for FIV was 14% among cats entering an animal shelter in Auckland, whereas the prevalence of FeLV antigen-positive cats was only 1%. These findings suggest differences in the transmission dynamics of each virus in free-roaming cat populations in New Zealand. Our study also highlights the potential role of desexing cats in reducing transmission of FIV. However, further data from first-opinion veterinary practices are required to confirm that these findings may be generalised to the wider domestic cat population in New Zealand.","Gates, M C; Vigeant, S; Dale, A",New Zealand veterinary journal,115,24

Identical sets of coded samples were prepared using serial dilutions of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) from serum and cell culture propagated material. Each laboratory extracted nucleic acid from this panel using available robotic equipment (12 separate instruments, comprising 8 different models), after which the processed samples were frozen and sent to a single laboratory for subsequent testing by real-time RT-PCR. In general, there was good concordance between the results obtained for the different automated extraction platforms. In particular, the limit of detection was identical for 9/12 and 8/12 best performing robots (using dilutions of BVDV infected-serum and cell culture material, respectively), which was similar to a manual extraction method used for comparison. The remaining equipment and protocols used were less sensitive, in an extreme case for serum, by a factor of 1000. There was no evidence for cross-contamination of RNA template in any of the negative samples included in these panels. These results are not intended to replace local optimisation and validation, but provide reassurance to laboratories to indicate that the best performing optimised nucleic acid extraction systems can have similar performance.","Rasmussen, Thomas Bruun; Uttenthal, Ase; Hakhverdyan, Mikhayil; Belák, Sándor; Wakeley, Philip R; Reid, Scott M; Ebert, Katja; King, Donald P",Journal of virological methods,115,1

METHODS A Qualtrics survey of more than 2,300 health care providers was conducted in a single academic health system on May 15, 2020 including practicing attending physicians, residents and fellows in training, advanced practice providers, and nurses. Six hundred and sixty-eight responded (29% response rate). The survey employed the Research Diagnostic Criteria for insomnia disorder to diagnose acute insomnia disorder. RESULTS 573 respondents had no missing data pertaining to sleep, with a mean age of 43.4 + 12.5 years and 72% women. The rate of insomnia disorder before COVID-19 was 44.5%, while after COVID-19 it was 64.0%. 10.2% of persons with insomnia disorder before COVID-19 stated it had resolved during COVID-19, while 43.4% of persons who did not have insomnia disorder before COVID-19 developed acute insomnia disorder during COVID-19 (χ2=145.2; df=1; P<0.0001). New cases of acute insomnia disorder were related positively to female gender, advancing age, and less time spent in direct patient care. CONCLUSIONS Acute insomnia disorder was exceptionally common in this sample of tertiary care health care workers. The effects of gender and age were similar to what has been generally described as risk factors for insomnia. The surprising finding that less time spent in direct patient care was associated with more cases of acute insomnia disorder might be explained by the poorly understood stresses of working from home during COVID-19.","McCall, William V; Mensah-Bonsu, Demetra; Withers, Allison E; Gibson, Robert W",Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,115,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS Multiple IRE lesions were created percutaneously by ultrasound guidance in livers of 11 Yorkshire pigs using a prototype IRE generator. Paired electrodes were used. Three pigs were killed at the same day; 2 pigs, at 2 days; 2 pigs, at 2 weeks; 2 pigs, at 4 weeks; and 2 pigs, at 8 weeks. Contrast-enhanced CT was performed in all pigs initially and thereafter at selected intervals. Pathological sections were performed for correlation. Initial CT scans were analyzed for lesions for degree of circumferential contact (< 25%, 26%-50%, 51%-75%, and 76%-100%) to the hepatic veins for analysis of any contour deformity. The hepatic veins were also analyzed for any thrombus and for any narrowing. Those lesions with follow-up scans were also analyzed for changes over time. RESULTS Twenty-three lesions showed contiguity to the hepatic veins between 3 to 9 mm in size at the initial CT. No contour deformity due to perivascular tissue sparing is detected for any lesion. There was no thrombus detected in any vessel at any time point. Vessel narrowing was seen in 9 of 23 veins on the initial CT, all less than 50% in diameter and all with lesion contact of greater than 25% in circumference, but 2 of 3 veins with follow-up scans showed return-to-normal caliber. No late narrowing of any hepatic vein was seen on the long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION Irreversible electroporation creates uniform tissue ablation around the hepatic veins without perivascular tissue sparing. Vessel narrowing may occur acutely but without long-term sequela.","Lee, Young Joon; Lu, David S K; Osuagwu, Ferdnand; Lassman, Charles",Investigative radiology,115,23

We present a single-institution series of transvaginal hybrid NOTES cholecystectomies (TVC) and compare outcomes with patients undergoing standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). METHODS Patients had an indication for elective cholecystectomy and met the following institutional review board-approved inclusion criteria: female gender, age >18 years, body mass index ≤35, ASA Classification I or II, and absence of acute cholecystitis. TVC was performed by using one or two transabdominal ports to enable gallbladder retraction and clip application. Dissection was performed with a flexible endoscope through a posterior colpotomy using instrumentation from the NOTES GEN1 Toolbox (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.). RESULTS Seven patients underwent TVC and seven patients underwent LC. Operative times were significantly longer for TVC (162 vs. 68 min; p < 0.001). All procedures were performed on an outpatient basis, except for one patient in each group who were discharged on POD#1. Three minor (grade I) complications occurred: two in the LC group and one in the TVC group. TVC patients required less narcotics in the postanesthesia care unit (1 vs. 8 mg morphine equivalents; p = 0.02). Visual Analog Scale pain scores (scale 0-10) were less in the TVC group at 30 min (1 vs. 5; p = 0.02) and 60 min (2 vs. 5; p = 0.02). TVC pain scores also were lower on postoperative days 1, 4, and 7 (2, 1, 0 vs. 6, 3, 2), although only significantly on POD#1 (p = 0.01). SF-36 scores were similar at 1 and 3 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS This series adds to the existing evidence that transvaginal hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy using a flexible endoscope for dissection is a technically feasible and safe procedure. TVC requires a longer operative time than LC but may result in less pain in the immediate postoperative period with patients subsequently requiring fewer narcotics.","Santos, Byron F; Teitelbaum, Ezra N; Arafat, Fahd O; Milad, Magdy P; Soper, Nathaniel J; Hungness, Eric S",Surgical endoscopy,115,20

METHODS AND RESULTS Eighty-five patients admitted for STEMI at a high-volume Italian centre were included. Patients hospitalized during the COVID-19 outbreak (21 February-10 April 2020) (40%) were compared with those admitted in pre-COVID-19 period (3 January-20 February 2020) (60%). A 43% reduction in STEMI admissions was observed during the COVID-19 outbreak compared with the previous period. Time from symptom onset to first medical contact (FMC) and time from FMC to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) were longer in patients admitted during the COVID-19 period compared with before [148 (79-781) versus 130 (30-185) min; P = 0.018, and 75 (59-148)] versus 45 (30-70) min; P < 0.001]. High-sensitive troponin T levels on admission were also higher. In-hospital mortality was 12% in the COVID-19 phase versus 6% in the pre-COVID-19 period. Incidence of the composite end-point, including free-wall rupture, severe left ventricular dysfunction, left ventricular aneurysm, severe mitral regurgitation and pericardial effusion, was higher during the COVID-19 than the pre-COVID-19 period (19.6 versus 41.2%; P = 0.030; odds ratio = 2.87; 95% confidence interval 1.09-7.58). CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the STEMI care system reducing hospital admissions and prolonging revascularization time.

BrS is a challenging entity, in regard to diagnosis as well as arrhythmia risk prediction and management. Nowadays, asymptomatic patients represent the majority of newly diagnosed patients with BrS, and its incidence is expected to rise due to (genetic) family screening. Progress in our understanding of the genetic and molecular pathophysiology is limited by the absence of a true gold standard, with consensus on its clinical definition changing over time. Nevertheless, novel insights continue to arise from detailed and in-depth studies, including the complex genetic and molecular basis. This includes the increasingly recognised relevance of an underlying structural substrate. Risk stratification in patients with BrS remains challenging, particularly in those who are asymptomatic, but recent studies have demonstrated the potential usefulness of risk scores to identify patients at high risk of arrhythmia and SCD. Development and validation of a model that incorporates clinical and genetic factors, comorbidities, age and gender, and environmental aspects may facilitate improved prediction of disease expressivity and arrhythmia/SCD risk, and potentially guide patient management and therapy. This review provides an update of the diagnosis, pathophysiology and management of BrS, and discusses its future perspectives.","Marsman, E Madelief J; Postema, Pieter G; Remme, Carol Ann",Heart,115,10

We compared the capacity to change the postural responses after unexpected external perturbation and investigated the habituation plateaus of postural responses to non-sequential perturbation trials in people with Parkinson's disease and healthy older adults. METHODS In people with Parkinson's disease (n = 37) and older adults (n = 20), sudden posterior support-surface translational were applied in 7 out of 17 randomized trials to ensure perturbation unpredictability. Electromyography and center of pressure parameters of postural response were analyzed by ANOVAs (Group vs. Trials). Two simple planned contrasts were performed to determine at which trial the responses first significantly habituate, and by which trials the habituation plateaus. FINDINGS Older adults demonstrated a first response change in trial 5 and habituation plateaus after trial 4, while for people with Parkinson's disease, the first change occurred in trial 2 and habituation plateau after trial 5 observed by center of pressure range. People with Parkinson's disease demonstrated a greater center of pressure range in trial 1 compared to older adults. Independent of trial, people with Parkinson's disease vs. older adults demonstrated a greater ankle muscle co-activation and recovery time. INTERPRETATION Despite the greater center of pressure range in the first trial, people with Parkinson's disease can habituate to unpredictable perturbations. This is reflected by little, to no difference in the time-course of adaptation for all but 2 parameters that showed only marginal differences between people with Parkinson's disease and older adults.","Beretta, Victor Spiandor; Carpenter, Mark Gregory; Barbieri, Fabio Augusto; Santos, Paulo Cezar Rocha; Orcioli-Silva, Diego; Pereira, Marcelo Pinto; Gobbi, Lilian Teresa Bucken",Clinical biomechanics,115,1

We hypothesized that aptitude may directly affect one's ability to successfully complete the learning curve for minimally invasive procedures. The aim was to assess whether aptitude has an impact on ability to achieve proficiency in completing a simulated minimally invasive surgical procedure. The index procedure chosen was a laparoscopic appendectomy. STUDY DESIGN Two groups of medical students with disparate aptitude were selected. Aptitude (visual-spatial, depth perception, and psychomotor ability) was measured by previously validated tests. Indicators of technical proficiency for laparoscopic appendectomy were established by trained surgeons with an individual case volume of more than 150. All subjects were tested consecutively on the ProMIS III (Haptica) until they reached predefined proficiency in this procedure. Simulator metrics, critical error scores, and Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scores were recorded. RESULTS The mean numbers of attempts to achieve proficiency in performing a laparoscopic appendectomy for group A (high aptitude) and B (low aptitude) were 6 (range 4 to 7) and 14 (range 10 to 18), respectively (p < 0.0001). Significant differences were found between the 2 groups for path length (p = 0.014), error score (p = 0.021), and OSATS score (p < 0.0001) at the initial attempt. CONCLUSIONS High aptitude is directly related to a rapid attainment of proficiency.

Therapeutic options for first-line acute attacks are intravenous administration of glucose and/or exogenous heme. The former treatment can aggravate hyponatremia by dilution and cause seizures; thus, the correction of hyponatremia must be carried out with extreme caution. This review summarizes recommendations for the management of hyponatremia during acute episodes of porphyria. Hyponatremia should be corrected slowly and seizures treated with medications in order to not exacerbate motor and sensory axonal neuropathy. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is considered a frequent cause of hyponatremia in acute porphyrias and must be identified as a symptom of an acute porphyria attack.

This study aimed to investigate the incidence of HBoV and co-infections in pediatric patients with symptoms of viral respiratory tract infection. METHODOLOGY This study included 2,310 patients between the ages of 0-18 in whom HBoV and other respiratory tract viral pathogens were analyzed in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. RESULTS In the pediatric age group, HBoV was found in 4.5% (105/2310) of the patients and higher in children between the ages of 1 and 5. Mixed infection was detected in 43.8% (46/105) of HBoV positive patients (p = 0.10). Mono and mixed infection rates were higher in outpatients than in inpatients (p < 0.05). Respiratory syncytial virus was significantly higher than the other respiratory viral pathogens (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study is important as it is one of the rare studies performed on the incidence of HBoV in the Marmara region. In pediatric age group, the incidence of HBoV was found 4.5%. The incidence rate of HBoV in this study was similar to those in studies around the world, but close to low rates. The incidence of HBoV was found higher especially among children between the ages of 1-5 in this study. In addition to the incidence of HBoV, accompanying co-infections in the pediatric age group were also investigated in this study. Since concurrence of RSV, HRV and hMPV with HBoV was the most common it must be considered that there may be more than one agents in patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infection.","Bakir, Ayfer; Karabulut, Nuran; Alacam, Sema; Mese, Sevim; Somer, Ayper; Agacfidan, Ali",Journal of infection in developing countries,115,24

Despite the proven safety and efficacy of bare platinum coils, criticism of the durability of endovascular coiling with respect to traditional open surgical clipping persists. In order to overcome this criticism, several newer generations of coils have been introduced with the purpose of enhancing the durability of the initial endovascular treatment. These 'bioactive' coils have an additional material [polyglycolic acid (PGA), polyglycolic/polylactic acid (PGLA), or hydrogel)] added to the bare platinum coil in order to induce an inflammatory response and/or increase packing density within the aneurysm. While comparable safety profiles have been proven, a review of the multiple trials and clinical series published on this topic provides no clear evidence to suggest that the current bioactive coil iterations provide any sustained benefit over bare platinum coils.","Vance, Awais; Welch, Babu G",Neurological research,115,28

Intravitreal injections can enhance ocular drug delivery, but the need for frequent retreatment and potential injection-related side effects limit the utility of this technique. Sustained-release drug delivery systems have been developed to overcome these limitations; such systems can achieve prolonged therapeutic drug concentrations in ocular target tissues while limiting systemic exposure and side effects and improving patient adherence to therapy. A critical factor in the development of safe and effective drug delivery systems has been the development of biocompatible polymers, which offer the versatility to tailor drug release kinetics for specific drugs and ocular diseases. Ocular implants include nonbiodegradable and biodegradable designs, with the latter offering several advantages. The polymers most commonly used in biodegradable delivery systems are synthetic aliphatic polyesters of the poly-α-hydroxy acid family including polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, and polylactic-co-glycolic acid. The characteristics of these polymers for medical applications as well as the pharmacological properties, safety, and clinical effectiveness of biodegradable drug implants for the treatment of ocular diseases are reviewed herein.","Lee, Susan S; Hughes, Patrick; Ross, Aron D; Robinson, Michael R",Pharmaceutical research,115,7

Because outcome crucially depends on time to treatment ('time-is-brain' concept), we assessed the effects of an intervention based on performing all the time-sensitive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures at a single location on the delay before intra-arterial stroke treatment. METHODS Consecutive acute stroke patients with large vessel occlusion who obtained IAT were evaluated before and after implementation (April 26, 2010) of an intervention focused on performing all the diagnostic and therapeutic measures at a single site ('stroke room'). RESULT After implementation of the intervention, the median intervals between admission and first angiography series were significantly shorter for 174 intervention patients (102 min, interquartile range (IQR) 85-120 min) than for 81 control patients (117 min, IQR 89-150 min; p < 0.05), as were the intervals between admission and clot removal or end of angiography (152 min, IQR 123-185 min vs. 190 min, IQR 163-227 min; p < 0.001). However, no significant differences in clinical outcome were observed. CONCLUSION This study shows for the, to our knowledge, first time that for patients with acute ischemic stroke, stroke diagnosis and treatment at a single location ('stroke room') saves crucial time until IAT.","Ragoschke-Schumm, Andreas; Yilmaz, Umut; Kostopoulos, Panagiotis; Lesmeister, Martin; Manitz, Matthias; Walter, Silke; Helwig, Stefan; Schwindling, Lenka; Fousse, Mathias; Haass, Anton; Garner, Dominique; Körner, Heiko; Roumia, Safwan; Grunwald, Iris; Nasreldein, Ali; Halmer, Ramona; Liu, Yang; Schlechtriemen, Thomas; Reith, Wolfgang; Fassbender, Klaus",Cerebrovascular diseases,115,5

Although potentially providing an energetic benefit through reduced maintenance and thermal costs, little is known about the cascading effects that may alter energy expenditure during activity, dive responses, and overall energy budgets for these warm water species. To examine this, we used open-flow respirometry to measure the energy expended during resting and swimming in both species. We found the average resting metabolic rates (RMR) for both the adult monk seal (753.8±26.1 kJ·hr-1, mean±s.e.m) and manatees (887.7±19.5 kJ·hr-1) were lower than predicted for cold water marine mammal species of similar body mass. Despite these relatively low RMRs, both total cost per stroke and total cost of transport (COTTOT) during submerged swimming were similar to predictions for comparably sized marine mammals (adult monk seal: Cost per stroke=5.0±0.2 J·kg-1·stroke-1, COTTOT=1.7±0.1 J·kg-1·m-1; manatees: Cost per stroke=2.0±0.4 J·kg-1·stroke-11, COTTOT=0.87±0.17 J·kg-1·m-1). These lower maintenance costs result in less variability in adjustable metabolic costs that occur during submergence for warm water species. However, these reduced maintenance costs do not appear to confer an advantage in overall energetic costs during activity, potentially limiting the capacity of warm-water species to respond to anthropogenic or environmental threats that require increased energy expenditure.","John, Jason S; Thometz, Nicole M; Boerner, Katharine; Denum, Laura; Kendall, Traci L; Richter, Beau P; Gaspard, Joseph C; Williams, Terrie M",The Journal of experimental biology,115,1

Methods We retrospectively analyzed data from 67 patients who underwent segmentectomy by VATS from November 2014 to November 2017 at the University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland. The need to modify arterial or parenchymal resection based on intraoperative near-infrared imaging was considered the primary study outcome. Results A total of 67 patients (28 men, 39 women, mean age 66±10 years) underwent anatomical pulmonary segmentectomy by VATS. Histological analysis revealed a primary lung tumor in 59 patients. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) operation time was 154±51 minutes. Identification of the intersegmental plane (ISP) with near-infrared angiography was achieved in 88% of patients and led to modification of the resection during segmentectomy in 7 patients (10%), avoiding inappropriate resection; 2 patients had distant tumor recurrences (3%). Conclusions Near-infrared angiography during VATS segmentectomy is effective for identifying ISPs, with respect to the oncological margins, as well as for correcting the anatomical resection.","Bédat, Benoît; Triponez, Frédéric; Sadowski, Samira Mercedes; Ellenberger, Christophe; Licker, Marc; Karenovics, Wolfram",Journal of thoracic disease,115,26

However, the augmented role of these procedures raises concerns about the radiation dose to patients and operators. We evaluated patient doses from an x-ray imaging platform with radiation dose-reduction technology, which combined image noise reduction, motion correction, and contrast-dependent temporal averaging with optimized x-ray exposure settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this single-center, retrospective study, cumulative dose-area product inclusive of fluoroscopy, angiography, and 3D acquisitions for all neurovascular procedures performed during a 2-year period on the dose-reduction platform were compared with a reference platform. Key study features were the following: The neurointerventional radiologist could select the targeted dose reduction for each patient with the dose-reduction platform, and the statistical analyses included patient characteristics and the neurointerventional radiologist as covariates. The analyzed outcome measures were cumulative dose (kerma)-area product, fluoroscopy duration, and administered contrast volume. RESULTS A total of 1238 neurointerventional cases were included, of which 914 and 324 were performed on the reference and dose-reduction platforms, respectively. Over all diagnostic and neurointerventional procedures, the cumulative dose-area product was significantly reduced by 53.2% (mean reduction, 160.3 Gy × cm2; P < .0001), fluoroscopy duration was marginally significantly increased (mean increase, 5.2 minutes; P = .0491), and contrast volume was nonsignificantly increased (mean increase, 15.3 mL; P = .1616) with the dose-reduction platform. CONCLUSIONS A significant reduction in patient radiation dose is achievable during neurovascular procedures by using dose-reduction technology with a minimal impact on workflow.","van der Marel, K; Vedantham, S; van der Bom, I M J; Howk, M; Narain, T; Ty, K; Karellas, A; Gounis, M J; Puri, A S; Wakhloo, A K",AJNR.

Understanding SARS-CoV-2 virology can elucidate potential drug targets for the inhibition of viral replication. Areas Covered: This review offers insights into novel and repurposed drugs that may have activity against SARS-CoV-2. We searched the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov for COVID-19 related therapy until September 15, 2020 using search words ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""antiviral"", and/or ""treatment"". Expert Opinion: Remdesivir decreased symptom duration modestly but had no significant impact on survival. Antivirals alone may be insufficient for a specific subset of patients with severe disease because of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Treatment may require a combination of antivirals and immunomodulators to inhibit viral replication and CRS, respectively. A safe and efficacious SARS-CoV-2 specific vaccine is critical for prevention and mortality reduction. Moreover, we cannot overstate the importance of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in testing of novel treatments. The pervasive stumbling block, however, is the low representation of minority groups. The benefit of remdesivir may not be generalizable to these populations because of significant underrepresentation in trials. Future endeavors should encompass the recruitment of patient populations that are reflective of the demographics significantly impacted by COVID-19.","Malinis, Maricar; McManus, Dayna; Davis, Matthew; Topal, Jeffrey",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,115,9

Interestingly, Emergency Department (ED) referrals for reasons other than Covid-19 seem to have declined steeply. In the present paper, we aimed to verify how the Covid-19 outbreak changed ED referral pattern. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients referred to the ED of a University Hospital in Northern Italy from 1st March to 13th April 2020. We compared the following data with those belonging to the same period in 2019: number of EDs accesses, rate of hospital admission, frequencies of the most common causes of ED referral, priority codes of access. RESULTS The number of ED referrals during the Covid-19 outbreak was markedly reduced when compared to the same period in 2019 (3059 vs. 5691;-46.3%). Conversely, the rate of hospital admission raised from 16.9% to 35.4% (p<0.0001), with a shift toward higher priority codes of ED admission. In 2020, we observed both a reduction of the number of patients referred for both traumatic (513, 16.8% vs. 1544, 27.1%; χ2=118.7, p<0.0001) and non-traumatic (4147 vs. 2546) conditions. Among the latter, suspected Covid-19 accounted for 1101 (43.2%) accesses. CONCLUSIONS The Covid-19 pandemic completely changed the pattern of ED referral in Italy, with a marked reduction of the accesses to the hospitals. This could be related to a limited exposure to traumas and to a common fear of being infected during EDs in-stay. This may limit the misuse of EDs for non- urgent conditions, but may also delay proper referrals for urgent conditions.","Bellan, Mattia; Gavelli, Francesco; Hayden, Eyal; Patrucco, Filippo; Soddu, Daniele; Pedrinelli, Anita R; Cittone, Micol G; Rizzi, Eleonora; Casciaro, Giuseppe F; Vassia, Veronica; Landi, Raffaella; Menegatti, Mirta; Gastaldello, Maria L; Beltrame, Michela; Labella, Emanuela; Tonello, Stelvio; Avanzi, Gian C; Pirisi, Mario; Castello, Luigi M; Sainaghi, Pier P",Panminerva medica,115,5

Using this platform, we perform a high content screen and identify GW6471, which blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection. GW6471 can also block infection of the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant. RNA-seq analysis suggests that GW6471 blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection at least in part by inhibiting HIF1α, which is further validated by chemical inhibitor and genetic perturbation targeting HIF1α. Metabolic profiling identifies decreased rates of glycolysis upon GW6471 treatment, consistent with transcriptome profiling.

The current study addressed the poor replication of IBV in the HeLa human cell line demonstrated in previous reports. We showed that IBV strains M41, H52, H120 and Gray could be propagated in HeLa cells with distinct cytopathic effect. The virus titre in freshly dispersed HeLa cells was 1000-fold higher than in cell monolayers. Trypsin was not the determinant for the viral replication, suggesting that the restriction of IBV replication in HeLa cells is the result of intracellular events rather than the binding to or fusion with host cells. These IBV strains replicated to an average titre of 10(3.4+/-0.2)/0.1 ml median tissue culture infectious doses in freshly dispersed HeLa cells and maintained this titre for the first 12 passages. Then an approximately 10-fold increase (10(4.20+/-0.19)/0.1 ml) occurred in passage 13, which was maintained to passage 16, after which there was another, bigger rise to 10(6.6+/-0.3)/0.1 ml in passage 17. This titre was maintained until passage 24 when the experiment was terminated. The IBV M41 S1 gene was amplified and sequenced for passages 0, 5 and 21. There was only one amino acid replacement in the S1 protein, in passage 21. The presence of sialic acid on HeLa cells contributed to efficient virus replication, while human aminopeptidase N was not involved in the infection.

This paper expresses the viewpoint of those in charge of responding to public health events of international concern and, in particular, to outbreaks of zoonotic disease. Several international organisations are involved in responding to such outbreaks, including the United Nations (UN) and its technical agencies; principally, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO); UN funds and programmes, such as the United Nations Development Programme, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Children's Fund; the UN-linked multilateral banking system (the World Bank and regional development banks); and partner organisations, such as the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). All of these organisations have benefited from the experiences gained during zoonotic disease outbreaks over the last decade, developing common approaches and mechanisms to foster good governance, promote policies that cut across different sectors, target investment more effectively and strengthen global and national capacities for dealing with emerging crises. Coordination among the various UN agencies and creating partnerships with related organisations have helped to improve disease surveillance in all countries, enabling more efficient detection of disease outbreaks and a faster response, greater transparency and stakeholder engagement and improved public health. The need to build more robust national public human and animal health systems, which are based on good governance and comply with the International Health Regulations (2005) and the international standards set by the OIE, prompted FAO, WHO and the OIE to join forces with the World Bank, to provide practical tools to help countries manage their zoonotic disease risks and develop adequate resources to prevent and control disease outbreaks, particularly at the animal source. All these efforts contribute to the One Health agenda.","Nuttall, I; Miyagishima, K; Roth, C; de La Rocque, S",Revue scientifique et technique,115,17

To facilitate studies of viral and host functions in FHV replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yeast DNA plasmids were constructed to inducibly express wild-type FHV RNA1 in vivo. Subsequent translation of FHV replicase protein A initiated robust RNA1 replication, amplifying RNA1 to levels approaching those of rRNA, as in FHV-infected animal cells. The RNA1-derived subgenomic mRNA, RNA3, accumulated to even higher levels of >100,000 copies per yeast cell, compared to 10 copies or less per cell for 95% of yeast mRNAs. The time course of RNA1 replication and RNA3 synthesis in induced yeast paralleled that in yeast transfected with natural FHV virion RNA. As in animal cells, RNA1 replication and RNA3 synthesis depended on FHV RNA replicase protein A and 3'-terminal RNA1 sequences but not viral protein B2. Additional plasmids were engineered to inducibly express RNA1 derivatives with insertions of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in subgenomic RNA3. These RNA1 derivatives were replicated, synthesized RNA3, and expressed GFP when provided FHV polymerase in either cis or trans, providing the first demonstration of reporter gene expression from FHV subgenomic RNA. Unexpectedly, fusing GFP to the protein A C terminus selectively inhibited production of positive- and negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 but not genomic RNA1 replication. Moreover, changing the first nucleotide of the subgenomic mRNA from G to T selectively inhibited production of positive-strand but not negative-strand RNA3, suggesting that synthesis of negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 may precede synthesis of positive-strand RNA3.","Price, B D; Roeder, M; Ahlquist, P",Journal of virology,115,16

Distillation is well-known as the major energy consumer and cost driver for ethanol recovery in conventional distilleries. Our research team has been developing a novel heat-intensified falling film distillation apparatus assisted by a two-phase closed thermosyphon, patented as Destubcal. Therefore, this study aims to provide a techno-economic and energetic assessment of the pilot-scale thermosyphon-assisted falling film distillation unit applied to recover sanitizer-grade ethanol with 70 vol% in alcohol. Performance analysis showed that under a feed flow rate of 14L/h, a feed temperature of 80 °C, and an evaporator temperature of 93 °C, the pilot-scale unit reaches the minimum specific thermal energy consumption with the maximum distillate ethanol recovery and energy efficiency (88.5%). The impact of the elements in the capital cost-share showed instrumentation and control (27.8%), and piping and auxiliary equipment (27.6%) as the predominant capital costs, while the cost for major process equipment represents only 6.2% which reveals a low-cost and easy-to-implement technology. The major operating cost-driver is the labor (51.3%) since the pilot-scale unit has a lower capacity than industrial plants. However, the Destubcal unit spends on utility costs about 31.6$/m3feed, which represents a total saving of 43.8% compared to conventional distilleries. Furthermore, the Destubcal unit saves about 1.78 MJ/kg (46.4%), with 59.2% less column height than a conventional column, being considered techno-economically feasible for sanitizer-grade ethanol recovery.","Battisti, Rodrigo Galeazzi Andrea Prifti Kristiano Manenti Flavio Machado Ricardo Antonio Francisco Marangoni Cintia",Applied Energy,115,1

Description and illustration of the most common alternative causes of shortness of breath, cough, and acute chest pain in pandemic COVID-19 conditions. Material and methods. Authors evaluated results of the retrospective single-center study and instrumental data of 67 patients with complaints of sudden chest pain, cough and shortness of breath. For patients admitted to the hospital between March, 27 and June, 30, 2020, the first stage of diagNosis was made with the performed multispiral computed tomography (MSCT) of the chest, confirming the presence of pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.

In CT of the chest organs, combinations of COVID-19 and pulmonary artery thromboembolism, central/peripheral lung cancer, and acute aortic syndrome manifestations were most common. Combinations of radiation techniques in pandemic settings are COVID-19 required by patients with the acute coronary syndrome. However, it will be possible to analyze all cases of a combination of acute chest pain and sudden shortness of breath in patients with COVID-19 only after processing an extensive array of data.

Theoretical Perspectives: To address this gap in the field, I examine affordances from the lenses of diaspora literacy, transnational literacy, and racial literacy, which hold promise for understanding how to foreground race in the literacies of predominantly English-speaking Black immigrant youth I demonstrate how each of these lenses, as applied to the literacies of the invisible population of Black youth, allows for partial understandings regarding these students' enactment of literacies based on their Englishes and semiotic resources In turn, I illustrate how these lenses can work together to clarify the role of race in Black immigrant literacies Implications: Based on these discussions, I present the framework of Black immigrant literacies to assist researchers, practitioners, and parents who wish to better understand and support Black immigrant youth I invite researchers who work with populations that include Black immigrant youth to consider how race, when central to research and teaching surrounding the literacies and Englishes of these youth, can provide opportunities for them to thrive beyond the perceptions of them as ""academic prodigies"" while also facilitating relationships with their Black American peers I invite teachers to consider ways of viewing Black immigrant literacies that foster a sense of community between these youth and their Black American peers as well as ways of engaging their literacies in classrooms that allow them to demonstrate how they function as language architects beyond performance on literacy assessments I invite parents to provide spaces beyond school contexts where Black immigrant youth can use their literacies for social adjustment Through this essay, it is expected that the dominant population can gain further insights into the nuances that exist within the Black population and be cognizant of these nuances when engaging with Black immigrant youth","Smith, Patriann",Teachers College Record,115,16

Although respiratory symptoms usually dominate the clinical presentation, COVID-19 is now known to also have potentially serious cardiovascular consequences, including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, stroke, arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock. The cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 might be related to the adrenergic drive, systemic inflammatory milieu and cytokine-release syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, direct viral infection of myocardial and endothelial cells, hypoxia due to respiratory failure, electrolytic imbalances, fluid overload, and side effects of certain COVID-19 medications. COVID-19 has profoundly reshaped usual care of both ambulatory and acute cardiac patients, by leading to the cancellation of elective procedures and by reducing the efficiency of existing pathways of urgent care, respectively. Decreased use of health care services for acute conditions by non-COVID-19 patients has also been reported and attributed to concerns about acquiring in-hospital infection. Innovative approaches that leverage modern technologies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic have been introduced, which include telemedicine, dissemination of educational material over social media, smartphone apps for case tracking, and artificial intelligence for pandemic modelling, among others.

METHODS: Data were retrieved from a national multicentric database supported by Turkish Society of Nephrology, which consists of retrospectively collected data between 17 April 2020 and 31 December 2020. Hospitalised patients aged 18 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis suffering from stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) or on maintenance haemodialysis (HD) treatment were included in the database. Non-uraemic hospitalised patients with COVID-19 were also included as the control group. RESULTS: We included 879 patients [388 (44.1%) female, median age: 63 (IQR: 50-73) years]. The percentage of older patients in the CKD group was 68.8% (n = 188/273), in the HD group was 49.0% (n = 150/306) and in the control group was 30.4% (n = 70/300).

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ravages the world, we have seen many perish in a short time. Many have died alone because of requirements for physical distancing. Even more will succumb as COVID-19 continues to spread. Moreover, deaths from other causes, numbering over 50 million annually, are also happening amid physical distancing and other COVID-19-related challenges. The pandemic is affecting the way terminally ill patients are being cared for, when and how people are dying of other causes, and how bodies are being handled and bereavement rituals performed. The bereaved are required to grieve without the support of usual social and cultural rituals. Grieving is further encumbered by cascading life stressors deriving from policies needed to mitigate the pandemic. Though we are often heartened by human resilience in response to death and other hardships, for some, the burden of this pandemic will be too much. Among other mental health problems, we will likely see an increase in prolonged grief disorder. In this commentary, we review the new diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder and outline why we might anticipate increased rates of this condition on the heels of COVID-19, especially among older persons.

The several weeks pandemic of the COVID-19 disease has forced the healthcare systems of numerous countries to adjust their resources to the care of the growing number of COVID-19 patients. Managers were presented with the challenge of protecting the healthcare workers from transmission of the disease within medical institutions, and issues concerning the physical and psychological depletion of personnel. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on analyses of the structure and work processes in Central Clinical Hospital (CCH) reconstructive strategic plan was developed. It included: division of existing wards into observation and isolation wards; installing locks; weekly plan for supplying personal protection equipment (PPE); designating new access to the hospital and communication routes; training of medical and supporting staff. The plan was implemented from the first days of conversion of the hospital. RESULTS: The wards of the CCH were converted for observation and isolation, and each one was fitted with sanitary locks. There was a big improvement in the supply of PPE for the medical staff. Separation of the 'dirty' and 'clean' parts of the CCH were attained, and widespread intensive training not only protected personnel against infections, but also diminished unrest which was discernable at the beginning of conversion. CONCLUSIONS: The transformation efforts will ultimately be appraised at the end of the epidemic, but the data looks encouraging. Two weeks after conversion, the testing of hospital Staff was started and by the end of April, 459 tests were had been conducted, of which only 11 were positive.","Król, Zbigniew; Szymanski, Piotr; Bochnia, Adrian; Abramowicz, Emilia; Plachta, Agnieszka; Rzeplinski, Radoslaw; Slugocki, Mikolaj; Nowak, Blazej; Zaczynski, Artur; Kozlowski, Krzysztof; Posobkiewicz, Marek; Wierzba, Waldemar",Ann Agric Environ Med,115,32

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are of interest to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN BODY: Stem cell-based therapies have been verified for prospective benefits in copious preclinical and clinical studies. MSCs confer potential benefits to develop various cell types and organoids for studying virus-human interaction, drug testing, regenerative medicine, and immunomodulatory effects in COVID-19 patients. Apart from paving the ways to augment stem cell research and therapies, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) holds unique ability for a wide range of health applications such as patient-specific or isogenic cells for regenerative medicine and breeding transgenic animals for biomedical applications. Being a potent cell genome-reprogramming tool, the SCNT has increased prominence of recombinant therapeutics and cellular medicine in the current era of COVID-19. As SCNT is used to generate patient-specific stem cells, it avoids dependence on embryos to obtain stem cells. CONCLUSIONS: The nuclear transfer cloning, being an ideal tool to generate cloned embryos, and the embryonic stem cells will boost drug testing and cellular medicine in COVID-19.","Singh, Birbal; Mal, Gorakh; Verma, Vinod; Tiwari, Ruchi; Khan, Muhammad Imran; Mohapatra, Ranjan K; Mitra, Saikat; Alyami, Salem A; Emran, Talha Bin; Dhama, Kuldeep; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Stem Cell Res Ther,115,25

Among these compounds, the most potent compound 6i could effectively inhibit MGC-803 (IC50 = 0.96 µM), being around 38-fold selectivity over GES-1. Further underlying mechanism studies indicated that 6i inhibited the colony formation, migration of MGC-803, and exerted anti-proliferative effect by inducing G0/G1 phase arrest in MGC-803 cells. Cell apoptosis was induced by 6i through activating mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway and the death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway. 6i induced cell apoptosis by elevating the level of ROS. Also, 6i up-regulated pro-apoptotic Bax and p53 level, while down-regulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. Furthermore, acute toxicity experiment indicated 6i exhibited good safety in vivo.

Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) may be suitable for testing strategies; however, benchmark comparisons are scarce. METHODS: We used 286 nasopharyngeal specimens from unexposed asymptomatic individuals collected between December 2020 and January 2021 to assess five Ag-RDTs marketed by Abbott, Siemens, Roche Diagnostics, Lepu Medical, and Surescreen. RESULTS: For the overall sample, the performance parameters of Ag-RDTs were as follows: Abbott assay, sensitivity 38.6% (95%CI 29.1-48.8) and specificity 99.5% (97-100%); Siemens, sensitivity 51.5% (41.3-61.6) and specificity 98.4% (95.3-99.6); Roche, sensitivity 43.6% (33.7-53.8) and specificity 96.2% (92.4-98.5); Lepu, sensitivity 45.5% (35.6-55.8) and specificity 89.2% (83.8-93.3%); Surescreen, sensitivity 28.8% (20.2-38.6) and specificity 97.8% (94.5-99.4%). For specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) <30 in RT-qPCR, all Ag-RDT achieved a sensitivity &#8805;70%. The modelled negative- and positive-predictive value for 1% prevalence were >99% and <50%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When screening unexposed asymptomatic individuals, two Ag-RDTs achieved sensitivity &#8805;80% for specimens with Ct<30 and specificity &#8805;96%.

Since the supply is limited, contact network-based interventions can be most powerful to set an optimal strategy by identifying high-risk individuals or communities. However, due to the high dimension, only partial and noisy network information can be available in practice, especially for dynamical systems where the contact networks are highly time-variant. Furthermore, numerous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 impact considerably the current infectious probability, requiring real-time network updating algorithms. In this study, we propose a sequential network updating approach based on data assimilation techniques to combine different sources of temporal information. We then prioritise the individuals with high-degree or high-centrality, obtained from the assimilated networks, for vaccination. The assimilation-based approach is compared with the standard method (based on partially observed networks) and a random selection strategy in terms of vaccination effectiveness in a SIR model. The numerical comparison is first carried out using real-world face-to-face dynamical networks collected in a high school, following by sequential multi-layer networks, generated relying on the Barabasi-Albert model emulating the department of Computing at Imperial College London in the UK as an example.","Cheng, Sibo; Pain, Christopher C.; Guo, Yi-Ke; Arcucci, Rossella",,115,21

In this sense, the countries have had difficulties in counting the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Errors in reporting results are a common factor, as well as the lack of interoperability between laboratories and governments. Approaches aimed at sending spreadsheets via email expose patients' privacy and have increased the probability of errors due to retyping, which generates a delay in the notification of results. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to design and develop an interoperable platform to report polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 tests from laboratories to the Chilean government. METHODS: The methodology to design and develop the interoperable platform was comprised of six well-structured stages: (1) creation of a minimum data set for PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, (2) modeling processes and end points where institutions interchange information, (3) standards and interoperability design, (4) software development, (5) software testing, and (6) software implementation. RESULTS: The interoperable Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) platform to report PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests from laboratories to the Chilean government was successfully implemented. The platform was designed, developed, tested, and implemented following a structured methodology. The platform's performance to 1000 requests resulted in a response time of 240 milliseconds, throughput of 28.3 requests per second, and process management time of 131 milliseconds. The security was assured through a private network exclusive to the Ministry of Health to ensure confidentiality and integrity. The authorization and authentication of laboratories were implemented with a JavaScript Object Notation Web Token. All the PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests were accessible through an application programming interface gateway with valid credentials and the right access control list. CONCLUSIONS: The platform was implemented and is currently being used by UC Christus Laboratory. The platform is secure. It was tested adequately for confidentiality, secure authorization, authentication, and message integrity. This platform simplifies the reporting of PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and reduces the time and probability of mistakes in counting positive cases. The interoperable solution with FHIR is working successfully and is open for the community, laboratories, and any institution that needs to report PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests.","Guinez-Molinos, Sergio; Andrade, José María; Medina Negrete, Alejandro; Espinoza Vidal, Sonia; Rios, Elvis",JMIR Med Inform,115,16

The current study aimed to (1) conduct a preliminary assessment of patients' perspectives regarding this transition, and (2) explore potential demographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors associated with these perspectives. METHODS: Sixty-three patients with EDs whose treatment was moved to an online format, were surveyed during the COVID-19 lockdown (April-May 2020). A 6-item measure was developed to examine their perspectives toward this transition. Exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) were conducted to confirm the rational-theoretical structure of the measure (Eigenvalue = 3.745, explaining 62.4% of variance). The Cronbach's alpha value was excellent (&#945; = 0.878). Validated questionnaires were used to measure ED symptoms, general psychopathology, therapeutic alliance, and pandemic anxiety, and their associations with our transition-focused scale and telemedicine satisfaction were examined. RESULTS: Mixed views were found regarding the transition, with the majority (68%) stating that they would not choose to continue online therapy given the option. Longer duration of treatment (r = 0.291, p = 0.022), stronger therapeutic alliance (r = 0.293, p = 0.028), and higher COVID-19 anxiety (r = 0.276, p = 0.029) were linked with more positive views towards the transition. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses suggest that patients' perspectives towards the transition can be measured using a Likert-type 6-item scale. Findings highlight the various responses to online treatment and indicate a need to identify patients who may face difficulties in the transition to this newly ubiquitous treatment mode.

Herein, we characterized a novel polysaccharide lyase AlgSH17 from marine bacterium Microbulbifer sp. SH-1. The recombinant enzyme exhibited the maximum activity at 30â¯°C, pHâ¯7.0 and retained 86.20% and 65.43% of its maximum activity at 20â¯°C and 15â¯°C, respectively, indicating that AlgSH17 has an excellent cold-adapted property. The final products of AlgSH17 mainly consisted of monosaccharides with small amounts of oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization (DP) 2-6, suggesting that AlgSH17 possesses both exolytic and endolytic activity. Degradation pattern analysis indicated that AlgSH17 could degrade DPâ¯&#8805;â¯4 oligosaccharides into disaccharides and trisaccharides by cleaving the endo-glycosidic bonds and further digest disaccharides and trisaccharides into monosaccharides in an exolytic manner. Products distribution and molecular docking analysis revealed that AlgSH17 could cleave the glycosidic bonds between -1 and +2 within the substrate. Furthermore, The ABTS+, hydroxyl and DPPH radicals scavenging activity of the enzymatic hydrolysates prepared by AlgSH17 reached up to 91.53%, 81.23% and 61.06%, respectively, and the enzymatic hydrolysates displayed an excellent preservation effect on fresh-cut apples.

METHODS: Between April 1 and May 13, 2020, online questionnaires were distributed among the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons, and Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association cohorts, including people with (n=1181) and without (n=336) depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. The questionnaire contained questions on perceived mental health impact, fear of COVID-19, coping, and four validated scales assessing depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness used in previous waves during 2006-16. Number and chronicity of disorders were based on diagnoses in previous waves. Linear regression and mixed models were done. FINDINGS: The number and chronicity of disorders showed a positive graded dose-response relation, with greater perceived impact on mental health, fear, and poorer coping. Although people with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders scored higher on all four symptom scales than did individuals without these mental health disorders, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, they did not report a greater increase in symptoms during the pandemic. In fact, people without depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders showed a greater increase in symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas individuals with the greatest burden on their mental health tended to show a slight symptom decrease. INTERPRETATION: People with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders are experiencing a detrimental impact on their mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires close monitoring in clinical practice. Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to have further increased symptom severity compared with their prepandemic levels.

In the specific domain of clinical research, the effort to rapidly find responses to health challenges and therapeutic hypotheses has highlighted the need for efficient, timely, ethically correct research. The guidelines published by the Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco have shown that some useful changes are feasible: simple and rapid methods have been implemented to conduct clinical research in the emergency conditions of the pandemic, maintaining high levels of quality. In this perspective, four Italian scientific associations operating in clinical research have worked together to evaluate which measures, among the ones implemented during the pandemic, have been particularly significant and potentially effective under normal conditions or in case of emergencies, and that therefore will be useful in the future as well.","Cagnazzo, Celeste; Besse, Marie-Georges; Manfellotto, Dario; Minghetti, Paola; Cazzaniga, Sara; Cottini, Lorenzo; Fontanella, Andrea; Maruti, Ilaria; Stabile, Stefano; Testoni, Sara; Trogu, Paola; Sinno, Valentina; Gussoni, Gualberto",Tumori,115,27

There is now mounting evidence that a minority of children infected with SARS-CoV2 may experience a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome, called Multisystem inflammatory Syndrome associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (MIS-C). To date no universally agreed approach is available for this disease. MAIN BODY: as Italy is now facing a second hity of COVID-19 cases, we fear a recrudescence of MIS-C cases. We have, therefore, decided to prepare a report that will help clinicians to face this novel and challenging disease. We propose a diagnostic algorithm, to help case definition and guide work-up, and a therapeutic approach. MIS-C should be promptly recognized, based on the presence of systemic inflammation and specific organ involvement. Early treatment is crucial, and it will be based on the combined use of corticosteroids, high-dose immunoglobulins and anti-cytokine treatments, depending on the severity of the disease. Ancillary treatments (such as. aspirin and thrombo-profilaxis) will be also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: we propose a document that will help physicians to diagnose and treat MIS-C patients. Given the level of evidence available and the methodology used, this document should not be interpreted as a guideline; the final decision about the optimal management should still be taken by the caring physician, on an individual basis.","Cattalini, Marco; Taddio, Andrea; Bracaglia, Claudia; Cimaz, Rolando; Paolera, Sara Della; Filocamo, Giovanni; La Torre, Francesco; Lattanzi, Bianca; Marchesi, Alessandra; Simonini, Gabriele; Zuccotti, Gianvincenzo; Zunica, Fiammetta; Villani, Alberto; Ravelli, Angelo",Ital J Pediatr,115,10

Here we develop a random-forest regression model, based on the large volume of real-time observational data during COVID-19, to predict surface-level NO2, O3, and fine particle concentration in the Los Angeles megacity. Our model exhibits high fidelity in reproducing pollutant concentrations in the Los Angeles Basin and identifies major factors controlling each species. During the strictest lockdown period, traffic reduction led to decreases in NO2 and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters <2.5 µm by -30.1% and -17.5%, respectively, but a 5.7% increase in O3 Heavy-duty truck emissions contribute primarily to these variations. Future traffic-emission controls are estimated to impose similar effects as observed during the COVID-19 lockdown, but with smaller magnitude.

DESIGN: Multicenter case-controlled study. SETTING: Two ICUs in The Netherlands and one in Switzerland. PATIENTS: Thirty-four critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients were compared with 33 healthy volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The microcirculatory parameters quantified included total vessel density (mm × mm-2), functional capillary density (mm × mm-2), proportion of perfused vessels (%), capillary hematocrit (%), the ratio of capillary hematocrit to systemic hematocrit, and capillary RBC velocity (µm × s-1). The number of leukocytes in capillary-postcapillary venule units per 4-second image sequence (4 s-1) and capillary RBC microaggregates (4 s-1) was measured. In comparison with healthy volunteers, the microcirculation of coronavirus disease 2019 patients showed increases in total vessel density (22.8 ± sd 5.1 vs 19.9 ± 3.3; p < 0.0001) and functional capillary density (22.2 ± 4.8 vs 18.8 ± 3.1; p < 0.002), proportion of perfused vessel (97.6 ± 2.1 vs 94.6 ± 6.5; p < 0.01), RBC velocity (362 ± 48 vs 306 ± 53; p < 0.0001), capillary hematocrit (5.3 ± 1.3 vs 4.7 ± 0.8; p < 0.01), and capillary-hematocrit-to-systemic-hematocrit ratio (0.18 ± 0.0 vs 0.11 ± 0.0; p < 0.0001). These effects were present in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores less than 10 but not in patients with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores greater than or equal to 10. The numbers of leukocytes (17.6 ± 6.7 vs 5.2 ± 2.3; p < 0.0001) and RBC microaggregates (0.90 ± 1.12 vs 0.06 ± 0.24; p < 0.0001) was higher in the microcirculation of the coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Receiver-operating-characteristics analysis of the microcirculatory parameters identified the number of microcirculatory leukocytes and the capillary-hematocrit-to-systemic-hematocrit ratio as the most sensitive parameters distinguishing coronavirus disease 2019 patients from healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: The response of the microcirculation to coronavirus disease 2019-induced hypoxemia seems to be to increase its oxygen-extraction capacity by increasing RBC availability. Inflammation and hypercoagulation are apparent in the microcirculation by increased numbers of leukocytes and RBC microaggregates.","Favaron, Emanuele; Ince, Can; Hilty, Matthias P; Ergin, Bülent; van der Zee, Philip; Uz, Zühre; Wendel Garcia, Pedro D; Hofmaenner, Daniel A; Acevedo, Claudio T; van Boven, Wim Jan; Akin, Sakir; Gommers, Diederik; Endeman, Henrik",Crit Care Med,115,24

However, the clinical characteristics of patients in other areas around Wuhan, Hubei Province are still unclear. In this study, we performed epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis on these regional cases. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated COVID-19 patients positively confirmed by nucleic acid Q-PCR at Taihe Hospital from January 16 to February 4, 2020. Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3 % developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2 % had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases. Among these patients, 9 cases were associated with family clustering. The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9 %) and cough (21.9 %). The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days. Of the patients, 67.1 % were originally healthy people with no underlying diseases, others mostly had common comorbidities including hypertension (12.3 %) and diabetes (5.5 %), 10.9 % were current smokers, 30.1 % had low white blood cell counts and 45.2 % showed decreased lymphocytes at the first time of diagnosis. CT scans showed that multiple patchy ground glass shadows outside of the patient lungs were commonly observed, and a single sub-pleural sheet of ground glass shadow with enhanced vascular bundles was also found located under the pleura. Patient follow-up to February 14 presented 38.4 % severe cases and 2.7 % critical cases. After follow-up, the parameter of lymphocyte counts below 0.8 × 109/L cannot be used to predict severe and critical groups from the ordinary group, and a lower proportion of smokers and higher proportion of diabetes patients occur in the poor outcome group. Other co-morbidities are observed but did not lead to poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: The epidemiological characteristics of patients in the area around Wuhan, such as Shiyan, at first diagnosis are described as follows: Patients had histories of Wuhan residences in the early stage and family clustering in the later period. The incubation period was relatively long, and the incidence was relatively hidden, but the virulence was relatively low. The initial diagnosis of the patients was mostly ordinary, and the percentage of critical patients who evolved into the ICU during follow-up is 2.7 %, which is lower than the 26.1 % reported by Wuhan city. According to the Shiyan experience, early diagnosis with multiple swaps of the Q-PCR test and timely treatment can reduce the death rate. Diabetes could be one of the risk factors for progression to severe/critical outcomes. No evidence exists that smoking protects COVID-19 patients from developing to severe/critical cases, and the absolute number of lymphocytes at initial diagnosis could not predict the progression risk from severe to critical condition. Multivariate regression analysis should be used to further guide the allocation of clinical resources.","Zheng, Yi; Xiong, Chang; Liu, Yuquan; Qian, Xin; Tang, Yijun; Liu, Liang; Leung, Elaine Lai-Han; Wang, Meifang",Pharmacol Res,115,1

A questionnaire survey was administered to physicians of patients in the Japanese cTTP registry to characterise these outcomes. We analysed 55 patients in remission, with 41 cases receiving prophylactic fresh frozen plasma (FFP; median dosage: 13·2 ml/kg per month) and 14 receiving on-demand FFP. Patients receiving prophylactic FFP were considered as having a more severe form of the disease and had lower platelet counts and higher serum creatinine levels than those receiving on-demand FFP (median 138 × 109 /l vs. 243 × 109 /l, P = 0·003 and 0·71 mg/dl vs 0·58 mg/dl, P = 0·009, respectively). Patients who received prophylactic FFP more commonly developed organ damage, including renal impairment, cerebral infarctions, and cardiac hypofunction, than those who did not. Adverse FFP-related events were seen in 78% of the prophylactic FFP group, with allergic reactions being most common. Since current protocols for FFP administration to the prophylactic FFP group in Japan may be insufficient for preventing cumulative organ damage, a higher dosage of ADAMTS13 supply using recombinant ADAMTS13 agent is needed in these patients.","Sakai, Kazuya; Fujimura, Yoshihiro; Miyata, Toshiyuki; Isonishi, Ayami; Kokame, Koichi; Matsumoto, Masanori",Br. j. haematol,115,21

Due to their varying impacts on the SDGs, the economic activities undertaken by organisations present a key lever for operationalising this SDG-nexus. Yet the interactions between individual economic activities and the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development have not been systematically assessed, thus creating a vital operational bottleneck to achieving the SDGs. This paper conducts a systematic review of 876 articles published between 2005 and 2019 to study the nexus between individual economic activities, sustainable development in general, and the SDGs in specific. It finds that studies on agricultural, industrial, and manufacturing activities predominantly report negative impacts on environmental development, while literature on services activities highlight economic and social contributions. Overall, economic activities are expected to positively impact industrialisation, infrastructure, and innovation [SDG 9], economic productivity [SDG 8], housing and transport [SDG 11], energy [SDG 7], and waste management [SDG 6]. However, negative impacts are widespread, afflicting ecosystems [SDGs 14 and 15], climate change [SDG 13] and human health [SDG 3]. We synthesise positive and negative interactions between individual economic activities and SDG targets and discuss implications for: integrated (nexus) governance approaches to the SDGs; the role of the private sector in promoting sustainable development; and for improving statistical classifications to monitor economic activities’ SDG impacts.","van Zanten, Jan Anton; van Tulder, Rob",Int.

These include: the need to adopt decolonizing, participatory methods that amplify refugee voices; the further development of frameworks for studying the broad impacts of forced migration that go beyond posttraumatic stress disorder; and more translational research informed by longitudinal studies of the course of refugee adaptation. Keeping a human rights advocacy perspective front and center will allow researchers to work in collaborative ways with both refugee communities and receiving societies to develop innovative mental health policy and practice to meet the urgent need for a global response to the challenge of forced migration, which is likely to grow dramatically in the coming years as a result of the impacts of climate change.","Kronick, Rachel; Jarvis, G Eric; Kirmayer, Laurence J",Transcult Psychiatry,115,23
260412,260412,260412,International heterogeneity in coronavirus disease 2019 pediatric mortality rates,14.521199,11.747551,2021,"BACKGROUND: The impact of COVID-19 has been felt worldwide, yet we are still unsure about its full impact. One of the gaps in our current knowledge relates to the long-term mental and physical impact of the infection on affected individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the Netherlands at the end of February 2020, resulting in over 900,000 people testing positive for the virus, over 24,000 hospitalizations, and over 13,000 deaths by the end of January 2021. Although many patients recover from the acute phase of the disease, experience with other virus outbreaks has raised concerns regarding possible late sequelae of the infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an online tool to assess the long-term burden of COVID-19 in patients. METHODS: In this paper, we describe the process of development, assessment, programming, implementation, and use of this new tool: the assessment of burden of COVID-19 (ABCoV) tool. This new tool is based on the well-validated assessment of burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease tool. RESULTS: As of January 2021, the new ABCoV tool has been used in an online patient platform by more than 2100 self-registered patients and another 400 patients in a hospital setting, resulting in over 2500 patients. These patients have submitted the ABCoV questionnaire 3926 times. Among the self-registered patients who agreed to have their data analyzed (n=1898), the number of females was high (n=1153, 60.7%), many were medically diagnosed with COVID-19 (n=892, 47.0%), and many were relatively young with only 7.4% (n=141) being older than 60 years. Of all patients that actually used the tool (n=1517), almost one-quarter (n=356, 23.5%) used the tool twice, and only a small group (n=76, 5.0%) used the tool 6 times. CONCLUSIONS: This new ABCoV tool has been broadly and repeatedly used, and may provide insight into the perceived burden of disease, provide direction for personalized aftercare for people post COVID-19, and help us to be prepared for possible future recurrences.","van Noort, Esther M J; Claessens, Danny; Moor, Catharina C; Berg, Carlijn A L Van Den; Kasteleyn, Marise J; 039, In; t Veen, Johannes C C M; Van Schayck, Onno C P; Chavannes, Niels H",JMIR Form Res,115,16

The relationship between clinical characteristics and antibody response to COVID-19 is not well defined. We investigated predictors of convalescent antibody production and quantified recipient antibody response in a convalescent plasma therapy clinical trial. METHODS: Multivariable analysis of clinical and serological parameters in 103 confirmed COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors 28 days or more following symptom resolution was performed. Mixed-effects regression models with piecewise linear trends were used to characterize serial antibody responses in 10 convalescent plasma recipients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Donor antibody titres ranged from 0 to 1 : 3892 (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)) and 0 to 1 : 3289 (anti-spike). Higher anti-RBD and anti-spike titres were associated with increased age, hospitalization for COVID-19, fever and absence of myalgia (all P < 0.05). Fatigue was significantly associated with anti-RBD (P = 0.03). In pairwise comparison amongst ABO blood types, AB donors had higher anti-RBD and anti-spike than O donors (P < 0.05). No toxicity was associated with plasma transfusion. Non-ECMO recipient anti-RBD antibody titre increased on average 31% per day during the first three days post-transfusion (P = 0.01) and anti-spike antibody titre by 40.3% (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Advanced age, fever, absence of myalgia, fatigue, blood type and hospitalization were associated with higher convalescent antibody titre to COVID-19. Despite variability in donor titre, 80% of convalescent plasma recipients showed significant increase in antibody levels post-transfusion. A more complete understanding of the dose-response effect of plasma transfusion amongst COVID-19-infected patients is needed.","Madariaga, M L L; Guthmiller, J J; Schrantz, S; Jansen, M O; Christensen, C; Kumar, M; Prochaska, M; Wool, G; Durkin-Celauro, A; Oh, W H; Trockman, L; Vigneswaran, J; Keskey, R; Shaw, D G; Dugan, H; Zheng, N-Y; Cobb, M; Utset, H; Wang, J; Stovicek, O; Bethel, C; Matushek, S; Giurcanu, M; Beavis, K G; di Sabato, D; Meltzer, D; Ferguson, M K; Kress, J P; Shanmugarajah, K; Matthews, J B; Fung, J F; Wilson, P C; Alverdy, J C; Donington, J S",J. intern. med,115,1

This study evaluated trends in emergency department (ED) access for seizure-related reasons in the first 8 weeks of lockdown in Italy. METHODS: All ED accesses of children (<14 years of age) at two university hospitals, in Turin and Rome, Italy, between January 6, 2020 and April 21, 2020, were examined and compared with the corresponding periods of 2019. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 lockdown period (February 23-April 21, 2020), there was a 72 % decrease in all pediatric ED accesses over the corresponding 2019 period (n = 3,395 vs n = 12,128), with a 38 % decrease in seizure-related accesses (n = 41 vs n = 66). The observed decrease of seizure-related ED accesses was not accompanied by significant changes in age, sex, type of seizure, or hospitalization rate after the ED visit. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown was accompanied by a sudden decrease in seizure-related hospital emergency visits. School closure, social distancing, reduced risk of infection, and increased parental supervision are some of the factors that might have contributed to the finding.","Davico, Chiara; Marcotulli, Daniele; Lux, Caterina; Calderoni, Dario; Terrinoni, Arianna; Di Santo, Federica; Ricci, Federica; Vittorini, Roberta; Amianto, Federico; Urbino, Antonio; Ferrara, Mauro; Vitiello, Benedetto",Seizure,115,1

RECOMMENDATIONS: The first version on this living guidance focuses on corticosteroids. It contains a strong recommendation for systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe and critical covid-19, and a weak or conditional recommendation against systemic corticosteroids in patients with non-severe covid-19. Corticosteroids are inexpensive and are on the World Health Organisation list of essential medicines. HOW: this guideline was created This guideline reflects an innovative collaboration between the WHO and the MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation, driven by an urgent need for global collaboration to provide trustworthy and living covid-19 guidance. A standing international panel of content experts, patients, clinicians, and methodologists, free from relevant conflicts of interest, produce recommendations for clinical practice. The panel follows standards, methods, processes, and platforms for trustworthy guideline development using the GRADE approach. We apply an individual patient perspective while considering contextual factors (that is, resources, feasibility, acceptability, equity) for countries and healthcare systems. THE EVIDENCE: A living systematic review and network meta-analysis, supported by a prospective meta-analysis, with data from eight randomised trials (7184 participants) found that systemic corticosteroids probably reduce 28 day mortality in patients with critical covid-19 (moderate certainty evidence; 87 fewer deaths per 1000 patients (95% confidence interval 124 fewer to 41 fewer)), and also in those with severe disease (moderate certainty evidence; 67 fewer deaths per 1000 patients (100 fewer to 27 fewer)). In contrast, systemic corticosteroids may increase the risk of death in patients without severe covid-19 (low certainty evidence; absolute effect estimate 39 more per 1000 patients, (12 fewer to 107 more)). Systemic corticosteroids probably reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and harms are likely to be minor (indirect evidence). UNDERSTANDING THE RECOMMENDATIONS: The panel made a strong recommendation for use of corticosteroids in severe and critical covid-19 because there is a lower risk of death among people treated with systemic corticosteroids (moderate certainty evidence), and they believe that all or almost all fully informed patients with severe and critical covid-19 would choose this treatment. In contrast, the panel concluded that patients with non-severe covid-19 would decline this treatment because they would be unlikely to benefit and may be harmed. Moreover, taking both a public health and a patient perspective, the panel warned that indiscriminate use of any therapy for covid-19 would potentially rapidly deplete global resources and deprive patients who may benefit from it most as potentially lifesaving therapy. UPDATES: This is a living guideline. Work is under way to evaluate other interventions. New recommendations will be published as updates to this guideline.

How to cooperate with the government's pandemic-prevention policies and reduce the gap between education and clinical practice represent significant challenges. In this paper, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology (CCUST) is used as an example to show how schools in Taiwan have effectively adapted the fundamentals of nursing practicum programs to the current pandemic using e-learning, group discussions, case analysis, clinical skill practice, and clinical case simulation scenario exercises. The program at CCUST both takes into account the safety of students and has achieved all critical nursing practice goals. After implementation of these adjustments, satisfaction among nursing students with the practicum environment and the clinical instructors was found to be significantly higher for the on-campus clinical practicum than for the off-campus clinical practicum. Furthermore, the results of qualitative data analyses show that nursing students in the on-campus practicum gained significant knowledge and experience and commented positively on their experience. For example, the students indicated that they were satisfied with the simulated clinical environment of the CCC, the teaching strategies and adaptability of the instructor, and the application of virtual reality scenario cases to enhance skill proficiency and learning outcomes. The adjusted nursing clinical practicum described in this paper may be used as a reference to ensure the quality of nursing clinical practicum programs is maintained during epidemics.","Liu, Ying-Mei; Chen, Miao-Chuan; Chung, Fen-Fang; Huang, Hsiang-Ping; Chao, Li-Fen; Chen, Mei-Yen; Jane, Sui-Whi; Fan, Jun-Yu",Hu Li Za Zhi,115,16

However, the molecular mechanisms of PF secondary to COVID-19 haven't been fully elucidated, making the identification of novel strategies for targeted therapy challenging. This study aimed to systematically identify the molecular mechanisms and high-frequency core traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) targeting PF secondary to COVID-19 through network pharmacology and data mining. METHODS: The molecular mechanisms of PF secondary to COVID-19 were identified by mapping the COVID-19 differentially expressed gene and known targets associated with PF, protein-protein interactions network analysis, and enrichment pathway analysis; then the high-frequency core TCM targeting PF secondary to COVID-19 were identified by data mining and ""Key targets related to PF secondary to COVID-19 - Ingredients"" and ""Key ingredients-key herbs"" network analysis; and last we validated the interaction between the key ingredients and key targets by molecular docking. RESULTS: The molecular mechanisms of PF secondary to COVID-19 were mainly related to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, and NF-&#954;B signaling pathway. Among these, cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), TNF, and IL-1ß were identified as the key targets associated with PF secondary to COVID-19. The high-frequency core TCM targeting these key targets were identified, including ingredients of quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, emodin, triptolide, resveratrol, and herb of Polygonum cuspidatum. Finally, our results were validated by quercetin and resveratrol both well docked to IL-6, TNF, and IL-1ß protein, with the estimated docking energy <0 kcal/mol. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the cytokines-related molecular mechanisms of PF secondary to COVID-19, and the high-frequency core TCM against PF by targeting IL-6, TNF, and IL-1ß. Which provides new ideas for the discovery of small molecular compounds with potential therapeutic effects on PF secondary to COVID-19.","Yu, Mei-Xiang; Song, Xin; Ma, Xiao-Qin; Hao, Chen-Xia; Huang, Jing-Jing; Yang, Wan-Hua",Ann Palliat Med,115,20

Long-term survival of a neovascularized bowel segment is an indication that the utilization of this segment as an intestinal graft can be successful. METHODS: To test the proposed surgical technique, 13 Wistar rats were subjected to laparotomy, the jejunum was exposed at 20 cm from the angle of Treitz and a pedicle of greater omentum was isolated. An incision of 6 cm was made along the antimesenteric jejunal border, exposing the submucosa. Omentoenteropexy was performed between the incision of the jejunum and the pedicle of the greater omentum. After seven weeks, the mesentery of the jejunal segment subjected to omentoenteropexy was ligated and isolated from the rest of the jejunum by a complete proximal and distal transversal section. Subsequently, an end-to-end anastomosis was performed to restore the continuity of the bowel. RESULTS: At 10 weeks from the first surgical intervention, the isolated jejunal segment subjected to omentoenteropexy was completely neovascularized and viable.

The pandemic has been a tough test for all European national health systems and their capability to provide an adequate reaction. METHODS: The present work aims to reveal correlations between parameters such as COVID-19 incidence, ICU bed occupancy, ICU excess area, and mortality in Italian regions. Public data for the period of March 1 to July 16, 2020, were analyzed using several mathematical and statistical methods. RESULTS: The analysis defined two separate groups of Italian regions. The examined variables considered within these groups were interlinked and dependent on each other. The regions of the two groups shared the same kind of fitted model (linear) explaining mortality as a function of cumulative incidence, but with higher value of the constant in one group, so characterized by a high intrinsic ""strength"" of the pandemic, certainly playing a major role in the generation of a large number of severe and life-threatening cases. These results are confirmed at European level. Other factors may condition mortality and be linked to incidence, such as ICU saturation and excess. CONCLUSIONS: These quantitative results could be a very helpful tool to set up preventive measures and optimize biomedical interventions before the pandemic, in its recurrent waves, could overcome the reaction capacity of any public health system.","Olivieri, A; Palù, G; Sebastiani, G",Int J Infect Dis,115,1

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study. We prospectively enrolled a multiethnic cohort of asymptomatic adults with T2D and no history, signs, or symptoms of cardiovascular disease. Age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched control subjects were recruited for comparison. Participants underwent bioanthropometric profiling, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance with adenosine stress perfusion imaging. Multivariable linear regression analysis was undertaken to identify independent associations between measures of cardiovascular structure and function and peak VO2. RESULTS: A total of 247 adults with T2D (aged 51.8 ± 11.9 years, 55% males, 37% black or south Asian ethnicity, HbA1c 7.4 ± 1.1% [57 ± 12 mmol/mol], and duration of diabetes 61 [32-120] months) and 78 control subjects were included. Subjects with T2D had increased concentric left ventricular remodelling, reduced myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR), and markedly lower aerobic exercise capacity (peak VO2 18.0 ± 6.6 vs. 27.8 ± 9.0 mL/kg/min; P < 0.001) compared with control subjects. In a multivariable linear regression model containing age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, and systolic blood pressure, only MPR (ß = 0.822; P = 0.006) and left ventricular diastolic filling pressure (E/e') (ß = -0.388; P = 0.001) were independently associated with peak VO2 in subjects with T2D.

Loss of PTGDR signaling might be expected to enhance DC activation and EAE but here we show that PTGDR-/- mice developed only mild signs of MOG35-55 peptide immunization-induced EAE. Compared to wild type mice, PTGDR-/- mice exhibited less demyelination, decreased leukocyte infiltration and diminished microglia activation. These effects resulted from increased pro-inflammatory responses in the lymph nodes, most notably in IL-1ß production, with the unexpected consequence of increased activation-induced apoptosis of MOG35-55 peptide-specific T cells. Conditional deletion of PTGDR on DCs, and not other myeloid cells ameliorated EAE. Together, these results demonstrate the indispensable role that PGD2/PTGDR signaling on DCs has in development of pathogenic T cells in autoimmune demyelination.","Zheng, Jian; Sariol, Alan; Meyerholz, David; Zhang, Qinran; Abrahante Lloréns, Juan E; Narumiya, Shuh; Perlman, Stanley",J Autoimmun,115,1

METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen therapy who received tocilizumab in seven centers across Poland. We assessed on-treatment changes in clinical status and inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included (19 male), with a mean age of 61.7 ± 12.4 years. The mean time from symptom onset to the first tocilizumab dose was 10.5 ± 5.7 days. Clinical status improved within 24 hours in 11 (39%) patients, within one week in 23 (82%) patients, and within two weeks in 25 (89%); one (4%) patient showed no change and two (7%) patients died. Sixteen patients (57%) no longer needed oxygen therapy within a week (p < 0.001). The serum concentrations of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and fibrinogen decreased significantly (p &#8804; 0.001). Lung changes improved in 21 (84%) patients within two weeks of treatment; 19 had minimal or no changes upon final examination.

The US government has sponsored the development of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, for public health emergencies; however, federally supported programs, including the Public Health and Emergency Preparedness program and Cities Readiness Initiative, have historically emphasized antibiotic pill dispensing over mass vaccination. While mass vaccination and pill dispensing programs share similarities, they also have fundamental differences that require dedicated preparedness efforts to address. To date, only a limited number of public assessments of local mass vaccination operational capabilities have been conducted. To fill this gap, we interviewed 37 public health and preparedness officials representing 33 jurisdictions across the United States. We aimed to characterize their existing mass vaccination operational capacities and identify challenges and lessons learned in order to support the efforts of other jurisdictions to improve mass vaccination preparedness. We found that most jurisdictions were not capable of or had not planned for rapidly vaccinating their populations within a short period of time (eg, 1 to 2 weeks). Many also noted that their focus on pill dispensing was driven largely by federal funding requirements and that preparedness efforts for mass vaccination were often self-motivated. Barriers to implementing rapid mass vaccination operations included insufficient personnel qualified to administer vaccinations, increased patient load compared to pill-dispensing modalities, logistical challenges to maintaining cold chain, and operational challenges addressing high-risk populations, including children, pregnant women, and non-English-speaking populations. Considering the expected availability of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine for distribution and dispensing to the public, our findings highlight critical considerations for planning possible future mass vaccination events, including during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Hosangadi, Divya; Shearer, Matthew P; Warmbrod, Kelsey Lane; Kan, Lilly; Cantu, Michelle; Nuzzo, Jennifer",Health Secur,115,16

Neurological complications of this disease are increasingly common. We present one of the first published cases of Guillan-Barré Syndrome (GBS) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States. Design/Methods: Data regarding this case was recorded and reviewed through use of the Computerized Patient Record System from the Veteran's Affairs Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction assays met federal guidelines for clinical use. Results: A 72 year-old male presented after a fall with one day of progressive distal limb weakness and numbness in the setting of a recent diarrheal illness. Exam demonstrated tetraparesis, distal sensation loss, and areflexia. Admission nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab was positive. Cerebrospinal fluid studies revealed albuminocytological dissociation and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing of fluid was negative. Neurophysiologic studies performed supported a diagnosis of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy subtype of GBS. His course was complicated by respiratory failure, requiring intubation and eventual tracheostomy, dysautonomia, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Patient received a course of intravenous immunoglobulin and with near complete resolution 90 days after symptom onset. Conclusions: As a threat to global health, SARS-CoV-2 needs to be recognized as a possible trigger for GBS and patients should be screened and tested, as deemed appropriate by their care team.

Outreach included: local production and dissemination of 10 culturally relevant safety videos, 10 risk, prevention, and safety postcard messages, 3 virtual forums, and PPE kit distribution via the network and their distribution venues. Communication mediums included social media posts (i.e., Facebook and YouTube), network email distribution lists, and postcards distributed along with PPE kits. Outreach activities were evaluated via an online survey, reach of social media posts, and PPE distribution. Working through the organizational network, the WGHC reached a combined total of 30,310 community members with educational materials. Forty-four outreach events were held during this period and over 8000 PPE kits were distributed. The online survey, distributed through the network, yielded more than 400 completed questionnaires. This tool was used to gain insights on community perceptions of COVID-19 safety barriers and media messages. The activation of the network as an approach for rapid response to an emerging public health crisis greatly expanded the reach of the WGHC. The WGHC is working to institutionalize the network to address future emerging health threats, as well as the dissemination of health information more generally.","Hall, Marla B; Winterbauer, Nancy L; Klinger, Courtney; Tucker-McLaughlin, Mary; Rafferty, Ann; Greene, Gwendolyn; Dodson, Savannah",J. community health,115,1

Currently, in this region, health technology is frequently adopted from HICs without local research and HTA. It also discusses the importance of local co-creation of technology to reflect the needs of users within a culturally appropriate setting. It is important for LMIC-based researchers to understand the potential of PPI/E and how it can contribute to it to improve health care and research, especially perhaps in the era of COVID-19.","Simkhada, Bibha; van Teijlingen, Edwin; Naheed, Aliya; Warren, Angela; Green, Sue",Int J Technol Assess Health Care,115,10

Previous studies reported pulmonary embolism (PE) in severe COVID-19 patients. Aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of symptomatic PE in COVID-19 patients and to identify the clinical, radiological or biological characteristics associated with PE. PATIENTS/METHODS: We conducted a retrospective nested case-control study in 2 French hospitals. Controls were matched in a 1:2 ratio on the basis of age, sex and center. PE patients with COVID-19 were compared to patients in whom PE was ruled out (CTPA controls) and in whom PE has not been investigated (CT controls). RESULTS: PE was suspected in 269 patients among 1042 COVID-19 patients, and confirmed in 59 patients (5.6%). Half of PE was diagnosed at COVID-19 diagnosis. PE patients did not differ from CT and CTPA controls for thrombosis risk factors. PE patients more often required invasive ventilation compared to CTPA controls (odds ratio (OR) 2.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-5.84) and to CT controls (OR 8.07; 95% CI 2.70-23.82). PE patients exhibited more extensive parenchymal lesions (>50%) than CT controls (OR 3.90; 95% CI 1.54-9.94). D-dimer levels were 5.1 (95% CI 1.90-13.76) times higher in PE patients than CTPA controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a PE prevalence in COVID-19 patients close to 5% in the whole population and to 20% of the clinically suspected population. PE seems to be associated with more extensive lung damage and to require more frequently invasive ventilation.","Planquette, Benjamin; Le Berre, Alice; Khider, Lina; Yannoutsos, Alexandra; Gendron, Nicolas; de Torcy, Marie; Mohamedi, Nassim; Jouveshomme, Stéphane; Smadja, David M; Lazareth, Isabelle; Goudot, Guillaume; Fournier, Laure; Bruel, Cédric; Diehl, Jean Luc; Mourad, Jean-Jacques; Meyer, Guy; Priollet, Pascal; Messas, Emmanuel; Sanchez, Olivier; Beaussier, Hélène; Mirault, Tristan; Zins, Marc; Chatelier, Gilles; Emmerich, Joseph",Thromb Res,115,30

Nevertheless, they commonly exhibit considerable sensitivity to some input parameters' variance which results in large fluctuations in the generated projections, thus rendering predictions difficult and even risky. In this work we examine a novel meta-projections-based approach which allows us to evaluate the model's current trends and assess whether generated projections are at a transient or stable state. Meta-projections can be extracted from graphs of successive estimations of model's parameters and resulting projections, over a sequence of days being gradually added to the employed model. In other words, projections are carried out on truncated time series of cumulative numbers of confirmed cases with increased lengths at each successive evaluation. This allows us to trace the values of model parameters over a certain period of time and examine their trends which may converge to specific values for settled-growth cases or exhibit a changing or even an erratic behavior for cases that undergo epidemiological transitions and/or are inappropriately described by the current model instance(s). We have computed meta-projections and compared our findings for countries at different stages of the epidemic with stable or unstable behaviors and increasing or decreasing numbers of confirmed cases. Our results indicate that meta-projections can aid researchers in assessing the appropriateness of their relevant models and in effect decrease the uncertainty in their estimations of an epidemic's severity and development.","Xydas, Evagoras; Kostas, Konstantinos",,115,1

There is concern for increased substance use motivated by coping with stress, anxiety, depression, and boredom-all of which may be elevated during the pandemic. The current study examined intraindividual changes (from pre-COVID to during COVID) in young adults' alcohol and marijuana use, perceptions of peers' use (i.e., norms), and motives for use. METHODS: A community sample of young adults (N = 572; Mage= 25.14; 60.8% women) was recruited in Washington State. By using a repeated-measures design, data were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020) and again during the initial acute phase of the pandemic (April/May of 2020). RESULTS: Young adults, on average, increased alcohol use frequency but decreased the amount consumed per drinking occasion. No changes in marijuana use were identified. Young adults (on average) perceived that peers had increased the frequency and total amount of alcohol use and perceived that peers were engaging in heavier marijuana use than prior to COVID-19. For alcohol use motives, there was a significant increase in depression coping motives and significant decreases in social, enhancement, and conformity motives. Boredom motives for marijuana use significantly increased, while celebration motives decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Using a prospective design with a sample initially recruited in Washington State, these data indicate that (a) young adults' patterns of alcohol use may have changed, (b) young adults tend to think that peers are engaging in heavier alcohol/marijuana use than before the pandemic, and (c) motives for using alcohol/marijuana may have changed during the pandemic.","Graupensperger, Scott; Fleming, Charles B; Jaffe, Anna E; Rhew, Isaac C; Patrick, Megan E; Lee, Christine M",J Adolesc Health,115,11

DESIGN: A retrospective, observational, correlational study of existing deidentified Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant data using the Omaha System and its equivalent, Simplified Omaha System Terms. METHODS: We used three samples to explore for patterns of resilience: pre-COVID-19 community-generated data (N = 383), pre-COVID-19 clinical documentation data (N = 50,509), and during-COVID-19 community-generated data (N = 102). Community participants used the My Strengths + My Health (MSMH) app to generate the two community datasets. The clinical data were obtained from the Omaha System Data Collaborative. We operationalized resilience as Omaha System Status scores of 4 (minimal signs or symptoms) or 5 (no signs or symptoms) as a discrete strengths measure for each of 42 Omaha System problem concepts. We used visualization techniques and standard descriptive and inferential statistics for analysis. FINDINGS: It was feasible to examine resilience, operationalized as strengths by problem concept, within existing Omaha System or Simplified Omaha System Terms (MSMH) data. We identified several patterns indicating strengths and resilience that were consistent with literature related to community connectedness for community participants, and sleep for individuals in the clinical data. CONCLUSIONS: When used consistently, the Omaha System within MSMH enabled robust data collection for a comprehensive, holistic assessment, resulting in better whole-person data including strengths, and enabled us to discover a potentially useful approach for defining resilience in new ways using standardized nursing data. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The notion that how we assess individuals and communities (i.e., the completeness of our assessments in relation to whole-person health) determines what we can know about resilience is seemingly in opposition to the critical need to decrease documentation burden, despite the potential to shift from a problem deficit-based assessment to one of strengths and resilience. However, a patient-facing comprehensive assessment that includes resilience and the social determinants of health can provide a transformative, whole-person platform for strengths-based care and population management.","Monsen, Karen A; Austin, Robin R; Goparaju, Bhavana; Clarence Jones, Robert; Mathiason, Michelle A; Pirsch, Anna; Eder, Milton",J Nurs Scholarsh,115,9

We aimed to summarize the possible relationship between gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV) and endoscopic GERD according to Lyon Consensus using meta-analysis of studies done in Asia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comprehensive searches of PubMed, WOS, Embase, SinoMed, and CNKI databases were completed to identify eligible studies published before September 22, 2019. A total of 237 articles have been reviewed and 2 reviewers independently evaluated the eligibility for inclusion, extracted, and analyzed the statistical data. The pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were measured for the association. Random-effects models were used when observing significant heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included and we found that abnormal GEFV (III and IV) could be associated with RE and the correlation become stronger as the grade increases (RE-A vs. controls-RR: 2.186, 95% CI: 1.560-3.064, P<0.001; RE-B vs. RE-A-RR: 1.268, 95% CI: 1.128-1.425, P<0.001; RE-C vs. RE-B-RR: 1.181, 95% CI: 1.000-1.395, P=0.049; RE-D vs. RE-C-RR: 1.471, 95% CI: 1.151-1.879, P=0.002).

CONCLUSION: Abnormal GEFV could provide useful information for reflux conditions, but it could not distinguish confirmatory GERD from low-grade RE under the upper endoscopy.","Bao, Yun; Chen, Xiaosu; Xu, Ying; Wang, Yan; Lin, Lin; Tang, Yurong",J. clin. gastroenterol,115,16

Italian Government ordered a national lockdown on the 9 th March 2020, forcing the population to severe restrictive isolation measures. The burden on mental health of the medical emergency related to COVID19 is progressively been revealed. Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), is estimated to represent 1-3% of patients admitted with suspected STEMI, mostly affecting elderly women with emotional stress and/or acute illness preceding the presentation. Comparing patients hospitalised from February to May 2020 with those of the corresponding period in 2019 we observed a significantly increased number of TTS diagnosis in 2020 (11 patients vs 3 in 2019), especially during the first period of lockdown. The only two males were patients with COVID-19 and were the only two who died in hospital. At psychological examination all patients enrolled report to have lived a particularly stressful experience at IES-R in the last year, without presenting the symptoms of a post-traumatic stress disorder.

Developing countries that mostly have a weaker healthcare system and insufficient resources are likely to be the most hardly affected by the pandemic. Cancers are frequently diagnosed in late stages with higher case-fatality rates compared to those in high-income countries. Delayed diagnosis, lack of cancer awareness, low adherence to treatment, and unequal or limited access to treatment are among the challenging factors of cancer management in developing countries. Elective cancer surgeries are often considered to be postponed during COVID-19 pandemic to preserve valuable hospital resources such as personal protection equipment, hospital bed, intensive care unit capacity, and manpower to screen and treat the affected individuals. However, specific considerations to defer cancer surgery in developing countries might need to be carefully adjusted to counterbalance between preventing COVID-19 transmission and preserving patients 'long-term life expectancy and quality of life.","Anwar, Sumadi Lukman; Harahap, Wirsma Arif; Aryandono, Teguh",Int J Surg,115,10

In this work, we propose a new framework for monitoring the social-distance using end-to-end Deep Learning, to detect crowds violating the social-distance in wide areas where important occlusions may be present. Our framework consists in the creation of a new ground truth based on the ground truth density maps and the proposal of two different solutions, a density-map-based and a segmentation-based, to detect the crowds violating the social-distance constrain. We assess the results of both approaches by using the generated ground truth from the PET2009 and CityStreet datasets.

E-health security risks have also risen significantly with the rise in the use of telehealth. This paper addresses one of e-health's key concerns, namely security. Secret sharing is a cryptographic method to ensure reliable and secure access to information. To eliminate the constraint that in the existing secret sharing schemes, this paper presents Tree Parity Machine (TPM) guided patients' privileged based secure sharing. This is a new secret sharing technique that generates the shares using a simple mask based operation. This work considers addressing the challenges presents in the original secret sharing scheme. This proposed technique enhances the security of the existing scheme. This research introduces a concept of privileged share in which among k number of shares one share should come from a specific recipient (patient) to whom a special privilege is given to recreate the original information. In the absence of this privileged share, the original information cannot be reconstructed. This technique also offers TPM based exchange of secret shares to prevent Man-In-The-Middle-Attack (MITM). Here, two neural networks receive common inputs and exchange their outputs. In some steps, it leads to full synchronization by setting the discrete weights according to the specific rule of learning. This synchronized weight is used as a common secret session key for transmitting the secret shares. The proposed method has been found to produce attractive results that show that the scheme achieves a great degree of protection, reliability, and efficiency and also comparable to the existing secret sharing scheme.","Sarkar, Arindam; Sarkar, Moumita",Multimed Tools Appl,115,21

METHODS AND RESULTS: In a single-centre cross-sectional observational study, we included 355 patients with AMI containing ST-elevation or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI), admitted for emergency cardiac catheterization between January and April 2020 and the equivalent time in 2019. During the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic (e-COV) in Berlin (March and April 2020), admissions for AMI halved compared with those in the pre-Covid-19 time (January and February 2020; pre-COV) and with those in the corresponding months in 2019. However, mortality for AMI increased substantially from 5.2% pre-COV to 17.7% (P < 0.05) during e-COV. Severity of presentation for AMI was more pronounced during e-COV [increased levels of cardiac enzymes, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), an increase in the need of inotropic support by 25% (P < 0.01)], while patients' demographic and angiographic characteristics did not differ between pre-COV and e-COV. Time from symptom onset to first medical contact was prolonged in all AMI during e-COV (presentation > 72 h +21% in STEMI, p = 0.04 and presentation > 72 h in NSTEMI +22%, p = 0.02). Door to balloon time was similar in STEMI patients, while time from first medical contact to revascularization was significantly delayed in NSTEMI patients (p = 0.02). Major cardiac complications after AMI occurred significantly more often, and cardiac recovery was worse in e-COV than in pre-COV, demonstrated by a significantly lower LVEF (39 ± 16 vs. 46 ± 16, p < 0.05) at hospital discharge and substantially higher NTproBNP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 outbreak affects hospital admissions for acute coronary syndromes. During the first phase of the pandemia, significantly less patients with AMI were admitted, but those admitted presented with a more severe phenotype and had a higher mortality, more complications, and a worse short-term outcome. Therefore, our data indicate that Covid-19 had relevant impact on non-infectious disease states, such as acute coronary syndromes.","Primessnig, Uwe; Pieske, Burkert M; Sherif, Mohammad",ESC Heart Fail,115,23

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection, comparing standard of care along with Convalescent Plasma with or without Tocilizumab (CP vs. CPT). RESULTS: A total of 110 patients were enrolled with an overall mean age of 50 ± 16 years. Patients on CPT were more likely to have had acute respiratory distress syndrome (77% vs. 42%; p < 0.001), sepsis (9.7% vs. 0; p = 0.036), chest X-ray abnormealities (71% vs. 44%; p = 0.004), intensive care unit admission (84% vs. 56%; p = 0.001) as well as being on mechanical ventilation (79% vs. 48%; p = 0.001). After CPT treatment, all measured inflammatory markers, except interleukine-6, showed an overall steady decline over time (all p-values <0.05) and the ventilatory parameters showed significant improvement of PaO2/FiO2 ratio from 127 to 188 within 7 days (p < 0.001). Additionally, 52% (32/62) of the patients had favorable outcome, either as improvement of ventilatory parameters or extubation within 14 days of hospitalization. However, mortality rate in those on CPT was higher than those who received CP alone (24% vs. 8.3%; p = 0.041).

Endothelial VWF is stored in cell-specific secretory granules, Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), organelles generated in a wide range of lengths (0.5-5.0 µm). WPB size responds to physiological cues and pharmacological treatment, and VWF secretion from shortened WPBs dramatically reduces platelet and plasma VWF adhesion to an endothelial surface. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that WPB-shortening represented a novel target for antithrombotic therapy. Our objective was to determine whether compounds exhibiting this activity do exist. METHODS: Using a microscopy approach coupled to automated image analysis, we measured the size of WPB bodies in primary human endothelial cells treated with licensed compounds for 24 hours. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A novel approach to identification of antithrombotic compounds generated a significant number of candidates with the ability to shorten WPBs. In vitro assays of two selected compounds confirm that they inhibit the pro-hemostatic activity of secreted VWF. This set of compounds acting at a very early stage of the hemostatic process could well prove to be a useful adjunct to current antithrombotic therapeutics. Further, in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with a considerable fraction of critically ill COVID-19 patients affected by hypercoagulability, these WPB size-reducing drugs might also provide welcome therapeutic leads for frontline clinicians and researchers.","Ferraro, Francesco; Patella, Francesca; Costa, Joana R; Ketteler, Robin; Kriston-Vizi, Janos; Cutler, Daniel F",J. thromb. haemost,115,24

To deal with this array of threats, the immune system has evolved to include a myriad of specialised cell types, communicating molecules and functional responses. The immune system is always active, carrying out surveillance, but its activity is enhanced if an individual becomes infected. This heightened activity is accompanied by an increased rate of metabolism, requiring energy sources, substrates for biosynthesis and regulatory molecules, which are all ultimately derived from the diet. A number of vitamins (A, B6, B12, folate, C, D and E) and trace elements (zinc, copper, selenium, iron) have been demonstrated to have key roles in supporting the human immune system and reducing risk of infections. Other essential nutrients including other vitamins and trace elements, amino acids and fatty acids are also important. Each of the nutrients named above has roles in supporting antibacterial and antiviral defence, but zinc and selenium seem to be particularly important for the latter. It would seem prudent for individuals to consume sufficient amounts of essential nutrients to support their immune system to help them deal with pathogens should they become infected. The gut microbiota plays a role in educating and regulating the immune system. Gut dysbiosis is a feature of disease including many infectious diseases and has been described in COVID-19. Dietary approaches to achieve a healthy microbiota can also benefit the immune system. Severe infection of the respiratory epithelium can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterised by excessive and damaging host inflammation, termed a cytokine storm. This is seen in cases of severe COVID-19. There is evidence from ARDS in other settings that the cytokine storm can be controlled by n-3 fatty acids, possibly through their metabolism to specialised pro-resolving mediators.","Calder, Philip C",BMJ Nutr Prev Health,115,16

As access to whole-genome sequencing has grown, greater amounts of molecular data have helped improve the ability to detect and track outbreaks of diseases such as COVID-19, investigate transmission chains and explore large-scale population dynamics, such as the spread of antibiotic resistance. However, the wide adoption of whole-genome sequencing also poses new challenges for public-health agencies that must adapt to support a new set of expertise, which means that the capacity to perform genomic data assembly and analysis has not expanded as widely as the adoption of sequencing itself. In this Perspective, we make recommendations for developing an accessible, unified informatic ecosystem to support pathogen genomic analysis in public-health agencies across income settings. We hope that the creation of this ecosystem will allow agencies to effectively and efficiently share data, workflows and analyses and thereby increase the reproducibility, accessibility and auditability of pathogen genomic analysis while also supporting agency autonomy.","Black, Allison; MacCannell, Duncan R; Sibley, Thomas R; Bedford, Trevor",Nat Med,115,4

Many researchers attempted to solve this problem using deep reinforcement learning due to its efficient inherence that can handle the property of financial markets. However, most of them can hardly be applicable to real-world trading since they ignore or extremely simplify the realistic constraints of transaction costs. These constraints have a significantly negative impact on portfolio profitability. In our research, a conservative level of transaction fees and slippage are considered for the realistic experiment. To enhance the performance under those constraints, we propose a novel Deterministic Policy Gradient with 2D Relative-attentional Gated Transformer (DPGRGT) model. Applying learnable relative positional embeddings for the time and assets axes, the model better understands the peculiar structure of the financial data in the portfolio optimization domain. Also, gating layers and layer reordering are employed for stable convergence of Transformers in reinforcement learning. In our experiment using U.S. stock market data of 20 years, our model outperformed baseline models and demonstrated its effectiveness.","Kim, Tae Wan; Khushi, Matloob",,115,23

The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study on 376 patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza, Italy, from March to July 2020. All patients answered a phone questionnaire providing information on age, sex, smoking status, and clinical characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through logistic regression models including relevant covariates. RESULTS: The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients was 33.5 and 35.6%, respectively. Olfactory dysfunctions were significantly directly associated with current smoking and history of allergy, the multivariable ORs being 6.53 (95% CI 1.16-36.86) for current smokers versus never smokers, and 1.89 (95% CI 1.05-3.39) for those with an allergy compared to those without any allergy. Respiratory allergy in particular was significantly associated with olfactory dysfunctions (multivariable OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.02-5.17). Significant inverse associations were observed for patients aged 60 years or more (multivariable OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.57) and hospitalization (multivariable OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.89). Considering gustatory dysfunctions, after allowance of other variables a significant direct association was found for respiratory allergies (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.03-4.86), and an inverse association was found only for hospitalization (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.76). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that current smoking and history of allergy (particularly respiratory) significantly increase the risk for smell loss in COVID-19 patients; the latter is also significantly associated to taste loss. Hospitalization has an inverse association with the risk of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, suggesting that these may be symptoms characteristics of less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Galluzzi, Francesca; Rossi, Veronica; Bosetti, Cristina; Garavello, Werner",Neuroepidemiology,115,24

A complex regulatory network is needed to preserve a population of naïve cells over lifetime that exhibit sufficient diversity of antigen receptors to respond to new antigens, while also sustaining immune memory. In parallel, cells need to maintain their proliferative potential and the plasticity to differentiate into different functional lineages. Initial signs of waning immune competence emerge after 50 years of age, with increasing clinical relevance in the 7th-10th decade of life. Morbidity and mortality from infections increase, as drastically exemplified by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Many vaccines, such as for the influenza virus, are poorly effective to generate protective immunity in older individuals. Age-associated changes occur at the level of the T-cell population as well as the functionality of its cellular constituents. The system highly relies on the self-renewal of naïve and memory T cells, which is robust but eventually fails. Genetic and epigenetic modifications contribute to functional differences in responsiveness and differentiation potential. To some extent, these changes arise from defective maintenance; to some, they represent successful, but not universally beneficial adaptations to the aging host. Interventions that can compensate for the age-related defects and improve immune responses in older adults are increasingly within reach.","Zhang, Huimin; Weyand, Cornelia M; Goronzy, Jörg J",FEBS j,115,16

The treatment of critically ill patients is a challenging task, without identified credible predictors of mortality. Methods: We performed an analysis of 160 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit between June 23, 2020, and October 2, 2020, in University Hospital Center Bezanijska kosa, Belgrade, Serbia. Patients on invasive, noninvasive ventilation and high flow oxygen therapy with moderate to severe ARDS, according to the Berlin definition of ARDS, were selected for the study. Demographic data, past medical history, laboratory values, and CT severity score were analyzed to identify predictors of mortality. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess potential predictors of mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Results: The mean patient age was 65.6 years (range, 29-92 years), predominantly men, 68.8%. 107 (66.9%) patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation, 31 (19.3%) on noninvasive, and 22 (13.8%) on high flow oxygen therapy machine. The median total number of ICU days was 10 (25th to 75th percentile: 6-18), while the median total number of hospital stay was 18 (25th to 75th percentile: 12-28). The mortality rate was 60% (96/160). Univariate logistic regression analysis confirmed the significance of age, CRP, and lymphocytes at admission to hospital, serum albumin, D-dimer, and IL-6 at admission to ICU, and CT score. Serum albumin, D-dimer, and IL-6 at admission to ICU were independently associated with mortality in the final multivariate analysis. Conclusion: In the present study of 160 consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS, IL-6, serum albumin, and D-dimer at admission to ICU, accompanied by chest CT severity score, were marked as independent predictors of mortality.","Popadic, Viseslav; Klasnja, Slobodan; Milic, Natasa; Rajovic, Nina; Aleksic, Aleksandra; Milenkovic, Marija; Crnokrak, Bogdan; Balint, Bela; Todorovic-Balint, Milena; Mrda, Davor; Zdravkovic, Darko; Toskovic, Borislav; Brankovic, Marija; Markovic, Olivera; Bjekic-Macut, Jelica; Djuran, Predrag; Memon, Lidija; Brajkovic, Milica; Todorovic, Zoran; Hadzi-Djokic, Jovan; Jovanovic, Igor; Nikolic, Dejan; Zdravkovic, Marija",Oxid Med Cell Longev,115,10

N95 respirators are commonly used to protect healthcare workers from respiratory pathogens, including the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and are increasingly employed by other frontline workers and the general public. Under routine circumstances, these masks are disposable, single-use items, but extended use and reuse practices have been broadly enacted to alleviate critical supply shortages during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Although extended-time single use presents a low risk of pathogen transfer, repeated donning and doffing of potentially contaminated masks presents increased risk of pathogen transfer. Therefore, efficient and safe decontamination methods for N95 masks are needed to reduce the risk of reuse and mitigate local supply shortages. Here, we review the available literature concerning use of germicidal ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light to decontaminate N95 masks. We propose a practical method for repeated point-of-use decontamination using commercially available UV-C cross-linker boxes from molecular biology laboratories to expose each side of the mask to 800-1200 mJ/cm2 of UV-C. We measure the dose that penetrated to the interior of the respirators and model the potential germicidal action on coronaviruses. Our experimental results, in combination with modeled data, suggest that such a UV-C treatment cycle should induce a >3-log-order reduction in viral bioburden on the surface of the respirators and a 2-log-order reduction throughout the interior. We find that a dose 50-fold greater does not impair filtration or fit of 3M 8210 N95 masks, indicating that decontamination can be performed repeatedly. As such, UV-C germicidal irradiation is a practical strategy for small-scale point-of-use decontamination of N95s.","Huber, Thomas; Goldman, Olivia; Epstein, Alexander E; Stella, Gianna; Sakmar, Thomas P",Biophys. j,115,16

The aim of this paper is to explore and discuss the experiences, perspectives, challenges and opportunities of Library and Information Science Educators (LISE) during the pandemic. The aim is articulated in the following three research questions: How is the COVID-19 pandemic experienced by LISE and in research? What are the perceptions formed during the period? And what are the challenges and opportunities?Design/methodology/approachThis is an interpretivist qualitative study informed by disaster management theories. The study involved the content analysis of existing literature with a focus on COVID-19 and higher education, particularly LISE, in conjunction with an open-ended email questionnaire that was sent to selected LIS educators/faculty/staff from major LIS Schools from eight sub-Saharan African countries. The author used personal experiences and observation to supplement the data and the interpretation.FindingsResults show more similarities than differences in how the COVID-19 pandemic is experienced and perceived, as well as the challenges and opportunities that it brings to the sector. As a whole, political factors are most pronounced, meaning that administration and decision-making need more attention in the sector. Also notable is that opportunities are mostly linked to technological factors, which will determine the “new normal” for LISE in the future. Almost all the narratives focused on the middle level of (during) the disaster life cycle, which is understandable as the complete cycle of the disaster is yet to come, likely when COVID-19 ceases to be a threat.Research limitations/implicationsThe sample was small, as related studies focus more on COVID-19 and higher education, with hardly any focusing on LISE. The COVID-19 pandemic has not ended, so the disaster management life cycle cannot be fully exploited. Furthermore, the author’s categorization of responses within PEST was largely judgmental.Practical implicationsNew research, teaching and learning developmental paths have been created for LISE. The study provides practical reflection on the effects of COVID-19 on the sector and HEIs that can inform discourse and responses to the pandemic.Originality/valueThe study explores a new research domain in LISE and due to limited research in the domain brings together important voices/narratives – based on their experiences – of LIS educators in Africa on the research area. Further, it proposes the future of LISE under COVID-19 within the 4IR framework.","Ocholla, Dennis N.",Library Management,115,23

Many orthopaedic departments suspended elective surgery, and some re-deployed orthopaedic residents to stressful nonorthopaedic tasks; long hours were commonplace. Stress-reaction symptoms such as anxiety and depression have been reported in about 10% of healthcare workers during previous infectious-diseases outbreaks (including the Ebola virus), but little is known about the psychological needs of residents faced with this global disaster. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Have anxiety and depression symptoms among orthopaedic residents worsened from the period before to the period after the lockdown in Italy? (2) Are there differences in anxiety and depression symptoms between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not? METHODS: The Italian Association of Orthopaedic and Traumatology Residents is comprised of 365 members who were recruited through the organization's mailing list; they were asked to respond to a survey about their health and well-being at the beginning and end of the first COVID-19 Italian lockdown (March 9, 2020 to May 3, 2020). For the survey's development, 10 orthopaedic surgery residents at the Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro were preliminarily asked to answer the surveys, and both face validity and content validity were tested. The test-retest reliability was 0.9. Impact on and future concerns about family life and daily work practice, as well as sleep disorders, were investigated. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which includes 14 questions (seven for anxiety, HADS-A; and seven for depression, HADS-D) on a Likert scale (0-3); thus, a patient can have a score between 0 and 21 for either the HADS-A or HADS-D, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of anxiety or depression. Previously reported minimum clinically important differences ranged from 1.5 to 1.7. For each scale, total scores of &#8804; 7 , 8 to 10, and &#8805; 11 were taken to represent normal, borderline, or abnormal level of anxiety or depression, respectively. Overall, 75% (272 of 365) of residents completed the survey at both the beginning and end of the lockdown; 72% (196 of 272) were men, the mean ± SD age was 30 ± 3 years, 72% (197 of 272) worked in a hospital setting with patients who were COVID-19-positive, 20% (55 of 272) served in a COVID-19 department, and 5% (7 of 139) tested positive for COVID-19 by nasal-pharyngeal swab. Overall, 9% (24 of 272) of residents had family members who contracted COVID-19, and 3% (8 of 272) had a relative who died. Because of the risk of possible COVID-19 exposure, 18% (48 of 272) of residents needed to temporarily change their household given that social distancing was considered the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: At the end of the lockdown, orthopaedic residents exhibited signs of worsening anxiety and depression as measured by the overall HADS score (median 9 [IQR 5 to 14] versus median 11 [IQR 6 to 17.8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; effect size [r] = -0.24; p < 0.001) as well as in the depression subscale (median 4 [IQR 2 to 7] versus median 5.5 [IQR 3 to 8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; r = -0.36; p < 0.001). We found no difference in the development of anxiety or depression between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not, as demonstrated by comparing the change in HADS scores between these groups (median 1 [IQR -3 to 4] versus median 1 [IQR -2 to 4] in HADS change score over time; median difference 0 [95% CI -1 to 2]; r = -0.03; p = 0.61). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the daily practice of orthopaedic residents and has had important, far-reaching consequences on their health and well-being, including social implications. Residents showed higher anxiety and depression symptoms at the end of the lockdown. No differences were found in changes of anxiety and depression, over time, for residents who worked in a COVID-19 department compared with those who did not. The evaluation of anxiety and depression through standardized questionnaires could help to identify residents at risk of higher psychological distress who could be referred to regular psychological counseling as a possible prevention strategy during stressful times. Future studies should confirm the long-term effects of these findings.

Many orthopaedic departments suspended elective surgery, and some re-deployed orthopaedic residents to stressful nonorthopaedic tasks; long hours were commonplace. Stress-reaction symptoms such as anxiety and depression have been reported in about 10% of healthcare workers during previous infectious-diseases outbreaks (including the Ebola virus), but little is known about the psychological needs of residents faced with this global disaster. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Have anxiety and depression symptoms among orthopaedic residents worsened from the period before to the period after the lockdown in Italy? (2) Are there differences in anxiety and depression symptoms between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not? METHODS: The Italian Association of Orthopaedic and Traumatology Residents is comprised of 365 members who were recruited through the organization's mailing list; they were asked to respond to a survey about their health and well-being at the beginning and end of the first COVID-19 Italian lockdown (March 9, 2020 to May 3, 2020). For the survey's development, 10 orthopaedic surgery residents at the Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro were preliminarily asked to answer the surveys, and both face validity and content validity were tested. The test-retest reliability was 0.9. Impact on and future concerns about family life and daily work practice, as well as sleep disorders, were investigated. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which includes 14 questions (seven for anxiety, HADS-A; and seven for depression, HADS-D) on a Likert scale (0-3); thus, a patient can have a score between 0 and 21 for either the HADS-A or HADS-D, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of anxiety or depression. Previously reported minimum clinically important differences ranged from 1.5 to 1.7. For each scale, total scores of &#8804; 7 , 8 to 10, and &#8805; 11 were taken to represent normal, borderline, or abnormal level of anxiety or depression, respectively. Overall, 75% (272 of 365) of residents completed the survey at both the beginning and end of the lockdown; 72% (196 of 272) were men, the mean ± SD age was 30 ± 3 years, 72% (197 of 272) worked in a hospital setting with patients who were COVID-19-positive, 20% (55 of 272) served in a COVID-19 department, and 5% (7 of 139) tested positive for COVID-19 by nasal-pharyngeal swab. Overall, 9% (24 of 272) of residents had family members who contracted COVID-19, and 3% (8 of 272) had a relative who died. Because of the risk of possible COVID-19 exposure, 18% (48 of 272) of residents needed to temporarily change their household given that social distancing was considered the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: At the end of the lockdown, orthopaedic residents exhibited signs of worsening anxiety and depression as measured by the overall HADS score (median 9 [IQR 5 to 14] versus median 11 [IQR 6 to 17.8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; effect size [r] = -0.24; p < 0.001) as well as in the depression subscale (median 4 [IQR 2 to 7] versus median 5.5 [IQR 3 to 8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; r = -0.36; p < 0.001). We found no difference in the development of anxiety or depression between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not, as demonstrated by comparing the change in HADS scores between these groups (median 1 [IQR -3 to 4] versus median 1 [IQR -2 to 4] in HADS change score over time; median difference 0 [95% CI -1 to 2]; r = -0.03; p = 0.61).

Gating modifier toxins from spider venom can modulate the gating mechanism of sodium channels and thus have potential as drug leads. Here, we established expression of the gating modifier toxin PaurTx-3, a sodium channel inhibitor found in the venom of the spider Phrixotrichus auratus. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings indicated that recombinant PaurTx-3 (rPaurTx-3) inhibited Nav1.4, Nav1.5, and Nav1.7 currents with IC50 values of 61 nM, 72 nM, and 25 nM, respectively. Furthermore, rPaurTx-3 irreversibly inhibited Nav1.7 currents, but had 60-70% recovery in Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 after washing with a bath solution. rPaurTx-3 also hyperpolarized the voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation curve and significantly slowed recovery from fast inactivation of Nav1.7. Current-clamp recordings showed that rPaurTx-3 suppressed small DRG neuron activity. The biological activity assay findings for rPaurTx-3 support its potent pharmacological effect in Nav1.7 and small DRG neurons.","Chen, Minzhi; Peng, Shuijiao; Wang, Li; Yang, Li; Si, Yuxin; Zhou, Xi; Zhang, Yunxiao; Liu, Zhonghua",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,115,8

Distinguishing features of the two crises, as well as differences among the states, lead them to engage such strategies in similar and dissimilar ways. Federal aid during both fiscal disasters is also distinctive. During the Great Recession, federal stimulus funds to states supported budget balancing efforts. In contrast, until the COVID-19 relief bill of March 2021, federal assistance was primarily funneled directly to individuals and businesses and for pandemic-specific spending. This left states on their own to close budget gaps fueled by COVID-19.","Rubin, Marilyn M.; Willoughby, Katherine",Public Budgeting &amp; Finance,115,1

Although 'city-lockdown' policy reduced the spatial spreading of the COVID-19, the city-level outbreaks within each city remain a major concern to be addressed. The local or regional level disease control mainly depends on individuals self-administered infection prevention actions. The contradiction between choice of taking infection prevention actions or not makes the elimination difficult under a voluntary acting scheme, and represents a clash between the optimal choice of action for the individual interest and group interests. Methods: We develop a compartmental epidemic model based on the classic susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model and use this to fit the data. Behavioral imitation through a game theoretical decision-making process is incorporated to study and project the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. By varying the key model parameters, we explore the probable course of the outbreak in terms of size and timing under several public interventions in improving public awareness and sensitivity to the infection risk as well as their potential impact. Results: We estimate the basic reproduction number, R0, to be 2.5 (95% CI: 2.4-2.7). Under the current most realistic setting, we estimate the peak size at 0.28 (95% CI: 0.24-0.32) infections per 1,000 population. In Wuhan, the final size of the outbreak is likely to infect 1.35% (95% CI: 1.00-2.12%) of the population. The outbreak will be most likely to peak in the first half of February and drop to daily incidences lower than 10 in June 2020. Increasing sensitivity to take infection prevention actions and the effectiveness of infection prevention measures are likely to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Conclusions: Through an imitating social learning process, individual-level behavioral change on taking infection prevention actions have the potentials to significantly reduce the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of size and timing at city-level. Timely and substantially resources and supports for improving the willingness-to-act and conducts of self-administered infection prevention actions are recommended to reduce to the COVID-19 associated risks.","Zhao, Shi; Stone, Lewi; Gao, Daozhou; Musa, Salihu S.; Chong, Marc K.C.; He, Daihai; Wang, Maggie H.",Ann.

The reciprocal role of SARS-CoV-2 and Bc, their potential interactions and the contribution of the individual therapies to the favourable outcome are unclear. It is debatable whether it was SARS-CoV2 that triggered a Bc pulmonary exacerbation or if the chronic Bc infection facilitated the development of a COVID-19 more aggressive than usually seen in CF. If the latter hypothesis were confirmed by similar cases, Bc colonization should be regarded as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 expression in CF.","Olcese, C; Casciaro, R; Pirlo, D; Debbia, C; Castagnola, E; Cresta, F; Castellani, C",J Cyst Fibros,115,5

Following second AHCT, the patient demonstrated clinical, VEGF, hematological response and remains SARS-CoV-2 infection-free and in POEMS remission with excellent quality-of-life at last follow up (6 months). We evidenced that thanks to an outpatient transplant program, the best therapeutic modalities can be offered to patients with hematologic malignancies in the context of present or future pandemics. Finally, high-complexity patients with HIV infection should have access to the same treatment strategies as non-infected patients. A second AHCT in the outpatient setting is feasible, safe and highly effective to treat patients with relapsed POEMS syndrome.","Hernández-Coronado, Marcela; Jaime-Pérez, José Carlos; Villarreal-Martínez, Alejandra; Ocampo-Candiani, Jorge; Gómez-Almaguer, David",Transpl Immunol,115,16

Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly around the globe. For many years we have been warned that we would face a new pandemic, most likely with a zoonotic virus. For COVID-19 it was shown that transmission can occur via droplets and aerosols that can remain in the air for some hours and also via contaminated surfaces. Extra risks have been suggested to exists for aerosol producing surgery in sinus- and skull-base surgery. Ongoing transmission is especially difficult to prevent when the pathogen can be transmitted during the incubation period before the patient experiences symptoms. In March, Claire Hopkins and colleagues warned the rhinologic community and later health authorities about the significant increase in anosmia (and dysgeusia) related to (often further) asymptomatic COVID-19 and pointed to the possibility of recognizing COVID-19 patients by unexplained anosmia without other symptoms.","Fokkens, W J",Rhinology,115,6

Methods: Outpatients who had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 or were presenting with suspected COVID-19 were asked to have a nasopharyngeal swab collected and provide at least one self-collected sample type. Participants were also asked about sample acceptability using a five point Likert scale. For those previously diagnosed with COVID-19, all samples underwent real-time PCR testing using a lab-developed assay, and the majority were also tested using an FDA-authorized assay. For those presenting with suspect COVID-19, only those with a positive nasopharyngeal swab sample went on to have other samples tested. Saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day one, and day 2 to assess nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Results: 50 participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary sample yield analysis. Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples had a sensitivity of 98% (39/40) while saliva samples had a sensitivity of 79% (26/33). Both saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples showed stable viral RNA detection after 2 days of room temperature storage. Mouth rinse/gargle samples had the highest (mean 4.9) and HCW-collected NP swabs had the lowest acceptability scores (mean 3.1). Conclusion: Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples demonstrated the highest combined user acceptability ratings and analytical performance when compared with saliva and HCW collected NP swabs. This sample type is a promising swab-independent option, particularly for outpatient self-collection in adults and school aged children.","Goldfarb, David M; Tilley, Peter; Al-Rawahi, Ghada N; Srigley, Jocelyn A; Ford, Geoffrey; Pedersen, Heather; Pabbi, Abhilasha; Hannam-Clark, Stephanie; Charles, Marthe; Dittrick, Michelle; Gadkar, Vijay J; Pernica, Jeffrey M; Hoang, Linda M N",J. clin. microbiol,115,6

Physical activity (PA) behaviors need to be examined to inform interventions and improve health. Responses to the C-EAT (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time) survey (N = 720; age = 24.7 ± 2.0 yrs) were analyzed. This mixed-methods study quantitatively examined changes in self-reported PA (hours/week of mild PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), and total PA) from 2018 to 2020. Qualitative responses on how COVID-19 impacted PA were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Hours of PA were lower on average for all intensity levels during COVID-19 than in 2018 (p's < 0.0001). Over half of the sample reported a decrease in MVPA (53.8%) and total PA (55.6%); 42.6% reported a decrease in mild PA. High SES were more likely to report an increase in total PA (p = 0.001) compared to those of lower SES. Most (83.6%) participants perceived that COVID-19 had influenced their PA. The most common explanations were decreased gym access, effects on outdoor PA, and increased dependence on at-home PA.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, however, such information has been underestimated. Here, we propose a retrospective methodology to estimate daily infections from daily deaths, because those are usually more accurately documented. Given the incubation period, the time from illness onset to death, and the case fatality ratio, the date of death can be estimated from the date of infection. We apply this idea conversely to estimate infections from deaths. This methodology is applied to Spain and its 19 administrative regions. Our results showed that probable daily infections during the first wave were between 35 and 42 times more than those officially documented on 14 March, when the national government decreed a national lockdown and 9 times more than those documented by the updated version of the official data. The national lockdown had a strong effect on the growth rate of virus transmission, which began to decrease immediately. Finally, the first inferred infection in Spain is about 43 days before the official data were available during the first wave. The current official data show delays of 15-30 days in the first infection relative to the inferred infections in 63% of the regions. In summary, we propose a methodology that allows reinterpretation of official daily infections, improving data accuracy in infection magnitude and dates because it assimilates valuable information from the National Seroprevalence Studies.","García-García, David; Vigo, María Isabel; Fonfría, Eva S; Herrador, Zaida; Navarro, Miriam; Bordehore, Cesar",Sci Rep,115,1

The objective of this report was to describe the clinical case of a patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 who developed acute renal injury, probably secondary to this infection. CASE REPORT On 1 April 2020, a 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency service of the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Mexico City, with a 15-day history of dry cough and subjective fever. Finally, the following diagnoses were integrated: Acute renal injury of etiology to be determined (acute chronic kidney disease secondary to T2DM vs. acute renal injury by SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19. The patient had a typical presentation of severe COVID-19, evidencing all the risk and severity factors for this disease. However, after being admitted to the hospital, she showed evidence of acute renal injury. Although the renal injury may have been due to microangiopathic damage caused by chronic hypertension and diabetes, it is imperative to consider the possibility that such exacerbation contributes to SARS-CoV-2 infection or synergy of multiple factors. CONCLUSIONS Every aspect of this pandemic remains unclear. The formulation of hypotheses to explain the physiopathological mechanisms by which this new virus can cause mortality in infected patients may help reduce mortality rates and control the pandemic itself.","Sánchez Tinajero, Ángel; González Cueto, Elizabeth; Martínez Orozco, José A; Becerril Vargas, Eduardo; Ruiz Santillán, Danna P; Reséndiz Escobar, Héctor",Am J Case Rep,115,13

Although visiting restrictions are instituted to prolong the life of nursing home residents, they may detrimentally affect their quality of life. The aim of this study was to capture perspectives from the relatives of nursing home residents on nursing home visiting restrictions. DESIGN: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of Dutch relatives of nursing home residents (n = 1997) completed an online survey on their perspectives regarding nursing home visiting restrictions. METHODS: The survey included Likert-item, multiselect, and open-answer questions targeting 4 key areas: (1) communication access to residents, (2) adverse effects of visiting restrictions on residents and relatives, (3) potential protective effect of visiting restrictions, (4) important aspects for relatives during and after visiting restrictions. RESULTS: Satisfaction of communication access to nursing home residents was highest when respondents had the possibility to communicate with nursing home residents by nurses informing them via telephone, contact behind glass, and contact outside maintaining physical distance. Satisfaction rates increased when respondents had multiple opportunities to stay in contact with residents. Respondents were concerned that residents had increased loneliness (76%), sadness (66%), and decreased quality of life (62%), whereas study respondents reported personal sadness (73%) and fear (26%). There was no consensus among respondents if adverse effects of the visiting restrictions outweighed the protective effect for nursing home residents. Respondents expressed the need for increased information, communication options, and better safety protocols. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Providing multiple opportunities to stay in touch with nursing home residents can increase satisfaction of communication between residents and relatives. Increased context-specific information, communication options, and safety protocols should be addressed in national health policy.","Wammes, Joost D; Kolk MSc, Daisy; van den Besselaar Md, Judith H; MacNeil-Vroomen PhD, Janet L; Buurman-van Es Rn, Bianca M; van Rijn PhD, Marjon",J Am Med Dir Assoc,115,21

Within this project, the online panel of Doxa was used to conduct a web-based cross-sectional study during the first phase of the lockdown, on a large representative sample of adults aged 18-74 years (N=6003). The self-administered questionnaire included information on lifestyle habits and perceived physical and mental health, through the use of validated scales. As we are working within the Lost in Italy project, we got two additional grants to further research on the medium-term impact of lockdown, a topic of great interest and with anticipated large socio-economic and public health implications. In details: we obtained by the AXA Research Fund support to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on physical, mental, and social wellbeing of elderly and fragile populations in the Lombardy region, the area most heavily hit by the pandemic in the country. Moreover, as a fruitful integration, we obtained support by the Directorate General for Welfare of the region to assess health services delivery and access to healthcare in the same study population, combining an analysis of administrative databases with an economic analysis.

Most of existing methods can be summarized as anomaly object detection-based and reconstruction error-based techniques. However, due to the bottleneck of defining encompasses of real-world high-diversity outliers and inaccessible inference process, individually, most of them have not derived groundbreaking progress. To deal with those imperfectness, and motivated by memory-based decision-making and visual attention mechanism as a filter to select environmental information in human vision perceptual system, in this paper, we propose a Multi-scale Attention Memory with hash addressing Autoencoder network (MAMA Net) for anomaly detection. First, to overcome a battery of problems result from the restricted stationary receptive field of convolution operator, we coin the multi-scale global spatial attention block which can be straightforwardly plugged into any networks as sampling, upsampling and downsampling function. On account of its efficient features representation ability, networks can achieve competitive results with only several level blocks. Second, it's observed that traditional autoencoder can only learn an ambiguous model that also reconstructs anomalies ""well"" due to lack of constraints in training and inference process. To mitigate this challenge, we design a hash addressing memory module that proves abnormalities to produce higher reconstruction error for classification. In addition, we couple the mean square error (MSE) with Wasserstein loss to improve the encoding data distribution. Experiments on various datasets, including two different COVID-19 datasets and one brain MRI (RIDER) dataset prove the robustness and excellent generalization of the proposed MAMA Net.","Chen, Yurong; Zhang, Hui; Wang, Yaonan; Yang, Yimin; Zhou, Xianen; Jonathan Wu, Q M",IEEE. trans. med. imaging,115,32

METHODS: A register-based study from the Swedish National Cataract Register (NCR) during the years 2015-2017 including 358 040 cataract procedures. Patients with other ocular pathology than cataract and DR were omitted from outcome analyses. RESULTS: Diabetic retinopathy was reported in 13 724 of all eyes (3.8%). Preoperative BCVA was significantly worse in DR patients than in patients without DR, 0.54 ± 0.33 compared to 0.40 ± 0.27 (logMAR, mean ± SD, p < 0.001). The same was evident for postoperative BCVA, 0.15 ± 0.25 for DR patients versus 0.06 ± 0.13 (p < 0.001). The improvement in BCVA was slightly better in DR than in non-DR, -0.40 ± 0.32 (logMAR; mean ± SD) versus -0.35 ± 0.27, p < 0.001. The absolute mean biometry prediction error was 0.42 ± 0.50 diopters (D) in DR and 0.43 ± 0.71 D in non-DR patients, p = 0.768. One or more intraoperative difficulties, including mechanical pupil dilation, capsular stain, hooks at capsulorhexis margin or capsular tension ring, had an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61-1.90, p < 0.001) in DR versus non-DR cases and the rate of posterior capsular tears (PCR) had an adjusted OR of 1.76 (95% CI 1.40-2.20, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Eyes with DR have inferior pre- and postoperative BCVA compared to non-DR eyes. There is little difference in improvement of BCVA and no difference in absolute mean biometry prediction error. Importantly, intraoperative difficulties and PCRs are almost twice as common in DR patients, strongly indicating that these patients should be managed by experienced surgeons.","Ridderskär, Lucas; Montan, Per; Kugelberg, Maria; Nilsson, Ingela; Lundström, Mats; Behndig, Anders; Zetterberg, Madeleine",Acta Ophthalmol,115,1

Thus, a comprehensive investigation of DON's spatial distribution and its association with DBP occurrence in the surface water is urgently needed. In this study, a total of 51 water samples were collected from two rivers and four lakes in May 2020 in Wuhan to explore the regional variation of nitrogen (N) species, DON's compositional characteristics, and the three classes of DBP occurrence. In lakes, 53.0% to 86.3% of N existed as DON, with its concentration varying between 0.3-4.0 mg N/L. In contrast, NO3--N was the dominant N species in rivers. Spectral analysis revealed that DON in the lakes contained higher humic and fulvic materials with higher A254, A253/A203, SUVA254, and PIII+IV/PI+II+V ratios, while rivers had higher levels of hydrophilic compounds. Trihalomethanes (THMs) were the most prevalent DBPs in the surface waters, followed by N-nitrosamines and haloacetonitriles (HANs). The levels of N-nitrosamines (23.1-97.4 ng/L) increased significantly after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excessive DON in the surface waters was responsible for the formation of N-nitrosamines. This study confirmed that the presence of DON in surface water could result in DBP formation, especially N-nitrosamines, when disinfectants were discharged into surface water during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Leyun; Zhang, Xian; Chen, Shanshan; Meng, Fanbin; Zhang, Dayi; Liu, Yi; Li, Miao; Liu, Xiang; Huang, Xia; Qu, Jiuhui",Water Res,115,26

Objective: The objective of this study is to provide allergists and other clinicians with pearls pertaining to the management of patients with asthma in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide some information regarding the risk of transmission among the pediatric population. Methods: Utilizing the case of one of our own patients with asthma who developed COVID-19 as context, we review the recent literature discussing the risk of COVID-19 in patients with asthma, the management of asthma medications in the time of the pandemic, and the risk of viral transmission. Results: Despite initial reports that asthma was a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19, subsequent investigation has shown that this is likely not true. Additionally, the use of systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids does not appear to increase the risk of severe COVID-19, but there is no evidence guiding the use of biologic therapy. There is conflicting evidence regarding the ability of children to transmit the virus. Conclusion: We provide pearls that asthma does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 and continued use of inhaled corticosteroids appears to be safe. While there is no evidence guiding the use of biologic therapies, a recent position paper suggests that they should be continued unless a patient contracts COVID-19, at which point they should be held until clinical recovery occurs.","Pitlick, Mitchell M; Joshi, Avni Y",Allergy Asthma Proc,115,30

Lesson from patients with agammaglobulinemia,14.41537,11.480293,2020,"BACKGROUND: Research shows that nano-bioceramics can modulate the differentiation of dental stem cells. The novel ready-to-use calcium-silicate-based root-canal sealer iRoot SP is widely used in root filling. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of iRoot SP on proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in human stem cells from the apical papilla (hSCAPs). METHODS: hSCAPs were isolated and characterized in vitro, then cultured with various concentrations of iRoot SP extract. Cell proliferation was assessed by CCK-8 assay, and scratch-wound-healing assays were performed to evaluate cell-migration capacity. hSCAPs were then cultured in osteogenic medium supplemented with iRoot SP extracts. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay was used to evaluate ALP enzyme levels. Alizarin red staining and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) assays were performed to assess calcified-nodule formation and matrix-calcium accumulation of hSCAPs. The mRNA and protein expression levels of the osteogenic markers OCN, OSX, Runx2, and DSPP were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and LSD-t tests. RESULTS: iRoot SP at low concentrations (2, 0.2, and 0.02 mg/mL) is nontoxic to hSCAPs. iRoot SP at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/mL significantly increases cell-migration capacity. In terms of osteogenic differentiation, 0.2 mg/mL iRoot SP promotes intracellular ALP activity and the formation of mineralized nodules. Moreover, the expression of osteogenic markers at the mRNA and protein levels are upregulated by iRoot SP. CONCLUSION: iRoot SP is an effective filling material for periapical bone regeneration.","Wu, Laidi; Xue, Kaiyang; Hu, Guang; Du, Hanman; Gan, Kang; Zhu, Juanfang; Du, Tianfeng",BMC Oral Health,115,2

New challenges have been identified in order to maintain the safety of this procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. A novel approach, using a modified demistifier canopy, was developed during the first wave of the pandemic and implemented for 17 consecutive percutaneous tracheostomies in order to enhance procedural safety. METHODS: A protocol was developed after performing a literature review of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. A multidisciplinary tracheostomy team was established, including the departments of otolaryngology, critical care, and respiratory therapy. Simulation was performed prior to each PT, and postoperative debriefings were done. RESULTS: A protocol and technical description of PT using a modified demistifier canopy covering was written and video documented. Data were collected on 17 patients who underwent this procedure safely in our tertiary care hospital. There were no procedure-related complications, and no evidence of COVID-19 transmission to any member of the health care team during the study period. CONCLUSION: As patients continue to recover from COVID-19, their need for tracheostomy will increase. The technique described provides a safe, multidisciplinary method of performing PT in COVID-19 patients.","Turkdogan, Sena; Kay-Rivest, Emily; Giroux, Melanie; Piché, Chantal; Khwaja, Kosar; Mascarella, Marco; Khalife, Sarah; Alohali, Sama; Kost, Karen",Ear Nose Throat J,115,2

In this study, we aimed to explore the odds of significant COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among schizophrenia patients while controlling for potential sociodemographic and medical confounders. METHODS: Schizophrenia patients and age-and-sex matched controls (total n = 51 078) were assessed for frequency of COVID-19 positivity, hospitalizations, and mortality. The odds for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and mortality were calculated using logistic regression models, while controlling for age, sex, marital status, sector, socioeconomic status, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RESULTS: Individuals with schizophrenia were less likely to test positive for COVID-19; however, they were twice as likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 (OR 2.15 95% CI 1.63-2.82, P < .0001), even after controlling for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors (OR 1.88 95% CI 1.39-2.55, P < .0001). Furthermore, they were 3 times more likely to experience COVID-19 mortality (OR 3.27 95% CI 1.39-7.68, P < .0001), compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of associations between schizophrenia and increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality compared to controls regardless of sociodemographic and medical factors. As these patients present with a combination of potential risk factors for mortality, efforts should be made to minimize the effects of the pandemic on this vulnerable population.","Tzur Bitan, Dana; Krieger, Israel; Kridin, Khalaf; Komantscher, Doron; Scheinman, Yochai; Weinstein, Orly; Cohen, Arnon Dov; Cicurel, Assi Albert; Feingold, Daniel",Schizophr. bull,115,6

This research study was conducted with 145 respondents and Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used for data analysis. The participants were undergraduate and post-graduate students in public and private universities who studied online during the pandemic in Vietnam. The purpose of this study was to understand what factors have an impact on students' intentions to study online. The results show that institutional support and perceived enjoyment (satisfaction) affects the students' intentions to study the course online in the future. Perceived enjoyment (PE) affects the online learning intentions (OLI) and PE is affected by ICT infrastructure and internet speed and access. Hence, this research adds new research variable defined as extrinsic factors (ICT infrastructure and access to the internet), which indirectly influences students' intentions to learn online. Given the increased use of smart phones with this generation, it is advisable to integrate mobile technology in online learning and QR codes can be one of the ways to integrate that in the course materials. It is further recommended that to increase the perceived enjoyment of the students with the online learning, the lecturers might be encouraged to use videos, audios and instant messaging to contact and provide the feedback to the students.

We aim to explore reliable evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 by analyzing all the published studies by Chinese scholars on the clinical and imaging features in novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We searched five medical databases including two Chinese and three English databases for all published articles on COVID-19 since the outbreak. A random-effects model was designed, and the imaging and clinical data from all studies were collected for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 31 articles and 46 959 patients were included, including 10 English articles and 21 Chinese articles. The results of meta-analysis showed that the most common clinical manifestations were fever (87.3%; 0.838-0.909), cough (58.1%; 0.502-0.660), dyspnea (38.3%; 0.246-0.520), muscle soreness or fatigue (35.5%; 0.253-0.456), and chest distress (31.2%; -0.024 to 0.648). The main imaging findings were bilateral pneumonia (75.7%; 0.639-0.871) and ground-glass opacification (69.9%; 0.602-0.796). Among the patients, the incidence that required intensive care unit (ICU) was (29.3%; 0.190-0.395), the incidence with acute respiratory distress syndrome was (28.8%; 0.147-0.429), the incidence with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was (8.5%; -0.008 to 0.179), and the case fatality rate of patients with COVID-19 was (6.8%; 0.044-0.093). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a new clinical infectious disease that mainly causes bilateral pneumonia and lung function deteriorates rapidly. Nearly a third of patients need to be admitted to the ICU, and patients are likely to present respiratory failure or even death.","Cao, Yinghao; Liu, Xiaoling; Xiong, Lijuan; Cai, Kailin",J. med. virol,115,16

Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a highly immunogenic, safe, and robust approach that can be used to base several vaccine candidates on. Particularly, HIV-1 Gag VLPs is a flexible system comprising a Gag core surrounded by a lipid bilayer that can be modified to present diverse types of membrane proteins or antigens against several diseases, like influenza, dengue, West Nile virus, or human papillomavirus, where it has been proven successful. The size distribution and structural characteristics of produced VLPs vary depending on the cell line used to produce them. In this study, we established an analytical method of characterization for the Gag protein core and clarified the current variability of Gag stoichiometry in HIV-1 VLPs depending on the cell-based production platform, directly determining the number of Gag molecules per VLP in each case. Three Gag peptides have been validated to quantify the number of monomers using parallel reaction monitoring, an accurate and fast, mass-spectrometry-based method that can be used to assess the quality of the produced Gag VLPs regardless of the cell line used.

At the time of writing, additional precautions are required when a procedure considered to generate aerosol is undertaken.This paper aims to present evidence-based treatments that remove or reduce the generation of aerosols during the management of carious lesions. It maps aerosol generating procedures (AGPs), where possible, to alternative non-AGPs or low AGPs. This risk reduction approach overcomes the less favourable outcomes associated with temporary solutions or extraction-only approaches. Even if this risk reduction approach for aerosol generation becomes unnecessary in the future, these procedures are not only suitable but desirable for use as part of general dental care post-COVID-19.","Eden, Ece; Frencken, Jo; Gao, Sherry; Horst, Jeremy A; Innes, Nicola",Br Dent J,115,21

This is exacerbated by the increasing burden of diseases such as tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV and AIDS) and more recently the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as advancing technology and changing regulations and policies. Problem-based learning is a student-centred learning strategy, where students are presented with situations drawn from practice, which can be used to bridge the theory-practice gap. OBJECTIVES: To explore the perceptions and views of healthcare educators on how problem-based learning can be facilitated through simulation. METHOD: A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual research design was used. Thirteen educators from the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Johannesburg, with 5 years' teaching experience, were purposively selected from the Dean's office, the Nursing Department, emergency medical care and the departments of podiatry, somatology and radiography. The participants were selected based on their extensive knowledge of problem-based learning and the use of simulation. Data were collected through in-depth, individual, semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis provided six themes and 13 related sub-themes. The article focuses on the perceptions and views of educators regarding problem-based learning through simulation. RESULTS: Problem-based learning through simulation allows students to work together in teams, which demonstrates a new modus operandi and renders a holistic approach to patient care. CONCLUSION: Problem-based learning through simulation should be utilised to encourage reflective knowledge exchange. Students from various departments can learn about new innovations, creativity and develop critical thinking when solving complex health-related problems.","Matlala, Sidwell",Curationis,115,16

The present review assesses requirements for implementation of COVID-19 RDTs in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Review of PubMed-published articles assessing COVID-19 RDTs complemented with Instructions for Use (IFU) of products. Results: In total 47 articles on two COVID-19 Ag RDTs and 54 COVID-19 Ab RDTs and IFUs of 20 COVID-19 Ab RDTs were retrieved. Only five COVID-19 Ab RDTs (9.3%) were assessed with capillary blood sampling at the point-of-care; none of the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Sampling: Challenges for COVID-19 Ag RDTs include nasopharyngeal sampling (technique, biosafety) and sample stability; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs equivalence of whole blood vs. plasma/serum needs further validation (assessed for only eight (14.8%) products). Sensitivity-Specificity: sensitivity of COVID-19 Ag and Ab RDTs depend on viral load (antigen) and timeframe (antibody), respectively; COVID-19 Ab tests have lower sensitivity compared to laboratory test platforms and the kinetics of IgM and IgG are very similar. Reported specificity was high but has not yet been assessed against tropical pathogens. Kit configuration: For COVID-19 Ag RDTs, flocked swabs should be added to the kit; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs, finger prick sampling materials, transfer devices, and controls should be added (currently only supplied in 15, 5, and 1/20 products). Usability and Robustness: some COVID-19 Ab RDTs showed high proportions of faint lines (>40%) or invalid results (>20%). Shortcomings were reported for buffer vials (spills, air bubbles) and their instructions for use. Stability: storage temperature was &#8804; 30°C for all but one RDT, in-use and result stability were maximal at 1 h and 30 min, respectively. Integration in the healthcare setting requires a target product profile, landscape overview of technologies, certified manufacturing capacity, a sustainable market, and a stringent but timely regulation. In-country deployment depends on integration in the national laboratory network. Discussion/Conclusion: Despite these limitations, successful implementation models in triage, contact tracing, and surveillance have been proposed, in particular for COVID-19 Ab RDTs. Valuable experience is available from implementation of other disease-specific RDTs in sub-Saharan Africa.","Jacobs, Jan; Kühne, Vera; Lunguya, Octavie; Affolabi, Dissou; Hardy, Liselotte; Vandenberg, Olivier",Front Med (Lausanne),115,16

During 2004-2018, an average of 702 heat-related deaths occurred in the United States annually. To study patterns in heat-related deaths by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and level of urbanization, and to explore comorbid conditions associated with deaths resulting from heat exposure, CDC analyzed nationally comprehensive mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS).* The rate of heat-related mortality tended to be higher among males, persons aged &#8805;65 years, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, and persons living in noncore nonmetropolitan and large central metropolitan counties. Natural heat exposure was a contributing cause of deaths attributed to certain chronic medical conditions and other external causes. Preparedness and response initiatives directed toward extreme heat events, currently underway at local, state, and national levels, can contribute to reducing morbidity and mortality associated with natural heat exposure. Successful public health interventions to mitigate heat-related deaths include conducting outreach to vulnerable communities to increase awareness of heat-related symptoms and provide guidance for staying cool and hydrated, particularly for susceptible groups at risk such as young athletes and persons who are older or socially isolated (2). Improved coordination across various health care sectors could inform local activities to protect health during periods of high heat. For instance, jurisdictions can monitor weather conditions and syndromic surveillance data to guide timing of risk communication and other measures (e.g., developing and implementing heat response plans, facilitating communication and education activities) to prevent heat-related mortality in the United States. CDC also recommends that federal, state, local, and tribal jurisdictions open cooling centers or provide access to public locations with air conditioning for persons in need of a safe, cool, environment during hot weather conditions. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, CDC updated its guidance on the use of cooling centers to provide best practices (e.g., potential changes to staffing procedures, separate areas for persons with symptoms of COVID-19, and physical distancing) to reduce the risk for introducing and transmitting SARS COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into cooling centers.§.","Vaidyanathan, Ambarish; Malilay, Josephine; Schramm, Paul; Saha, Shubhayu",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,115,16

This immunity can be due to vaccination or to the recovery post-disease. Effective herd immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection has several hurdles upon achievement. Herd immunity cannot be obtained concomitantly in many geographical areas because the areas have different population density and the societal measures to contain the spreading are different. A proportion of 50-66% of the population needs to be immunized naturally or artificially in this SARS-Cov2 pandemic and this percentage is not easily achievable. The duration of herd immunity is another issue while information on the long-term immune response against SARS-CoV2 is yet scarce. Epitope stability, another issue to be solved when achieving herd immunity, is important. Mutation in the viral structure will call upon other sets of neutralizing antibodies and hence for other herd immunity type installment.

METHODS: A population-based household survey was performed, from July 27, 2020 to August 8, 2020. The estimates considered clustering, stratification and non-response. Qualitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies was performed in a fully-automated Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on the Cobas® e601 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). RESULTS: In total, 3,156 individuals were interviewed. Seroprevalence of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 40.4% (95%CI 35.6-45.3). Population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions was higher at the beginning of the pandemic than in the last month. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were significantly lower among mask wearers and among those who maintained social and physical distancing in the last month compared to their counterparts. Among the infected, 26.0% were asymptomatic. The infection fatality rate (IFR) was 0.14%, higher for men and older adults. The IFR based on excess deaths was 0.28%. The ratio of estimated infections to reported cases was 22.2. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 estimated in this population-based survey is one of the highest reported. The local herd immunity threshold may have been reached or might be reached soon.","Silva, Antônio Augusto Moura da; Lima-Neto, Lídio Gonçalves; Azevedo, Conceição de Maria Pedrozo e Silva de; Costa, Léa Márcia Melo da; Bragança, Maylla Luanna Barbosa Martins; Barros Filho, Allan Kardec Duailibe; Wittlin, Bernardo Bastos; Souza, Bruno Feres de; Oliveira, Bruno Luciano Carneiro Alves de; Carvalho, Carolina Abreu de; Thomaz, Erika Barbara Abreu Fonseca; Simões-Neto, Eudes Alves; Leite Júnior, Jamesson Ferreira; Cosme, Lécia Maria Sousa Santos; Campos, Marcos Adriano Garcia; Queiroz, Rejane Christine de Sousa; Costa, Sérgio Souza; Carvalho, Vitória Abreu de; Simões, Vanda Maria Ferreira; Alves, Maria Teresa Seabra Soares de Brito e; Santos, Alcione Miranda dos",Rev. saúde pública (Online),115,16

When admitting patients to the hospital, it is desirable to isolate patients with COVID-19 from those without the disease. However, reliably identifying patients with COVID-19 in the emergency department before hospital admission is often limited by the speed and availability of testing. Previous studies determined a low lymphocyte count is commonly found in patients with COVID-19. We sought to explore the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients presenting to the emergency department requiring subsequent hospitalization who were found to have COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on 312 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency department. The absolute lymphocyte count for these patients was used to calculate sensitivities at various cut-off values. The relationships between absolute lymphocyte count and variables, including age, sex, need for intubation, and mortality, were also explored. RESULTS: Cut-off values for absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 1.1 K/uL to 2.0 K/uL, with sensitivities of 72% and 94%, respectively. Additionally, lower mean absolute lymphocyte counts were identified in males, patients who required intubation, and patients who died. CONCLUSION: Knowing the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19 may help identify patients who are unlikely to have the disease. Additionally, absolute lymphocyte count can be used as a marker of disease severity in patients with COVID-19.","Illg, Zachary; Muller, Gregory; Mueller, Matthew; Nippert, Justin; Allen, Brian",Am J Emerg Med,115,20

Black adults in every age group were more likely than White adults to have health risks associated with severe COVID-19 illness. However, Whites were older, on average, than Blacks. Thus, when all factors were considered, Whites tended to be at higher overall risk compared with Blacks, with Asians and Hispanics having much lower overall levels of risk compared with either Whites or Blacks. We explored additional explanations for COVID-19 disparities-namely, differences in job characteristics and how they interact with household composition. Blacks at high risk for severe illness were 1.6 times as likely as Whites to live in households containing health-sector workers. Among Hispanic adults at high risk for severe illness, 64.5 percent lived in households with at least one worker who was unable to work from home, versus 56.5 percent among Black adults and only 46.6 percent among White adults.","Selden, Thomas M; Berdahl, Terceira A",Health Aff (Millwood),115,33

From its beginning inWuhan, China, the SARS-CoV-2 infected the similar groups of 100, 000 patients in 67, 11, 4, and 2 days. Healthcare workers are in the frontline of attacking by SARS-CoV-2, especially those who are in close contact with upper respiratory mucosa like otolaryngologists. Objectives: To describe ear pain as one of the first clinical manifestations of COVID-19, we present two cases of a family (a mother and her daughter) with a positive RT-PCR test for COVID-19 who presented earache as their first symptoms. Case Presentation: The first case was a 32 years old female patient (stewardess of an international airline, Tehran, Iran) was labeled as at risk due to her air flight to China in Dec 2019. She was first admitted for moderate ear pain in her left ear with mild itching of the external ear to an otolaryngology outpatient clinic by a general practitioner. After 7 days, her test for RT-PCR against COVID-19 was positive. No lung involvement was reported by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the thorax. Another case was her mother who were in close contact with each other and experienced severe ear pain after 7 days. She acquired mild COVID-19 symptoms with anosmia was a positive test result for COVID-19. Conclusions: The earache must be considered as their first clinical symptoms during the early phase of the coronavirus outbreak. It seems that local and international scientific groups of otolaryngologists must prepare their national guidelines to protect their practitioners against COVID-19 based on practical strategies. Using personal protective equipment is of utmost importance in reducing the risk of nosocomial infection among otolaryngologists.","Miri, Seyyed Mohammad; Ajalloueyan, Mohammad",Iran.

Different activities performed at the same location have commonalities resulting in less inter-class variations; while the same activity performed multiple times, or by multiple residents, varies in its execution resulting in high intra-class variations. We propose a Local Feature Weighting approach (LFW) that assigns weights based on both inter-class and intra-class importance of a feature in an activity. Multiple sensors are deployed at different locations in a smart home to gather information. We exploit the obtained information, such as frequency and duration of activation of sensors, and the total sensors in an activity for feature weighting. The weights for the same features vary among activities, since a feature may have more importance for one activity but less for the other. For the classification, we exploit the two variants of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Evidence Theoretic KNN (ETKNN) and Fuzzy KNN (FKNN). The evaluation of the proposed approach on three datasets, from CASAS smart home project, demonstrates its ability in the correct recognition of activities compared to the existing approaches.","Fahad, Labiba Gillani; Tahir, Syed Fahad",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,115,24

One of the reasons is the possibility of infection of the recipient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Determining the risk of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a donor organ is very important for developing a kidney transplantation policy during a pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHOD: We present cases of kidney transplantation from COVID-19-positive deceased donors to 2 dialysis patients 49 and 45 years old. One of them was on hemodialysis for 28 months; the other received continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Both patients received only basic immunosuppression, including tacrolimus, methylprednisolone, and mycophenolic acid. No antilymphocyte agents were used for induction therapy. RESULTS: Cold ischemia time was 22 and 21 hours, respectively. One recipient had delayed graft function with increasing of urine output on day 8; another had immediate function. Both patients had no febrile and no other symptoms of acute respiratory disease during their hospital stay. No abnormalities on the chest x-ray were seen. No serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were detected before and during 6 weeks after surgery. Repeated nasopharyngeal swabs real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) were negative during the period. Both recipients were discharged 5 weeks after surgery with serum creatinine levels of 122 and 91 mcmol/L, respectively. CONCLUSION: Today we have no evidence of the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from a SARS-CoV-2 positive donor to a kidney recipient. We also have no reason to suspect kidney damage by COVID-19 in a deceased donor at normal serum creatinine level.","Perlin, D V; Dymkov, I N; Terentiev, A V; Perlina, A V",Transplant. proc,115,24

However, the diagnosis by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction is costly and time-consuming. Several methods of group testing have been developed to overcome this problem. The proposed strategy offers optimization of group testing according to the available resources by decreasing not only the number of the assays but also the turnaround time. The initial classification of the samples would be done according to the intention of testing defined as diagnostic or screening/surveillance, achieving the best possible homogeneity. The proposed stratification of pooling is based on branching (divisions) and depth (levels of re-pooling) of the original group in association with the estimated probability of a positive sample. The dilutional effect of the grouped samples has also been considered. The margins of minimum and maximum conservation of assays of pooled specimens are calculated and the optimum strategy can be selected in association with the probability of positive samples in the original group.

While the initial surge of COVID-19 was concentrated in some areas, COVID-19 became pervasive across the entire continent with high impacts in the northern region and central region in the end of 2020. With this geographical transition, we aim to investigate patterns of these racial/ethnic disparities over time. We assessed associations of percentage of race/ethnic minorities and racial segregation indexes with COVID-19 case and mortality rates in 3108 counties of the continental United States during the pandemic's early phase, second, and third phase (January 21-June 15, June 16-August 31, and September 1-December 18, 2020, respectively). We adjusted for population density, age, and sex. We tested whether time-varying associations were consistent across climate regions and explained by socioeconomic variables. In the early phase, counties with higher percentage of Black/African Americans and higher Black-White segregation had higher COVID-19 case and mortality rates. These associations decreased over time and reversed in the third phase. Associations between Hispanic and COVID-19 outcomes were positive in all periods, but more so early in the pandemic. Higher COVID-19 case rates for counties with higher non-Hispanic White population emerged in the third phase. These trends were similar across climate regions, and socioeconomic variables did not explain these trends. In summary, county-level racial/ethnic disparities of COVID-19 are not stationary but change over the course of the pandemic, suggesting complex social, cultural, and political influences.","Kim, Honghyok; Zanobetti, Antonella; Bell, Michelle L",Sci Total Environ,115,4

Methods: This quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2020, using a convenience sample. An online questionnaire was used for collecting sociodemographic, occupational, and clinical data, which were analyzed descriptively. Results: In total, 437 health workers participated in the study, with a predominance of nursing workers (58.68%), women (70.3%), age between 30 and 49 years (54.2%), individuals living in the Southeast region of Brazil (60.54%), working in the public care system (69.11%), and focused on primary care (30.89%). Among the participants, 36% reported comorbidities, 21.1% had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and only 27% had undergone some type of COVID-19 testing. Conclusions: Despite the existence of risk comorbidities and symptoms suggestive of contamination, the frequency of testing was below one third among respondents.

Knowledge of risk factors of coronavirus disease among Brazilians remains scarce, especially in the adult population. This study verified the risk factors for intensive care unit admission and mortality for coronavirus disease among 20-59-year-old Brazilians. METHODS: A Brazilian database on respiratory illness was analyzed on October 9, 2020, to gather data on age, sex, ethnicity, education, housing area, and comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for coronavirus disease. RESULTS: Overall, 1,048,575 persons were tested for coronavirus disease; among them, 43,662 were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 34,704 patients died. Male sex (odds ratio=1.235 and 1.193), obesity (odds ratio=1.941 and 1.889), living in rural areas (odds ratio=0.855 and 1.337), and peri-urban areas (odds ratio=1.253 and 1.577) were predictors of intensive care unit admission and mortality, respectively. Cardiovascular disease (odds ratio=1.552) was a risk factor for intensive care unit admission.

As of July 27, 2020, the cumulative confirmed number of cases was about 4.2 million with almost 300,000 of them entailing hospitalizations. Due to data collection limitations the confirmed totals reported by the CDC undercount the actual number of cases and hospitalizations in the U.S. Using standard assumptions provided by the CDC, we estimate that as of July 27, 2020, the actual number of cumulative COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is about 47 million with almost 1 million involving hospitalizations. Applying value per statistical life (VSL) and relative severity/injury estimates from the Department of Transportation (DOT), we estimate an overall non-fatal unadjusted valuation of $2.2 trillion for the U.S. with a weighted average value of about $46,000 per case. This is almost 40% higher than the total valuation of $1.6 trillion (using about $11 million VSL from the DOT) for all approximately 147,000 COVID-19 fatalities. We also show a variety of estimates that adjust the non-fatal valuations by the dreaded and uncertainty aspect of COVID-19, age, income, and a factor related to fatality categorization. The adjustments show current overall non-fatal valuations ranging from about $1.5 trillion to about $9.6 trillion. Finally, we use CDC forecast data to estimate non-fatal valuations through November 2020, and find that the overall cumulative valuation increases from about $2.2 trillion to about $5.7 trillion or to about 30% of GDP. Because of the larger numbers of cases involved our calculations imply that non-fatal infections are as economically serious in the aggregate as ultimately fatal infections.","Kniesner, Thomas J; Sullivan, Ryan",J Risk Uncertain,115,16

We herewith report the proof-of-concept development of a biosensor able to detect the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus. The biosensor is based on membrane-engineered mammalian cells bearing the human chimeric spike S1 antibody. We demonstrate that the attachment of the protein to the membrane-bound antibodies resulted in a selective and considerable change in the cellular bioelectric properties measured by means of a Bioelectric Recognition Assay. The novel biosensor provided results in an ultra-rapid manner (3 min), with a detection limit of 1 fg/mL and a semi-linear range of response between 10 fg and 1 µg/mL. In addition, no cross-reactivity was observed against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Furthermore, the biosensor was configured as a ready-to-use platform, including a portable read-out device operated via smartphone/tablet. In this way, we demonstrate that the novel biosensor can be potentially applied for the mass screening of SARS-CoV-2 surface antigens without prior sample processing, therefore offering a possible solution for the timely monitoring and eventual control of the global coronavirus pandemic.","Mavrikou, Sophie; Moschopoulou, Georgia; Tsekouras, Vasileios; Kintzios, Spyridon",,115,21

Due to the limited testing capacity available in France at the time, we elaborated a testing strategy according to pre-test probability. METHODS: The investigation design combined active case finding and contact tracing around each confirmed case with testing of at-risk contact persons who had any evocative symptoms (n = 88). One month later, we performed serology testing to test and screen symptomatic and asymptomatic cases again (n = 79). RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were confirmed (14 with RT-PCR and 10 with serology). The attack rate was 29% (24/83). Median age was 40 (24 to 59), and the sex ratio was 15/12. Only three cases were asymptomatic (= no symptoms at all, 13%, 95% CI, 3–32). Nineteen symptomatic cases (79%, 95% CI, 63–95) presented a respiratory infection, two of which were severe. All the RT-PCR confirmed cases acquired protective antibodies. Median incubation was 4 days (from 1 to 13 days), and the median serial interval was 3 days (0 to 15). We identified pre-symptomatic transmission in 40% of this cluster, but no transmission from asymptomatic to symptomatic cases. CONCLUSION: We report the effective use of targeted testing according to pre-test probability, specifically prioritizing symptomatic COVID-19 diagnosis and contact tracing. The asymptomatic rate raises questions about the real role of asymptomatic infected people in transmission. Conversely, pre-symptomatic contamination occurred frequently in this cluster, highlighting the need to identify, test, and quarantine asymptomatic at-risk contact persons (= contact tracing). The local lockdown imposed helped reduce transmission during the investigation period.","de Laval, Franck; Grosset-Janin, Anaïs; Delon, François; Allonneau, Alexandre; Tong, Christelle; Letois, Flavie; Couderc, Anne; Sanchez, Marc-Antoine; Destanque, César; Biot, Fabrice; Raynaud, Françoise; Bigaillon, Christine; Ferraris, Olivier; Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Enouf, Vincent; Andriamanantena, Dinaherisoa; de Santi, Vincent Pommier; Javelle, Emilie; Mérens, Audrey",BMC Infect Dis,115,11

This prospective study analyzed the factors influencing treatment outcome in patients with TB treated with and without a hospital-based case management (HBCM) approach in a referral center in Taipei. Methods A register-based cohort study design was used to enroll all new cases of pulmonary or extra-pulmonary TB from February 2003 to January 2004. The case manager served as the coordinator among patients, physicians and public health nurses, to facilitate compliance with anti-TB treatment. Treatment outcomes were assessed according to the consensus recommendations of the World Health Organization and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. Results Suspected or confirmed pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB was diagnosed in 524 patients in our hospital from February 2003 to January 2004. Fifty-two of these patients were excluded due to duplicate reporting, previous treatment or death before enrollment. Out of 472 patients enrolled, 103 whose original diagnosis was revised were further excluded, leaving 369 cases eligible for analysis. Patients with case management had a significantly higher rate of successful treatment (cured plus completed treatment) compared to patients without case management, (240/277, 86.6% vs. 67/92, 72.8%; p = 0.002).

The phenomenological explanation offered was a new mutation of the virus, first identified in the UK. We use publicly available data in combination with a time-delayed controlled SIR model, which captures the effects of preventive measures and concomitant social response on the spreading of the virus. The model, which has a unique transmission rate, enables us to reproduce the waves of infection occurred in the UK. This suggests that the new SARS-CoV-2 UK variant is as transmissible as previous strains. Our findings reveal that the sudden surge in cases was in fact related to the relaxation of preventive measures and social awareness. We also simulate the combined effects of restrictions and vaccination campaigns in 2021, demonstrating that lockdown policies are not fully effective to flatten the curve; fully effective mitigation can only be achieved via a vigorous vaccination campaign. As a matter of fact, incorporating recent data about vaccine efficacy, our simulations advocate that the UK might have overcome the worse of the CoVid-19 pandemic, provided that the vaccination campaign maintains a rate of approximately 140k jabs per day.","Duran-Olivencia, M.

Hoping to facilitate the evaluation and/or update of methods relevant in Biomedicine, several aspects of scientific processes are here explored. First, the background is reviewed. In particular, eight topics are analyzed: (i) the history of Higher Education models in reference to the pursuit of science and the type of student cognition pursued, (ii) whether explanatory or actionable knowledge is emphasized depending on the well- or ill-defined nature of problems, (iii) the role of complexity and dynamics, (iv) how differences between Biology and other fields influence methodologies, (v) whether theory and hypotheses or data drive scientific research, (vi) whether Biology is reducible to one or a few factors, (vii) the fact that data, to become actionable knowledge, require structuring, and (viii) the need of inter-/trans-disciplinary knowledge integration. To illustrate how these topics interact, a second section describes four temporal stages of scientific methods: conceptualization, operationalization, validation and evaluation. They refer to the transition from abstract (non-measurable) concepts (such as ́health́) to the selection of concrete (measurable) operations (such as quantification of ́anti-virus specific antibody titerś). Conceptualization is the process that selects concepts worth investigating, which continues as operationalization -when data-producing variables viewed to reflect critical features of the concepts are chosen. Because the operations selected are not necessarily valid, informative, and/or may fail to solve problems, validations and evaluations are, arguably, the two most critical stages, which require inter/trans-disciplinary knowledge integration It is suggested that data structuring, alone, can substantially improve scientific methodologies applicable in Biology, provided that other aspects here mentioned are also considered. The creation of independent bodies meant to evaluate biologically oriented scientific methods is recommended.","Rivas, Ariel L.; Hoogesteijn, Almira L.",Methods,115,22

The cross-neutralization between these viruses is currently not well-defined. METHODS: Here, by using the live SARS-CoV-2 virus infection assay as well as HIV-1 based pseudotyped-virus carrying the spike (S) gene of the SARS-CoV-2 (ppSARS-2) and SARS-CoV (ppSARS), we examined whether infections with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can induce cross-neutralizing antibodies. FINDINGS: We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for SARS-CoV, and we also found that the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein of SARS-CoV effectively inhibits ppSARS-2 entry in Huh7.5 cells. However, convalescent sera from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 patients showed high neutralizing activity only against the homologous virus, with no or limited cross-neutralization activity against the other pseudotyped virus. Similar results were also observed in vaccination studies in mice. INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates that although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 as a cellular receptor, the neutralization epitopes are not shared by these two closely-related viruses, highlighting challenges towards developing a universal vaccine against SARS-CoV related viruses.

Scientists, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, and health organizations have dedicated substantial Intellectual and monetary resources to finding a cure, increasing immunization rates, and reducing the global burden of CHB. National and international health-related organizations including the center for disease control, the national institute of health, the American Association for the study of liver disease (AASLD), The European association for the study of the Liver (EASL), The Asia Pacific association for the study of the Liver (APASL) and the world health organization release periodic recommendations for disease prevention and treatment. Our review of the most recent guidelines by EASL, AASLD, APASL, and Taiwan Association for the Study of the Liver revealed that an overwhelming majority of cited studies were published before 2018. We reviewed Hepatitis B-related literature published 2018 onwards to identify recent developments and current barriers that will likely direct future efforts towards eradicating hepatitis B. The breakthrough in our understanding of the hepatitis B virus life cycle and resulting drug development is encouraging with significant room for further progress. Data from high-risk populations, most vulnerable to the devastating effects of hepatitis B infection and reactivation remain sparse. Utilization of systems approach, optimization of experimental models, identification and validation of next-generation biomarkers, and precise modulation of the human immune response will be critical for future innovation. Within the foreseeable future, new treatments will likely complement conventional therapies rather than replace them. Most Importantly, pragmatic management of CHB related population health challenges must be prioritized to produce real-world results.","Shah, Niraj James; Aloysius, Mark M; Sharma, Neil Rohit; Pallav, Kumar",World J Gastrointest Pharmacol Ther,115,24

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which enters human target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used a number of bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell-specific expression in trachea, lung, and small intestine, derive its putative functions, and predict transcriptional regulation. The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 mRNA than any other organ. By immunohistochemistry, duodenum, kidney and testis showed strong signals, whereas the signal was weak in the respiratory tract. Single cell RNA-Seq data from trachea indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in key protective cell types including club, goblet, proliferating, and ciliary epithelial cells; while in lung the ratio of ACE2-expressing cells was low in all cell types (<2.6%), but was highest in vascular endothelial and goblet cells. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in the renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis. Using a novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites we identified several putative binding sites within two tissue-specific promoters of the ACE2 gene as well as a new putative short form of ACE2. These include several interferon-stimulated response elements sites for STAT1, IRF8, and IRF9. Our results also confirmed that age and gender play no significant role in the regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression in the lung.","Barker, Harlan; Parkkila, Seppo",PLoS One,115,1

This study develops a research framework to explore the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and influential factors related to protection of vulnerable populations, intervention in transmission pathways, and provision of healthcare resources. Relevant data for regression analysis and structural equation modeling is collected during the first wave of the pandemic in the United States, from counties with over 100 confirmed cases. In addition to confirming certain factors found in the existing literature, we uncover six new factors significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence. Furthermore, incidence during the lockdown is found to significantly affect incidence after the reopening, highlighting that timely quarantining and treating of patients is essential to avoid the snowballing transmission over time. These findings suggest ways to mitigate the negative effects of subsequent waves of the pandemic, such as special attention of infection prevention in neighborhoods with unsanitary and overcrowded housing, minimization of social activities organized by neighborhood associations, and contactless home delivery service of healthy food. Also worth noting is the need to provide support to people less capable of complying with the stay-at-home order because of their occupations or socio-economic disadvantage.","Wang, Lan; Zhang, Surong; Yang, Zilin; Zhao, Ziyu; Moudon, Anne Vernez; Feng, Huasen; Liang, Junhao; Sun, Wenyao; Cao, Buyang",Cities,115,16

With little literature or experience to rely on, the initial priority was to minimize patient exposure to the hospital and to others. It remains unclear whether cancer patients are at higher risk of infection or serious complications, or if it is our traditional therapies that place them to be at higher risk. By far, the greatest negative impact was on screening. Routine colonoscopies were considered elective, and as a result, delays in diagnosis will be felt for years to come. The most positive changes were the incorporation of tele-visits, increased use of oral therapies, alterations in treatment schedules of both chemotherapy and radiation, and an increased emphasis on neoadjuvant therapy.

The sample consisted of 499 men and women aged between 18 and 72 who were gathered from the general population via an online recruitment platform. A numerical rating scale comprising 11 degrees of fear was used to assess participants’ COVID-19-related fear, and affective temperaments were evaluated using Akiskal’s Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A) scales. Cyberchondria was assessed using McElroy and Shevlin’s Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS). Small to medium positive correlations were found between depressive, cyclothymic, irritable and anxious temperaments and cyberchondria and between depressive and anxious temperaments and COVID-19 fears. However, no correlation was observed between the hyperthymic temperament and cyberchondria. Cyberchondria positively correlated with both COVID-19 fears scales, though the correlation coefficients were medium. Based on the results of linear regression analysis, only anxious temperament and COVID-19 fear of self-infection were significant predictors of cyberchondria. The analysis also revealed a significant indirect effect of anxious temperament on cyberchondria through fear of COVID-19 self-infection as a mediator between anxious temperament and cyberchondria.","Oniszczenko, Włodzimierz",PLoS One,115,26

With the genetic sequence data of the nCoV already available since January 10, 2020, leading pharmaceutical companies, world over, in turn, have started working on the clinical trials to produce vaccines against this nCoV. In fact, many vaccines under the Phase III trial have claimed to demonstrate their efficacy as high as 95% against nCoV. In India as of now, two vaccines have been licensed namely, Covishield (Live vaccine, Oxford AstraZeneca, United Kingdom) and Covaxin (inactivated vaccine, Bharat Biotech, India). Although, most of the countries offer no deferral period for the donors who have been administered an inactivated vaccine against this nCoV. However, the national blood transfusion council of India has recently recommended a donor deferral period of 28 days from the last dose of vaccination. This could essentially lead to a massive loss of eligible blood donors and jeopardise the already disrupted blood supply management due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Various classes of compounds isolated from this species have been identified as effective ingredients. Previous studies based on transcriptomes revealed only a few candidate genes for the biosynthesis of these active compounds in this medicinal plant. Here, we report a high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly of I. indigotica with a total size of 293.88 Mb and scaffold N50 = 36.16 Mb using single-molecule real-time long reads and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture techniques. We annotated 30,323 high-confidence protein-coding genes. Based on homolog searching and functional annotations, we identified many candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of main active components such as indoles, terpenoids, and phenylpropanoids. In addition, we found that some key enzyme-coding gene families related to the biosynthesis of these components were expanded due to tandem duplications, which likely drove the production of these major active compounds and explained why I. indigotica has excellent antibacterial and antiviral activities.

For instance, people may post exercise goals and behaviors on social media, while at the same time, they may be exposed to friends drinking alcohol and/or indulging in unhealthy snacking. This intersection of sociotechnical systems (i.e., social media), and health and wellbeing, has garnered increasing scholarly attention. How to understand and manage the continuous use intention of health-related social media, and then provide a better service platform and create a good service model for the needs of young adults has become an important topic in the research of social media and health-related fields. Based on the SOR theory, this paper constructs a theoretical model of factors affecting the continuous use intention of health-related social media. This paper uses questionnaires and structural equation empirical research methods, relevant software to process and analyze the data, and tests the applicability of the model. The results reveal that emotional support, information support, and service quality can significantly affect pan-family consciousness, pan-family consciousness can significantly affect the continuous use intention of health-related social media. In addition, our results also show that pan-family consciousness plays a mediating role between information support and the continuous use intention of health-related social media, pan-family consciousness plays a mediating role between the service quality and the continuous use intention of health-related social media, and self-efficacy plays a mediating role between pan-family consciousness and the continuous use intention of health-related social media.

COVID-19 vaccination was crucial to preventing and eliminating the disease, so vaccine development for COVID-19 was fast-tracked worldwide. Despite the fact that vaccination is commonly recognized as the most effective approach, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccine hesitancy is a global health issue. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of nurses in four different regions in Italy between 20 and 28 December 2020 to obtain data on the acceptance of the upcoming COVID-19 vaccination in order to plan specific interventions to increase the rate of vaccine coverage. Results: A total of 531 out of the 5000 nurses invited completed the online questionnaire. Most of the nurses enrolled in the study (73.4%) were female. Among the nurses, 91.5% intended to accept vaccination, whereas 2.3% were opposed and 6.2% were undecided. Female sex and confidence in vaccine efficacy represent the main predictors of vaccine intention among the study population using a logistic regression model, while other factors including vaccine safety concerns (side effects) were non-significant. Conclusions: Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, intention to be vaccinated was suboptimal among nurses in our sample. We also found a significant number of people undecided as to whether to accept the vaccine. Contrary to expectations, concerns about the safety of the vaccine were not found to affect the acceptance rate; nurses’ perception of vaccine efficacy and female sex were the main influencing factors on attitudes toward vaccination in our sample. Since the success of the COVID-19 immunization plan depends on the uptake rate, these findings are of great interest for public health policies. Interventions aimed at increasing employee awareness of vaccination efficacy should be promoted among nurses in order to increase the number of vaccinated people.","Trabucco Aurilio, Marco; Mennini, Francesco Saverio; Gazzillo, Simone; Massini, Laura; Bolcato, Matteo; Feola, Alessandro; Ferrari, Cristiana; Coppeta, Luca",Vaccines (Basel),115,15

We estimated associations between household composition and COVID-19 mortality in older adults ([≥]65 years) using a newly linked census-based dataset, and investigated whether living in a multi-generational household explained some of the elevated COVID-19 mortality amongst ethnic minority groups. Methods: Using retrospective data from the 2011 Census linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (2017-2019) and death registration data (up to 27th July 2020), we followed adults aged 65 years or over living in private households in England from 2 March 2020 until 27 July 2020 (n=10,078,568). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for COVID-19 death for people living in a multi-generational household compared with people living with another older adult, adjusting for geographical factors, socio-economic characteristics and pre-pandemic health. We conducted a causal mediation analysis to estimate the proportion of ethnic inequalities explained by living in a multi-generational household. Results: Living in a multi-generational household was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. After adjusting for confounding factors, the HRs for living in a multi-generational household with dependent children were 1.13 [95% confidence interval 1.01-1.27] and 1.17 [1.01-1.35] for older males and females. The HRs for living in a multi-generational household without dependent children were 1.03 [0.97 - 1.09] for older males and 1.22 [1.12 - 1.32] for older females. Living in a multi-generational household explained between 10% and 15% of the elevated risk of COVID-19 death among older females from South Asian background, but very little for South Asian males or people in other ethnic minority groups. Conclusion: Older adults living with younger people are at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, and this is a notable contributing factor to the excess risk experienced by older South Asian females compared to White females. Relevant public health interventions should be directed at communities where such multi-generational households are highly prevalent.

Meyer), a representative Chinese herbal medicine, can improve the body’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity. Recently, scientists have shifted emphasis towards the initial stages of different malignant diseases—corresponding organ fibrosis and explored the essential role of P. ginseng in the treatment of fibrotic diseases. MAIN BODY: In the first instance, the review generalizes the molecular mechanisms and common therapeutic methods of fibrosis. Next, due to the convenience and safety of individual medication, the research progress of ginseng extract and formulas in treating liver fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, myocardial fibrosis, and renal fibrosis has been systematically summarized. Finally, we describe active ingredients isolated from P. ginseng for their outstanding anti-fibrotic properties and further reveal the potential therapeutic prospect and limitations of P. ginseng in fibrotic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: P. ginseng can be regarded as a valuable herbal medicine against fibrous tissue proliferation. Ginseng extract, derived formulas and monomers can inhibit the abundant deposition of extracellular matrix which caused by repeated damage and provide protection for fibrotic organs. Although the molecular mechanisms such as transforming growth factor β signal transduction have been confirmed, future studies should still focus on exploring the underlying mechanisms of P. ginseng in treating fibrotic disease including the therapeutic targets of synergistic action of multiple components in P. ginseng. Moreover, it is also necessary to carry out clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of P. ginseng in combination with common fibrosis drugs.","Liu, Hao; Lv, Chongning; Lu, Jincai",Chin Med,115,28

We assessed the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, BioNTech, Mainz, Germany) administered as second dose in participants primed with ChAdOx1-S (Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca, Oxford, UK). METHODS: We did a phase 2, open-label, randomised, controlled trial on adults aged 18–60 years, vaccinated with a single dose of ChAdOx1-S 8–12 weeks before screening, and no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either BNT162b2 (0·3 mL) via a single intramuscular injection (intervention group) or continue observation (control group). The primary outcome was 14-day immunogenicity, measured by immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein and receptor binding domain (RBD). Antibody functionality was assessed using a pseudovirus neutralisation assay, and cellular immune response using an interferon-γ immunoassay. The safety outcome was 7-day reactogenicity, measured as solicited local and systemic adverse events. The primary analysis included all participants who received at least one dose of BNT162b2 and who had at least one efficacy evaluation after baseline. The safety analysis included all participants who received BNT162b2. This study is registered with EudraCT (2021-001978-37) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04860739), and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between April 24 and 30, 2021, 676 individuals were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=450) or control group (n=226) at five university hospitals in Spain (mean age 44 years [SD 9]; 382 [57%] women and 294 [43%] men). 663 (98%) participants (n=441 intervention, n=222 control) completed the study up to day 14. In the intervention group, geometric mean titres of RBD antibodies increased from 71·46 BAU/mL (95% CI 59·84–85·33) at baseline to 7756·68 BAU/mL (7371·53–8161·96) at day 14 (p<0·0001). IgG against trimeric spike protein increased from 98·40 BAU/mL (95% CI 85·69–112·99) to 3684·87 BAU/mL (3429·87–3958·83). The interventional:control ratio was 77·69 (95% CI 59·57–101·32) for RBD protein and 36·41 (29·31–45·23) for trimeric spike protein IgG. Reactions were mild (n=1210 [68%]) or moderate (n=530 [30%]), with injection site pain (n=395 [88%]), induration (n=159 [35%]), headache (n=199 [44%]), and myalgia (n=194 [43%]) the most commonly reported adverse events. No serious adverse events were reported.

While cats have not been found to be infected with the organism, significant percentages of dogs from Australia and Africa are infected, indicating that they may be important mammalian reservoirs. The objective of this study was to determine the presence of R. felis DNA in the blood of domestic dogs and cats in the USA. METHODS: Three previously validated PCR assays for R. felis and DNA sequencing were performed on blood samples obtained from clinically ill domestic cats and dogs from 45 states (2008–2020) in the USA. The blood samples had been submitted for the diagnosis of various tick-borne diseases in dogs and feline infectious peritonitis virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, and Bartonella spp. in cats. Phylogenetic comparisons were performed on the gltA nucleotide sequences obtained in the study and those reported for R. felis and R. felis-like organisms. RESULTS: Low copy numbers of R. felis DNA (around 100 copies/ml whole blood) were found in four cats (4/752, 0.53%) and three dogs (3/777, 0.39%). The very low levels of infection in clinically ill animals is consistent with R. felis being an unlikely cause of disease in naturally infected dogs and cats. The low copy numbers we found emphasize the requirement for very sensitive PCRs in prevalence studies. CONCLUSIONS: The low prevalence of naturally infected PCR-positive cats is further evidence that cats are unlikely to be important reservoirs of R. felis. Similarly, the low prevalence in dogs suggests they are not important reservoirs in the USA. Investigations should continue into the role other mammalian species may be playing in the epidemiology of R. felis infections.

In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.","Devaux, Christian A.; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Colson, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",Int J Antimicrob Agents,115,21

Understanding the clinical characteristics, interactions with the environment, and the variables that favor or hinder its dissemination help the public authorities in the fight and prevention, leading for a rapid response in society. Using models to estimate contamination scenarios in real time plays an important role. Population compartments models based on ordinary differential equations (ODE) for a given region assume two homogeneous premises, the contact mechanisms and diffusion rates, disregarding heterogeneous factors as different contact rates for each municipality and the flow of contaminated people among them. This work considers a hybrid model for covid-19, based on local SIR models and the population flow network among municipalities, responsible for a complex lag dynamic in their contagion curves. Based on actual infection data, local contact rates ([Formula: see text]) are evaluated. The epidemic evolution at each municipality depends on the local SIR parameters and on the inter-municipality transport flow. When heterogeneity of [Formula: see text] values and flow network are included, forecasts differ from those of the homogeneous ODE model. This effect is more relevant when more municipalities are considered, hinting that the latter overestimates new cases. In addition, mitigation scenarios are assessed to evaluate the effect of earlier interventions reducing the inter-municipality flux. Restricting the flow between municipalities in the initial stage of the epidemic is fundamental for flattening the contamination curve, highlighting advantages of a contamination lag between the capital curve and those of other municipalities in the territories.","Miranda, José Garcia Vivas; Silva, Mateus Souza; Bertolino, José Gabriel; Vasconcelos, Rodrigo Nogueira; Cambui, Elaine Cristina Barbosa; Araújo, Marcio Luis Valença; Saba, Hugo; Costa, Diego Pereira; Duverger, Soltan Galano; de-Oliveira, Matheus Teles; Neto, Hildebrando Simões de Araújo; Franca-Rocha, Washington de Jesus Sant’anna; Jorge, Daniel Cardoso Pereira; de Oliveira, Juliane Fonseca; Andrade, Roberto Fernandes Silva; Rosário, Raphael Silva",Physica D,115,22

We sought to identify alterations to established conventional evidence-based management of acute severe ulcerative colitis during the early COVID-19 pandemic, the effect on outcomes, and any associations with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: The PROTECT-ASUC study was a multicentre, observational, case-control study in 60 acute secondary care hospitals throughout the UK. We included adults (≥18 years) with either ulcerative colitis or inflammatory bowel disease unclassified, who presented with acute severe ulcerative colitis and fulfilled the Truelove and Witts criteria. Cases and controls were identified as either admitted or managed in emergency ambulatory care settings between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic period cohort), or between Jan 1, 2019, and June 30, 2019 (historical control cohort), respectively. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis receiving rescue therapy (including primary induction) or colectomy. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04411784. FINDINGS: We included 782 patients (398 in the pandemic period cohort and 384 in the historical control cohort) who met the Truelove and Witts criteria for acute severe ulcerative colitis. The proportion of patients receiving rescue therapy (including primary induction) or surgery was higher during the pandemic period than in the historical period (217 [55%] of 393 patients vs 159 [42%] of 380 patients; p=0·00024) and the time to rescue therapy was shorter in the pandemic cohort than in the historical cohort (p=0·0026). This difference was driven by a greater use of rescue and primary induction therapies with biologicals, ciclosporin, or tofacitinib in the COVID-19 pandemic period cohort than in the historical control period cohort (177 [46%] of 387 patients in the COVID-19 cohort vs 134 [36%] of 373 patients in the historical cohort; p=0·0064). During the pandemic, more patients received ambulatory (outpatient) intravenous steroids (51 [13%] of 385 patients vs 19 [5%] of 360 patients; p=0·00023). Fewer patients received thiopurines (29 [7%] of 398 patients vs 46 [12%] of 384; p=0·029) and 5-aminosalicylic acids (67 [17%] of 398 patients vs 98 [26%] of 384; p=0·0037) during the pandemic than in the historical control period. Colectomy rates were similar between the pandemic and historical control groups (64 [16%] of 389 vs 50 [13%] of 375; p=0·26); however, laparoscopic surgery was less frequently performed during the pandemic period (34 [53%] of 64] vs 38 [76%] of 50; p=0·018). Five (2%) of 253 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during hospital treatment. Two (2%) of 103 patients re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the 3-month follow-up were positive 5 days and 12 days, respectively, after discharge from index admission. Both recovered without serious outcomes. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic altered practice patterns of gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons in the management of acute severe ulcerative colitis but was associated with similar outcomes to a historical cohort. Despite continued use of high-dose corticosteroids and biologicals, the incidence of COVID-19 within 3 months was low and not associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes.

Measurements were collected for each disease for nine criteria that described potential disease impacts. A total score was calculated for each disease using a weighted sum value function that aggregated the nine disease criterion measurements and weights of importance for the criteria that were previously elicited from two groups of industry stakeholders. One stakeholder group placed most value on the impacts of disease on livestock, and one group placed more value on the zoonotic impacts of diseases. Prioritisation lists ordered by disease score were produced for both of these groups. Vesicular diseases were found to have the highest priority for the group valuing disease impacts on livestock, followed by acute forms of African and classical swine fever, then highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. The group who valued zoonotic disease impacts prioritised rabies, followed by Japanese encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis and Nipah virus, interspersed with vesicular diseases. The multi-criteria framework used in this study systematically prioritised diseases using a multi-attribute theory based technique that provided transparency and repeatability in the process. Flexibility of the framework was demonstrated by aggregating the criterion weights from more than one stakeholder group with the disease measurements for the criteria. This technique allowed industry stakeholders to be active in resource allocation for their industry without the need to be disease experts. We believe it is the first prioritisation of livestock diseases using values provided by industry stakeholders. The prioritisation lists will be used by industry stakeholders to identify diseases for further risk analysis and disease spread modelling to understand biosecurity risks to this industry.","Brookes, V.J.; Hernández-Jover, M.; Cowled, B.; Holyoake, P.K.; Ward, M.P.",Prev Vet Med,115,17

Digital healthcare platforms are making transformative changes to conventional healthcare processes which can provide many beneficial improvements for both citizen and government provision to society. These benefits are obvious during pandemics such as Covid-19, when most healthcare services are offered through digital means. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to measure the role of trust and information quality when using digital healthcare platforms. These constructs are integrated with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to provide a better understanding of the consumer perspective regarding the use of digital healthcare platforms. METHODS: Online structured self-administered questionnaire was utilized to collect the data. A sample consisting of 249 respondents participated in the questionnaire. Descriptive analysis was used to characterize the attributes of participants, and other statistical tests were conducted to ensure the reliability and validity of the survey. The model of the study was evaluated using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to explain the extent of the relationship among latent variables. RESULTS: The study determined that facilitating conditions (t=0.233, p=0.023) and trust (t=0.324, p=0.005) had a significant impact on consumers’ behavioral intention of using such platforms during Covid-19 pandemic.

With the incorporation of monoclonal antibody (mAb)-conjugated immunomagnetic beads, target influenza A viral particles such as A/H(1)N(1) and A/H(3)N(2) can be specifically recognized and are bound onto the surface of the immunomagnetic beads from the specimen sample. This is followed by labeling the fluorescent signal onto the virus-bound magnetic complexes by specific developing mAb with R-phycoerythrin (PE). Finally, the optical intensity of the magnetic complexes can be analyzed immediately by the optical detection module. Significantly, the limit of detection (LOD) of this immunomagnetic bead-based microfluidic system for the detection of influenza A virus in a specimen sample is approximately 5 × 10(−4) hemagglutin units (HAU), which is 1024 times better than compared to conventional bench-top systems using flow cytometry. More importantly, the entire diagnostic protocol, from the purification of target viral particles to optical detection of the magnetic complexes, can be automatically completed within 15 min in this immunomagnetic bead-based microfluidic system, which is only 8.5% of the time required when compared to a manual protocol. As a whole, this microfluidic system may provide a powerful platform for the rapid diagnosis of influenza A virus infection and may be extended for diagnosis of other types of infectious diseases with a high specificity and sensitivity.","Lien, Kang-Yi; Hung, Lien-Yu; Huang, Tze-Bin; Tsai, Yi-Che; Lei, Huan-Yao; Lee, Gwo-Bin",Biosens Bioelectron,115,1

Although in silico analyses based on receptor binding and diverse in vitro cell cultures were valuable, exact prediction of species susceptibility based on these tools proved challenging. Here, we assessed whether precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) could facilitate the selection of animal models, thereby reducing animal experimentation. Pig, hamster and cat PCLS were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 and virus replication was followed over time. Virus replicated efficiently in PCLS from hamsters and cats, while no evidence of replication was obtained for pig PCLS. These data corroborate the findings of many research groups that have investigated the susceptibility of hamsters, pigs and cats towards infection with SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest that PCLS can be used as convenient tool for the screening of different animal species for sensitivity to newly emerged viruses. To validate our results obtained in PCLS, we employed the hamster model. Hamsters were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 via the intranasal route. Susceptibility to infection was evaluated by body weight loss, viral loads in oropharyngeal swabs and respiratory tissues and lung pathology. The broadly used hamster model was further refined by including activity tracking of the hamsters by an activity wheel as a very robust and sensitive parameter for clinical health. In addition, to facilitate the quantification of pathology in the lungs, we devised a semi-quantitative scoring system for evaluating the degree of histological changes in the lungs. The inclusion of these additional parameters refined and enriched the hamster model, allowing for the generation of more data from a single experiment.","Gerhards, Nora M.; Cornelissen, Jan B. W.

Using data drawn between December 31, 2019 and July 31, 2020, this study found that in countries with a high level of social trust, particularly trust among ingroup members, or with a narrower or wider range than the intermediate range of trustees, the number of new infections tended to reach the first peak within a shorter time duration than in other countries. These results imply that in such societies, on the one hand, high cooperation among people to achieve common goals and strong compliance to social norms may allow them to begin neutralizing COVID-19 faster. On the other hand, however, the low risk perception and prevalence of cohesive relationships among people may lead to speedier transmission of COVID-19 before neutralization takes place.","Min, Jungwon",PLoS One,115,4

Several recent studies have reported that chimeric RNAs promote tumorigenesis and cancer drug resistance. Therefore, chimeric RNAs are crucial for generating phenotypic diversity between cancer cells that drives the adaptive evolution of cancer. Here, we will discuss the significance of chimeric RNAs in generating functional diversity in cancer cells and their potential impact on developing cancer from an evolutionary viewpoint. ABSTRACT: Gene fusions can give rise to somatic alterations in cancers. Fusion genes have the potential to create chimeric RNAs, which can generate the phenotypic diversity of cancer cells, and could be associated with novel molecular functions related to cancer cell survival and proliferation. The expression of chimeric RNAs in cancer cells might impact diverse cancer-related functions, including loss of apoptosis and cancer cell plasticity, and promote oncogenesis. Due to their recurrence in cancers and functional association with oncogenic processes, chimeric RNAs are considered biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. Several recent studies demonstrated that chimeric RNAs could lead to the generation of new functionality for the resistance of cancer cells against drug therapy. Therefore, targeting chimeric RNAs in drug resistance cancer could be useful for developing precision medicine. So, understanding the functional impact of chimeric RNAs in cancer cells from an evolutionary perspective will be helpful to elucidate cancer evolution, which could provide a new insight to design more effective therapies for cancer patients in a personalized manner.","Mukherjee, Sumit; Heng, Henry H.; Frenkel-Morgenstern, Milana",Cancers (Basel),115,16

The main objective was to evaluate the change in perception of students in the use of Instagram as a learning medium for qualitative biomechanical analysis as a part of their undergraduate sports science program. 171 students filled out a questionnaire on the use of smartphones, social networks, and specifically Instagram, before and after doing an assignment of qualitative analysis that was carried. The results indicated a positive change in the perspective of the students when asked if class assignments can be done on mobile devices (p = 0.002) and social media (p < 0.001). The students also indicated a greater interest in doing assignments via social networks (p < 0.001), especially in the subject of biomechanics (p < 0.001).

In this context, we launched a study to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and the socio-economic impact of the spring outbreak in the population. METHOD: We conducted an online survey of the participants of the CARTaGENE population-based cohort, composed of middle-aged and older adults. We collected information on socio-demographic, lifestyle, health condition, COVID-19 related symptoms and COVID-19 testing. We studied the association between these factors and two outcomes: the status of having been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and the status of having received a positive test. These associations were measured with univariate and multivariate analyses using a hybrid tree-based regression model. RESULTS: Among the 8,129 respondents from the CARTaGENE cohort, 649 were tested for COVID-19 and 41 were positive. Medical workers and individuals having a contact with a COVID-19 patient had the highest probabilities of being tested (32% and 42.4%, respectively) and of being positive (17.2% and 13.0%, respectively) among those tested. Approximately 8% of the participants declared that they have experienced at least one of the four COVID-19 related symptoms chosen by the Public Health authorities (fever, cough, dyspnea, anosmia) but were not tested. Results from the tree-based model analyses adjusted on exposure factors showed that the combination of dyspnea, dry cough and fever was highly associated with being tested whereas anosmia, fever, and headache were the most discriminant factors for having a positive test among those tested. During the spring outbreak, more than one third of the participants have experienced a decrease in access to health services. There were gender and age differences in the socio-economic and emotional impacts of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: We have shown some discrepancies between the symptoms associated with being tested and being positive. In particular, the anosmia is a major discriminant symptom for positivity whereas ear-nose-throat symptoms seem not to be COVID-19 related. The results also emphasize the need of increasing the accessibility of testing for the general population.

The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) required a data sharing statement (DSS) from submissions reporting clinical trials effective July 1, 2018. The required DSSs provide a window into current data sharing rates, practices, and norms among trialists and sponsors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implementation of the ICMJE DSS requirement in 3 leading medical journals: JAMA, Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a cross-sectional study of clinical trial reports published as articles in JAMA, Lancet, and NEJM between July 1, 2018, and April 4, 2020. Articles not eligible for DSS, including observational studies and letters or correspondence, were excluded. A MEDLINE/PubMed search identified 487 eligible clinical trials in JAMA (112 trials), Lancet (147 trials), and NEJM (228 trials). Two reviewers evaluated each of the 487 articles independently. EXPOSURE: Publication of clinical trial reports in an ICMJE medical journal requiring a DSS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes of the study were declared data availability and actual data availability in repositories. Other captured outcomes were data type, access, and conditions and reasons for data availability or unavailability. Associations with funding sources were examined. RESULTS: A total of 334 of 487 articles (68.6%; 95% CI, 64%-73%) declared data sharing, with nonindustry NIH-funded trials exhibiting the highest rates of declared data sharing (89%; 95% CI, 80%-98%) and industry-funded trials the lowest (61%; 95% CI, 54%-68%). However, only 2 IPD sets (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.0%-1.5%) were actually deidentified and publicly available as of April 10, 2020. The remaining were supposedly accessible via request to authors (143 of 334 articles [42.8%]), repository (89 of 334 articles [26.6%]), and company (78 of 334 articles [23.4%]). Among the 89 articles declaring that IPD would be stored in repositories, only 17 (19.1%) deposited data, mostly because of embargo and regulatory approval. Embargo was set in 47.3% of data-sharing articles (158 of 334), and in half of them the period exceeded 1 year or was unspecified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most trials published in JAMA, Lancet, and NEJM after the implementation of the ICMJE policy declared their intent to make clinical data available. However, a wide gap between declared and actual data sharing exists. To improve transparency and data reuse, journals should promote the use of unique pointers to data set location and standardized choices for embargo periods and access requirements.","Danchev, Valentin; Min, Yan; Borghi, John; Baiocchi, Mike; Ioannidis, John P.

Usually, this cytopathic effect (CPE) is ascribed to viral hijacking of cellular resources to fulfill viral needs. However, evidence is accumulating that CPE is not necessarily directly coupled to viral reproduction but may largely be due to host defensive and viral antidefensive activities. A major part in this virus–cell interaction appears to be played by a putative host-encoded program with multiple competing branches, leading to necrotic, apoptotic, and, possibly, other types of cell suicide. Manifestations of this program are controlled and modulated by host, viral, and environmental factors.","Agol, Vadim I.",Trends Microbiol,115,6

Also the replication of several nidoviruses was reported to depend on CypA, although possibly not to the same extent. These prior studies are difficult to compare, since different nidoviruses, cell lines and experimental set-ups were used. Here, we investigated the CypA dependence of three distantly related nidoviruses that can all replicate in Huh7 cells: the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV), the alphacoronavirus human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), and the betacoronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The replication of these viruses was compared in the same parental Huh7 cells and in CypA-knockout Huh7 cells generated using CRISPR/Cas9-technology. CypA depletion reduced EAV yields by ~ 3-log, whereas MERS-CoV progeny titers were modestly reduced (3-fold) and HCoV-229E replication was unchanged. This study reveals that the replication of nidoviruses can differ strikingly in its dependence on cellular CypA.","de Wilde, Adriaan H.; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C.; Beugeling, Corrine; Chatterji, Udayan; de Jong, Danielle; Gallay, Philippe; Szuhai, Karoly; Posthuma, Clara C.; Snijder, Eric J.",Virology,115,1

Review results show that most published algorithms: (a) are designed for one specific type of CCU; (b) are validated on data harvested only from one Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) monitor; (c) generate Signal Quality Indicators (SQI) that are not yet formalised for useful integration in clinical workflows; (d) operate either in standalone mode or coupled with CED or PD applications; (e) are rarely evaluated in real-time; and (f) are not implemented in clinical practice. In conclusion, it is recommended that AD algorithms conform to generic input and output interfaces with commonly defined data: (1) type; (2) frequency; (3) length; and (4) SQIs. This shall promote (a) reusability of algorithms across different CCU domains; (b) evaluation on different OEM monitor data; (c) fair comparison through formalised SQIs; (d) meaningful integration with other AD, CED and PD algorithms; and (e) real-time implementation in clinical workflows.","Nizami, Shermeen; Green, James R.; McGregor, Carolyn",IEEE reviews in biomedical engineering,115,21

We reported 2 cases of shoulder weakness and amyotrophy related to spinal accessory nerve (SAN) palsy due to neuralgic amyotrophy occurring after COVID-19 infection. Methods For both patients, clinical history, clinical examination, electrodiagnostic (EDX), and imaging examinations invalidated other diagnoses but confirmed NA diagnosis. Results The NA involved only the SAN in both cases. EDX revealed a characteristic axonal lesion found in NA. SAN conduction study revealed normal latencies and low compound motor action potential amplitude for trapezius muscle when needle examination demonstrated a neurogenic pattern and denervation signs in the trapezius muscle. Both patient's MRI revealed denervation T2 hyper signal in impaired muscles, and hyper signal of the involved roots, trunks, or nerves without any mass, cyst, injury, fibrous band, or tearing signs along SAN course.

Since its outbreak, it has become a global pandemic. During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), however, there is no mature experience or guidance on how to carry out emergency surgery for suspected cases requiring emergency surgical intervention and perioperative safety protection against virus. CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for emergency treatment due to ""3-d abdominal pain aggravated with cessation of exhaust and defecation"". After improving inspections and laboratory tests, the patient was assessed and diagnosed by the multiple discipline team as ""strangulation obstruction, pulmonary infection”. His body temperature was 38.8 °C, and the chest computed tomography showed pulmonary infection. Given fever and pneumonia, we could not rule out COVID-19 after consultation by fever clinicians and respiratory experts. Hence, we performed emergency surgery under three-level protection for the suspected case. After surgery, his nucleic acid test for COVID-19 was negative, meaning COVID-19 was excluded, and routine postoperative treatment and nursing was followed. The patient was treated with symptomatic support after the operation. The stomach tube and urinary tube were removed on the 1(st )d after the operation. The clearing diet was started on the 3(rd )d after the operation, and the body temperature returned to normal. Flatus and bowel movements were noted on 5(th) postoperative day. He was discharged after 8 d of hospitalization. The patient was followed up for 4 mo after discharge, no serious complications occurred. A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency room due to ""abdominal distention, fatigue for 6 d and fever for 13 h"". After the multiple discipline team evaluation, the patient was diagnosed as ""intestinal obstruction, abdominal mass, peritonitis and pulmonary infection"". At that time, the patient's body temperature was 39.6 °C, and chest computed tomography indicated pulmonary infection. COVID-19 could not be completely excluded after consultation in the fever outpatient department and respiratory department. Therefore, the patient was treated as a suspected case, and an urgent operation was performed under three-level medical protection. Postoperative nucleic acid test was negative, COVID-19 was excluded, and routine postoperative treatment and nursing were followed. After the operation, the patient received symptomatic and supportive treatment. The gastric tube was removed on the 1(st) d after the operation, and the urinary tube was removed on the 3(rd) d after the operation. Enteral nutrition began on the 3(rd) d after the operation. To date, no serious complications have been found during follow-up after discharge. CONCLUSION: Based on the previous treatment experience, we reviewed the procedures of two cases of suspected COVID-19 emergency surgery and extracted the perioperative protection experience. By referring to the literature and following the regulations on prevention and management of infectious diseases, we have developed a relatively mature and complete emergency surgical workflow for suspected COVID-19 cases and shared perioperative protection and management experience and measures.","Wu, Di; Xie, Tian-Yu; Sun, Xue-Hong; Wang, Xin-Xin",World J Clin Cases,115,28

Health care providers responded by rapidly transitioning from in-person to video consultations. Telemedicine (ie, video visits) is a potentially disruptive innovation; however, little is known about patient satisfaction with this emerging alternative to the traditional clinical encounter. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if patient satisfaction differs between video and in-person visits. METHODS: In this retrospective observational cohort study, we analyzed 38,609 Press Ganey patient satisfaction survey outcomes from clinic encounters (620 video visits vs 37,989 in-person visits) at a single-institution, urban, quaternary academic medical center in New York City for patients aged 18 years, from April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020. Time was categorized as pre–COVID-19 and COVID-19 (before vs after March 4, 2020). Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests and multivariable linear regression were used for hypothesis testing and statistical modeling, respectively. RESULTS: We experienced an 8729% increase in video visit utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period last year. Video visit Press Ganey scores were significantly higher than in-person visits (94.9% vs 92.5%; P<.001). In adjusted analyses, video visits (parameter estimate [PE] 2.18; 95% CI 1.20-3.16) and the COVID-19 period (PE 0.55; 95% CI 0.04-1.06) were associated with higher patient satisfaction. Younger age (PE –2.05; 95% CI –2.66 to –1.22), female gender (PE –0.73; 95% CI –0.96 to –0.50), and new visit type (PE –0.75; 95% CI –1.00 to –0.49) were associated with lower patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Patient satisfaction with video visits is high and is not a barrier toward a paradigm shift away from traditional in-person clinic visits. Future research comparing other clinic visit quality indicators is needed to guide and implement the widespread adoption of telemedicine.","Ramaswamy, Ashwin; Yu, Miko; Drangsholt, Siri; Ng, Eric; Culligan, Patrick J; Schlegel, Peter N; Hu, Jim C",J Med Internet Res,115,16

METHODS: Twenty‐one institutions providing live online dental courses in China during COVID‐19 epidemic enrolled in this study. Their online and/or offline course provision before and during the epidemic was retrospectively inquired. If live online education was provided, the number of courses, duration and number of participants per week were further investigated. Time distributions of live online dental courses were recorded and classified as within working time and out of working time. The test period of COVID‐19 epidemic was for two weeks between 16 February and 29 February 2020. The control period of pre‐COVID‐19 epidemic was for ten weeks between 01 November 2019 and 09 January 2020. RESULTS: The percentages of offline and online courses provided by 21 dental continuing education institutions before COVID‐19 epidemic were 95.2% (20 out of 21) and 28.6% (6 out of 21), respectively. All the institutions suspended offline courses whilst providing two live online courses, on average, per week with 188 minutes duration and 7290 participants during the epidemic. The total number of online courses for 10 weeks before the epidemic was 33, and that for two weeks during the epidemic was 119. The proportion of courses provided within working time raised from 6.1% (2 out of 33) of pre‐COVID‐19 to 46.2% (55 out of 119) during COVID‐19. There were significant differences between before and during the epidemic (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The dental continuing education transferred from offline to online dramatically, and live online dental continuing education increased significantly during COVID‐19 epidemic in China.","Liu, Xiaoqiang; Zhou, Jianfeng; Chen, Li; Yang, Yang; Tan, Jianguo",Eur J Dent Educ,115,1

These problems can increase downtime and production loss. In these wells, the diagnosis of operation conditions is carried out through downhole dynamometer cards, via pre-established patterns, with human visual effort in the operation centers. Starting with machine learning algorithms, several papers have been published on the subject, but it is still common to have doubts concerning the difficulty level of the dynamometer card classification task and best practices for solving the problem. In the search for answers to these questions, this work carried out sixty tests with more than 50,000 dynamometer cards from 38 wells in the Mossoró, RN, Brazil. In addition, it presented test results for three algorithms (decision tree, random forest and XGBoost), three descriptors (Fourier, wavelet and card load values), as well as pipelines provided by automated machine learning. Tests with and without the tuning of hypermeters, different levels of dataset balancing and various evaluation metrics were evaluated.

This article aims to investigate the effect of the partial lockdown on the main ambient air pollutants and their elemental concentrations bound to PM(2.5) in Hanoi. In addition to the PM(2.5) samples collected at three urban sites in Hanoi, the daily PM(2.5), NO(2), O(3), and SO(2) levels were collected from the automatic ambient air quality monitoring station at Nguyen Van Cu street to analyze the pollution level before (March 10th–March 31st) and during the partial lockdown (April 1st–April 22nd) with “current” data obtained in 2020 and “historical” data obtained in 2014, 2016, and 2017. The results showed that NO(2), PM(2.5), O(3), and SO(2) concentrations obtained from the automatic ambient air quality monitoring station were reduced by 75.8, 55.9, 21.4, and 60.7%, respectively, compared with historical data. Besides, the concentration of PM(2.5) at sampling sites declined by 41.8% during the partial lockdown.

Estimation of the SAR is an important part of understanding and controlling the transmission of infectious diseases. In practice, it is most often estimated using binomial models such as logistic regression, which implicitly attribute all secondary infections in a household to the primary case. In the simplest case, the number of secondary infections in a household with m susceptibles and a single primary case is modeled as a binomial(m, p) random variable where p is the SAR. Although it has long been understood that transmission within households is not binomial, it is thought that multiple generations of transmission can be neglected safely when p is small. We use probability generating functions and simulations to show that this is a mistake. The proportion of susceptible household members infected can be substantially larger than the SAR even when p is small. As a result, binomial estimates of the SAR are biased upward and their confidence intervals have poor coverage probabilities even if adjusted for clustering. Accurate point and interval estimates of the SAR can be obtained using longitudinal chain binomial models or pairwise survival analysis, which account for multiple generations of transmission within households, the ongoing risk of infection from outside the household, and incomplete follow-up. We illustrate the practical implications of these results in an analysis of household surveillance data collected by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic.","Sharker, Yushuf; Kenah, Eben",PLoS Comput Biol,115,1

Over the past 25 years, the prevalence of FeLV infection has decreased considerably, thanks both to reliable tests for the identification of viraemic carriers and to effective vaccines. Infection Transmission between cats occurs mainly through friendly contacts, but also through biting. In large groups of non-vaccinated cats, around 30–40% will develop persistent viraemia, 30–40% show transient viraemia and 20–30% seroconvert. Young kittens are especially susceptible to FeLV infection. Disease signs The most common signs of persistent FeLV viraemia are immune suppression, anaemia and lymphoma. Less common signs are immune-mediated disease, chronic enteritis, reproductive disorders and peripheral neuropathies. Most persistently viraemic cats die within 2–3 years. Diagnosis In low-prevalence areas there may be a risk of false-positive results; a doubtful positive test result in a healthy cat should therefore be confirmed, preferably by PCR for provirus. Asymptomatic FeLV-positive cats should be retested. Disease management Supportive therapy and good nursing care are required. Secondary infections should be treated promptly. Cats infected with FeLV should remain indoors. Vaccination against common pathogens should be maintained. Inactivated vaccines are recommended. The virus does not survive for long outside the host. Vaccination recommendations All cats with an uncertain FeLV status should be tested prior to vaccination. All healthy cats at potential risk of exposure should be vaccinated against FeLV. Kittens should be vaccinated at 8–9 weeks of age, with a second vaccination at 12 weeks, followed by a booster 1 year later. The ABCD suggests that, in cats older than 3–4 years of age, a booster every 2–3 years suffices, in view of the significantly lower susceptibility of older cats.","Lutz, Hans; Addie, Diane; Belák, Sándor; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman; Frymus, Tadeusz; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Hartmann, Katrin; Hosie, Margaret J.; Lloret, Albert; Marsilio, Fulvio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Radford, Alan D.; Thiry, Etienne; Truyen, Uwe; Horzinek, Marian C.",Journal of Feline Medicine & Surgery,115,16

Three mixing ventilation methods, which are widely used in current bus configurations, and an alternative displacement ventilation method were numerically assessed in terms of their ability to limit the risk of airborne influenza infection. Furthermore, both the non air-recirculation and air-recirculation with filtration ventilation modes were investigated in terms of the influenza infection probability. According to the simulation results, air-recirculation mode with high efficiency filtration was found to cause almost the same infection risk as non air-recirculation mode (100% outdoor air supply), which indicated a potential benefit of filtration in reducing the infection risk. Additionally, for the commonly used mixing ventilation methods, air distribution method, location of return/exhaust opening and seat arrangement affected the airborne transmission of influenza between passengers. The displacement ventilation method was found to be more effective in limiting the risk of airborne infection. Overall, the developed numerical model can provide insights into how the micro-environmental conditions affect airborne infection transmission in buses. This numerical model can assist in developing effective control strategies related to airborne transmitted diseases for other frequently used public transportation systems, such as trains and airplanes.","Zhu, Shengwei; Srebric, Jelena; Spengler, John D.; Demokritou, Philip",Build Environ,115,16

Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is a novel target for inflammatory disease, and ibudilast (IBU), a PDE4 inhibitor, inhibits inflammatory response. Our study investigated the effect of IBU on the pathogenesis of neonatal ARDS and the underlying mechanism related to it. MATERIAL AND METHODS Western blotting was performed to analyze the expression levels of PDE4, CXCR4, SDF-1, CXCR5, CXCL1, inflammatory cytokines, and proteins related to cell apoptosis. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to observe the pathological morphology of lung tissue. Pulmonary edema score was used to assess the degree of lung water accumulation after pulmonary injury. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to assess levels of inï¬ammatory factors (TNF-alpha, IL-1ß, IL-6, and MCP-1) in serum. TUNEL assay was used to detect apoptotic cells. RESULTS Increased expression of PDE4 was observed in an LPS-induced neonatal ARDS mouse model, and IBU ameliorated LPS-induced pathological manifestations and pulmonary edema in lung tissue. In addition, IBU attenuated the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by inactivating the chemokine axis in the LPS-induced neonatal ARDS mouse model. Finally, IBU significantly reduced LPS-induced cell apoptosis in lung tissue. CONCLUSIONS IBU, a PDE4 inhibitor, protected against ARDS by interfering with pulmonary inflammation and apoptosis. Our findings provide a novel and promising strategy to regulate pulmonary inflammation in ARDS.","Yang, Dongjie; Yang, Yihan; Zhao, Yue",Med Sci Monit,115,5

HF patients infected with COVID-19 are at a significant risk of severe illness and death. They usually present with shortness of breath and radiologic signs of an acute decompensation, which can mask the manifestations of COVID-19. Delay in the diagnosis increases the risk of individual poor outcomes and jeopardizes healthcare workers if protective and isolation measures are not established promptly. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic is forcing health-care systems to modify the delivery of care to patients. Outpatient services are being done virtually, and elective procedures postponed. These may have an impact on the quality of life and survival of chronic HF patients. We present two cases of patients with the previous history of HF who developed an acute exacerbation secondary to COVID-19 infection. In this review, we focused on the main challenges physicians face when dealing with COVID-19 in chronic HF patients at the individual and system levels.","Ata, Fateen; Montoro-Lopez, Maria Nieves; Awouda, Samah; Elsukkar, Abdallah M Abu; Badr, Amr Mohamed Hamed; Patel, Ashfaq Ahmad Abdul Hamid",Heart Views,115,1

This is a potentially vulnerable group and a critical developmental phase for women and infants. A mixed methods design was used to collect quantitative and qualitative data that provided a robust insight into their unique needs. A total of 174 women who were either pregnant or post-birth participated. The main findings demonstrated that women in this cohort experienced varying levels of stress and isolation but also positive experiences. Exploring the relationship between mental health (perceived stress and wellbeing) and resilience (mindfulness and self-compassion) revealed an association between positive mental health and higher levels of mindfulness and self-compassion. Positive mindsets may be protective against psychological distress for the mother and her child, suggesting that meditation-based or similar training might help support expectant and post-birth mothers during times of crisis, such as a pandemic. This information could be used to make recommendations for future planning for practitioners and policymakers in preparing for prospective infection waves, pandemics, or natural disasters, and could be used to develop targeted tools, support, and care.","Davis, Jacqueline A.; Gibson, Lisa Y.; Bear, Natasha L.; Finlay-Jones, Amy L.; Ohan, Jeneva L.; Silva, Desiree T.; Prescott, Susan L.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,115,1

Our aim was to assess the prevalence, risk factors and clinical outcomes of OD and MN in a general hospital during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study involving clinical assessment of OD (Volume-Viscosity Swallowing Test), and nutritional screening (NRS2002) and assessment (GLIM criteria) in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in general wards at the Consorci Sanitari del Maresme, Catalonia, Spain. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients were assessed at pre-admission, admission and discharge, and after 3 and 6-months follow-up. RESULTS: We included 205 consecutive patients (69.28 ± 17.52 years, Charlson 3.74 ± 2.62, mean hospital stay 16.8 ± 13.0 days). At admission, Barthel Index was 81.3 ± 30.3; BMI 28.5 ± 5.4 kg/m(2); OD prevalence 51.7% (44.1% impaired safety of swallow); and 45.5% developed MN with a mean weight loss of 10.1 ± 5.0 kg during hospitalization. OD was an independent risk factor for MN during hospitalization (OR 3.96 [1.45–10.75]), and hospitalization was prolonged in patients with MN compared with those without (21.9 ± 14.8 vs 11.9 ± 8.9 days, respectively; p < 0.0001). OD was independently associated with comorbidities, neurological symptoms, and low functionality. At 6-month follow-up, prevalence of OD was still 23.3% and that of MN only 7.1%. Patients with OD at discharge showed reduced 6-month survival than those without OD at discharge (71.6% vs 92.9%, p < 0.001); in contrast, those with MN at discharge did not show 6-month survival differences compared to those without (85.4% vs 83.8%, p = 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence and burden of OD and MN in patients hospitalized in COVID-19 wards is very high. Our results suggest that optimizing the management of MN might shorten the hospitalization period but optimizing the management of OD will likely impact the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients and improve their clinical outcomes and survival after hospital discharge.

METHODS: In a multicenter case-control analysis of US adults hospitalized March 11 - May 5, 2021, we evaluated vaccine effectiveness to prevent Covid-19 hospitalizations by comparing odds of prior vaccination with an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) between cases hospitalized with Covid-19 and hospital-based controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Among 1210 participants, median age was 58 years, 22.8% were Black, 13.8% were Hispanic, and 20.6% had immunosuppression. SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 was most common variant (59.7% of sequenced viruses). Full vaccination (receipt of two vaccine doses ≥14 days before illness onset) had been received by 45/590 (7.6%) cases and 215/620 (34.7%) controls. Overall vaccine effectiveness was 86.9% (95% CI: 80.4 to 91.2%). Vaccine effectiveness was similar for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and highest in adults aged 18–49 years (97.3%; 95% CI: 78.9 to 99.7%). Among 45 patients with vaccine-breakthrough Covid hospitalizations, 44 (97.8%) were ≥50 years old and 20 (44.4%) had immunosuppression. Vaccine effectiveness was lower among patients with immunosuppression (59.2%; 95% CI: 11.9 to 81.1%) than without immunosuppression (91.3%; 95% CI: 85.5 to 94.7%). CONCLUSION: During March–May 2021, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were highly effective for preventing Covid-19 hospitalizations among US adults.

A wide variety of organs have been found to be involved with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent reports indicate that the CNS is not spared. Headache, dysguesia and hyposmia, some more serious neurologic manifestations including encephalopathy Guillain Barre syndrome and stroke are now being reported as the number of patients with COVID-19 across the globe. We report a case of meningoencephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 who presented with altered mental status. CASE PRESENTATION: 43-year-old male with a PMH significant for insulin-dependent diabetes presented with altered mental status. In Emergency department was noted to have rhythmic jerking movements and his gaze was deviated to the right, concerning for seizure activity. Upon admission it was confirmed to have COVID-19 via detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen using the Simplexa SARS-CoV-2 assay. Neurological examination revealed confusion with orientation only to self, inability to follow commands, and no apparent focal neurological deficits. Otherwise, general examination was unremarkable and vital signs were within normal. CT head was negative for any acute pathology. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and color less with an elevated CSF cell count and lymphocytic predominance suspicious for viral encephalitis.The CSF glucose (70 mg/dL) was increased and CSF protein levels (19 mg/dL) were decreased. A CSF PCR panel including Cryptococcus neoformans, HSV, varicella zoster virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and enterovirus was negative. The SARS-CoV-2 CSF PCR was negative. Labs were significant for elevated ferritin, LDH, C reactive protein and Di dimer. EEG shows diffuse slowing in the theta range indicative of encephalopathy and lacked any epileptogenic activity. Patient started on steroids, Remedesivir with concern of COVID 19 meningoencephalitis. Within the next 3 days, his mentation progressively improved;he was able to communicate, and was following commands. DISCUSSION: The neuroinvasive nature of human coronavirus has been previously reported during the 2002–2003 SARS-CoV pandemic when viral nucleic acids were found in the human brain upon autopsies. It was postulated by scientists in China that SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus from the SARS-CoV family, could also infect the brain when they observed neurologic signs among patients with COVID-19 related respiratory illness. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, meningoencephalitis should be considered as a possible manifestation of COVID-19 disease. A suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 meningitis or encephalitis should be high among patients presenting with neurological symptoms during this era of pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 testing should be included as part of the workup in addition to other infectious causes. REFERENCE #1: Gu J., Gong E., Zhang B. Multiple organ infection and the pathogenesis of SARS.

In 70 short episodes released daily on YouTube, Alone Together aimed to disseminate timely and accurate information to increase young people's knowledge, motivation and actions to prevent COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify Alone Together viewer's perspectives on the global COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdowns by examining the words, conversations, experiences and emotions expressed on social media in response to the Alone Together episodes. We also assessed how viewers used the series and its online community as a source of support during the global pandemic. METHODS: 3,982 comments and 70 live chat conversations were extracted from YouTube between April-October 2020 and analysed through a data-led inductive thematic approach. Aggregated demographic and geographical data were collected using YouTube Analytics. RESULTS: The miniseries had a global reach across five continents, with a total of 7.7 million views across MTV Shuga platforms. The series had over 1 million views over 70 episodes on YouTube and an average of 5,683 unique viewers per episode on YouTube. The dominant audience was adults under the age of 35 and women. Across diverse countries like Nigeria, Ghana, the USA and the UK, Viewers believed that COVID-19 was serious and expressed that it was socially responsible to follow public health measures. The series storylines about the impact of self-isolation on mental health, exposure to violence in lockdowns and restricted employment opportunities due to the pandemic resonated with young viewers. Tuning in to the miniseries provided viewers with reliable information, entertainment, and an online community during an isolating, confusing and worrying time. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of COVID-19, viewers from at least 53 countries connected on social media via the MTV miniseries. The analysis showed how digitally connected people under the age of 35, predominantly women, felt compelled to follow COVID-19 safety measures despite the pandemic's impact on their social, educational and financial needs. Viewers used social media to reach out to fellow viewers for advice, solace, support and resources. Organisations, governments and individuals have been forced to innovate during the pandemic to ensure people can access services safely and remotely. This analysis showed that women under 35 were especially receptive to receiving support from online communities and media services. Peer influence and support online can be a powerful public health tool as people have a great capacity to influence each other and shape norms around public health. However, online services are not accessible to everyone, and COVID-19 has increased disparities between digitally connected and unconnected younger adults.","Baker, Venetia; Arnold, Georgia; Piot, Sara; Thwala, Lesedi; Glynn, Judith; Hargreaves, James; Birdthistle, Isolde",JMIR formative research,115,20

We compare simulations with available experimental data, describe the resulting conformational ensembles, and identify the presence of specific structural rearrangements in apical and internal loops that may be functionally relevant. Our atomic-detailed structural predictions reveal a rich dynamics in these RNA molecules, could help the experimental characterisation of these systems, and provide putative three-dimensional models for structure-based drug design studies.","Bottaro, Sandro; Bussi, Giovanni; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten",bioRxiv,115,27

Pre-existing health conditions and early morphological alterations may precipitate cardiac injury and dysfunction after contracting the virus. The current study aimed at assessing potential risk factors for COVID-19 cardiac complications in patients with pre-existing conditions and imaging predictors. Methods and Results: The multi-center, retrospective cohort study consecutively enrolled 400 patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 in six Chinese hospitals remote to the Wuhan epicenter. Patients were diagnosed with or without the complication of myocardial injury by history and cardiac biomarker Troponin I/T (TnI/T) elevation above the 99th percentile upper reference limit. The majority of COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury exhibited pre-existing health conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease. They had increased levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 and more in-hospital adverse events (admission to an intensive care unit, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death). Chest CT scan on admission demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury had higher epicardial adipose tissue volume ([EATV] 139.1 (83.8–195.9) vs. 92.6 (76.2–134.4) cm(2); P = 0.036). The optimal EATV cut-off value (137.1 cm(2)) served as a useful factor for assessing myocardial injury, which yielded sensitivity and specificity of 55.0% (95%CI, 32.0–76.2%) and 77.4% (95%CI, 71.6–82.3%) in adverse cardiac events, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that EATV over 137.1 cm(2) was a strong independent predictor for myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 [OR 3.058, (95%CI, 1.032–9.063); P = 0.044]. Conclusions: Augmented EATV on admission chest CT scan, together with the pre-existing health conditions (hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) and inflammatory cytokine production, is associated with increased myocardial injury and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Assessment of pre-existing conditions and chest CT scan EATV on admission may provide a threshold point potentially useful for predicting cardiovascular complications of COVID-19.","Wei, Zhi-Yao; Qiao, Rui; Chen, Jian; Huang, Ji; Wang, Wen-Jun; Yu, Hua; Xu, Jing; Wu, Hui; Wang, Chao; Gu, Chong-Huai; Li, Hong-Jiang; Li, Mi; Liu, Cong; Yang, Jun; Ding, Hua-Ming; Lu, Min-Jie; Yin, Wei-Hua; Wang, Yang; Li, Kun-Wei; Shi, Heng-Feng; Qian, Hai-Yan; Yang, Wei-Xian; Geng, Yong-Jian",Front Cardiovasc Med,115,16

Pollutants can lead to human health and environment hazards. The purpose of this review is to summarize the work done on detection of environmental pollutants using DNA nanosensors and challenges in the areas that can be focused for safe environment. RECENT FINDINGS: Most of the DNA-based nanosensors designed so far use DNA as recognition element. ssDNA, dsDNA, complementary mismatched DNA, aptamers, and G-quadruplex DNA are commonly used as probes in nanosensors. More and more DNA sequences are being designed that can specifically detect various pollutants even simultaneously in complex milk, wastewater, soil, blood, tap water, river, and pond water samples. The feasibility of direct detection, ease of designing, and analysis makes DNA nanosensors fit for future point-of-care applications. SUMMARY: DNA nanosensors are easy to design and have good sensitivity. DNA component and nanomaterials can be designed in a controlled manner to detect various environmental pollutants. This review identifies the recent advances in DNA nanosensor designing and opportunities available to design nanosensors for unexplored pathogens, antibiotics, pesticides, GMO, heavy metals, and other toxic pollutant.","Kumar, Vineet; Guleria, Praveen",Curr Pollut Rep,115,1

Through analyzing a random sample (n = 400) of Parler posts using the hashtags #COVID19Vaccine and #NoCovidVaccine, we use the concept of echo chambers to understand users’ discussions through a text analytics approach. Thematic analysis reveals five key themes: reasons to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine (40%), side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine (28%), population control through the COVID-19 vaccine (23%), children getting vaccinated without parental consent (5%), and comparison of other health issues with COVID-19 (2%). Textual analysis shows that the most frequently used words in the corpus were: nocovidvaccine (348); vaccine (264); covid (184); covid19 (157); and vaccines (128). These findings suggest that users adopted different terms and hashtags to express their beliefs regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Further, findings revealed that users used certain hashtags such as “echo” to encourage like-minded people to reinforce their existing beliefs on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and vaccine acceptance. These findings have implications for public health communication in attempts to correct false narratives on social media platforms.

In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in close collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments, began a 5-year initiative to establish population-based mother–baby linked longitudinal surveillance, the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this report is to describe an expanded surveillance approach that leverages and modernizes existing surveillance systems to address the impact of emerging health threats during pregnancy on pregnant women and their infants. METHODS: Mother–baby pairs are identified through prospective identification during pregnancy and/or identification of an infant with retrospective linking to maternal information. All data are obtained from existing data sources (e.g., electronic medical records, vital statistics, laboratory reports, and health department investigations and case reporting). RESULTS: Variables were selected for inclusion to address key surveillance questions proposed by CDC and health department subject matter experts. General variables include maternal demographics and health history, pregnancy and infant outcomes, maternal and infant laboratory results, and child health outcomes up to the second birthday. Exposure-specific modular variables are included for hepatitis C, syphilis, and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The system is structured into four relational datasets (maternal, pregnancy outcomes and birth, infant/child follow-up, and laboratory testing). DISCUSSION: SET-NET provides a population-based mother–baby linked longitudinal surveillance approach and has already demonstrated rapid adaptation to COVID-19. This innovative approach leverages existing data sources and rapidly collects data and informs clinical guidance and practice. These data can help to reduce exposure risk and adverse outcomes among pregnant women and their infants, direct public health action, and strengthen public health systems.","Woodworth, Kate R.; Reynolds, Megan R.; Burkel, Veronica; Gates, Cymone; Eckert, Valorie; McDermott, Catherine; Barton, Jerusha; Wilburn, Amanda; Halai, Umme-Aiman; Brown, Catherine M.; Bocour, Angelica; Longcore, Nicole; Orkis, Lauren; Lopez, Camille Delgado; Sizemore, Lindsey; Ellis, Esther M.; Schillie, Sarah; Gupta, Neil; Bowen, Virginia B.; Torrone, Elizabeth; Ellington, Sascha R.; Delaney, Augustina; Olson, Samantha M.; Roth, Nicole M.; Whitehill, Florence; Zambrano, Laura D.; Meaney-Delman, Dana; Fehrenbach, S.

Due to the difficulty of clinical decision-making during this period, our study group reviewed current literature focusing on the neurological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19. Despite the knowledge on this newly discovered virus which is constantly evolving, different pieces of evidence reported an association between COVID-19 and neurological symptoms like headache, dizziness, taste and smell disorders and complications involving the nervous system eventually triggered by the pathologic processes elicited by SARS-CoV-2. It seems that younger patients are less prone to develop severe forms of COVID-19. However, neurological signs have been reported in paediatric patients as well, and in some cases, the infection presented neurological sequelae. Furthermore, children with particular neurological diseases or treated with specific drugs (e.g. immune-suppressant therapies) must be carefully monitored during this pandemic. Neurologists should be aware of the main drug–drug interactions and the neurological side effects of COVID-19 treatments. Notably, adverse mental health impact has been reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2, which could be related either to the social strain or to the eventual neurotropic effects of the virus, which in other infections have been proven to promote the onset of psychiatric symptoms. Further, psychiatric population may be more vulnerable to the infection and at higher risk for adverse outcomes.","Orsini, Alessandro; Corsi, Martina; Santangelo, Andrea; Riva, Antonella; Peroni, Diego; Foiadelli, Thomas; Savasta, Salvatore; Striano, Pasquale",Neurol Sci,115,21

However, to meet the increasing demand for treatment of these pathogenic coronaviruses, accelerating novel antiviral drug development as much as possible has become a public concern. Target-based drug development may be a promising approach to achieve this goal. In this review, the relevant features of potential molecular targets in human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are highlighted, including the viral protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and methyltransferases. Additionally, recent advances in the development of antivirals based on these targets are summarized. This review is expected to provide new insights and potential strategies for the development of novel antiviral drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Xiao-huan; Zhang, Xiao; Lu, Zhen-hua; Zhu, You Shuang; Wang, Tao",Biomed Pharmacother,115,1

In this paper, for the first time, we show that tilting the Tx can be beneficial in VLP systems considering both line of sight (LoS) and non-line of sight transmission paths. With the Txs oriented towards the center of the receiving plane (i.e., the pointing center F), the received power level is maximized due to the LoS components on F. We also show that the proposed scheme offers a significant accuracy improvement of up to ~66% compared with a typical non-tilted Tx VLP at a dedicated location within a room using a low complex linear least square algorithm with polynomial regression. The effect of tilting the Tx on the lighting uniformity is also investigated and results proved that the uniformity achieved complies with the European Standard EN 12464-1. Furthermore, we show that the accuracy of VLP can be further enhanced with a minimum positioning error of 8 mm by changing the height of F.","Chaudhary, Neha; Younus, Othman Isam; Alves, Luis Nero; Ghassemlooy, Zabih; Zvanovec, Stanislav; Le-Minh, Hoa",Sensors (Basel),115,1

Several medicinal plants from the Himalayan region have been traditionally used to treat various human disorders. Thus, in our current study, we intended to explore the potential ability of Himalayan medicinal plant (HMP) bioactives against COVID-19 using computational investigations. METHODS: Molecular docking was performed against six crucial targets involved in the replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. About forty-two HMP bioactives were analyzed against these targets for their binding energy, molecular interactions, inhibition constant, and biological pathway enrichment analysis. Pharmacological properties and potential biological functions of HMP bioactives were predicted using the ADMETlab and PASS webserver respectively. RESULTS: Our current investigation has demonstrated that the bioactives of HMPs potentially act against COVID-19. Docking results showed that several HMP bioactives had a superior binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 essential targets like 3CL(pro), PLpro, RdRp, helicase, spike protein, and human ACE2. Based on the binding energies, several bioactives were selected and analyzed for pathway enrichment studies. We have found that selected HMP bioactives may have a role in regulating immune and apoptotic pathways. Furthermore, these selected HMP bioactives have shown lower toxicity with pleiotropic biological activities, including anti-viral activities in predicting activity spectra for substances. CONCLUSIONS: Current study results can explore the possibility of HMPs as therapeutic agents against COVID-19.","Natesh, Jagadish; Mondal, Priya; Kaur, Bhavjot; Abdul Salam, Abdul Ajees; Kasilingam, Srikaa; Meeran, Syed Musthapa",Comput Biol Med,115,20

Scarce and low-quality public health facilities are common problems in these communities. Costs and prevalence of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) have also been reported as high in studies conducted in slums in developing countries and those suffering from chronic conditions and the poorest households seem to be more vulnerable to financial hardship. The COVID-19 pandemic may be aggravating the economic impact on the extremely vulnerable population living in slums due to the long-term consequences of the disease. The objective of this review is to report the economic impact of seeking healthcare on slum-dwellers in terms of costs and CHE. We will compare the economic impact on slum-dwellers with other city residents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review adopts the framework suggested by Arksey and O’Malley. The review is part of the accountability and responsiveness of slum-dwellers (ARISE) research consortium, which aims to enhance accountability to improve the health and well-being of marginalised populations living in slums in India, Bangladesh, Sierra Leone and Kenya. Costs of accessing healthcare will be updated to 2020 prices using the inflation rates reported by the International Monetary Fund. Costs will be presented in International Dollars by using purchase power parity. The prevalence of CHE will also be reported. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for scoping reviews. We will disseminate our results alongside the events organised by the ARISE consortium and international conferences. The final manuscript will be submitted to an open-access international journal.

Using annual data over 2004–2020, we find that infectious‐disease outbreaks have no discernible effect on CDS spreads, after controlling for macroeconomic and institutional factors. However, a granular analysis using high‐frequency data indicates that the COVID‐19 pandemic has had a significant impact on CDS spreads. This adverse effect appears to be more pronounced in advanced economies, which may reflect the greater severity of the pandemic and depth of the economic crisis in these countries, at least during the initial stage of the outbreak, as well as underreporting in developing countries due to differences in testing availability and institutional capacity. While more stringent containment measures help lower sovereign CDS spreads, the fiscal burden of these efforts could undermine credit worthiness and eventually push the cost of borrowing higher.","Cevik, Serhan; Öztürkkal, Belma",International Finance,115,24

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, plus-stranded RNA virus with a single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 30,000 nucleotides. The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes 29 proteins, including 16 nonstructural, 4 structural and 9 accessory proteins. To date, over 1,228 experimental structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), including 16 protein structures, two functional domain structures of nucleocapsid (N) protein, and scores of complexes. Overall, they exhibit high similarity to SARS-CoV proteins. Here, we summarize the progress of structural and functional research on SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These studies provide structural and functional insights into proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and further elucidate the daedal relationship between different components at the atomic level in the viral life cycle, including attachment to the host cell, viral genome replication and transcription, genome packaging and assembly, and virus release.

Coding and non-coding RNAs frequently fold into complex conformations which, if effectively targeted, offer opportunities to therapeutically modulate numerous cellular processes, including those linked to undruggable protein targets. Despite the considerable skepticism as to whether RNAs can be targeted with small molecule therapeutics, overwhelming evidence suggests the challenges we are currently facing are not outside the realm of possibility. In this review, we highlight the most recent advances in molecular techniques that have sparked a revolution in understanding the RNA structure-to-function relationship. We bring attention to the application of these modern techniques to identify druggable RNA targets and to assess small molecule binding specificity. Finally, we discuss novel screening methodologies that support RNA drug discovery and present examples of therapeutically valuable RNA targets.","Sztuba-Solinska, Joanna; Chavez-Calvillo, Gabriela; Cline, Sabrina Elizabeth",Bioorg Med Chem,115,16

Current treatments are only supportive, and there are no treatments that reverse the pathophysiological effects of sepsis. Vitamin C has antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, anticoagulant and immune modulatory actions, so it is a rational treatment for sepsis. Here, we summarise data that support the use of megadose vitamin C as a treatment for sepsis and COVID‐19. Megadose intravenous sodium ascorbate (150 g per 40 kg over 7 h) dramatically improved the clinical state and cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic and renal function and decreased body temperature, in a clinically relevant ovine model of Gram‐negative bacteria‐induced sepsis. In a critically ill COVID‐19 patient, intravenous sodium ascorbate (60 g) restored arterial pressure, improved renal function and increased arterial blood oxygen levels.

However, relevant data are often scattered across different stakeholders and their use is regulated, e.g. by GDPR or HIPAA. As a concrete use-case, hospital Erasmus MC and health insurance company Achmea have data on individuals in the city of Rotterdam, which would in theory enable them to train a regression model in order to identify high-impact lifestyle factors for heart failure. However, privacy and confidentiality concerns make it unfeasible to exchange these data. METHODS: This article describes a solution where vertically-partitioned synthetic data of Achmea and of Erasmus MC are combined using Secure Multi-Party Computation. First, a secure inner join protocol takes place to securely determine the identifiers of the patients that are represented in both datasets. Then, a secure Lasso Regression model is trained on the securely combined data. The involved parties thus obtain the prediction model but no further information on the input data of the other parties. RESULTS: We implement our secure solution and describe its performance and scalability: we can train a prediction model on two datasets with 5000 records each and a total of 30 features in less than one hour, with a minimal difference from the results of standard (non-secure) methods. CONCLUSIONS: This article shows that it is possible to combine datasets and train a Lasso regression model on this combination in a secure way. Such a solution thus further expands the potential of privacy-preserving data analysis in the medical domain.","van Egmond, Marie Beth; Spini, Gabriele; van der Galien, Onno; IJpma, Arne; Veugen, Thijs; Kraaij, Wessel; Sangers, Alex; Rooijakkers, Thomas; Langenkamp, Peter; Kamphorst, Bart; van de L’Isle, Natasja; Kooij-Janic, Milena",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,115,33

(SB) is a common heat-clearing medicine in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It has been used for thousands of years in China and its neighboring countries. Clinically, it is mostly used to treat diseases such as cold and cough. SB has different harvesting periods and processed products for different clinical symptoms. Botanical researches proved that SB included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (1st, 2020) was consistent with the medicinal SB described in ancient books. Modern phytochemical analysis had found that SB contains hundreds of active ingredients, of which flavonoids are its major components. These chemical components are the material basis for SB to exert pharmacological effects. Pharmacological studies had shown that SB has a wide range of pharmacological activities such as antiinflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer, liver protection, etc. The active ingredients of SB were mostly distributed in liver and kidney, and couldn't be absorbed into brain via oral absorption. SB’s toxicity was mostly manifested in liver fibrosis and allergic reactions, mainly caused by baicalin. The non-medicinal application prospects of SB were broad, such as antibacterial plastics, UV-resistant silk, animal feed, etc. In response to the Coronavirus Disease In 2019 (COVID-19), based on the network pharmacology research, SB’s active ingredients may have potential therapeutic effects, such as baicalin and baicalein. Therefore, the exact therapeutic effects are still need to be determined in clinical trials.

Lung injury/fibrosis was evaluated by observation of hydroxyproline concentrations, lung indexes, and histopathology on days 7, 14, and 30 postinoculation. RESULTS: H5N1-inoculated mice presented two stages of pulmonary disease over a 30-d period after infection. At acute stage, infected-mice showed typical diffuse pneumonia with inflammatory cellular infiltration, alveolar and interstitial edema and hemorrhage on day 7 postinoculation. At restoration stage, most infected-mice developed PF of different severities on day 30 postinoculation, and 18% of the survived mice underwent severe interstitial and intra-alveolar fibrosis with thickened alveolar walls, collapsed alveoli and large fibrotic areas.

Thus, it is unclear whether these findings translate to older individuals and with longer administration periods. OBJECTIVE: Extending previous work, this study investigated the safety and tolerability of chronic intranasal OT in generally healthy older men. METHODS: Data were from a randomized, placebo (P)-controlled, double-blind clinical trial evaluating the effects of 4 weeks of self-administered intranasal OT (24 IU twice daily) in older adults with no major physical or cognitive impairments. Heart rate, blood pressure, urine osmolality, and serum metabolic biomarkers were obtained before and at the end of the intervention. AEs were collected during the first 3 weeks and 1 week after cessation of treatment. RESULTS: Of 103 participants recruited, 95 were randomized and received the intervention (OT = 49, P = 46). OT had no significant impact on cardiovascular, urine, or serum measures. The AEs reported for both treatments were generally mild and few in number, though one participant assigned to OT and two assigned to P dropped out due to AEs. Relative to P, OT did not significantly increase the likelihood of reporting AEs, nor the number or severity of AEs reported. CONCLUSION: Chronic intranasal OT appears safe and well-tolerated in generally healthy older men. These findings provide support for continued human research on potential benefits of chronic OT in older adult populations.

Then, it examines how manufacturing automation could affect industrialized developing economies based on the premise that manufacturers may accelerate production automation in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic. The model predicts declines in developing economies' manufacturing competitiveness and a heterogeneous pattern of recovery from the COVID‐19 recession. In comparison, developing economies with large manufacturing bases would recover relatively quickly, whereas those with weaker manufacturing bases would suffer from a long‐term decline and manufacturing contraction trends (undesirable deindustrialization). Manufacturing automation can enhance economic welfare, causing a contraction in the unproductive nontradable good (service) sector.

Calves on C MR treatments received 454 g of MR from d 2 to 41. Calves on A MR received 916 g of MR from d 2 to 8 and 1134 g of MR from d 9 to 41. Visitation with calves occurred at 1030 and 1430 h daily from d 1 to 56 and comprised verbal stimulation and stirring of starter grain. An opaque curtain divided the calf nursery, with calves in the front half assigned to visitation treatments and those in the rear half not assigned to visitation treatments. Calves were fed their MR treatment until d 43 (preweaning), after which all calves received half of their allotment of MR until d 49 (weaning). Calves were tracked for the next week until d 56 (postweaning). Starter grain and MR intakes were measured daily along with weekly body weight and skeletal measurements. One half of the calves on each treatment had blood samples taken via jugular venipuncture on d 41 (preweaning), 43, 45, 47, 49, and 51 (postweaning) to evaluate blood glucose, urea, nonesterified fatty acids, and cortisol concentrations. During the preweaning and weaning phases, calves on A0 and A1 treatments consumed more MR, less starter, and weighed more than the C0 and C1 calves. Calves on A0 and A1 had greater average daily gain (ADG), hip and withers gain, were taller at the hip, and had larger girths during the preweaning phase. Overall, body weight, withers and hip heights, and heart girths were greater in A0 andA1 calves during the weaning week. Efficiency of utilization of estimated metabolizable energy (ME) intake (ADG/ME) were similar. Glucose and nonesterified fatty acids concentrations were greater in visited calves preweaning. An interaction for glucose was observed during weaning, with A1 calves having the highest concentration and A0 calves having the lowest concentrations during weaning. Cortisol tended to be higher in visited calves during weaning. Postweaning, calves formerly fed A0 and A1 treatments had lower blood glucose and tended to have higher urea and cortisol concentrations than C0 and C1 treatments. The higher plane of nutrition fed calves tended to have higher cortisol concentrations indicating that they experienced more stress due to the removal of MR more than calves fed conventionally. Calves fed the higher plane of MR nutrition consumed more dry matter, ME, and water weighed more, had a greater ADG, and were taller than calves fed the conventional MR. These calves were more efficient (ADG/dry matter intake) when expressed on a dry matter basis, but had similar efficiency when expressed on an ME basis (ADG/ME). Visiting calves did little to reduce the stress of weaning when calves are fed the higher plane of nutrition MR feeding regimen.","Guindon, N.E.; Antaya, N.T.; Cabral, R.G.; Whitehouse, N.L.; Earleywine, T.J.; Erickson, P.S.",J Dairy Sci,115,1

Driven by ongoing miniaturization in diverse areas including medical devices, precision equipment, communication devices, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and microsystems technology (MST), the demands for micro metallic products have increased tremendously. Such a trend requires development of advanced micromanufacturing technology of metallic materials for producing high-quality micro metallic products that possess excellent dimensional tolerances, required mechanical properties and improved surface quality. Micromanufacturing differs from conventional manufacturing technology in terms of materials, processes, tools, and machines and equipment, due to the miniaturization nature of the whole micromanufacturing system, which challenges the rapid development of micromanufacturing technology. Against such a background, the Special Issue “Micromanufacturing of Metallic Materials” was proposed to present the recent developments of micromanufacturing technologies of metallic materials. The papers collected in the Special Issue include research articles, literature review and technical notes, which have been highlighted in this editorial.","Zhao, Jingwei; Jiang, Zhengyi; Dobrzański, Leszek A.; Lee, Chong Soo; Yu, Fuxiao",Materials (Basel),115,16

A number with positive results. However, long-term effects of these interventions and their potentially wider influence on well-being and health have been less studied. This study aims to evaluate the long-term effects of a multicomponent intervention in elementary school children targeting individual behaviour as well as environment (Lekker Fit!). The primary outcomeis body mass index and the secondary outcomes are waist circumference, weight status, physical fitness, lifestyle, psychosocial health and academic performance. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a naturalistic effect evaluation with a retrospective, controlled design adolescents in secondary schools, from intervention and non-intervention elementary schools, will be compared on a wide set of outcome variables. Data will be collected by questionnaires and through anthropometric and fitness measurements by trained physical education teachers and research assistants. Baseline data consist of measurements from the adolescents at the age of 5 years old and are gathered from preventive youth healthcare records, from before the intervention took place. Multilevel regression models will be used and adjusted for baseline measurements and potential confounding variables on the individual and environmental level. Furthermore, propensity scores will be applied.

METHODS/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: The review included studies published in English, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. Records were identified through systematic literature searches in six databases. We summarized results narratively and through meta-analytic strategies. Only studies for the 1918 and 2009 pandemics were identified. Of 14 studies on the 2009 pandemic including data on both medical and social risk factors, after controlling for medical risk factors 8 demonstrated independent impact of SES. In the random effect analysis of 46 estimates from 35 studies we found a pooled mean odds ratio of 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2–1.7, p < 0.001), comparing the lowest to the highest SES, but with substantial effect heterogeneity across studies,–reflecting differences in outcome measures and definitions of case and control samples. Analyses by pandemic period (1918 or 2009) and by level of SES measure (individual or ecological) indicated no differences along these dimensions. Studies using healthy controls tended to document that low SES was associated with worse influenza outcome, and studies using infected controls find low SES associated with more severe outcomes. A few studies compared severe outcomes (ICU or death) to hospital admissions but these did not find significant SES associations in any direction. Studies with more unusual comparisons (e.g., pandemic vs seasonal influenza, seasonal influenza vs other patient groups) reported no or negative non-significant associations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We found that SES was significantly associated with pandemic influenza outcomes with people of lower SES having the highest disease burden in both 1918 and 2009. To prepare for future pandemics, we must consider social vulnerability. The protocol for this study has been registered in PROSPERO (ref. no 87922) and has been published Mamelund et al.

Infection by the virus can have diverse clinical manifestations with one of the most severe clinical manifestation being respiratory failure and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Clinical manifestations of acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to SARS-CoV-2 are also diverse with a lack of diagnostic tools to distinguish between primary viral infection and secondary bacterial infections. Methods Single center, retrospective case-control study of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cell counts, flow cytometry and culture results from mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Results Neutrophils were the predominant cell type in bronchoalveolar fluid samples up to two weeks into mechanical ventilation. There also was a strong correlation between positive respiratory cultures and significant elevation in bronchoalveolar fluid neutrophil counts/percentages and serum c-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Absolute levels of T cell subtypes correlated with reduced lung compliance measurements. Conclusion Patients with SARS-CoV-2 and severe respiratory disease are at risk for secondary infections. In some COVID-19 patients, serum CRP and bronchoalveolar fluid neutrophils may be correlated with a secondary infection.","Holliday, Zachary M.; Alnijoumi, Mohammed M.; Reed, Mark A.; Earhart, Alexander P.; Schrum, Adam G.; Allen, Lee-Ann H.; Krvavac, Armin",New Microbes New Infect,115,18

Adipose tissue exerts anatomic and physiologic effects with significant implications for critical illness. Changes in respiratory mechanics cause expiratory flow limitation, atelectasis, and ventilation/perfusion mismatch with resultant hypoxemia. Altered work of breathing and obesity hypoventilation syndrome may cause hypercapnia. Challenging mask ventilation and peri-intubation hypoxemia may complicate intubation. Patients with obesity are at increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome and should receive lung-protective ventilation based on predicted body weight. Increased positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), coupled with appropriate patient positioning, may overcome the alveolar decruitment and intrinsic PEEP caused by elevated baseline pleural pressure, though evidence is insufficient regarding the impact of high PEEP strategies on outcomes. Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be safely performed in patients with obesity. Fluid management should account for increased prevalence of chronic heart and kidney disease, expanded blood volume, and elevated acute kidney injury risk. Medication pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics may be altered by hydrophobic drug distribution to adipose depots and comorbid liver or kidney disease. Obesity is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism and infection; appropriate dosing of prophylactic anti-coagulation and early removal of indwelling catheters may decrease these risks. Obesity is associated with improved critical illness survival in some studies. It is unclear whether this reflects a protective effect or limitations inherent to observational research. Obesity is associated with increased risk of intubation and death in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ongoing molecular studies of adipose tissue may deepen understanding of how obesity impacts critical illness pathophysiology.","Anderson, Michaela R.; Shashaty, Michael G.S.",Chest,115,10

Self-care and self-compassion predicted nurses’ professional quality of life, whereas the practice environment and nursing stress were not predictors. Finally, professional quality of life showed a positive relationship with life satisfaction. Conclusions: The study presents a comprehensive structural equation model in which self-care and self-compassion are the best predictors of nurses’ professional quality of life.

Several different attempts including video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsies failed to reach a second or alternative diagnosis including an infectious, autoimmune or collagen-vascular condition. She responded to steroids but with poor tolerance to this treatment, which could not be tapered. After she was started on anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) therapy with infliximab, 200 mg at three-monthly intervals, she has been fine for well over a decade. CONCLUSIONS: In this patient with sarcoidosis who had a productive cough accompanied by fever, an extensive workup and prolonged follow-up, an alternative or second diagnosis could be ruled out; we therefore conclude that this highly unusual presentation is part of the clinical spectrum of sarcoidosis.","Al-Kailany, Wud; Timens, Wim; Venmans, Ben; de Jonge, Gonda; van der Werf, Tjip S.",J Med Case Rep,115,29

However, almost all of the reported viral RdRp inhibitors (either repurposed drugs or new antiviral agents) lack selectivity against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Herein, I discovered a new favipiravir derivative, (E)-N-(4-cyanobenzylidene)-6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (cyanorona-20), as the first potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor with very high selectivity (209- and 45-fold more potent than favipiravir and remdesivir, respectively). Based on the significant reduction in the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication/copies, strong computational cyanorona-20 ligand-RdRp protein interactions, and anti-RdRp activity of the parent favipiravir drug, SARS-CoV-2 inhibition is thought to be mediated through the coronaviral-2 RdRp inhibition. This promising selective anti-COVID-19 compound is also, to the best of our knowledge, the first bioactive derivative of favipiravir, the known antiinfluenza and antiviral drug. This new nucleoside analog was designed, synthesized, characterized, computationally studied (through pharmacokinetic calculations along with computational molecular modeling and prediction), and biologically evaluated for its anti-COVID-19 activities (through a validated in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay). The results of the biological assay showed that cyanorona-20 surprisingly exhibited very significant anti-COVID-19 activity (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC(50) = 0.45 μM), and, in addition, it could be also a very promising lead compound for the design of new anti-COVID-19 agents. Cyanorona-20 is a new favipiravir derivative with promise for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Despite the fact that caretakers who work closely with animals recognize the value of euthanasia, ending an animal’s life remains a difficult task. On swine operations, veterinarians often do not perform day-to-day euthanasia but as animal health and well-being experts, veterinarians should be integral in euthanasia protocol development, training, and execution. Although the importance of euthanasia training is recognized, there is still opportunity within the swine industry to ensure all employees are properly trained. It is evident that there is also a need to provide additional training to veterinarians as integral components of the veterinary school curriculum and continuing education programming. Logistical factors are noted as challenges to proper and timely euthanasia and need to be addressed. Additionally, as the impact that euthanasia can have on caretaker and veterinarian mental well-being becomes more recognized in the livestock industries, it is crucial to incorporate strategies for coping with the moral stress of having to perform euthanasia into training protocols, as currently this is not broadly addressed. ABSTRACT: Euthanasia is a critical component in swine production and veterinarians play an important role in euthanasia protocol development and training. This study aimed to understand veterinarian involvement in and perspectives on euthanasia on pig farms. An online survey was disseminated both at a pig welfare conference and online via a veterinarian e-newsletter. Twenty-five veterinarians participated in the survey. The majority of respondents indicated that caretakers are the individuals making euthanasia decisions and performing the task (n = 17, 68% and 22, 88%, respectively). The majority (22, 88%) of respondents indicated that most of the facilities with which they work have a written euthanasia protocol, and 72% (18) indicated that they assisted in protocol development. Only half of respondents (13, 52%) agreed that “all employees performing euthanasia have been trained adequately”, and 80% (20) identified an interest in delivering more training. Less than half the respondents indicated that strategies for coping with “personal stress” and “emotional wellness” (12, 48%) were included in euthanasia training. While the moral stress of performing euthanasia is recognized, there is opportunity for addressing mental well-being in euthanasia resources. Although preliminary, this study supports the need for further euthanasia training on-farm, involving veterinarians in the process.","Edwards-Callaway, Lily N.; Cramer, Mary Caitlin; Roman-Muniz, I.

This report is the first analysis of a large trauma network describing the extent of these impacts. The objective of this study was to describe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient volumes, demographics, injury characteristics, and outcomes. METHODS: For this descriptive, multicenter study from a large, multistate hospital network, data were collected from the system-wide centralized trauma registry and retrospectively reviewed to retrieve patient information including volume, demographics, and outcomes. For comparison, patient data from January through May of 2020 and January through May of 2019 were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 12 395 trauma patients (56% men, 79% white, mean age 59 years) from 85 trauma centers were included. The first 5 months of 2020 revealed a substantial decrease in volume, which began in February and continued into June. Further analysis revealed an absolute decrease of 32.5% in patient volume in April 2020 compared with April 2019 (4997 from 7398; p<0.0001). Motor vehicle collisions decreased 49.7% (628 from 1249).

Early detection, diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer is an important means to improve the survival rate of lung cancer patients. The early signs of lung cancer are small pulmonary nodules, so early detection and timely treatment of pulmonary nodules are of great significance to save the lives of lung cancer patients. With the progress of medical CT technology, a large number of image data obtained by medical CT examination are increasing, which can provide more organ and tissue information, but also bring a great burden to doctors. Therefore, the detection technology of thoracic spectrum signal is a key point. The chest cavity is a non adjustable resonator with a fixed volume and space, which is located in the chest ribs and below the vocal cords. According to the principle of resonance in physical theory, the resonance characteristics are mainly related to the size of the cavity surrounded by a certain hardness of the outer wall. Therefore, some researchers believe that the volume of the chest cavity is related to the resonance of the chest cavity. Although in recent years, some teams have combined deep learning and machine learning to improve signal feature extraction, which makes signal feature extraction easier and more efficient, most of them are still based on IQ data for signal modulation recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the visual feature extraction model based on artificial intelligence and thoracic echo spectrum, and the experimental results show the effectiveness of this method compared with the latest approaches.","Niu, Haitao; Gu, Jihua",Int J Speech Technol,115,15

Compared with synthetic siRNA, esiRNA targeting HBsAg was less effective than the selected synthetic siRNA in terms of the inhibition of HBV gene expression and replication. However, while the ability of synthetic siRNAs for specific gene silencing was impaired strongly by the nucleotide substitutions within the target sequences. The efficiency of gene silencing by esiRNAs was not influenced by sequence variation. The transfection of esiRNA did not induce interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like STAT1 and ISG15, indicating the absence of off-target effects. In general, esiRNAs strongly inhibited HBV gene expression and replication and may have an advantage against HBV strains which are variable genetically.","Meng, Zhongji; Xu, Yang; Wu, Jun; Tian, Yongjun; Kemper, Thekla; Bleekmann, Barbara; Roggendorf, Micheal; Yang, Dongliang; Lu, Mengji",J Virol Methods,115,1

Fraud have been detected in European markets in the last decade, finding different substitute species sold as G. morhua or Atlantic cod on the label. In this study, we analyzed 252 samples of fresh and frozen cod fillets sold in Germany, the Netherlands, and France using DNA barcoding. Different trends were found in different countries: while the level of mislabeling found in Germany and the Netherlands remained at zero in the last years, a significant increase was found in the French markets comparing the current results with previous studies on fillets in France. On the one hand, this mislabeling proves the need to encourage European efforts to control seafood authenticity; on the other, zero mislabeling in two countries shows the success of current European regulations.","Feldmann, Frederik; Ardura, Alba; Blanco-Fernandez, Carmen; Garcia-Vazquez, Eva",Foods,115,1

Although some studies have suggested increased pulmonary angiogenesis, the presence of vascular proliferation in COVID-19 lungs has not been well characterised. Glomeruloid-like microscopic foci and/or coalescent vascular proliferations measuring up to 2 cm were present in the lung of 14 out of 16 autopsied patients. These lesions expressed CD31, CD34 and vascular endothelial cadherin. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β immunohistochemistry and dual immunostaining for CD34/smooth muscle actin demonstrated the presence of pericytes. These vascular alterations may contribute to the severe and refractory hypoxaemia that is common in patients with severe COVID-19.","Pérez-Mies, Belén; Gómez-Rojo, María; Carretero-Barrio, Irene; Bardi, Tommaso; Benito, Amparo; García-Cosío, Mónica; Caballero, Álvaro; de Pablo, Raul; Galán, Juan Carlos; Pestaña, David; Palacios, Jose",Thorax,115,20

Integrating soft hydrogel materials with micro/nanooptics could expand the horizons of photonics for bioengineering. Here, wet-spun multilayer hydrogel fibers are engineered through ionic-crosslinked natural polysaccharides that serve as multifunctional platforms. The resulting flexible hydrogel structure and reversible crosslinking provide tunable design properties such as adjustable refractive index and fusion splicing. Modulation of the optical readout via physical stimuli, including shape, compression, and multiple optical inputs/outputs is demonstrated. The unique permeability of the hydrogels is also combined with plasmonic nanoparticles for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in fiber-coupled biomedical swabs. A tricoaxial 3D printing nozzle is then employed for the continuous fabrication of living optical fibers. Light interaction with living cells enables the quantification and digitalization of complex biological phenomena such as 3D cancer progression and drug susceptibility. These fibers pave the way for advances in biomaterial-based photonics and biosensing platforms.","Guimarães, Carlos F; Ahmed, Rajib; Mataji-Kojouri, Amideddin; Soto, Fernando; Wang, Jie; Liu, Shiqin; Stoyanova, Tanya; Marques, Alexandra P; Reis, Rui L; Demirci, Utkan",Adv Mater,115,1

Most proposed DEA approaches focus on single-period portfolio performance assessment based on aggregated historical data. However, such an evaluation setting may result in the loss of valuable information in past individual time periods, and violate real-world portfolio managers’ and investors’ decision making, which generally involves multiple time periods. Furthermore, to our knowledge, all proposed DEA approaches treat the financial assets comprising a portfolio as a “black box”: thus there is no information about their individual performance. Moreover, ideal portfolio evaluation models should enable the target portfolio to compare with all possible portfolios, i.e., enabling full diversification of portfolios across all financial assets. Hence, this research aims at developing nested dynamic network DEA models, an additive model being nested within a slacks-based measure (SBM) DEA model, that explicitly utilizes the information in each individual time period to fully and simultaneously measure the multi-period efficiency of a portfolio and its comprised financial assets. The proposed nested dynamic network DEA models, referred to as NDN DEA models, are linear programs with conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constraints, and infinitely many decision making units (DMUs). In conducting the empirical study, this research applies the NDN DEA models to a real-world case study, in which Markov chain Monte Carlo Bayesian algorithms are used to obtain future performance forecasts in today's highly volatile investment environments.","Chang, Tsung-Sheng; Tone, Kaoru; Wu, Chen-Hui",Eur J Oper Res,115,2

Kessler psychological distress scale (K10) was used to evaluate stress symptoms. This study first conducted an online focus group discussion (OFGD) with the target population to develop the scale of “e-Learning crack-up” and “fear of academic year loss”. Afterward, a questionnaire was developed based on OFGD findings. An online survey was conducted amongst college students in Bangladesh using a purposive sampling technique. Results show that “e-Learning crack-up” perception has a significant positive impact on student’s psychological distress, and fear of academic year loss is the crucial factor that is responsible for psychological distress during COVID-19 lockdown. This study can provide an understanding of how “e-Learning crack-up” and “Fear of academic year loss” influence college students’ mental health. Theoretically, this study extends and validated the scope of Kessler's psychological distress scale with two new contexts. Practically, this study will help the government and policymakers identify the student's mental well-being and take more appropriate action to address these issues.","Hasan, Najmul; Bao, Yukun",Child Youth Serv Rev,115,28

This paper describes the change process and evaluates the impact on participants compared with previous live courses. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The 2019 live course contained 41 h of educational content, comprising 33 h of synchronous activities (lectures, interactive activities, videos) and 8 h of homework (contouring, dose planning). For the online course, the lectures were provided as pre-course material (11 mandatory, 22 optional). Contouring/dose planning homework was unchanged. The synchronous sessions were reconfigured as six 2-hour webinars (total educational content ~38 h). Participant numbers/characteristics, engagement and satisfaction for six live courses and the online course were compared. RESULTS: Participant numbers for the online and live courses were similar (90 vs. mean 96). There were more participants from outside Europe (28% vs. mean 18%) and more non-doctors (47% vs. mean 33%). Proportion of participants responding to the pre-course questionnaire was similar (77% vs. mean 78%) but post-course questionnaire response was lower (62% vs. mean 92%). 43% participants viewed ≥75% of mandatory lectures before the webinars. 86% viewed the optional lectures. Submissions of contouring and dose planning homework was higher (contouring 77%–90% vs. 56%–69%, dose planning 74%–89% vs. 29%–57%). 96% (47/49) participants rated the online course as Excellent (43%) or Good (53%). Overall satisfaction was similar (4.4 vs. mean 4.6). CONCLUSION: Participant satisfaction and engagement with the online course remained high despite less contact time with faculty.","Tan, L.T.; Tanderup, K.; Nappa, A.; Petric, P.; Jürgenliemk-Schulz, I.M.; Serban, M.; Swamidas, J.V.; Palmu, M.; Duke, S.L.; Mahantshetty, U.; Nesvacil, N.; Pötter, R.C.; Nout, R.A.",Clin Transl Radiat Oncol,115,1

Thus, this work considers a deep learning architecture that fuses the layers of current-state-of-the-art deep networks to produce a new structure-fused deep network. The advantages of our deep network fusion scheme are multifold, and ultimately afford an appealing COVID-19 automatic diagnosis that outbalances current deep learning methods. Indeed, evaluation on Computer Tomography (CT) and X-ray imagery considering a two-class (COVID-19/ non-COVID-19) and a four-class (COVID-19/ non-COVID-19/ Pneumonia bacterial / Pneumonia virus) classification problem, highlights the classification capabilities of our method attaining 99.3% and 100%, respectively.","Kechagias-Stamatis, O.; Aouf, N.; Koukos, J.",,115,26
