2996,2996,2996,Impact of influenza vaccine on childhood otitis media in Taiwan: A population-based study,17.860662,6.901433,2018-01-05,"PURPOSE: Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common infectious disease in children and usually accompanied by a preceding viral respiratory tract infection, especially in the preschool-age population. The study aimed to evaluate impact of influenza vaccine on childhood otitis media. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included data for 803,592 children (<10 years old) recorded in Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. AOM incidence and tympanostomy tube insertion incidence in each influenza season before and after the introduction of traditional injectable trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) were compared using the Poisson regression analysis to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In children < 2 years old, the age group eligible for free influenza vaccination, there was a significant reduction in seasonal AOM incidence after TIV introduction in 2004 (from 98.4 episodes/1000 person-seasons [95% CI: 96.4–100.5] to 66.1 episodes/1000 person-seasons [95% CI: 64–68.1]). In addition, with the increased vaccine coverage rate, the outpatient visits for AOM in the influenza season of 2005 and 2006 were significantly lower than that in 2004 (IRR = 0.85 and 0.80, respectively, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in primary care consultations for children <2 years old was observed after the introduction of the TIV in Taiwan in 2004. With the increased vaccine coverage, there was an additional decline in 2005 and 2006. In addition of the direct protection provided by the vaccination, we believe that TIV may have induced some herd immunity that further contributed to the reduction in influenza attack rates and the rates of associated AOM in that age group. These reductions were observed only in vaccine-eligible children, while older children, who were not enrolled in the influenza vaccination program during the study period, have experienced increases in the AOM incidence during the 2004–2006 period compared to the 2000–2003 period.","Wu, Pei-Wen; Huang, Chien-Chia; Chao, Wei-Chieh; Sun, Chi-Chin; Chiu, Cheng-Hsun; Lee, Ta-Jen",PLoS One,381,1

Some viruses subvert LN B cell activation; however, our knowledge of viral hindrance of B cell responses of important human pathogens is lacking. Here, we define mechanisms whereby chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted RNA virus that causes outbreaks of acute and chronic arthritis in humans, hinders dLN antiviral B cell responses. Infection of WT mice with pathogenic, but not acutely cleared CHIKV, induced MyD88-dependent recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils to the dLN. Blocking this influx improved lymphocyte accumulation, dLN organization, and CHIKV-specific B cell responses. Both inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (Nox2) contributed to impaired dLN organization and function. Infiltrating monocytes expressed iNOS through a local IRF5- and IFNAR1-dependent pathway that was partially TLR7-dependent. Together, our data suggest that pathogenic CHIKV triggers the influx and activation of monocytes and neutrophils in the dLN that impairs virus-specific B cell responses.","McCarthy, Mary K.; Reynoso, Glennys V.; Winkler, Emma S.; Mack, Matthias; Diamond, Michael S.; Hickman, Heather D.; Morrison, Thomas E.",PLoS Pathog,381,28

We report the case of a 24-year gravida 4 para 2 with singleton pregnancy admitted to obstetrical unit for fever up to 38°C during the 20th week of a so far uncomplicated pregnancy. Ultrasound examination and urine test was inconspicuous. Throat complaints were initially relieved during antibiotic therapy, but the patient developed dyspnea with progressing signs of cyanosis. Intubation was necessary on the fifth day because of decreasing oxygen saturation. Coincidentally, progressive pancytopenia and increased inflammatory activity was recorded. Echocardiography, blood cultures, and bronchial lavage brought no pathological findings, but CT revealed acute respiratory distress syndrome and hepatomegaly. Recent human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalic virus, herpes simplex virus, classical influenza and parainfluenza infections were excluded. An H1N1-infection was confirmed by PCR on the sixth day. The antiviral therapy was changed from zanamivir to oseltamivir. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was necessary due to insufficient oxygen saturation by mechanical ventilation. Until this time, pregnancy seemed to be unimpaired, but a sudden spontaneous expulsion of the fetus occurred on the seventh day (weight 460 g, no anomalies detectable). Curettage post abortem was not necessary. As a result of the antiviral therapy, H1N1-DNA was not detectable at day 16. Despite all endeavors, the respiratory situation could not be improved significantly; the patient additionally developed multiorgan failure during the time course and died on the 28th day of treatment. The recent case illustrates a very dangerous and imposing course of an H1N1-infection during pregnancy.","Bowkalow, Sandy; Brauer, Martin; Groß, Walter; Schleußner, Ekkehard",Arch Gynecol Obstet,381,22

Local invasive aspergillosis of the gastrointestinal system is quite rare. A 13-year-old female without immune deficiency presented with acute abdomen due to full-thickness necrosis of the gastric fundus. The necrotic gastric wall was excised and the stomach repaired. The pathology revealed a gastric ulcer with invading Aspergillus hyphae and spores. Aspergillosis is an opportunistic infection and its spores cannot survive in the normal gastric mucosa. The Aspergillus spores in this case probably grew on a background of gastric ulcer and caused wall necrosis and that the surgical treatment possibly provided a cure because it remained localized to the gastric wall.,"Karaman, Ibrahim; Karaman, Ayşe; Boduroğlu, Esin Cengiz; Erdoğan, Derya; Tanır, Gönül",Surg Today,381,19

Such building blocks have only rarely been employed for the design of enzyme inhibitors. Herein, we demonstrate the combination of a peptidic recognition sequence with such electrophilic (het)arenes to generate highly active inhibitors of disease-relevant proteases. We further elucidate an unexpected mode of action for the trypanosomal protease rhodesain using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, enzyme kinetics and various types of simulations. After hydrolysis of an ester function in the recognition sequence of a weakly active prodrug inhibitor, the liberated carboxylic acid represents a highly potent inhibitor of rhodesain (K(i) = 4.0 nM). The simulations indicate that, after the cleavage of the ester, the carboxylic acid leaves the active site and re-binds to the enzyme in an orientation that allows the formation of a very stable π-complex between the catalytic dyad (Cys-25/His-162) of rhodesain and the electrophilic aromatic moiety. The reversible inhibition mode results because the S(N)Ar reaction, which is found in an alkaline solvent containing a low molecular weight thiol, is hindered within the enzyme due to the presence of the positively charged imidazolium ring of His-162. Comparisons between measured and calculated NMR shifts support this interpretation.","Klein, Philipp; Johe, Patrick; Wagner, Annika; Jung, Sascha; Kühlborn, Jonas; Barthels, Fabian; Tenzer, Stefan; Distler, Ute; Waigel, Waldemar; Engels, Bernd; Hellmich, Ute A.; Opatz, Till; Schirmeister, Tanja",Molecules,381,26

This study assessed the effect of HT on sarcopenia in postmenopausal women. METHODS: The present study included 4,254 postmenopausal women who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys from 2008 to 2011. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by weight (ASM/Wt) and the prevalence of sarcopenia were analyzed in groups of women stratified by duration of HT use. RESULTS: ASM/Wt was higher and the prevalence of sarcopenia was lower in participants with a history of prolonged (≥13 mo) HT use than in participants with a shorter duration of HT use or no HT use. After adjusting for multiple confounding factors, prolonged use of HT remained significantly associated with estimated mean ASM/Wt and the prevalence of sarcopenia (odds ratio: 0.60; 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.88; P = 0.01). In addition, the prevalence of sarcopenia was linearly associated with history of hypertension, duration of hypertension, physical activity, and duration of HT use. Subgroup analysis showed that the association between duration of HT use and the prevalence of sarcopenia was maintained in younger (<65 y old) and leaner (body mass index <25 kg/m(2)) postmenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the prolonged use of HT was associated with high muscle mass and a low prevalence of sarcopenia in postmenopausal women.","Kim, Sung-Woo; Kim, Rebecca",Menopause,381,1

This quality improvement (QI) project aimed to reduce appointment lengths and improve the patient experience. METHODS: PediPlace introduced 3 interventions: improved patient tracking to measure timing on the electronic health record interface, elimination of script repetition between medical assistants and providers, and patient art kits. RESULTS: From over 2,000 surveys indicated that patients were more satisfied; the percentage of negative survey comments decreased from 20% in 2017 and 2018 to under 10% in 2019. The overall rating of the clinic rose from 3.8 to 4.75 (on a scale of 1–5) after QI interventions as well. The number of patients not checked out declined from 49 errors in October–December 2018 to 25 errors in January–March 2019, indicating that this part of the initiative was initially successful. However, subsequent months experienced higher error rates. Analysis of over 20,000 appointments from June 2018 to July 2019 showed that appointment length did not change after interventions. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in appointment lengths between Hispanic/Latino patients and other patients, and an encouraging finding that suggests PediPlace providers are effective bilingual communicators. Furthermore, anecdotal evidence indicated that the art kits were positively received. The interventions appeared to improve the patient experience but did not impact appointment length.

Patient volumes continue to increase, leading to worsening wait times and left-without-being-seen (LWBS) rates. In 2015, the ED’s median door-to-provider time was 49 minutes [interquartile range (IQR) = 26–90], with a 3.2% LWBS rate. ED leadership, staff, and providers aimed to improve patient flow with specific goals to (1) decrease door-to-provider times to a median of <30 minutes and (2) decrease annual LWBS rate to <1%. METHODS: An inter-professional team utilized quality improvement and Lean methodology to study, redesign, and implement significant changes to ED front-end processes. Key process elements included (1) new Flow Nurse/EMT roles, (2) elimination of traditional registration and triage processes, (3) immediate “quick registration” and nurse assessment upon walk-in, (4) direct-bedding of patients, and (5) a novel “Intake” system staffed by a pediatric emergency medicine physician. RESULTS: In the 12 months following full implementation of the new front-end system, the median door-to-provider time decreased 49% to 25 minutes (IQR = 13–50), and the LWBS rate decreased from 3.2% to 1.4% (a 56% relative decrease). Additionally, the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes of arrival increased, overall ED length-of-stay decreased, patient satisfaction improved, and no worsening of the unexpected 72-hour return rate occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Using quality improvement and Lean methodology, an inter-professional team decreased door-to-provider times and LWBS rates in a large pediatric ED by redesigning its front-end processes and implementing a novel pediatric emergency medicine-led Intake system.","Carney, Kevin P.; Crespin, Ann; Woerly, Gray; Brethouwer, Nicholas; Baucum, Jeff; DiStefano, Michael C.",Pediatr Qual Saf,381,1

SVC-CI has been validated only with conventional transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the SVC long axis, on the basis of SVC diameter variations, but not in the SVC short axis or by SVC area variations. SVV was not previously tested in vascular surgery patients. Forty consecutive adult patients undergoing open major vascular surgical procedures received 266 intraoperative volume loading tests (VLTs), with 500 ml of gelatine over 10 min. The hSVC-CI was measured using a miniaturized transoesophageal echocardiography probe (hTEE). The SVV and cardiac index (CI) were measured using Vigileo-FloTrac technology. VLTs were considered ‘positive’ (≥ 11% increase in CI) or ‘negative’ (< 11% increase in CI). We compared SVV and hSVC-CI measurements in the SVC short axis to predict fluid responsiveness. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for hSVC-CI and SVV were not significantly different (P = 0.56), and both showed good predictivity at values of 0.92 (P < 0.001) and 0.89 (P < 0.001), respectively. The cutoff values for hSVC-CI and SVV were 37% (sensitivity 90%, specificity of 83%) and 15% (sensitivity 78%, specificity of 100%), respectively. Our study validated the value of the SVC-CI measured as area variations in the SVC short axis to predict fluid responsiveness in anesthetized patients.

The government implemented a national tollfree telephone line (1-1-7) for public reporting of illness and deaths to improve the detection of Ebola cases. Reporting of deaths declined substantially after the epidemic ended. To inform routine mortality surveillance, we aimed to describe the trends in deaths reported to the 1-1-7 system and to quantify people’s motivations to continue reporting deaths after the epidemic. METHODS: First, we described the monthly trends in the number of deaths reported to the 1-1-7 system between September 2014 and September 2019. Second, we conducted a telephone survey in April 2017 with a national sample of individuals who reported a death to the 1-1-7 system between December 2016 and April 2017. We described the reported deaths and used ordered logistic regression modeling to examine the potential drivers of reporting motivations. FINDINGS: Analysis of the number of deaths reported to the 1-1-7 system showed that 12% of the expected deaths were captured in 2017 compared to approximately 34% in 2016 and over 100% in 2015. We interviewed 1,291 death reporters in the survey. Family members reported 56% of the deaths. Nearly every respondent (94%) expressed that they wanted the 1-1-7 system to continue. The most common motivation to report was to obey the government’s mandate (82%). Respondents felt more motivated to report if the decedent exhibited Ebola-like symptoms (adjusted odds ratio 2.3; 95% confidence interval 1.8–2.9). CONCLUSIONS: Motivation to report deaths that resembled Ebola in the post-outbreak setting may have been influenced by knowledge and experiences from the prolonged epidemic. Transitioning the system to a routine mortality surveillance tool may require a robust social mobilization component to match the high reporting levels during the epidemic, which exceeded more than 100% of expected deaths in 2015.","Jalloh, Mohamed F.; Kaiser, Reinhard; Diop, Mariam; Jambai, Amara; Redd, John T.; Bunnell, Rebecca E.; Castle, Evelyn; Alpren, Charles; Hersey, Sara; Ekström, Anna Mia; Nordenstedt, Helena",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,381,1

In ovarian cancer, oncobiosis was identified in numerous compartments, including the tumor tissue itself, the upper and lower female genital tract, serum, peritoneum, and the intestines. Colonization was linked to Gram-negative bacteria with high inflammatory potential. Local inflammation probably participates in the initiation and continuation of carcinogenesis. Furthermore, local bacterial colonies in the peritoneum may facilitate metastasis formation in ovarian cancer. Vaginal infections (e.g. Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis) increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Bacterial metabolites, produced by the healthy eubiome or the oncobiome, may exert autocrine, paracrine, and hormone-like effects, as was evidenced in breast cancer or pancreas adenocarcinoma. We discuss the possible involvement of lipopolysaccharides, lysophosphatides and tryptophan metabolites, as well as, short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids and polyamines in the carcinogenesis of ovarian cancer. We discuss the applicability of nutrients, antibiotics, and probiotics to harness the microbiome and support ovarian cancer therapy.

Although inactivated and/or attenuated vaccines have been developed and widely used around the world, there are still concerns with regard to their safety, efficacy, and costs. OBJECTIVE: As demand has grown for a new rabies vaccine, we have developed a new vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs) based rabies vaccine that replaces glycoproteins with rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein (GP), or so-called VSV/RABV-GP. METHODS: VSV/RABV-GP production was measured by sandwich ELISA. The generation of VSV/RABV-GP was evaluated with GP-specific antibodies and reduced transduction with GP-specific neutralizing antibodies. Virus entry was quantified by measuring the luciferase levels at 18-h post-transduction. BALB/c mice (three groups of six mice each) were intraperitoneally immunized with PBS, RABA, or VSV/RABV-GP at 0 and 14 days. At 28 days post-immunization serology was performed. Statistical significance was calculated using the Holm–Sidak multiple Student’s t test. RESULTS: Mice immunized with VSV/RABV-GP produced IgM and IgG antibodies, whereas IgM titers were significantly higher in mice immunized with VSV/RABV-GP compared to inactivated RABV. The secretion profiles of IgG1 and IgG2a production suggested that VSV/RAVB-GP induces the T helper cell type-2 immune bias. In addition, the average (±SD; n = 3) serum neutralization titers of the inactivated RABV and VSV/RABV-GP groups were 241 ± 40 and 103 ± 54 IU/mL, respectively CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that VSV/RABV-GP could be a new potential vaccination platform for RABV.","Park, Jung-Eun; Shin, Hyun-Jin",,381,13

TSPO’s primary amino acid sequence is only modestly conserved between diverse species, although its five transmembrane helical structure appears mainly conserved. Its cellular location and orientation in membranes have been reported to vary between species and tissues, with implications for potential diverse binding partners and function. Most TSPO functions relate to stress-induced changes in metabolism, but in many cases it is unclear how TSPO itself functions—whether as a receptor, a sensor, a transporter, or a translocator. Much evidence suggests that TSPO acts indirectly by association with various protein binding partners or with endogenous or exogenous ligands. In this review, we focus on proteins that have most commonly been invoked as TSPO binding partners. We suggest that TSPO was originally a bacterial receptor/stress sensor associated with porphyrin binding as its most ancestral function and that it later developed additional stress-related roles in eukaryotes as its ability to bind new partners evolved.","Hiser, Carrie; Montgomery, Beronda L.; Ferguson-Miller, Shelagh",J Bioenerg Biomembr,381,1

Vascular dysfunction is characterized by an imbalance in vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents which underlies the mechanism of vascular injury in DM. Additionally, diminished podocytes correlate with the severity of kidney injury. Podocyturia often precedes proteinuria in several kidney diseases, including diabetic kidney disease. Centella asiatica (CeA) is known as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant and has neuroprotective effects. This research aimed to investigate the potential effect of CeA to inhibit glomerular injury and vascular remodeling in DM. METHODS: The DM rat model was induced through intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin 60 mg/kg body weight (BW), and then rats were divided into 1-month DM (DM1, n = 5), 2-month DM (DM2, n = 5), early DM concurrent with CeA treatment for 2 months (DMC2, n = 5), and 1-month DM treated with CeA for 1-month (DM1C1, n = 5). The CeA (400 mg/kg BW) was given daily via oral gavage. The control group (Control, n = 5) was maintained for 2 months. Finally, rats were euthanized and kidneys were harvested to assess vascular remodeling using Sirius Red staining and the mRNA expression of superoxide dismutase, podocytes marker, ACE2, eNOS, and ppET-1 using RT-PCR. RESULTS: The DM groups demonstrated significant elevation of glucose level, glomerulosclerosis, and proteinuria. A significant reduction of SOD1 and SOD3 promotes the downregulation of nephrin and upregulation of TRPC6 mRNA expressions in rat glomerular kidney. Besides, this condition enhanced ppET-1 and inhibited eNOS and ACE2 mRNA expressions that lead to the development of vascular remodeling marked by an increase of wall thickness, and lumen wall area ratio (LWAR). Treatment of CeA, especially the DMC2 group, attenuated glomerular injury and showed the reversal of induced conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Centella asiatica treatment at the early stage of diabetes mellitus ameliorates glomerulosclerosis and vascular injury via increasing antioxidant enzymes.","Setyaningsih, Wiwit A.

Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is one of the major aetiological risk factors in glaucoma, and is currently the only modifiable risk factor. However, 30–40% of glaucoma patients do not present with elevated IOP and still proceed to lose vision. The pathophysiology of glaucoma is therefore not completely understood, and there is a need for the development of IOP-independent neuroprotective therapies to preserve vision. Neuroinflammation has been shown to play a key role in glaucoma and, specifically, the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key driver of inflammation, has recently been implicated. The NLRP3 inflammasome is expressed in the eye and its activation is reported in pre-clinical studies of glaucoma. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome results in IL-1β processing. This pro inflammatory cytokine is elevated in the blood of glaucoma patients and is believed to drive neurotoxic inflammation, resulting in axon degeneration and the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs).

METHODS: Literature searches were performed on databases using keywords involving gut microbiota and psychiatric disorders. Articles in English with human participants up until February 13, 2020, were reviewed. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for microbiota studies. RESULTS: Sixty-nine of 4231 identified studies met the inclusion criteria for extraction. In most studies, gut microbiota composition differed between individuals with psychiatric disorders and healthy controls; however, limited consistency was observed in the taxonomic profiles. At the genus level, the most replicated findings were higher abundance of Bifidobacterium and lower abundance of Roseburia and Faecalibacterium among patients with psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Gut bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids, such as Roseburia and Faecalibacterium, could be less abundant in patients with psychiatric disorders, whereas commensal genera, for example, Bifidobacterium, might be more abundant compared with healthy controls. However, most included studies were hampered by methodological shortcomings including small sample size, unclear diagnostics, failure to address confounding factors, and inadequate bioinformatic processing, which might contribute to inconsistent results. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to improve quality and comparability of future microbiota studies in psychiatry.","Chen, Long Long; Abbaspour, Afrouz; Mkoma, George F.; Bulik, Cynthia M.; Rück, Christian; Djurfeldt, Diana",Psychosom Med,381,27

Today the early diagnosis of breast cancer(BC) is yet a challenging problem in clinical practice, so the evidence that a well identified population of postmenopausal women, affected by MetS, presents a high risk, of breast cancer occurrence, is useful for breast cancer prevention. Our study aims to assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, diagnosed according to current guidelines, in postmenopausal women with breast cancer, and its role as an independent risk factor. RESULTS: MetS rate was significantly higher among women affected by BC:10.1%, 33 women, than CG:5.4%, 18 women, Chi-squared4.8,Odds ratio1.94,c.i.95%,p<0.02. Metabolic cardiomyopathy rate was significantly higher among women affected by BC:5.8%, 18 women, than CG:1.8%, 6 women, Chi-squared6.5,Odds ratio3.2,c.i.95%,p<0.01. Otherwise MetS rate without cardiomyopathy was higher among women affected by BC:4.8%, 15 women, than CG:3.4%, 11 women, but in a not statistically significant way, Chi-squared0.8,Odds ratio1.35,c.i.95%,p<0.36. CONCLUSION: There was a significant relationship, in our population, between MetS and BC, adding evidence to this controversial association, the relationship was even tighter, when restricted to women affected by metabolic cardiomyopathy; otherwise it, restricted to women affected by MetS, without metabolic cardiomyopathy, was not statistically significant. Since the prevalence of MetS is increasing worldwide, just like the incidence of BC, an intervention is needed to improve physical activity and weight reduction to decrease the MetS rate.","Maiello, Maria; Cecere, Annagrazia; Ciccone, Marco Matteo; Palmiero, Pasquale",Acta Biomed,381,2

Ecosystem service (ES) assessments record the aesthetic contributions of landscapes to peoples’ well-being in support of sustainable policy goals. However, the survey methods available to measure these contributions restrict modelling at large scales. As a result, most studies rely on environmental indicator models but these do not incorporate peoples’ actual use of the landscape. Now, social media has emerged as a rich new source of information to understand human-nature interactions while advances in deep learning have enabled large-scale analysis of the imagery uploaded to these platforms. In this study, we test the accuracy of Flickr and deep learning-based models of landscape quality using a crowdsourced survey in Great Britain. We find that this novel modelling approach generates a strong and comparable level of accuracy versus an indicator model and, in combination, captures additional aesthetic information. At the same time, social media provides a direct measure of individuals’ aesthetic enjoyment, a point of view inaccessible to indicator models, as well as a greater independence of the scale of measurement and insights into how peoples’ appreciation of the landscape changes over time. Our results show how social media and deep learning can support significant advances in modelling the aesthetic contributions of ecosystems for ES assessments.","Havinga, Ilan; Marcos, Diego; Bogaart, Patrick W.; Hein, Lars; Tuia, Devis",Sci Rep,381,1

The case study describes how the system regulates the current speed of a car according to a set criteria like the speed desired by the driver, the position of a possible preceding vehicle but also a given speed limit that the driver must not exceed. For that purpose, this controller reads different information form the available sensors (key state, desired speed, etc.) and takes the adequate actions by acting on the actuators of the car’s speed according to the read information. To formally model this system, we adopt a stepwise refinement approach with the Event-B method. We consider most features of the case study, all proof obligations have been discharged using the Rodin provers. Our model has been validated using ProB by applying the different provided scenarios.

METHODS: This was a retrospective and observational study of adult patients who were admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit between January 2014 and March 2018 and underwent tracheostomy. In this study, primary endpoints were incidence of SAE: cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, hypertension, hypotension, desaturation, bradypnea, or ventilatory distress. The secondary endpoint was procedure-induced complications. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients underwent tracheostomy during the study. Elective surgery of brain tumors (34.0%) and intracranial hemorrhage (20.5%) were the most common reasons for admission. The most common reasons for tracheostomy were difficult ventilator weaning or prolonged intubation (42.9%) and sedative reduction (23.7%). Tachycardia (30.1%) and hypertension (30.1%) were the most common SAE. Incidence of SAE was more common in conventional tracheostomy compared to PDT (67.1% vs. 42.3%, P = 0.002). The total duration of SAE (19.8 ± 23.0 min vs. 3.4 ± 5.3 min, P < 0.001) and procedural time (42.2 ± 21.8 min vs. 17.7 ± 9.2 min, P < 0.001) were longer in conventional tracheostomy compared to PDT. Multivariable adjustment revealed that only PDT by a neurointensivist significantly reduced the incidence of SAE by one third (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.187–0.691). In addition, PDT by a neurointensivist deceased the duration of SAE by 8.64 min (β: -8.64, 95% CI: − 15.070 – -2.205, P = 0.009) and prolonging the procedure time by every one minute significantly increased the duration of SAE by 6.38 min (β: 6.38, 95% CI: 0.166–0.470, P < 0.001). Procedure-induced complications were more common in conventional tracheostomy compared to PDT (23.5% vs. 11.3%, P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective and exploratory study of our single-center limited cohort of tracheostomy patients revealed that decreased SAE may be associated with short procedural time during the PDT procedure performed by a neurointensivist. It is proposed that PDT by a neurointensivist may be safe and feasible in neurocritically ill patients.","Kim, Yong Oh; Chung, Chi Ryang; Park, Chi-Min; Suh, Gee Young; Ryu, Jeong-Am",BMC Neurol,381,1

Live bacilli can be isolated by culture methods, but this is time-consuming. We developed a de novo TB diagnostic method that detects only live bacilli with high sensitivity within hours. METHODS: A prospective study was performed in Taiwan from 2017 to 2018. Sputum was collected consecutively from 1102 patients with suspected TB infection. The sputum was pretreated and heated at 46°C for 1 h to induce the secretion of MPT64 protein from live Mycobacterium tuberculosis. MPT64 was detected with our ultrasensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) coupled with thionicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (thio-NAD) cycling. We compared our data with those obtained using a culture test (MGIT), a smear test (Kinyoun staining), and a NAAT (Xpert). FINDINGS: The limit of detection for MPT64 in our culture-free ultrasensitive ELISA was 2.0 × 10(−19) moles/assay. When the criterion for a positive response was set as an absorbance value ≥17 mAbs, this value corresponded to ca. 330 CFU/mL in the culture method – almost the same high-detection sensitivity as the culture method. To confirm that MPT64 is secreted from only live bacilli, M. bovis BCG was killed using 8 μg/mL rifampicin and then heated. Following this procedure, our method detected no MPT64. Our rapid ultra-sensitive ELISA-based method required only 5 h to complete. Comparing the results of our method with those of culture tests for 944 specimens revealed a sensitivity of 86.9% (93/107, 95% CI: 79.0–92.7%) and a specificity of 92.0% (770/837, 95% CI: 89.9–93.7%). The performance data were not significantly different (McNemar's test, P = 0.887) from those of the Xpert tests. In addition, at a ≥1+ titer in the smear test, the positive predictive value of our culture-free ultrasensitive ELISA tests was in a good agreement with that of the culture tests. Furthermore, our culture-free ultrasensitive ELISA test had better validity for drug effectiveness examination than Xpert tests because our test detected only live bacilli. INTERPRETATION: Our culture-free ultrasensitive ELISA method detects only live TB bacilli with high sensitivity within hours, allowing for rapid diagnosis of TB and monitoring drug efficacy.

As European countries start easing lockdowns, discussions on recovery and investment plans pick up the pace, but it will be vital not to repeat mistakes of the past but focus on a healthy, green and just recovery to increase overall health preparedness and resilience in the face of future pandemics. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM: The recovery from the COVID-19 crisis is the litmus test how serious policy-makers are about the EGD, if they take it as the blueprint for rebuilding or continue investing into yesterday's polluting industries and economies. While at EU level there is a strong commitment for the EGD to be the principle in economic recovery, decisions and bailouts at national level do not necessarily follow suit (yet). One of the actions that are needed is defining conditions for all recovery and investment money being spent. RESULTS: With EU Commission President's van der Leyen's proposal for a 750 billion EUR recovery fund was presented end of May (1). The European Green Deal (EGD) proposal (2) shows that European Commission has understood the importance of a healthy planet for healthy people. If successfully implemented, this deal has the potential to achieve major health improvements in the near term while reducing the growing health risks from climate change (3,4), air and chemical pollution. LESSONS: Shifting from a polluting to a green and healthy economy, with the European Green Deal at the core is possible. The EGD already foresees a zero pollution ambition for the EU: preventing all pollution in order to protect health is the much needed goal upon which European and national leaders must base all recovery actions. KEY MESSAGES: A green recovery can give the necessary financial support for upgrading and modernising our cities and sustainable urban planning. Through the imminent recovery decisions, policy-makers need to seize the historic opportunity to reduce the pressure on the planet’s and people’s health.","Stauffer, A",Eur J Public Health,381,1

With more law schools introducing global clinical experiences into their curriculum, clinicians, students, clients, and practitioners are facing a host of new questions, challenges, and obstacles. These challenges are practical, logistical, ethical, and cultural. As research has found, finding a means of addressing these issues in ways that advance social justice has proven difficult. Striking a balance between client service and student learning, navigating relationships between different learning institutions, and setting ambitious but attainable goals are important elements of any clinic, but become increasingly vital for the success of a transnational clinical programme. Despite these obstacles and foundational questions, we argue that transnational clinical education presents benefits to all parties involved. This article assesses the methods, strengths, weaknesses, and outcomes of a collaboration between Cornell Law School’s Human Rights Clinic and National Law University (NLU), Delhi, that took place in 2017. This clinic focused on advocacy in favour of lifting bans on compensated surrogacy in both India and New York, culminating in two reports, an event at the United Nations, and testimony before the New York State Assembly. Twelve students from Cornell Law School and eight students from NLU, Delhi met weekly in a ‘global classroom’ equipped with video and chat functions to discuss the goals of the clinic, background readings, and their respective projects within the clinic. Eight students from Ithaca travelled to Delhi for eight days, conducting interviews and engaging in fact-finding with NLU, Delhi students. Together, students and clinicians from Cornell Law School and NLU, Delhi authored two reports, one focused on the U.S., and one focused on India, which were disseminated to each country’s governments.

Since a critical issue in overcoming a large‐scale pandemic involves finding effective treatments for the disease, there is typically urgent pressure on the health‐care sector to develop innovations to combat the pandemic. Recently, scholars have argued that repurposing – that is, reusing an existing innovation in a different context – allows for such rapid innovation responses and can reduce costs, as the groundwork has already been laid. In this paper, we compare these benefits with the considerable disadvantages associated with innovation repurposing, including lowered barriers to entry, which can lead to declining average quality and duplicate work. Using data on 2,456 COVID‐19‐related clinical trials initiated between December 2019 and July 2020, we find that merely one‐third of the trials actually investigated drugs or vaccines, whereas the rest focused on diagnostics and crisis management issues. In the trials concerning drug testing, we find that drug repurposing is a predominant innovation strategy, but many trials tested the same (combination of) drugs. This indicates an inefficient use of resources and reductions in the average variety and novelty of clinical trials. Furthermore, the small percentage of biopharmaceutical firms involved in the search for COVID‐19 treatments raises the question of whether firms may have insufficient incentives to redirect innovation efforts to respond to the pandemic. Our paper contributes to crisis management research, the nascent debate on COVID‐19, and the emerging literature on innovation repurposing.","Hanisch, Marvin; Rake, Bastian",,381,1

This provided a unique opportunity to isolate the effects from emission and meteorology on tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)). Comparing the atmospheric NO(2) in 2020 to 2017, we found the changes of emission have led to a -49.3 ± 23.5% reduction, which was ∼12% more than satellite observed reduction of -37.8 ± 16.3%. The discrepancy was mainly due to the changes of meteorology which have contributed to an 8.1 ± 14.2% increase of NO(2). We also revealed that the emission induced reduction of NO(2) has significantly negative correlations to human mobility, particularly that inside the city.

It is challenging to diagnose COVID-19 in patients presenting with only gastrointestinal symptoms, with early suspicion and visualisation of the lung bases on computerised tomography(CT) abdomen scans being helpful. METHODS: Single-centre retrospective analysis of abdominal/chest CT scans was conducted within a District General Hospital. From the 6000 CT scans between March and April 2020, 1557(26%) were abdominal, 230 of which had chest CT scans with COVID-19 positive changes. 49 patients with CT abdomen and a positive CT Chest were shortlisted. All recorded documentation was assessed using online clinical portal and tabulated using Microsoft Excel®. Subdivision into 3 groups was: 1) primary gastrointestinal symptom, normal CT abdomen, 2) common COVID-19 symptoms with gastrointestinal symptoms, normal CT abdomen 3) gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal pathology on radiology. RESULTS: COVID-19 related changes were seen on CT scans with no abdominal pathology noted in 33% (n = 16) patients with primary gastrointestinal symptoms. Further 18% (9 patients) presented with gastrointestinal symptoms alongside other common COVID-19 symptoms, however abdominal CT scan was normal. CT abdomen of these 25 patients were studied by a consultant radiologist, who examined the lung bases on the abdominal CT scan for COVID-19 related changes, which was seen in 92% patients. In 8% of the cases where the lung bases on the CT abdomen were normal, COVID-19 related changes were apparent on the CT chest. CONCLUSIONS: CT scans of the abdomen should be supplemented with CT scans of the chest, when appropriate, for early accurate diagnosis, early treatment and triage to the correct wards, especially at the height of the pandemic.","Niaz, Osamah; Uddin, Aaliya; Thomas, Sangeetha; Harries, Katherine; Walton, Sarah-Jane; Uddin, Aaliya",BJS Open,381,26

Additionally, exploration of the possible impact of the introduction of a hotline giving clinicians access to 24/7 Children’s and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) advice. METHODS: Identification of mental health presentations in children ≤ 16 years from coded admission data. Data collected included basic demographics, presenting complaint, final diagnosis, mental health Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) outcome and timings of review, referral and discharge. RESULTS: 141 cases were examined (2019 - n = 79, 2020 - n = 62). During the Covid-19 pandemic 18.9% (n = 10) scored high on the RAM and 64.2% (n = 34) scored moderate whilst in 2019, 17.2% (n = 11) scored high on the RAM and 69.4% (n = 38) scored moderate. 2019 data saw 25.3% (n = 20) discharged directly compared to 37.1% (n = 23) in 2020. In 2020, 26 (42.6%) of CAMHS reviews were via telephone compared to nine (12.3%) in 2019. Overnight (20:00-08:00), in 2019, there were 37 (46.8%) presentations, 86.5% (n = 32) of which required admission and in 2020 there were 36 (58.1%) where 75.0% (n = 27) required admission. CONCLUSION: A higher number of presentations was not seen in the CED despite the potentially adverse psychological effects caused by enforced isolation due to Covid-19. The provision of a 24/7 hotline may have contributed to clinician’s decision to discharge, aiding a higher number of out of hours discharges.","Groome, Rachel; Jain, Neha; Henderson, Sally; Green, Michelle; Hand, Catriona; Cuellar, Bianca; Groome, Rachel",BJS Open,381,16

In order to support them appropriately both now and, in the future, it is imperative that we understand the impact it has had upon them. This study assessed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students and interim foundation year doctors across the United Kingdom (UK), and the support that they received and sought. METHODS: A prospective, observational, multicentre study was conducted. All medical students and interim foundation year doctors were eligible to participate. The data analysis was carried out as detailed a priori in the protocol. FINDINGS: A total of 2075 individuals participated in the SPICE-19 survey from 33 medical schools. There was a significant (p < 0.0001) decrease in participants’ mood when comparing their mood before the pandemic to during the pandemic. Social distancing and more time at home/with family were the factors that negatively and positively respectively impacted the mood of the greatest number of participants. All areas of life included in the survey were found to have been significantly more negatively impacted than positively impacted (p < 0.0001). 931 participants wanted more support from their university. Participants were mainly seeking support with exam preparation, course material, and financial guidance. DISCUSSION: Medical and foundation schools need to prepare adequate and effective support. If no action is taken, there may be a knock-on effect on workforce planning and the health of our future workforce. When medical students return to their universities, there is likely to be need for enhanced wellbeing support, adaptations in the short-term and long-term strategies for medical education, and provision of financial guidance.","Bandyopadhyay, Soham; Georgiou, Ioannis; Baykeens, Bibire; Gillespie, Conor S; de Andres Crespo, Marta; Bashir, Mohammad Talha; Handa, Ashok; Saunders, Kate E A; Bandyopadhyay, Soham",BJS Open,381,14

The COVID-STAR qualitative study demonstrated a perceived negative impact of COVID-19 on numerous aspects of surgical training across all specialties and training grades. The aim of this study is to investigate how COVID-19 has affected operative case exposure and work-based assessments for surgeons in training. METHODS: Anonymized data has been sought from the Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme (ISCP) database for operations and work-based assessments in each specialty, involving surgical trainees on an approved training programme at defined Pre-COVID (16/03/19 – 11/05/19) and COVID (16/03/2020 – 11/05/20) timepoints. Primary outcome measures are the percentage (%) difference in WBA and operative activity between time points respectively. Differences in training activity between time periods will be tested using Pearson χ2 and Kruskal–Wallis tests for categorical and continuous variables respectively. RESULTS: This study has been approved by the ISCP Data Analysis, Audit and Research Group, and data will be managed in accordance with ISCP data governance. The hypothesis of this study is that COVID-19 has caused a reduction in the operative and WBA activity of trainees across all specialties. CONCLUSION: This study seeks to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on operative training activity and completion of WBAs in clinical practice. This information will inform major stakeholders involved in optimising surgical training in the COVID-19 recovery phase.","Clements, Joshua",BJS Open,381,16

Conversion of the majority of the hospital’s assets, including staff and infrastructure, to COVID care created a large reduction in resources for other clinical problems. The burn service was among those few essential disciplines that continued to receive acutely affected individuals during the crisis. The preservation of the burn center’s ability to continue its mission within the walls of a COVID hospital is the subject of this review. METHODS: All of the hospital’s ICU rooms, including all those on the burn unit, post anesthesia care units, some step-down units, and over 90% of the operating rooms (ORs) converted to COVID care ICUs. These vital actions by hospital administration enabled an increase in ICU beds from 114 to 270. Staff were redeployed to cover the massive influx of critical COVID patients. Burn inpatients during the transition were categorized by severity and age for disposition consideration. Of the 17 inpatients, 4 pediatric patients discharged home and 1 transferred to our associated children’s hospital; 7 adults discharged home, 2 transferred to our associated inpatient psychiatric hospital, 1 to inpatient rehab, and 2 transferred to a neighboring orthopedic hospital converted into an adult acute care hospital. The commitment to keep the burn center operational for both children and adults was facilitated by protecting the burn ICU hydrotherapy room, a large patient care space in the center of the burn ICU. Children, initially admitted and cared for in the hydrotherapy room until stable, transferred to our network Children’s hospital for continued care. Critical adult burns were admitted to the inpatient ICU with the COVID patients, acute burns were housed on the few remaining medical surgical units. Burn care was performed in the patients’ rooms to keep the hydrotherapy room “clean”. RESULTS: During the 3-month period described the burn service admitted and cared for 92 adult and 25 pediatric patients while maintaining a full ICU census. Although 3 admitted burn patients were COVID +, no burn patients housed in the ICU became COVID + during their stay. CONCLUSIONS: The commitment to protect the burn hydrotherapy space for burn triage and care from the top level of administration was critical and notable given the widespread conversion of the subspecialty ICUs and most other patient care areas to COVID care units. Strict adherence to infection prevention guidelines and protection of the hydrotherapy room allowed burn patients to receive timely and appropriate care during a pandemic.","Heffernan, Jamie; Gallagher, James",J Burn Care Res,381,16

The implementation of a Closed Loop Medication Administration solution aims to reduce medication administration errors and prevent patient harm. AIM: We conducted the first evaluation to assess the impact of a novel optical medication scanning device, MedEye, on the rate of medication administration errors in solid oral dosage forms. METHODS: We performed a before and after study on one ward at a tertiary-care teaching hospital that used a commercial electronic prescribing and medication administration system and was implementing MedEye (a bedside tool for stopping and preventing medication administration errors). Pre-MedEye data collection occurred between Aug-Nov 2019 and post-MedEye data collection occurred between Feb-Mar 2020. We conducted direct observations of nursing drug administration rounds before and after the MedEye implementation. Observers recorded what they observed being administered (e.g., drug name, form, strength and quantity) and compared this to what was prescribed. Errors were classified as either a ‘timing’ error, ‘omission’ error or ‘other’ error. We calculated the rate and type of medication administration errors (MAEs) before and after the MedEye implementation. A sample size calculation suggested that approximately 10,000 medication administrations were needed. Data collection was reduced due to the COVID 19 pandemic and implementation delays. RESULTS: Trained pharmacists or nurses observed a total of 1,069 administrations of solid oral dosage forms before and 432 after the MedEye intervention was implemented. The percentage of MAEs pre-MedEye (69.1%) and post-MedEye (69.9%) remained almost the same. Non-timing errors (combination of ‘omission’ + ‘other’ errors) reduced from 51 (4.77%) to 11 (2.55%), which had borderline significance (p=0.05) however after adjusting for confounders, significance was lost. We also saw a non-significant reduction in ‘other’ error types (e.g., dose and documentation errors) following the implementation of MedEye from 34 (3.2%) to 7 (1.62%). An observer witnessed a nurse dispense the wrong medication (prednisolone) instead of the intended medication (furosemide) in the post-MedEye period. After receiving a notification from MedEye that an unexpected medication had been dispensed, the nurse corrected the dose thus preventing an error. We also identified one instance where the nurse correctly dispensed a prescribed medication (amlodipine) but this was mistakenly identified by the MedEye scanner as another prescribed medication (metoclopramide). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evaluation of a novel optical medication scanning device, MedEye on the rate of MAEs in one of the largest NHS trusts in England. We found a non-statistically significant reduction in non-timing error rates. This was notable because incidents within this category e.g., dose errors, are more likely to be associated with harm compared to timing errors.(2) However, further research is needed to investigate the impact of MedEye on a larger sample size and range of medications.

The therapeutic effects of current clinical drugs are accompanied by side effects. In recent years, stem cell therapy has attracted the attention of researchers. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) have been widely used in various diseases due to their excellent paracrine function. TNF-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6), a secretion factor of stem cells, may play an important role in hucMSCs in the treatment of SCI. So we conducted an experiment to explore its effect. We first observed that the expression of TSG-6 increased in SCI rats after injected with hucMSCs. Then, we used siRNA to knowdown the expression of TSG-6. We treated SCI rats with TSG-6-knockdown hucMSCs. Without TSG-6 expression, hucMSCs treatment made the tissue recovery worse and the number of Nissl bodies less. Meanwhile, neutrophils infiltrated more in the damaged parts. Our research also proved that TSG-6 may help demyelination recovering and alleviate astrocytes gathering in the injury sites. Our study revealed that hucMSCs secreted TSG-6 may decrease the degeneration of myelin sheath, reduce inflammation, decrease neuron loss and promote tissue repair. These results provided a new therapeutic factor for the treatment of SCI.","Liao, Ziling; Wang, Wei; Deng, Weiyue; Zhang, Yuying; Song, Aishi; Deng, Sihao; Zhao, Huifang; Zhang, Shusheng; Li, Zhiyuan",ASN Neuro,381,1

RESULTS: 68% of patients were female. 98% of referrals mentioned weight loss, 94.5% of these patients had concurrent symptoms. 77.5% of patients had a positive finding. 5% (n = 5) had a diagnosis of malignancy. Of the 5 diagnosed with malignancy, none had presented with symptoms of weight loss alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our practice is in accordance with NICE guidelines. Despite perception, OGD for weight loss alone does not occur commonly. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is even more important to vet patients appropriately to prevent unnecessary aerosol generating procedures. We cannot extrapolate from this pilot study whether weight loss alone, is a good indicator for detecting upper GI malignancies, though all cases of malignancy had other specific alarm symptoms.","Pickard, C; Komolafe, S",Br J Surg,381,26

The prevalence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Catalonia among people over 60 years is 6.6%. Biological agents have not been associated with a higher incidence nor a worse prognosis of COVID-19. However, the role of immunosuppressants (IMS) on this issue is still to be elucidated. Moreover, there are scarce data related about COVID-19 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients under IMS, and none focusing in elderly IBD. Our aim was to describe and to compare the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in patients over 65 years of age with IBD, particularly in relation to the use of IMS. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study including IBD patients over 65 years since January 2020, from two referral centres in the Barcelona metropolitan area (Catalonia, Spain). Patients were grouped in two cohorts regarding the use or not of IMS (thiopurines or methotrexate). Patients on biological treatment were excluded. We identified those cases with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 (positive PCR) during the period from 1(st) of March 2020 (the beginning of the pandemic in Catalonia) to 1(st) March 2021 (the beginning of vaccination in the elderly). Demographic data, IBD comorbidities, concomitant non-IBD related treatments, and SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Four-hundred and eighteen elderly IBD patients were included. The median age was 74 years (IQR 69–78), 52% were male; 70% had ulcerative colitis, 28% Crohn’s disease and 2% IBD unclassified, 62% had arterial hypertension, 22% diabetes mellitus, 22% cardiovascular disease, 15% chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 10% chronic renal disease, 5% were active smokers. There were no differences regarding comorbidities and non-IBD treatments between the two study groups. From the whole cohort, 89 (21.3%) patients were on IMS (86 with thiopurines, 3 with methotrexate). The median time on IMS was 121 months (IQR 60–162). During the study period, 32 patients (7.7%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (7 of whom were on IST; 7.6% not on IMS vs. 7.9% on IMS, P=0.933). Seventeen (53%) patients required hospital admittance (4% not IMS vs. 4.5% on IMS; P=0.818); 4 of them developed COVID-19 related complications (3 patients not on IMS vs. 1 on IMS), and 7 (22%) patients died (6 not on IMS vs. 1 patient on IMS). CONCLUSION: The rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection among elderly IBD patients is quite similar to that reported in the elderly background population. In elderly IBD patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a high admission rate and mortality, regardless of the use of IMS.","Calafat Sard, M; González-Muñoza, C; Fortuny, M; Roig, C; Calm, A; Mombiela, A; Teller-Martin, M; Cañete, F; Bertoletti, F; González-González, L; Gordillo, J; Mañosa, M; Garcia-Planella, E; Domènech, E",J Crohns Colitis,381,1

The L test is more extensive than other performance tests, especially in turn direction and specific tasks. The study aimed to evaluate the test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and minimal detectable change of the L test in patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA). A cross-sectional study was conducted with 33 unilateral and primary THA patients. The L test was performed twice with an interval of an hour on the same day for the test-retest reliability. Timed up and go test (TUG), five times sit to stand test (FTST), and Harris hip score (HHS) were carried out for the analysis of the concurrent validity of the L test. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 74.6 ± 10.3 years. The ICC score of the L test was 0.992. Test-retest reliability was excellent. SEM(95) and MDC(95) values were 3.39 and 9.39, respectively. Both TUG and HHS were strongly correlated with the L test (r(1) = 0.889, r(2) = −0.568, p < 0.001). However, there was no significant correlation between FTST and L test (r = 0.024, p > 0.05).

This study was aimed at discovering vital hub genes and potential molecular pathways of DM through bioinformatics analysis, which contributes to identifying potential diagnostic or therapeutic biomarkers and targets. In this study, a total of 915 DEGs in DM samples including 167 upregulated genes and 748 downregulated genes were screened out by the limma package based on the GSE142807 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Furthermore, the results of Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these downregulated genes were highly associated with the immune-related biological processes and pathways. Therefore, 41 genes closely related to DM were extracted for further study based on the subcluster analysis through the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) software plugin in Cytoscape. Ultimately, 10 hub genes (including ISG15, DDX58, IFIT3, CXCL10, and STAT1) were identified as the potential candidate biomarkers and targets. Besides, we found that the identified hub genes directly or indirectly communicated with each other via molecular signaling pathways on the protein and transcription level. In general, under the guidance of bioinformatics analysis, 10 vital hub genes and molecular mechanisms in DM were identified and the expression of proinflammatory factors and interferon family proteins and genes showed high association with DM, which might help provide a theoretical foundation for the development of point-to-point targeted therapy in the future treatment of DM.","Ouyang, Xueren; Zeng, Yuning; Jiang, Xiaotao; Xu, Hua; Ning, Yile",Biomed Res Int,381,22

In North Central London (NCL) during the first wave of the pandemic, in response to the needs and demands for adults with COVID-19, general paediatric wards in acute hospitals and some paediatric emergency departments were closed. Paediatric mental health services in NCL mental health services were reconfigured. Here we describe process and lessons learnt from a collaboration between physical and mental health services to provide care for CYP presenting in mental health crisis. Two new ‘hubs’ were created to coordinate crisis presentations in the region and to link community mental health teams with emergency departments. All CYP requiring a paediatric admission in the first wave were diverted to Great Ormond Street Hospital, a specialist children’s hospital in NCL, and a new ward for CYP mental health crisis admissions was created. This brought together a multidisciplinary team of mental health and physical health professionals. The most common reason for admission to the ward was following a suicide attempt (n=17, 43%). Patients were of higher acute mental health complexity than usually admitted to the hospital, with some CYP needing an extended period of assessment. In this review, we describe the challenges and key lessons learnt for the development of this new ward setting that involved such factors as leadership, training and also new governance processes. We also report some personal perspectives from the professionals involved. Our review provides perspective and experience that can inform how CYP with mental health admissions can be managed in paediatric medical settings.","Gorny, Monika; Blackstock, Sarah; Bhaskaran, Arun; Layther, Imogen; Qoba, Mimoza; Vassar, Carly; Ellis, Jacob; Begent, Joanna; Forrester, John; Goldin, Jon; Hallet, Zoe; Read, Tina; Hodges, Sally; Groszmann, Michael; Hudson, Lee Duncan",BMJ Paediatr Open,381,26

The stress axis and production of stress hormones (corticosteroids) regulates ESD in fish, but evidence of a similar influence in reptiles is sparse and conflicting. The central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps) has a system of sex determination involving the interplay between sex chromosomes (ZZ/ZW female heterogamety) and the thermal environment. High egg incubation temperatures induce sex reversal of the ZZ genotype, feminizing chromosomally male individuals. Here we show that corticosterone elevation is not associated with sex reversal in the central bearded dragon, either during embryonic development or adulthood. We also demonstrate experimentally that sex determination is not affected by corticosterone injection into the yolk. This strongly suggests that stress axis upregulation by high temperature during incubation does not cause sex reversal in P. vitticeps. Our work is in general agreement with other research in reptiles, which suggests that the stress axis does not mediate sex in reptiles with ESD. Alternative biological systems may be responsible for capturing environmental conditions during reptile development, such as cellular calcium and redox regulation or the action of temperature-sensitive splicing factors.","Castelli, Meghan; Georges, Arthur; Holleley, Clare E","Journal of experimental zoology.

METHODS The Interventional Management of Stroke III trial randomized patients within 3 hours of acute ischemic stroke onset to intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator±EVT. GA use within 7 hours of stroke onset was recorded per protocol. Good outcome was defined as 90-day modified Rankin Scale ≤2. A multivariable analysis adjusting for dichotomized National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS; 8-19 versus ≥20), age, and time from onset to groin puncture was performed. RESULTS Four hundred thirty-four patients were randomized to EVT, 269 (62%) were treated under local anesthesia and 147 (33.9%) under GA; 18 (4%) were undetermined. The 2 groups were comparable except for median baseline NIHSS (16 local anesthesia versus 18 GA; P<0.0001). The GA group was less likely to achieve a good outcome (adjusted relative risk, 0.68; confidence interval, 0.52-0.90; P=0.0056) and had increased in-hospital mortality (adjusted relative risk, 2.84; confidence interval, 1.65-4.91; P=0.0002). Those with medically indicated GA had worse outcomes (adjusted relative risk, 0.49; confidence interval, 0.30-0.81; P=0.005) and increased mortality (relative risk, 3.93; confidence interval, 2.18-7.10; P<0.0001) with a trend for higher mortality with routine GA. There was no significant difference in the adjusted risks of subarachnoid hemorrhage (P=0.32) or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (P=0.37). CONCLUSIONS GA was associated with worse neurological outcomes and increased mortality in the EVT arm; this was primarily true among patients with medical indications for GA. Relative risk estimates, though not statistically significant, suggest reduced risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage under local anesthesia. Although the reasons for these associations are not clear, these data support the use of local anesthesia when possible during EVT. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

The present study was designed to determine the feasibility and safety of robotic VEG-DFT. METHODS After robotic PG, seromuscular flaps were extracorporeally created at the anterior wall of the remnant stomach through a small umbilical incision. Then, using a robot, the posterior wall of the esophagus was fixed to the cranial end of the mucosal window, and layer-to-layer sutures were placed between the anterior aspects of esophagus and the remnant stomach. Finally, the anastomosis was covered by seromuscular flaps. Short-term outcomes of 12 consecutive patients who underwent VEG-DFT between January 2014 and December 2015 were assessed. RESULTS Operations were successfully completed using robotic assistance in all patients. Median operative, surgeon console, and anastomosis times were 406 (324-613 min), 267 (214-483), and 104 (76-186) min, respectively, and median estimated blood loss was 31 (5-130) ml. The first six cases were required to reach a learning plateau. Both mortality and morbidity rates within 30 days after surgery were 0%. Postoperative hospital stay was 10 (9-30) days. No postoperative reflux esophagitis was observed, whereas anastomotic stenosis, which required endoscopic balloon dilation, developed in three patients (25%) in postoperative month 2. There was a significant association between the total number of stitches used for VEG-DFT and anastomotic stenosis (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Robotic assistance may be useful for VEG-DFT with a short learning curve. Attention is required to prevent postoperative anastomotic stenosis possibly caused by an excessive number of stitches for esophagogastrostomy.","Shibasaki, Susumu; Suda, Koichi; Nakauchi, Masaya; Kikuchi, Kenji; Kadoya, Shinichi; Ishida, Yoshinori; Inaba, Kazuki; Uyama, Ichiro",Surgical endoscopy,381,1

The aims of this study were to quantify flow restoration and the particle size distribution of the effluent pursuant to MET in an in vitro occlusion model. MATERIALS AND METHODS The model system was composed of 3 elements: an ICA/MCA replica, a clot model with mechanical properties similar to those of thrombi found in patients at risk of stroke, and a pulsatile flow loop. Different thrombectomy mechanisms including mechanical retrieval, aspiration, and waveguide induced cavitation were used. The efficacy end points were recanalization rate and amount of flow restoration. The risk of the embolic shower was assessed to evaluate device safety. RESULTS The recanalization rates were the following: Merci, 67%; Solitaire, 100%; Penumbra, 83%; Enterprise, 17%; and the waveguide, 0%. In experiments in which recanalization was achieved, the amount of flow restoration for the Merci, Solitaire, and Enterprise devices was 100%, 92%, and 86%, respectively. The mean sizes of generated small and large clot fragments were between 23 and 37 and 215 and 285 μm, respectively, depending on the device used. The Merci device generated the fewest number of large fragments compared with the Penumbra system (P < .05) and Solitaire (not significant). CONCLUSIONS The risk of embolic shower was influenced by the mechanism of action for the thrombectomy device. Clinically reported recanalization rates for the Solitaire, Penumbra, and Merci devices were nearly identical in this model system, suggesting that this model may provide a predictive tool for preclinical evaluation of MET.","Chueh, J Y; Wakhloo, A K; Gounis, M J",AJNR.

Herein, a novel cysteine-doped polyaniline@faujasite hybrid composite (Cys-PANi@FAU-50) was synthesized via a facile in-situ polymerization route for the effective detoxification of Cr(VI)-bearing wastewaters. The Cys-PANi@FAU-50 composite displayed an open mesoporous structure richly decorated with nitrogen/oxygen-containing functional groups, which consequently boosted the diffusion, adsorption and reduction of Cr(VI) oxyanions. The Cr(VI) adsorption behavior was satisfactorily tailored via pseudo-second-order law and Langmuir model with a maximum uptake capacity of 384.6 mg/g. Based on the advanced statistical physics theory, the monolayer model with two distinct receptor sites provided a reliable microscopic and macroscopic prediction of the Cr(VI) adsorption process. Stereographically, the Cr(VI) ions were adsorbed through horizontal multi-anchorage and vertical multi-molecular mechanisms on the amine and hydroxyl groups of Cys-PANi@FAU-50, respectively. The thermodynamic functions evidenced that the Cr(VI) adsorption was an endothermic spontaneous process. XPS analysis proved that Cr(VI) ions were electrostatically adsorbed, and subsequently reduced to Cr(III), which were in turn immobilized by chelation with imine/sulfonate groups and electrostatic interactions with carboxylate groups. The Cys-PANi@FAU-50 featured an effortless regenerability and good reusability. Overall, the Cys-PANi@FAU-50 composite owns outstanding potentiality for detoxifying Cr(VI)-laden effluents.","Laabd, Mohamed; Imgharn, Abdelaziz; Hsini, Abdelghani; Naciri, Yassine; Mobarak, Mohamed; Szunerits, Sabine; Boukherroub, Rabah; Albourine, Abdallah",Journal of hazardous materials,381,23

METHODS Sixteen patients (5 men and 11 women; mean age, 72.6 years) with 17 lung cancer lesions showing GGO (mean long axis diameter, 1.6 cm) underwent a total of 20 percutaneous computed tomography (CT) fluoroscopy-guided RFA sessions, including three repeated sessions for local progression. Lung cancer with GGO was defined as a histologically confirmed malignant pulmonary lesion with a GGO component accounting for >50 % of the lesion on high-resolution CT. Procedure outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS There were no major complications. Pneumothorax occurred in 15 of 20 treatment sessions: 14 were asymptomatic, and 1 required chest tube placement but resolved satisfactorily within 48 h. Minor pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in two and mild pneumonitis in one. The median tumor follow-up period was 61.5 (range 6.1-96.6) months. The effectiveness rates of the primary and secondary techniques were 100 and 100 % at 1 year, 93.3 and 100 % at 2 years, and 78.3 and 92.3 % at 3 years, respectively.

Interruptions in chest compressions are detrimental. We aimed to compare the effect of mouth-to-mouth ventilation (MMV), mouth-to-pocket mask ventilation (MPV) and bag-valve-mask ventilation (BMV) on the quality of CPR. MATERIALS AND METHODS Surf lifeguards in active service were included in the study. Each surf lifeguard was randomized to perform three sessions of single-rescuer CPR using each of the three ventilation techniques (MMV, MPV and BMV) separated by 5 min of rest. Data were obtained from a resuscitation manikin and video recordings. RESULTS A total of 60 surf lifeguards were included (67% male, 33% female, mean age 25 years). Interruptions in chest compressions were significantly reduced by MMV (8.9 ± 1.6 s) when compared to MPV (10.7 ± 3.0 s, P < 0.001) and BMV (12.5 ± 3.5s, P < 0.001). Significantly more effective ventilations (visible chest rise) were delivered using MMV (91%) when compared to MPV (79%, P < 0.001) and BMV (59%, P < 0.001). The inspiratory time was longer during MMV (0.7 ± 0.2 s) and MPV (0.7 ± 0.2s, P < 0.001 for both) compared to BMV (0.5 ± 0.2s). Tidal volumes were significantly lower using BMV (0.4 ± 0.2L) compared to MMV (0.6 ± 0.2L, P < 0.001) and MPV (0.6 ± 0.3 L, P < 0.001), whereas no differences were observed when comparing MMV and MPV. CONCLUSION MMV reduces interruptions in chest compressions and produces a higher proportion of effective ventilations during lifeguard CPR. This suggests that CPR quality is improved using MMV compared to MPV and BMV.","Adelborg, Kasper; Dalgas, Christian; Grove, Erik Lerkevang; Jørgensen, Carsten; Al-Mashhadi, Rozh Husain; Løfgren, Bo",Resuscitation,381,19

In recent years, regulatory bodies, such as the Therapeutic Good Administration in Australia, have provided information about an increasing number of drug shortages. It is reported that 90% of medicines in Australia are imported; this leaves Australia vulnerable to international drug shortages. It has been suggested that Australia is heavily reliant on the US as its primary source of medicines. OBJECTIVE(S) To determine whether there are significant trends in the quantity, frequency, and nature of drug shortages between the US and Australia in a pre-pandemic and pandemic climate. METHODS This study mapped and analyzed drug shortages reported by both the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in 2019 and 2020. RESULTS In 2019 (pre-COVID19), only 4% of US drug shortages were reported in Australia; this rose to 7% in 2020. Between 2019 and 2020, the number of US drug shortages increased by 37%, whilst the number of Australian drug shortages increased by 300%.

While this resource has benefits for wild bird populations, concern has been expressed regarding the potential for contamination of foodstuffs by mycotoxins, and the implications this might have for wildlife health. We investigated whether aflatoxin (AF) and ochratoxin A (OA) residues are present in foodstuffs sold for wild bird consumption at point of sale in Great Britain using high pressure liquid chromatography analyses. The hypothesis that production of these mycotoxins occurs in British climatic conditions, or under storage conditions after the point of sale, was tested under experimental conditions but was not proved by our study. While the majority of peanut samples were negative for AF residues, 10% (10/98) of samples at point of sale and 11% (13/119) of those across the storage and climate exposure treatment replicates contained AFB1 that exceeded the maximum permitted limit of 20 μg/kg.

In this research, we investigated the effect of social distancing duration on negative moods and memory. The relation between social distancing duration and both negative mood and memory errors followed the same U-shaped function: negative moods and memory errors initially decreased as social distancing duration increased, and then at approximately 30 days, they began to increase.

Although antibodies against this epitope fail to recognize fully mature West Nile virus (WNV) virions and accordingly neutralize infection poorly in vitro, their functional properties in vivo remain less well understood. Here, we show that while passive transfer of poorly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAb) and polyclonal antibodies against the DII-FL epitope protect against lethal WNV infection in wild-type mice, they fail to protect mice lacking activating Fcγ receptors (FcγR) and the complement opsonin C1q. Consistent with this, an aglycosyl chimeric mouse-human DII-FL MAb (E28) variant that lacks the ability to engage FcγR and C1q also did not protect against WNV infection in wild-type mice. Using a series of immunodeficient mice and antibody depletions of individual immune cell populations, we demonstrate that the nonneutralizing DII-FL MAb E28 does not require T, B, or NK cells, inflammatory monocytes, or neutrophils for protection. Rather, E28 treatment decreased viral load in the serum early in the course of infection, which resulted in blunted dissemination to the brain, an effect that required phagocytic cells, C1q, and FcγRIII (CD16). Overall, these studies enhance our understanding of the functional significance of immunodominant, poorly neutralizing antibodies in the polyclonal human anti-flavivirus response and highlight the limitations of current in vitro surrogate markers of protection, such as cell-based neutralization assays, which cannot account for the beneficial effects conferred by these antibodies.","Vogt, Matthew R; Dowd, Kimberly A; Engle, Michael; Tesh, Robert B; Johnson, Syd; Pierson, Theodore C; Diamond, Michael S",Journal of virology,381,10

The specific mental health implications of COVID-19 are still being uncovered, but we know that there are likely to be negative outcomes for many people. This is particularly the case for vulnerable members of the community, such as those with high health anxiety, and under conditions where individuals feel isolated or disconnected from others. The objective of this study was to examine whether the level of socially motivated Internet use acts as a buffer of the relationship between health anxiety, isolation behaviors, and depression. Participants (N = 473; 67.3 percent female; Mage = 23.03, SD = 7.50) from Australia completed self-report measures during the height of the national pandemic restrictions (April-May 2020). A regression analysis revealed positive relationships between health anxiety and isolation behaviors on depression and highlighted a three-way interaction effect. Specifically, health anxiety was significantly negatively associated with depression when participants engaged in fewer isolation behaviors. However, at higher levels of isolation behaviors, the relationship between health anxiety and depression was attenuated for participants with greater levels of online social connection. The findings suggest that online social connection buffered the negative effects of health anxiety under conditions of isolation. These results offer promising avenues to mitigate against vulnerabilities during the pandemic and highlight the need to promote alternate social support mechanisms in the absence of face-to-face connection.","Stuart, Jaimee; O'Donnell, Karlee; O'Donnell, Alex; Scott, Riley; Barber, Bonnie","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",381,1

We present the short-term functional outcome and patient satisfaction after laparoscopic and robotic VMR with biological mesh. METHODS We analyzed data from 123 patients who underwent laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVMR) or robotic ventral mesh rectopexy (RVMR) from August 2012 to January 2017. Included in these data were patient demographics, intra- and postoperative findings, Cleveland Clinic Constipation Score (CCCS), Obstructed Defecation Score Longo (ODS), Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score (CCIS), and patient satisfaction as measured by visual analog scale (0-10). RESULTS Improvements in CCCS, CCIS, and ODS were statistically significant at 6 and 12 months (p < 0.001). Patient satisfaction was excellent at 6 and 12 months (8.2/10 and 8.3/10, respectively). The overall complication rate was 14%, with a major complication rate of 2%. No mesh-related complications were observed. The need for surgical re-intervention because of relapse, symptom persistence or recurrence, or new symptoms was 3%. Outcome appears to be similar between LVMR and RVMR. CONCLUSIONS Both LVMR and RVMR with biological mesh are safe and effective in reducing symptoms, as measured by CCCS, CCIS, and ODS, and patient satisfaction is high.","Brunner, M; Roth, H; Günther, K; Grützmann, R; Matzel, K E",International journal of colorectal disease,381,16

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients treated with acute bailout stenting after failed MT in three large neurointerventional centers using exclusively the Acclino (Flex) Stent and the NeuroSpeed Balloon Catheter. Functional outcome was assessed by the rate of major early neurological recovery (mENR) at 24 hours and at 90 days with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Safety evaluation included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), mortality, and intervention-related serious adverse events (SAEs). RESULTS 50 patients with a median age of 71 years met the inclusion criteria and 52% (26/50) of the occluded vessels were located within the anterior circulation. mENR was observed in 38.8% and 90-day favorable outcome (mRS ≤2) was 40.6% (13/32). Higher NIH Stroke Scale scores on admission were significantly associated with poor functional outcome (mRS ≥3) at 90 days (adjusted OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.53; p=0.007). sICH occurred in two cases of the study population. There were no intervention-related SAEs. CONCLUSION Intracranial bailout stenting with the Acclino (Flex) Stent and the NeuroSpeed Balloon Catheter after failed MT is a feasible and effective recanalization method for atherosclerotic stenosis-based stroke that is associated especially with low rates of sICH.","Stracke, Christian Paul; Meyer, Lukas; Fiehler, Jens; Leischner, Hannes; Bester, Maxim; Buhk, Jan Hendrik; Thomalla, Goetz; Krause, Lars Udo; Lowens, Stephan; Rothaupt, Jan; Chapot, René; Hanning, Uta",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,381,1

CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 20-year-old man sustained a stab wound to the left temporal skull and presented with a retained knife blade. He reported a headache at presentation, but remained neurologically intact with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. Computed tomography imaging and subsequent angiography confirmed complete transection of the petrocavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery with effective tamponade by the knife blade in situ and satisfactory collateral flow across the Circle of Willis. Coil embolization of the left internal carotid artery was performed. Retrograde embolization of the petrocavernous internal carotid segment distal to the injury was performed via vertebral and posterior communicating artery access. Antegrade embolization of the internal carotid artery proximal to the injury was completed and the patient was transferred to the operating room for craniectomy and foreign body extraction. Postoperative computed tomography angiography revealed no parenchymal hemorrhage, mass effect, or midline shift, and successful embolization of the internal carotid artery. At 6-week follow-up, the patient remained neurologically intact with no infectious or vascular complications. CONCLUSION Staged endovascular and surgical therapy provides complete assessment and effective control of damaged vessels when retained intracranial foreign bodies are present. Given the high risk of vascular injury with retained transcranial foreign bodies, this strategy should be considered a safe approach for these challenging cases.","Kodadek, Lisa M; Leeper, W Robert; Caplan, Justin M; Molina, Camilo; Stevens, Kent A; Colby, Geoffrey P",Neurosurgery,381,19

The current novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has reduced face-to-face contact, and this has challenged how health professionals and clinical students can access training, accreditation and development. Online and other remote mechanisms are available to tutors and course designers; however, they might not feel comfortable with such affordances, in light of expectations to so rapidly change familiar teaching and delivery styles. This may result in the loss of interaction and disruption of peer learning, which are hallmarks of the small group tutorial. Collaborative learning is essential to develop and refine an emerging sense of belonging to a professional community through formal studies, and interactive learning is a requirement for some registered health professions to satisfy ongoing professional accreditation. Online media has been used to promote social learning in regional, rural and remote communities for some time. Strategies for learning activity design and tutor training are proposed to equip course designers and educators to support health professions education remotely, through the synchronous, online small group. This may herald a new era of increased access to training and professional development for non-urban learners, beyond COVID-19.","Seymour-Walsh, Amy E; Weber, Anthony; Bell, Andy",Rural and remote health,381,20

Evaluation of social and health risk factors of preschool children living along the Texas-Mexico border provides feedback to design health interventions. METHODS South Texas Early Prevention Study-PreK (STEPS-PreK) is a cluster randomized trial designed to assess the effect of the Bienestar coordinated school health program on children's health outcomes. Family characteristics, dietary intake, fitness, and anthropometric data were collected from 1277 preschool students enrolled in 28 preschools. RESULTS The response rate was 67%. Overall, 57% of families lived in poverty. The mean age of students was 4.7 years, 95% were Hispanic, and 51% were male. The average serving of fruits and vegetables per day were 1 and 1/3, respectively. Of these, students consumed 39.7% of fruits and 18.9% of vegetables. Obesity prevalence for boys was 19.2% and for girls 16.8%. Nearly one-half reported some form of food insecurity. CONCLUSIONS Children living in low-income areas are affected by high levels of social and health risk factors.

To describe the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and outcome of IA in children, retrospective review of the medical records of proven and probable IA between January 1986 and December 2000 was used. Twenty-four patients with IA were identified (10 proven and 14 probable) with a median age of 8.5 years. The incidence of IA was particularly high in acute myeloblastic leukaemia (5.35%) and leukaemia relapse (4%). Twenty-two patients presented with lung involvement. Broncho-alveolar lavage led to a diagnosis in 11 cases, but diagnosis was difficult and repeated invasive explorations were required. Antifungal therapy mainly consisted of amphotericin B. Eight patients underwent open-thorax surgery without any complication. Nine patients (37.5%) were cured of IA and three are still alive. The mortality was 87.5%. Three patients died of massive haemoptysis, including two before neutropenia recovery. Four patients presented with IA recurrence and three were cured again. Despite significant progress having been made in the treatment and diagnosis of IA, it is still a devastating complication in children with haematological disorders. New antifungal therapies and strategies are promising, but objective data are still lacking.","Crassard, Nicolas; Hadden, Hélène; Piens, Marie-Antoinette; Pondarré, Corinne; Hadden, Richard; Galambrun, Claire; Pracros, Jean-Pierre; Souillet, Gérard; Basset, Thierry; Berthier, Jean-Claude; Philippe, Noel; Bertrand, Yves",Mycoses,381,29

We compared direct VIC in 1109 consecutive bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and a well-validated CMV-QNAT (Basel-CMV-UL111a-77bp). In the retrospective group-1 (N=694) and group-2 (N=303), CMV-QNAT was performed within 48 hours from 2-fold and 10-fold concentrated total nucleic acid (TNA)-eluates, respectively. In group-3 (N=112), 2-fold and 10-fold concentrated TNA-eluates were prospectively analyzed in parallel to VIC. CMV was detected by VIC in 79/694 (11%) and 26/303 (9%) of group-1 and -2, but in 114/694 (16%) and 57/303 (17%) by CMV-QNAT, respectively. Median CMV-loads were significantly higher in VIC-positive than in VIC-negative BALF. The likelihood for CMV-detection by VIC was 85% for BALF CMV-loads >4 log10 copies/mL. In the prospective group-3, CMV was detected by VIC in 10/112 (9%), and in 14/112 (13%) and 20/112 (18%) by CMV-QNAT, when using 2-fold and 10-fold concentrated TNA-eluates, respectively. Notably, CMV was undetectable by CMV-QNAT in 10 VIC-positive cases of group-1 and -2, but in none of group-3. We conclude that CMV-QNAT can be adopted to BALF diagnostics but require several careful steps in validation. CMV-QNAT loads >10'000 copies/mL in BALF may indicate significant CMV replication as defined by VIC, if short shipment and processing procedures can be guaranteed. Discordance of detecting CMV in time-matched plasma samples emphasies the role of local CMV replication, for which histopathology remains the gold standard of proven CMV pneumonia.

In the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases, the main focus is on respiratory failure. However, available data suggest an important contribution of haemodynamic impairment in the course of this disease. SARS-CoV-2 may affect the circulatory system in various ways that are universal for septic conditions. Nonetheless, unique features of this pathogen, e.g. direct insult leading to myocarditis and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis dysregulation, must be taken into account. Although current recommendations on COVID-19 resemble previous septic shock guidelines, special attention to haemodynamic monitoring and treatment is necessary. Regarding treatment, one must take into account the potential profound hypovolaemia of severe COVID-19 patients. Pharmacological cardiovascular support should follow existing guidelines and practice.

However, the substantial gains achieved since entry into force of MLC in August 2013 appear to have been severely dented by the COVID-19 global pandemic. The aim of the study was to examine, on a pilot basis, the disruptions and challenges to the observance of seafarers' rights to shore leave, repatriation and medical assistance as an immediate consequence of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS The impact of COVID-19 on seafarers' rights was examined in three dimensions - shore leave, repatriation and medical assistance. Questionnaires were administered online from June to August 2020 to 450 seafarers, top 10 ship-management companies, 35 shipping companies and maritime administrations of top 5 seafarer supplying countries. The paper discusses the results of the survey. RESULTS The research revealed a previously unknown majority preference for shore leave, that diminished sharply during COVID-19. Impact on work-performance and well-being of seafarers was revealed with only a fifth of the seafarers having willingly agreed to an extension of contract. This study revealed incidence rates at 6 months into the pandemic of several parameters - delayed repatriations (21.44%) that includes crew with contract extensions (12.48%), crew with completed contract awaiting repatriation (8.96%) and crew that had exceeded 12-month continuous service (0.82%). Compensation, if provided, is meagre and was affecting ratings the most. Deprivation of medical assistance was also revealed. CONCLUSIONS The well being of seafarers would likely remain vulnerable to breaches, unless measures are put in place to safeguard the rights assured under MLC in the face of uncertainties caused by a pandemic such as COVID-19.","Hebbar, Anish Arvind; Mukesh, Nitin",International maritime health,381,1

METHODS The authors conducted an online survey of directors of medical curricula in Italy. Free-text responses to open-ended questions about curricular adaptations and reflections on these adaptations were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS Twenty out of 60 Italian medical school directors completed the survey. Strengths identified were rapid responses and a spirit of cooperation. Weaknesses included dependency on clinical facilities, teachers' limited skills to use technology, and lack of mental health support for staff. Opportunities highlighted were clear government rules, new ways of teaching and a renewed focus on underrepresented topics. Threats expressed included impaired relationships, difficulties related to online assessment, lack of IT access, and legal and insurance issues.

Parental emotional neglect is widely posited as an antecedent of anxiety disorder, with attachment researchers arguing for anxious-ambivalent attachment style as a mediating factor. METHOD Childhood experience of neglect and abuse, including antipathy (cold, critical parenting), attachment styles, and anxiety disorders were assessed in a high-risk sample of 160 adolescents and young adults by means of interview measures. RESULTS Antipathy was associated with 12-month prevalence of anxiety disorders in the sample. Anxious-ambivalent attachment scores statistically mediated the relationship between antipathy and anxiety disorders. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians treating anxiety disorders in youths need to consider that emotional neglect in childhood in the form of antipathy could lead to anxious-ambivalent internal working models operating around fear of rejection and fear of separation.","Schimmenti, Adriano; Bifulco, Antonia",Child and adolescent mental health,381,24

General drug development is expensive and can take more than 10 years to go through the designing, development, and necessary approval steps. However, established drugs have already overcome these steps and thus a potential candidate may be already available decreasing the risks and costs involved. Viruses invade cells, usually provoking biochemical changes, leading to tissue damage, alteration of normal physiological condition in organisms and can even result in death. Inside the cell, the virus finds the machinery necessary for its multiplication, as for instance the protein quality control system, which involves chaperones and Hsps (heat shock proteins) that, in addition to physiological functions, help in the stabilization of viral proteins. Recently, many inhibitors of Hsp90 have been developed as therapeutic strategies against diseases such as the Hsp90 inhibitors used in anticancer therapy. Several shreds of evidence indicate that these inhibitors can also be used as therapeutic strategies against viruses. Therefore, since a drug treatment for COVID-19 is urgently needed, this review aims to discuss the potential use of Hsp90 inhibitors in the treatment of this globally threatening disease.","Ramos, Carlos H I; Ayinde, Kehinde S",Current protein & peptide science,381,1

We also compare these two models to other PAH models commonly used in research. In the last few years, the focus of animal PAH models has moved towards studying the mechanism of angioproliferation of plexiform lesions, in which the role of increased pulmonary blood flow is considered as an important trigger in the development of severe pulmonary vascular remodeling. One of the most promising rodent models of increased pulmonary flow is the unilateral left pneumonectomy combined with a ""second hit"" of MCT or Sugen. The removal of the left lung leads to increased and turbulent pulmonary blood flow and vascular remodeling. Currently, there is no detailed procedure of the pneumonectomy surgery in rats. This article details a step-by-step protocol of the pneumonectomy surgical procedure and post-operative care in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Briefly, the animal is anesthetized and the chest is opened. Once the left pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, and bronchus are visualized, they are ligated and the left lung is removed. The chest then closed and the animal recovered. Blood is forced to circulate only on the right lung. This increased vascular pressure leads to a progressive remodeling and occlusion of small pulmonary arteries. The second hit of MCT or Sugen is used one week post-surgery to induce endothelial dysfunction. The combination of increased blood flow in the lung and endothelial dysfunction produces severe PAH. The primary limitation of this procedure is that it requires general surgical skills.","Katz, Michael G; Fargnoli, Anthony S; Gubara, Sarah M; Bisserier, Malik; Sassi, Yassine; Bridges, Charles R; Hajjar, Roger J; Hadri, Lahouaria",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,381,4

Cautery was applied to the ipsilateral pectoralis major muscle and ipsilateral temporalis muscle at bipolar, monopolar coagulation, and monopolar cut settings of 50 W. The intensity in each modality setting was increased by increments of 10 W to a maximum of 100 W. Integrity testing was performed before, during, and after each cautery setting. Voltage fluctuations were measured during cautery, and maximal voltage changes for each setting were noted. After explantation, devices were returned to the manufacturer for in-depth failure analysis to evaluate for any damage to the devices. SETTING Tertiary medical center. SUBJECTS Cadaveric study. METHODS Basic science laboratory. RESULTS No change in impedance or integrity testing occurred at any cautery setting when applied to either to pectoralis major or temporalis. The maximum voltage change was 22 V. Comprehensive device analysis showed no evidence of device damage from the study. CONCLUSIONS The cochlear implant devices had no evidence of electrical damage by monopolar cautery, even up to levels of 100 W in the temporalis muscle. The maximum voltage change was 22 V, likely resulting from protecting diodes within the implant. Additional study is necessary, but more flexible recommendations regarding electrosurgery in cochlear implant recipients should be considered.","Jeyakumar, Anita; Jackson, Neal M; Givens, Victoria B; Brickman, Todd M; Arriaga, Moisés A","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",381,16

[Nature 581, 396 (2020)]. This and similar molecules are considered to search for the new physics effects. The radium nucleus is of interest as it is octupole-deformed and has close levels of opposite parity. The preparation of such experiments can be simplified if there are reliable theoretical predictions. It is shown that the accurate prediction of the hyperfine structure of the RaF molecule requires to take into account the finite magnetization distribution inside the radium nucleus. For atoms, this effect is known as the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) effect. Its magnitude depends on the model of the nuclear magnetization distribution which is usually not well known. We show that it is possible to express the nuclear magnetization distribution contribution to the hyperfine structure constant in terms of one magnetization distribution dependent parameter: BW matrix element for 1s-state of the corresponding hydrogen-like ion. This parameter can be extracted from the accurate experimental and theoretical electronic structure data for an ion, atom, or molecule without the explicit treatment of any nuclear magnetization distribution model. This approach can be applied to predict the hyperfine structure of atoms and molecules and allows one to separate the nuclear and electronic correlation problems. It is employed to calculate the finite nuclear magnetization distribution contribution to the hyperfine structure of the 225Ra+ cation and 225RaF molecule. For the ground state of the 225RaF molecule, this contribution achieves 4%.","Skripnikov, Leonid V",The Journal of chemical physics,381,29

The current systematic review, therefore, identified 21 studies that assessed the relationship between sexual and gender minority status and weight among adolescents. Results indicated an overall greater prevalence of overweight and obesity among sexual and gender minority adolescents compared with cisgender, heterosexual youth. However, cisgender sexual minority males demonstrated lower or no added risk for overweight and obesity, whereas cisgender sexual minority females demonstrated greater risk for overweight and obesity. Findings were mixed among gender minority adolescents. This study highlights weight disparities in sexual and gender minority youth, although important subgroup differences exist.

Physical activity after transplant is the most modifiable nonpharmacological factor for improving cardiovascular outcomes. Few studies have tested walking interventions to enhance daily steps and health outcomes in older kidney recipients. METHODS Using a pilot feasibility randomized clinical trial design, we tested the feasibility and efficacy of a 6-month SystemCHANGE (Change Habits by Applying New Goals and Experience) + Activity Tracker intervention for recruitment, retention, daily steps, and health outcomes (blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, waist circumference, and physical function). The SystemCHANGE + Activity Tracker intervention taught participants to use a multicomponent intervention that connects person-centered systems solutions combined with visual feedback from a mobile activity tracker to achieve daily step goals. RESULTS Fifty-three participants (mean age 65 years, 66% male, and 57% white) participated with 27 in the intervention and 26 in the control group. The study protocol was feasible to deliver with high adherence to the protocol in both groups. The intervention group increased daily steps at 3 months (mean difference, 608; standard error = 283, P = .03) compared to the control group.

Compared with the control group, the nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) content of the bulk soil in the low PFOS (0.1 mg kg-1) treatment significantly decreased (27.7%), the ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) content significantly increased (8.7%), and the pH value and total organic carbon (TOC) content slightly increased (0.3% and 1.1%, respectively). Compared with the low PFOS treatment, the content of NO3-N, NH4+-N and pH value in the bulk soil of the high PFOS treatment (50 mg kg-1) significantly increased (1.0%, 53.8% and 61.8%, respectively), and the TOC content significantly decreased (8.2%). Soil protease levels were high in the low PFOS treatment, but low in the high PFOS treatment. PFOS produced inverted U-shaped responses in the potential nitrification (1.5, 3.0, and 1.1 mg N d-1 kg-1 in no, low, and high PFOS, respectively), denitrification (0.19, 0.30, and 0.22 mg N d-1 kg-1 in no, low, and high PFOS, respectively), and N2O emission rates (0.01, 0.03, and 0.02 mg N d-1 kg-1 in no, low, and high PFOS, respectively) of bulk soil. The abundance of the archaea amoA gene decreased with increasing PFOS concentration, whereas that of bacterial amoA increased; inverted U-shaped responses were observed for narG, nirK, nirS, and nosZ. In the PFOS-contaminated rhizosphere soil, the observed changes differed from those in the bulk soil and differed between treatments. P. communis tended to upregulate each step of the nitrogen cycle under low PFOS conditions, whereas L. salicaria tended to inhibit them. Under high PFOS conditions, both test plants tended to act as inhibitors of the soil N-cycle; thus, the effects of PFOS on soil N transformation were plant-specific.","Lu, Bianhe; Qian, Jin; Wang, Peifang; Wang, Chao; Hu, Jing; Li, Kun; He, Xixian; Jin, Wen",The Science of the total environment,381,16

METHODS J591(scFv) was expressed in HEK-293T cells and purified by metal ion affinity chromatography, followed by size exclusion chromatography. Stability and monomer/dimer ratios of purified scFv under different storage conditions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and analytical size exclusion chromatography. J591(scFv) was labelled with (Equation is included in full-text article.)at 37°C for 60 min. The stability of Tc-scFv in human serum was analysed by SDS-PAGE with autoradiography. Cell-binding studies were carried out using PC3LN3 (PSMA negative) and PC3LN3-PSMA (a variant engineered to express PSMA) cell lines. RESULTS J591(scFv) was most stable to dimerisation on storage at -80°C compared with -20 and 4°C. Radiochemical yields of 85-90% were obtained with the final radiochemical purity of more than 99% after purification by gel filtration. In these small-scale studies, the maximum specific activity achieved was 7 MBq/μg. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed the formation of Tc-J591(scFv), which was radiochemically stable in serum, with no dissociation of Tc over 24 h. Cell-binding assays showed specific binding to PSMA-positive cells. CONCLUSION J591(scFv) can be radiolabelled with (Equation is included in full-text article.)conveniently and efficiently. The labelled product was stable in serum. It showed selective binding to PSMA-positive cells compared with PSMA-negative cells.

Our objectives were to compare the diagnostic accuracy of virtual to in-person cognitive assessments and tests and barriers to virtual cognitive assessment implementation. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING MEDLINE, EMBASE, CDSR, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, and gray literature (inception to April 1, 2020). PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS Studies describing the accuracy or reliability of virtual compared with in-person cognitive assessments (i.e., reference standard) for diagnosing dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), identifying virtual cognitive test cutoffs suggestive of dementia or MCI, or describing correlations between virtual and in-person cognitive test scores in adults. MEASUREMENTS Reviewer pairs independently conducted study screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias appraisal. RESULTS Our systematic review included 121 studies (15,832 patients). Two studies demonstrated that virtual cognitive assessments could diagnose dementia with good reliability compared with in-person cognitive assessments: weighted kappa 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41-0.62) and 0.63 (95% CI 0.4-0.9), respectively. Videoconference-based cognitive assessments were 100% sensitive and specific for diagnosing dementia compared with in-person cognitive assessments in a third study. No studies compared telephone with in-person cognitive assessment accuracy. The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS; maximum score 41) and modified TICS (maximum score 50) were the only virtual cognitive tests compared with in-person cognitive assessments in >2 studies with extractable data for meta-analysis. The optimal TICS cutoff suggestive of dementia ranged from 22 to 33, but it was 28 or 30 when testing was conducted in English (10 studies; 1673 patients). Optimal modified TICS cutoffs suggestive of MCI ranged from 28 to 31 (3 studies; 525 patients). Sensory impairment was the most often voiced condition affecting assessment. CONCLUSION Although there is substantial evidence supporting virtual cognitive assessment and testing, we identified critical gaps in diagnostic certainty.","Watt, Jennifer A; Lane, Natasha E; Veroniki, Areti Angeliki; Vyas, Manav V; Williams, Chantal; Ramkissoon, Naveeta; Thompson, Yuan; Tricco, Andrea C; Straus, Sharon E; Goodarzi, Zahra",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,381,11

In these viruses, nonstructural protein 2C is one of the most conserved proteins and contains ATPase activity and putative RNA helicase activity. Here we expressed 2C protein of Ectropis obliqua picorna-like virus (EoV; genus Iflavirus, family Iflaviridae, order Picornavirales) in a eukaryotic expression system and determined that EoV 2C displays ATP-independent nucleic acid helix destabilizing and strand annealing acceleration activity in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that this picornaviral 2C is more like an RNA chaperone than like the previously predicted RNA helicase. Our further characterization of EoV 2C revealed that divalent metal ions, such as Mg(2+) and Zn(2+), inhibit 2C-mediated helix destabilization to different extents. Moreover, we determined that EoV 2C also contains ATPase activity like that of other picornaviral 2C proteins and further assessed the functional relevance between its RNA chaperone-like and ATPase activities using mutational analysis as well as their responses to Mg(2+). Our data show that, when one of the two 2C activities was dramatically inhibited or almost abolished, the other activity could remain intact, showing that the RNA chaperone-like and ATPase activities of EoV 2C can be functionally separated. This report reveals that a picorna-like virus 2C protein displays RNA helix destabilizing and strand annealing acceleration activity, which may be critical for picornaviral replication and pathogenesis, and should foster our understanding of picorna-like viruses and viral RNA chaperones.","Cheng, Zhenyun; Yang, Jie; Xia, Hongjie; Qiu, Yang; Wang, Zhaowei; Han, Yajuan; Xia, Xiaoling; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Hu, Yuanyang; Zhou, Xi",Journal of virology,381,27

Adverse events can occur if the devices are not used appropriately. The SAGES' Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy™ (FUSE) program will include a curriculum and certification examination to address this safety issue. The aim of this study was to determine the self-perceived knowledge of practicing surgeons related to energy-based devices and identify areas to emphasize in the assessment component of FUSE. METHODS Psychometric experts led the test development process. During a 2-day retreat, a multidisciplinary group defined 63 test objectives assessing the knowledge and skills required to use energy-based surgical instruments safely (job task analysis). A survey was sent to a sample of 103 SAGES leaders and others in the test target audience to determine the number of items to use for the certification examination. Participants rated each objective for frequency, relevance, and importance on a 1-7 scale with the means used to create a weighted scale. The survey also included five self-assessment questions. RESULTS Fifty surveys were completed; only 28 % of respondents considered themselves ""experts."" The most common source of knowledge was ""industry sales representative or course"" (42 %). The highest weighted topic was ""Prevention of Adverse Events with Electrosurgery."" The highest-rated objectives (>6 out of 7) were ""Identify various mechanisms whereby electrosurgical injuries may occur,"" ""Identify patient protection measures for setup and settings for the electrosurgical unit,"" and ""Identify circumstances, mechanisms, and prevention of dispersive electrodes-related injury."" CONCLUSIONS Although basic and advanced energy-based devices are commonly used, training has been largely dependent upon industry representatives or industry-sponsored courses. Few surgeons consider themselves experts in the mechanisms of action and the appropriate and safe use of energy-based surgical devices.

METHODS This retrospective, comparative, two-center study included age- and sex-matched patients exhibiting an idiopathic epiretinal membrane with and without foveal herniation (epiretinal membrane + foveal herniation group and epiretinal-membrane-only group, respectively). The baseline best-corrected visual acuity and central foveal thickness were compared within the groups through months 1, 3, 6, and 12 of follow-up postoperatively. Then, changes in these two parameters at all follow-up points were compared between the groups. RESULTS We enrolled 16 patients per study group. The baseline best-corrected visual acuity and central foveal thickness were not significantly different between the two groups (p>0.05). Compared with the baseline, both the best-corrected visual acuity and central foveal thickness improved significantly in both groups in all follow-ups (p<0.05), except for the best-corrected visual acuity of the epiretinal-membrane-only group after month 1 (p<0.05). The mean best-corrected visual acuity improvement after month 1 and the mean central foveal thickness reduction after months 1, 3, and 6 were significantly better in the foveal herniation + epiretinal membrane group than in the epiretinal-membrane-only group (p<0.05). However, the best-corrected visual acuity and central foveal thickness changes were not significantly different between the groups at the final visit (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS Although epiretinal membrane + foveal herniation demonstrated prompt anatomical and functional improvement, foveal herniation occurrence did not affect the final surgical outcomes in patients with idiopathic epiretinal membrane.","Ozdemir, Hakan; Karacorlu, Murat; Elbay, Ahmet; Kirik, Furkan",Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,381,29

We therefore tested 2 hypotheses: (1) that diabetics show a greater increase from preoperative to intraoperative glucose concentrations than nondiabetics; and (2) that steroid administration increases intraoperative hyperglycemia more so in diabetics compared with nondiabetics. METHODS Patients scheduled for major noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled and randomized to preoperative IV 8 mg dexamethasone or placebo, stratified by diagnosis of diabetes. Patients were part of a larger underlying trial (the Dexamethasone, Light Anesthesia and Tight Glucose Control [DeLiT] Trial). IV insulin was given when glucose concentration exceeded 215 mg/dL. The primary outcome measure was the change in glucose from the preoperative to maximal intraoperative glucose concentration. We also report the time-dependent pattern of intraoperative hyperglycemia. RESULTS Ninety patients (23% with diabetes) were randomized to dexamethasone, and 95 (29% with diabetes) were given placebo. The mean ± SD change from preoperative to maximal intraoperative glucose concentration was 63 ± 69 mg/dL in diabetics and 72 ± 45 mg/dL in nondiabetics. The mean covariable-adjusted change (95% confidence interval) in nondiabetics was 29 (13, 46) mg/dL more than in diabetics (P < 0.001). For all patients combined, mean glucose increased slightly from preoperative to incision, substantially from incision to surgery midpoint, and then remained high and fairly stable through emergence, with nondiabetic patients showing a greater increase (P < 0.001). For nondiabetics, the mean increase in glucose concentration (97.5% CI) was 29 (9, 49) mg/dL more in patients given dexamethasone than placebo (P = 0.0012). However, there was no dexamethasone effect in diabetics (P = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS Treatment of intraoperative hyperglycemia should account for the hyperglycemic surgical stress response trend depending on the stage of surgery as well as the added effects of steroid administration. Denying steroid prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting for fear of hyperglycemic response should be reconsidered given the limited effect of steroids on intraoperative blood glucose concentrations.","Abdelmalak, Basem B; Bonilla, Angela M; Yang, Dongsheng; Chowdary, Hyndhavi T; Gottlieb, Alexandru; Lyden, Sean P; Sessler, Daniel I",Anesthesia and analgesia,381,16

RESULTS Participants reported high rates of depression and anxiety symptoms, adjustment difficulties, and poor sleep quality. In both countries, COVID-related stressors were associated with both anxiety and depression, and these associations were mediated by sleep disturbances.

Here, a thin, soft, ""skin-like"" microfluidic platform is introduced that bonds to the skin to allow for collection and storage of sweat in an interconnected set of microreservoirs. Pressure induced by the sweat glands drives flow through a network of microchannels that incorporates capillary bursting valves designed to open at different pressures, for the purpose of passively guiding sweat through the system in sequential fashion. A representative device recovers 1.8 µL volumes of sweat each from 0.8 min of sweating into a set of separate microreservoirs, collected from 0.03 cm2 area of skin with approximately five glands, corresponding to a sweat rate of 0.60 µL min-1 per gland. Human studies demonstrate applications in the accurate chemical analysis of lactate, sodium, and potassium concentrations and their temporal variations.","Choi, Jungil; Kang, Daeshik; Han, Seungyong; Kim, Sung Bong; Rogers, John A",Advanced healthcare materials,381,31

Beneficial effects of laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) for the treatment of AA are still controversial. AIM To present our technique for LA and to determine whether LA should be the technique of choice of any case of AA instead of OA. MATERIAL AND METHODS All cases operated for AA (February 2011 through February 2012) by means of LA or OA were prospectively evaluated. Data regarding length of stay, complications, emergency department consultation after discharge or readmission were collected. Patients were classified into four groups depending on the severity of the appendicitis. Economic data were obtained based on the cost of the disposable material. Cost of hospital stay was calculated based on the Ley de Tasas of the Generalitat Valenciana according to the DRG and the length of stay. RESULTS One hundred and forty-two cases were included. Ninety-nine patients underwent OA and 43 LA. Average length of stay for LA group was 2,6 days and 3,8 for OA. Average cost of the stay for OA was 1.799 euros and 1.081 euros for LA. Global morbidity rate was 16%, 5% for LA and 20% for OA.

Physicians are exposed to increasing moral conflict situations, which may cause Moral Distress (MD). MD occurs when someone thinks he or she might know the morally correct action but cannot act upon this knowledge because of in- or external constraints. Correlations of MD among residents to job changes and burn-out have been shown previously. There are, however, hardly any quantitative studies about MD among physicians in Germany. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of occurrence, the level of disturbance, and reasons for MD among neurological residents in German hospitals. METHODS 1st qualitative phase: Open interviews on workload and ethical conflicts in everyday clinical practice were conducted with five neurological residents. Ethical principles of medical action and potential constraints that could cause MD were identified and a questionnaire designed. 2nd quantitative phase: A preliminary questionnaire was tested and evaluated by five further neurological residents. The final questionnaire consisted of 12 items and was conducted online and anonymously via e-mail or on-site as part of an unrelated resident training event at 56 sites. RESULTS One hundred seven neurological residents from 56 university/acute care and rehabilitation hospitals throughout Germany were examined (response rate of those requesting the questionnaire: 75.1%). 96.3% of the participants had experienced MD weekly (3.86, SD 1.02), because they were unable to invest the necessary time in a patient or relative consultation. Errors in medical care, which could not be communicated adequately with patients or relatives, were rated as most distressing. The most common reasons for MD were the growing numbers of patients, expectations of patient relatives, fears of legal consequences, incentives of the DRG-system, and the increasing bureaucratization requirement. 43.0% of participants mentioned they considered leaving the field of inpatient-care. 65.4% stated they would like more support in conflict situations. CONCLUSION MD plays an important role for neurological residents in German hospitals and has an impact on participants' consideration of changing the workplace. Important aspects are rationing (time/beds) and incentives for overdiagnosis as well as lack of internal communication culture and mentoring.","Hildesheim, Hanna; Rogge, Annette; Borzikowsky, Christoph; Witt, Victoria Dorothea; Schäffer, Eva; Berg, Daniela",Neurological research and practice,381,20

RECENT FINDINGS The discovery of anti-HMGCR antibodies led to a better understanding of clinical aspects of statin-associated anti-HMGCR myopathy and its treatment. Statins are widely prescribed medications with well-established benefits in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Adherence to statins is influenced by development of side effects, especially muscle related. There is wide range of neuromuscular side effects associated with statin therapy. Documented neuromuscular side effects include asymptomatic elevation of muscle enzymes, mild-moderate myalgias and cramps, toxic and immune-mediated severe necrotizing myopathy, and rare cases of rhabdomyolysis. In addition, statins can lead to unmasking or triggering of underlying muscle and neuromuscular junction disorders. This article identifies the risk factors and provides a review of neuromuscular side effects associated with statin use, their diagnosis and treatment.","Crisan, Elena; Patil, Vijaya K",Current neurology and neuroscience reports,381,25

Introduction: Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) experienced a rapid evolution from delivery of in-person cessation counseling services to virtual telehealth treatments for our tobacco-dependent cancer patients. Aim: To examine the effect of rapid scaling of tobacco treatment telehealth on patient engagement, as measured by attendance rates for in-person counseling visits versus remote telehealth counseling visits. We also describe the patient, clinician, and health care system challenges encountered in rapid expansion of individual and group tobacco telehealth services. Methods: Data collected from the electronic medical record during the first 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were examined for tobacco treatment counseling. Results: From January 1, 2020 to March 30, 2020, markedly improved patient engagement was observed in ambulatory tobacco treatment services with greater attendance at scheduled telehealth visits than in-person visits, 75% versus 60.3%, odds ratio 1.84 (confidence interval: 1.26-2.71; p < 0.001). In addition, bedside hospital counseling visits were transformed into inpatient telephone visits with high levels of sustained patient engagement. Lastly, group telehealth services were launched rapidly to increase capacity and provide greater psychosocial support for cancer patients struggling with tobacco dependence. Discussion: Clinical, Information Technology (IT), and hospital system barriers were successfully addressed for most cancer patients seeking individual telehealth treatment. Group telehealth services were found to be feasible and acceptable. Conclusions: MSK's rapid leap into virtual care delivery mitigated disruption of tobacco treatment services and demonstrated strong feasibility and acceptance for managing complex tobacco-dependent patients.","Kotsen, Chris; Dilip, Deepika; Carter-Harris, Lisa; O'Brien, Maureen; Whitlock, Charles W; de Leon-Sanchez, Suhana; Ostroff, Jamie S",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,381,2

Once diagnosed, young peoples' health can deteriorate, and it is therefore vital to detect this early to prevent severe outcomes including hospitalisations and deaths by suicide. The main study aim is to describe and discuss observational studies that examine signs of deterioration in young patients with SMI. METHODS A systematic review guided by the published protocol was conducted. Cumulative Index to Nursing and allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC) and Web of Science were searched against pre-defined criteria until 1 March 2021. Observational studies were extracted according to design, country, participant, indicator, outcome and main finding categories. Quality was assessed independently using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). RESULTS Of the 15,788 publications identified, 5 studies were included and subjected to narrative synthesis. Two indicators of mental health deterioration were identified: cognitive functioning (decline, worsening and poor school/academic performance) and expressed emotion status. Indicators revealed mixed views on predicting deterioration. Worsening cognitive functioning and expressed emotion status significantly predicted medication non-adherence and relapse respectively. However, a decline in cognitive functioning (poor academic performance) was not found to significantly correlate to deaths by suicide. Study quality was mostly poor and associations between indicators and varied outcomes were weak. The heterogeneous nature of the data made comparisons difficult and did not allow for further statistical analysis. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first review of observational studies to identify indicators of deterioration in young patients with SMI. Worsening cognitive functioning and expressed emotion status could indicate non-adherence and relapse in young patients with SMI but larger sample sizes in good quality studies are needed. The dearth of observational studies means further research is required to ascertain other indicators of deterioration before serious outcomes occur.

EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS) can be attempted via the trans-gastric route. These procedures are technically complex for two reasons. First, puncture of the intrahepatic bile duct via the trans-gastric route can be more difficult than that by other approaches because of the small diameter of the target site, and guidewire insertion or manipulation is challenging during EUS-HGS. Second, critical adverse events, such as stent migration into the abdominal cavity, could occur because of the greater mobility of the stomach compared to the duodenum. Therefore, endoscopists should be cautious when performing EUS-HGS. An advantage of EUS-HGS is that it can be performed in patients with complications such as duodenal bulb obstruction or surgically altered anatomy. Recent advances in technique and improvements in devices and stents for EUS-HGS have shown promise for improving the technical success rate of EUS-HGS and reducing the rate of adverse events. However, endoscopists should remain aware of the possibility of critical adverse events such as stent migration.","Ogura, Takeshi; Higuchi, Kazuhide",Clinical endoscopy,381,16

A challenge when utilizing such models is monitoring tumor growth during the experiments. In this study, experimental liver metastases were established in nude mice by splenic injection of the CRC cell lines HT29 and HCT116, and the mice were treated with the antiangiogenic drug aflibercept. Tumor growth was monitored using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Aflibercept treatment was well tolerated and resulted in increased animal survival in HCT116, but not in HT29, while inhibited tumor growth was observed in both models. Treatment efficacy was monitored with high precision using MRI, while BLI detected small-volume disease with high sensitivity, but was less accurate in end-stage disease. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values obtained by diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) were highly predictive of treatment response, with increased ADC corresponding well with areas of necrosis observed by histological evaluation of aflibercept-treated xenografts. The results showed that the efficacy of the antiangiogenic drug aflibercept varied between the two models, possibly reflecting unique growth patterns in the liver that may be representative of human disease. Non-invasive imaging, especially MRI and DW-MRI, can be used to effectively monitor tumor growth and treatment response in orthotopic liver metastasis models.","Fleten, Karianne G; Bakke, Kine M; Mælandsmo, Gunhild M; Abildgaard, Andreas; Redalen, Kathrine Røe; Flatmark, Kjersti",Clinical & experimental metastasis,381,27

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) rt-PA Stroke Trials dataset allows for systematic analyses of very early postrandomization improvement (VEPRIM) in stroke severity as a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was available for all subjects enrolled in the study at baseline (NIHSSB) and at 2 hours after randomization (NIHSS2H). We explored various definitions of VEPRIM to characterize predictive values for clinical outcomes. METHODS Post hoc analyses of the NINDS rt-PA Stroke Trials were conducted. VEPRIM was defined as the difference between the NIHSSB and the NIHSS2H scores using 3 approaches: raw, percent, and normalized change. We assessed the association between VEPRIM and 3-month favorable outcome (mRS score of 0-1), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and death. RESULTS In the 624 subjects, every VEPRIM definition was independently associated with an increased probability of favorable outcome: for each unit of change within the VEPRIM definitions, there were 2%-24% (all P < .05) relative increased probability of favorable outcome, 2%-15% (all P < .05) decreased likelihood of death, and 2%-13% (all P < .05) decreased likelihood of sICH. Adjusting for NIHSSB and prestroke mRS scores, there was a significant rt-PA treatment effect for improvement seen for all 3 VEPRIM definitions. CONCLUSIONS VEPRIM predicted favorable outcomes independent of definition and treatment arm. Patients with VEPRIM by any definition, while doing better than patients without VEPRIM, also derived increased clinical benefit when treated with rt-PA compared to placebo. Even with VEPRIM, a substantial percentage of patients had unfavorable outcomes.","Balucani, Clotilde; Levine, Steven R; Khoury, Jane C; Khatri, Pooja; Saver, Jeffrey L; Broderick, Joseph P",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,381,0

PLWD are at greater risk of poor outcomes during and following hospital admission. Compared to those without dementia, they are almost twice as likely to die in hospital and two to three times more likely to experience an adverse event. Although some hospitalizations are clinically necessary, there may be a proportion related to ACSC that could be potentially avoided with additional support and education for PLWD and their carers. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of interventions focused on reducing avoidable hospitalization for PLWD by supporting carers to manage the health care needs of the PLWD, via improved awareness and understanding of health and the healthcare system. METHOD Scientific and gray literature will be searched using a combination of keywords pertaining to dementia, caregivers, education, and support. Included studies will involve community-dwelling PLWD and caregivers, with interventions aimed at improving carer's understanding of the healthcare system and ability to manage the caregiving role. The primary outcome will be hospitalization related to the PLWD and secondary outcomes will be carer burden, stress, wellbeing, and quality of life. All study designs will be considered. Data from included studies will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. If the data permits, we will perform a meta-analysis and subgroup analyses, related to the intervention and participant characteristics. DISCUSSION This review will provide a comprehensive picture of the knowledge available on the subject and identify knowledge gaps in existing literature. The findings may highlight the lack of existing interventions for PLWD and their carers who live in the community and will help stakeholders to identify needs and develop programs targeted to carers and care recipients that prevent avoidable hospitalization for PLWD.

Given a fixed number of treatment sessions, planners thus face the problem of finding a dosing sequence that achieves this goal. This is called the fractionation problem, and has received steady attention over a long history in the clinical literature. Mathematical formulations of the resulting optimization problem utilize the linear-quadratic (LQ) framework to characterize radiation dose-response of tumors and OAR. This yields a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program. The optimal dosing plan in this forward problem crucially depends on the parameters of the LQ model. Unfortunately, these parameters are difficult to estimate via {\it{in vitro}} or {\it{in vivo}} studies, and as such, their values are unknown to treatment planners. The clinical literature is thus replete with debates about what parameter values will make specific dosing plans effective. This manuscript formulates this as an inverse optimization problem. The LQ dose-response parameters appear in the objective function, the left hand side, and the right hand side of the forward problem, and none of the existing generic methods can provide an exact solution of the inverse problem. This manuscript exploits the structure of the problem and identifies all possible parameter values that render the given dosing plan optimal, in closed-form. This closed-form formula is applied to dosing-plans from three clinical studies published within the last two years.","Ghate, Archis",Physics in medicine and biology,381,8

METHODS This was a retrospective chart review study among LT patients with RSV infection between 2013 and 2018 (90 episodes among 87 patients; mean age 56.3 ± 13.1 years, M:F 52:35). A contemporaneous control group consisting of LT patients without RSV infection (n = 183) was included. One-year survival after the RSV infection was the primary endpoint. RESULTS Median time from LT to RSV infection was 30 (1-155) months. Before RSV infection, the median decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) was 9.7 cc (-17.8 to 83 cc) or 0.29% (-1.4% to 4.6%) per month, while the forced expiratory volume (FEV1 ) decline was 7.5 cc (-8.8 to 58 cc) or 0.3% (-0.57% to 4.3%) per month with no statistically significant change after RSV infection. One-year survival among patients with RSV infection was 86.2% (75/87). Pre-infection diagnosis of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD; adjusted HR: 4.29, 1.08-17.0; P = .038) and FVC or FEV1 decline >10% during 6 months post infection (adjusted HR: 35.1, 3.26-377.1; P = .003) were independently associated with worse survival. On propensity score matched analysis, RSV infection was not associated with worse post-transplant survival (HR with 95% CI: 0.79, 0.47-1.34; P = .38). CONCLUSIONS A majority of LT patients in the current cohort did not experience an alteration in the trajectory of FVC or FEV1 decline after developing RSV infection, and their post-transplant survival was not adversely impacted. Established CLAD at the time of RSV infection and post infection >10% decline in FVC or FEV1 are independently associated with worse survival after RSV infection.","Mahan, Luke D; Points, April; Mohanka, Manish R; Bollineni, Srinivas; Joerns, John; Kaza, Vaidehi; La Hoz, Ricardo M; Gao, Ang; Zhang, Song; Torres, Fernando; Banga, Amit",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,381,2

The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of a hypertonic-saline (HS)-enhanced multipolar RFA technique using a perfused electrode to increase RF-created coagulation necrosis, and to compare that technique with natural saline-augmented needle and conventional multipolar RFA. A total of 18 ablations were performed in explanted porcine livers. A total of 6 thermal ablation zones were created in each of 3 groups treated with the conventional multipolar mode, the multipolar mode with 0.9% NaCl and the multipolar mode with 6% NaCl, respectively. During RFA, the dimensions and volumes of the ablation zones were compared, and gross and microscopic pathological evaluations were performed. Multipolar RFA with 6% NaCl created the largest short-axis diameters and volumes of coagulation necrosis (3.89±0.09 mm and 40.01±2.86 mm3, respectively) among the three groups (conventional group: 2.31±0.04 mm and 8.99±0.52 mm3, respectively; 0.9% NaCl solution group: 3.17±0.05 mm and 21.79±1.05 mm3, respectively). Overall, multipolar RFA with the instillation of 6% NaCl solution through an open perfusion system created a larger ablation zone compared with the conventional and 0.9% NaCl modes. Therefore, HS-enhanced multipolar RFA may be a promising approach for treating large liver tumors.","Wang, Caoye; Wang, Qi; Zhang, Dachuan; He, Zhongming; Chen, Wenhua",Oncology letters,381,1

Parent satisfaction is important in this context because studies on healthcare consumption indicate a substantial relationship between patient satisfaction with services and implementation of recommendations and follow-up care. We followed PRISMA guidelines to conduct a systematic review of the literature on parent perception of pediatric neuropsychological evaluations for children aged 3-21 years. Using a set of predefined search terms, we identified 1,163 abstracts across PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science electronic databases and included 12 studies in our qualitative synthesis. In general, parents reported high levels of satisfaction with their child's evaluation. Feedback from the evaluation was helpful for understanding their child's pattern of strengths and weaknesses and included useful information for obtaining support. Although parents did report improvement in their child's functional participation in home, school, and community settings, they tended to rate the usefulness of the evaluation for eliciting change lower than their overall satisfaction with the evaluation or how helpful the evaluation was for understanding their child's abilities. Additional effort appears to be needed for pediatric neuropsychological evaluations recommendations to result in durable, meaningful change in child functioning.","Spano, Paul; Katz, Nicole; DeLuco, Tara; Martin, Christina Octavia; Tam, Helen; Montalto, Daniela; Stein, Cheryl R",Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence,381,27

Mechanical ventilation is an important risk factor for developing AKI in critically ill patients. Ventilation with high tidal volumes has been associated with postoperative organ dysfunction in cardiac surgical patients. No data are available about the effects of the duration of postoperative respiratory support in the immediate postoperative period on the incidence of AKI in patients after cardiac surgery. METHOD We performed a secondary analysis of 584 elective cardiac surgical patients enrolled in an observational trial on the association between preoperative cerebral oxygen saturation and postoperative organ dysfunction and analyzed the incidence of AKI in patients with different times to extubation. The latter variable was graded in 4 h intervals (if below 16 h) or equal to or greater than 16 h. AKI was staged according to the AKI Network criteria. RESULTS Overall, 165 (28.3%) patients developed AKI (any stage), 43 (7.4%) patients needed renal replacement therapy. Patients developing AKI had a significantly (P <0.001) lower renal perfusion pressure (RPP) in the first 8 hours after surgery (57.4 mmHg (95% CI: 56.0 to 59.0 mmHg)) than patients with a postoperatively preserved renal function (60.5 mmHg ((95% CI: 59.9 to 61.4 mmHg). The rate of AKI increased from 17.0% in patients extubated within 4 h postoperatively to 62.3% in patients ventilated for more than 16 h (P <0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of variables significantly associated with AKI in the univariate analysis revealed that the time to the first extubation (OR: 1.024/hour, 95% CI: 1.011 to 1.044/hour; P <0.001) and RPP (OR: 0.963/mmHg; 95% CI: 0.934 to 0.992; P <0.001) were independently associated with AKI. CONCLUSION Without taking into account potentially unmeasured confounders, these findings are suggestive that the duration of postoperative positive pressure ventilation is an important and previously unrecognized risk factor for AKI in cardiac surgical patients, independent from low RPP as an established AKI trigger, and that even a moderate delay of extubation increases AKI risk. If replicated independently, these findings may have relevant implications for clinical care and for further studies aiming at the prevention of cardiac surgery associated AKI.","Heringlake, Matthias; Nowak, Yvonne; Schön, Julika; Trautmann, Jens; Berggreen, Astrid Ellen; Charitos, Efstratios I; Paarmann, Hauke",Critical care,381,33

The experts shared their experience about the treatment of 42 patients with severe acute respiratory failure requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). Patients were predominantly male (male-to-female ratio: 3:1), with a mean age of 51 years (range: 25-73 years). VV-ECMO support was indicated in 30% of the ventilated COVID-19 patients. The mean time requiring mechanical ventilation was 16.5 days, with a mean duration of ECMO support of 10.6 days. At the time of the webinar, a total of 17 patients had already been decannulated from ECMO, whereas six died with multiorgan failure. 18 patients remained on ECMO, with their final outcomes unknown at the time of the webinar. Hospital mortality was 25.6% (as of April 17, 2020). In this respect, VV-ECMO, provided by expert centers, is a recognized and validated mode of advanced life-support during the recent COVID-19 pandemic with good outcomes.","Yankah, Charles Abraham; Trimlett, Richard; Sandoval, Elena; Lotz, Christopher; Ledot, Stephane; Pomar, Jose Luis; Price, Susanna; Meybohm, Patrick",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,381,24

Methods: The MEDLINE and EMBASE via OVID, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus via EBSCO databases were searched from inception to 25 th April 2018.All randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and any prospective studies of adults with wrist osteoarthritis investigating any intervention with a comparator were included. Data were extracted and checked for accuracy and completeness by pairs of reviewers. Primary outcomes were pain and function. Comparative treatment effects were analysed by random effects at all time points. Results: Three RCTs were identified for inclusion after screening and all had a high risk of bias. Two compared proximal row carpectomy (PRC) with four corner fusion (4CF) for post-traumatic osteoarthritis, while the other compared leather with commercial wrist splints in patients with chronic wrist pain, of which a small group had wrist osteoarthritis. Conclusion: There is no prospective study comparing operative to non-operative treatment for wrist osteoarthritis, while there is a paucity of prospective studies assessing the effectiveness of both non-operative and operative interventions.

However, it remains unclear whether CMC modulation would depend on the contribution of neural mechanisms acting at the spinal level. To this purpose, modulations of CMC were compared during submaximal isometric, shortening and lengthening contractions of the soleus (SOL) and the medial gastrocnemius (MG) with a concurrent analysis of changes in spinal excitability that may be reduced during lengthening contractions. Submaximal contractions intensity was set at 50% of the maximal SOL EMG activity. CMC was computed in the time-frequency domain between the Cz EEG electrode signal and the unrectified SOL or MG EMG signal. Spinal excitability was quantified through normalized Hoffmann (H) reflex amplitude. The results indicate that beta-band CMC and normalized H-reflex were significantly lower in SOL during lengthening compared with isometric contractions, but were similar in MG for all three muscle contraction types. Collectively, these results highlight an effect of contraction type on beta-band CMC, although it may differ between agonist synergist muscles. These novel findings also provide new evidence that beta-band CMC modulation may involve spinal regulatory mechanisms.","Glories, Dorian; Soulhol, Mathias; Amarantini, David; Duclay, Julien",Scientific reports,381,31

This study reports progress made in the timing of HCV elimination in 45 high-income countries between 2017 and 2019. METHODS Disease progression models of HCV infection for each country were updated with latest data on chronic HCV prevalence, and annual diagnosis and treatment levels, assumed to remain constant in the future. Modelled outcomes were analysed to determine the year in which each country would meet the WHO 2030 elimination targets. RESULTS Of the 45 countries studied, 11 (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom) are on track to meet WHO's elimination targets by 2030; five (Austria, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, and South Korea) by 2040; and two (Saudi Arabia and Taiwan) by 2050. The remaining 27 countries are not expected to achieve elimination before 2050. Compared to progress in 2017, South Korea is no longer on track to eliminate HCV by 2030, three (Canada, Germany, and Sweden) are now on track, and most countries (30) saw no change. CONCLUSIONS Assuming high-income countries will maintain current levels of diagnosis and treatment, only 24% are on track to eliminate HCV by 2030, and 60% are off track by at least 20 years. If current levels of diagnosis and treatment continue falling, achieving WHO's 2030 targets will be more challenging. With less than ten years remaining, screening and treatment expansion is crucial to meet WHO's HCV elimination targets.","Gamkrelidze, Ivane; Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel; Lazarus, Jeffrey V; Feld, Jordan J; Zeuzem, Stefan; Bao, Yanjun; Pires Dos Santos, Ana Gabriela; Gonzalez, Yuri Sanchez; Razavi, Homie",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,381,29

Regulatory mechanisms can be triggered to counteract these alterations. However, these mechanisms would occur only when fatigue is induced through voluntary (VOL) contractions and not with electrically stimulated (ES) contractions. Hence the aim was to compare the effects of VOL and ES fatiguing contractions inducing a similar level of strength loss on unipedal postural control (assessed by means of force platform and EMG measurements), maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and central activation ratio (CAR) to characterize the alterations induced by both modalities of fatigue and the associated regulatory mechanisms. Results showed that the VOL exercise induced a significant decrease of the CAR whereas the ES exercise did not, thus illustrating that central fatigue was present only after voluntary contractions. The VOL exercise also induced greater postural disturbances and larger regulatory mechanisms than the ES exercise, which also induced postural regulatory mechanisms. The present study reveals that postural control mechanisms are modulated according to the nature of the fatiguing contractions, likely due integration of specific fatigue signals according to the modality of the contraction. Because of a larger neurophysiological impact of VOL than ES fatiguing contractions due to greater central disturbances, VOL exercise-induced larger regulatory mechanisms. Nevertheless, the presence of regulatory mechanisms with ES contractions clearly underlines the ability of the central nervous system to display an accurate motor control following acute externally induced neuromuscular perturbations.","Hachard, B; Noe, F; Catherine, A; Zeronian, Z; Paillard, T",Experimental brain research,381,16

This mixed-methods study was designed to define and establish expert consensus on the most important competencies required to perform a thyroidectomy safely. METHODS Cognitive task analyses for thyroidectomy were performed with semistructured interviews of experts in thyroid surgery. Verbal data were transcribed verbatim, coded, and categorized according to themes that were synthesized into a list of items. Once qualitative data reached saturation, 26 experts were invited to complete 2-round online Delphi surveys to rank each item on a Likert scale of importance (1-7). Consensus was predefined as a Cronbach's α ≥ 0.80. RESULTS Sixty items were synthesized from 5 interviews and categorized into 8 sections: preparation (n = 8), incision/exposure (n = 11), general considerations (n = 4), middle thyroid vein (n = 1), superior pole (n = 5), inferior pole (n = 5), posterolateral dissection (n = 19), and closure (n = 7). Eighteen (69%) experts from 3 countries participated in the Delphi survey. Consensus was achieved after 2 voting rounds (Cronbach's α = 0.95). Greatest weighted sections included ""Superior Pole Dissection"" and ""Posterolateral Dissection."" CONCLUSION Consensus was achieved on defining the most important competencies for safe thyroidectomy.

Antiproliferative activity and the mechanism were assessed by quantitative real time PCR and flow cytometry. Moreover, confocal microscopy was employed to analyze the cell uptake of simvastatin loaded niosomes to the cancerous cells.Results: Size, Polydispersity index (PDI), and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of the best formulation were obtained as 164.8 nm, 0.232, and 97%, respectively. The formulated simvastatin had a spherical shape and showed a slow release profile of the drug after 72h. Stability data elucidated an increase in mean diameter and PDI which was lower for 4 °C than 25 °C. Confocal microscopy showed the localization of drug loaded niosomes in the cancer cells. The MTT assay revealed both free drug and drug loaded niosomes exhibited a dose-dependent cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 cells). Flow cytometry and qPCR analysis revealed drug loaded niosomes exert their cytotoxicity on cancerous cells via regulation of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes.Conclusions: the prepared niosomal simvastatin showed good physicochemical and biological properties than free drug.

Eleven participants with BD and 11 age- and sex-matched control participants (CON) completed a simultaneous magnetic resonance - positron emission tomography (MR-PET) scan with [11C]Martinostat. Lower [11C]Martinostat uptake was found in the right amygdala of BD compared to CON. We assessed uptake in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to compare previous findings of lower uptake in the DLPFC in schizophrenia and found no group differences in BD. Exploratory whole-brain voxelwise analysis showed lower [11C]Martinostat uptake in the bilateral thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, right hippocampus, and right amygdala in BD compared to CON. Furthermore, regional [11C]Martinostat uptake was associated with emotion regulation in BD in fronto-limbic areas, which aligns with findings from previous structural, functional, and molecular neuroimaging studies in BD. Regional [11C]Martinostat uptake was associated with attention in BD in fronto-parietal and temporal regions. These findings indicate a potential role of HDACs in BD pathophysiology. In particular, HDAC expression levels may modulate attention and emotion regulation, which represent two core clinical features of BD.","Tseng, Chieh-En J; Gilbert, Tonya M; Catanese, Mary C; Hightower, Baileigh G; Peters, Amy T; Parmar, Anjali J; Kim, Minhae; Wang, Changning; Roffman, Joshua L; Brown, Hannah E; Perlis, Roy H; Zürcher, Nicole R; Hooker, Jacob M",Translational psychiatry,381,7

Two ionic species, namely Na^{+} and Cl^{-}, have been considered here. E protein is one of the smallest structural protein which is embedded in the outer membrane of the virus. Once the virus is inside the host cell, this protein is expressed abundantly and is responsible for activities such as replication and budding of the virus. In the literature, we can find a few experimental studies focusing on understanding the activity of the channel formed by E proteins of different viruses. Here, we attempt the same study for the COVID-19 E protein ion channel through mathematical modeling. The channel geometry is calculated from the protein data bank file which was provided by NARLabs, Taiwan, using the hole program. Further, it was used to obtain the charge distribution using the pdbtopqr online program. The immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM) has been implemented to numerically solve the system of equations in the channel generated by the protein data bank file.

METHODS The pooled data of INTERACT 1 and 2 (international, multicenter, prospective, open, blinded end point, randomized controlled trials of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage [<6 hours] and elevated systolic blood pressure) were analyzed with regard to associations of baseline lipid-lowering treatment and clinical outcomes of 3184 participants in a multivariate model. Associations of lipid-lowering therapy and hematoma growth (baseline to 24 hours) in computed tomographic substudies participants (n=1310) were estimated in ANCOVA. RESULTS Among 204 patients (6.5%) with baseline lipid-lowering treatment, 90-day clinical outcomes were not significantly different after adjustment for confounding variables including region and age. In the computed tomographic substudy, 24-hour hematoma growth was greater in 124 patients (9%) with, compared with those without, prior lipid-lowering therapy. However, this association was not significant between groups (9.2 versus 6.8 mL; P<0.13), after adjustment for prior antithrombotic therapy.

To ensure the credibility of the data arising from these instruments, the methodological quality of development must be high. This paper reports the protocol for a systematic review of self-report instruments used to measure women's experiences of their maternity care. METHODS Citation databases CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE will be searched from 2002 to 2018 using keywords including women, experience, maternity care, questionnaires, surveys, and self-report. Citations will be screened by two reviewers, in two rounds, for inclusion as per predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction forms will be populated with data, extracted from each study, to evaluate the methodological quality of each survey instrument and the criteria for good measurement properties using quality criteria. Data will also be extracted to categorise the items included in each survey instrument. A combination of a structured narrative synthesis and quantitate summaries in tabular format will allow for recommendations to be made on the use, adaptation and development of future survey instruments. DISCUSSION The value of survey instruments that evaluate women's experiences of their maternity care, as a marker of quality care, has been recognised internationally with many countries employing the use of such instruments to inform policy and practice. The development of these instruments must be methodologically sound and the instrument itself fit for the purpose and context in which it is used.

Hence, desperate efforts have been undertaken for combating the effects of this stress in plants. Interestingly, the use of phytohormones in reducing the impact of HM toxicity has gained much momentum in the recent past. Phytohormones act as chemical messengers that improve the HM stress resistance in plants, thus allowing them to retain their growth and developmental plasticity. Their exogenous application as well as manipulation of endogenous levels through precise targeting of their biosynthesis/signaling components is a promising approach for providing a protective shield against HM stress in plants. However, for the successful use of phytohormones for field plants exposed to HM toxicity, in-depth knowledge of the key pathways regulated by them is of prime importance. Hence, the present review mainly summarizes the key conceptual developments on the involvement of phytohormones in the mitigation of HM stress in plants. The role of various genes, proteins, and signaling components involved in phytohormones associated HM stress tolerance and their modulation has also been discussed. Thus, this update will pave the way for improving HM stress tolerance in plants with the advent of phytohormones for sustainable agriculture growth in the future.","Saini, Shivani; Kaur, Navdeep; Pati, Pratap Kumar",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,381,12

Stigmas are typically investigated in HIV literature individually or through investigating individual populations and the various stigmas they may face. The concept of intersectionality highlights the interconnected nature of social categorisations and their ability to create interdependent systems of discrimination based on gender, race, sexuality and so on. Drawing from perspectives on intersectionality, intersectional stigma denotes the convergence of multiple marginalised identities within an individual or a group, the experiences of stigma associated with these identities as well as the synergistic impact of these experiences on health and well-being. With respect to HIV, public health scholars can examine the impacts of intersectional stigmas on HIV prevention and care utilisation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Reviewers will search systematically through MEDLINE, Global Health, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection and Africa Index Medicus and citations for quantitative studies, qualitative studies and grey literature that include data on stigma and HIV among men who have sex with men and women who have sex with women in Sub-Saharan Africa. Eligible studies will include primary or secondary data on stigma related to HIV risk factors experienced by this population. Studies will be written in French or English and be published between January 1991 and November 2020. All screening and data extraction will be performed in duplicate, and if discrepancies arise, they will be settled by GM'RA, LEN, DD or AO. Findings from this study will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews.

The electrical properties of the skin, also known as electrodermal activity (EDA), are considered as an indirect measure of autonomous nervous system. AIM This study explores EDA changes during endotracheal suction in sedated adult critical care patients; and compares these changes to other monitoring parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS Skin conductance variability, selected hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, bispectral index (BIS) and ambient noise level, were monitored during 4 hour routine daytime intensive care nursing and treatment in an adult Intensive Care Unit. 4h-measurements were divided into 2 groups, based upon the sedation level (group A: Ramsay sedation scale 2-4 and group B: 5-6 respectively) of the patients. Selected recordings before and after endotracheal suction (stress events) were performed. Seven stress events from Group A and 17 from Group B were included for further analysis. Patients' demographics, laboratory exams and severity scores were recorded. Pain status evaluation before every event was also performed via 2 independent observers. RESULTS In both groups the rate of EDA changes was greater than in other monitoring parameters. Yet, in group A only selected parameters were significantly changed after the start of the procedure, while in group B, every parameter showed significant change (p<0.05). Groups were similar for other co-founding factors. CONCLUSION EDA measurements are more sensitive to stress stimuli, than cardiovascular, respiratory or even BIS monitoring. Deeper sedation seems to affect more the intensity of EDA changes during suction.","Aslanidis, Theodoros; Grosomanidis, Vasilios; Karakoulas, Konstantinos; Chatzisotiriou, Athanasios",Folia medica,381,1

It is essential to quantify the transmissibility on real-time basis for designing public health responses. Methods We estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers in China, Hubei province and Wuhan city by using the renewable equation determined by the serial interval (SI) of COVID-19. We compare the average reproduction numbers in different periods of time to explore the effectiveness of the public health control measures against the COVID-19 epidemic. Results We estimated the reproduction numbers at 2.61 (95% CI: 2.47-2.75), 2.76 (95% CI: 2.54-2.95) and 2.71 (95% CI: 2.43-3.01) for China, Hubei province and Wuhan respectively. We found that the reproduction number largely dropped after the city lockdown. As of February 16, the three reproduction numbers further reduced to 0.98, 1.14 and 1.41 respectively. Conclusions The control of COVID-19 epidemic was effective in substantially reducing the disease transmissibility in terms of the reproduction number in China reduced to 0.98 as of February 16. At the same time, the reproduction number in Wuhan was probably still larger than 1, and thus the enhancement in the public health control was recommended to maintain.","Wang, Kai; Zhao, Shi; Li, Huling; Song, Yateng; Wang, Lei; Wang, Maggie H; Peng, Zhihang; Li, Hui; He, Daihai",Annals of translational medicine,381,17

This can be addressed by developing a core outcome set, a standardised set of outcomes reported in all interventional studies for a specific condition. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the range of outcomes, their definitions, and the measurement instruments currently utilised in interventional studies for adult patients with AF. This will inform the development of an AF core outcome set. METHODS Medline, Embase and The Cochrane Library were searched to identify all patient- and clinician-reported outcomes in studies assessing medical, surgical or combination treatment of adult patients with AF published from January 2008 to May 2020. The resulting outcomes were categorized according to the Core Outcome Measurement in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) taxonomy to better understand their distribution. RESULTS In total, 155 studies were included, 552 outcomes were extracted, with a median of three outcomes (interquartile range 2-5) per study. Only 25% of studies demonstrated high-quality outcome reporting. The outcomes were merged into 52 unique outcomes and structured into four core areas and 14 domains, with the majority in the domain of physiological or clinical (gastrointestinal) outcomes. The most commonly reported outcomes were healing (77%), incontinence (63%), and recurrence (40%), with no single outcome assessed across all studies. There was a wide variation in outcome definitions and measurement instruments used. CONCLUSIONS There is substantial heterogeneity in outcomes, definitions, and measurement instruments reported in interventional studies for cryptoglandular anal fistula. This emphasises the need for standardised outcome reporting and measurement.","Machielsen, A J H M; Iqbal, N; Kimman, M L; Sahnan, K; Adegbola, S O; Kane, G; Woodcock, R; Kleijnen, J; Grossi, U; Breukink, S O; Tozer, P J",Techniques in coloproctology,381,8

OBJECTIVES Herein, we report on complications of LAGBP and discuss the clinical features and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in such situations, with emphasis on gastric fold herniation (GFH). SETTING University Hospital. METHODS Prospectively collected data of 223 patients who underwent LAGBP for morbid obesity between August 2009 and December 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Follow-up at 1 year was 75%. RESULTS Eight patients (3.5%) required readmission due to major complications, including 1 trocar site hernia, 1 band leak, 1 gastric stenosis, and 5 GFHs. GFHs occurred mostly in the first postoperative month (4/5, 80%) and at the fundus (5/5, 100%); 4 GFHs occurred in the initial 70 patients. Seven laparoscopic reoperations were required for managing GFH. The gastric band was removed in 3 patients (of 5; 60%). Two patients developed residual intra-abdominal abscess and were treated successfully by image-guided drainage. In March 2012, we reversed the order of our surgical techniques for the subsequent 153 patients and performed greater curvature plication first, followed by band placement. Only one GFH occurred after this change in surgical order (1/153 versus 4/70; P< .05). CONCLUSIONS High clinical suspicion assisted by radiological investigations and early surgical intervention is the key for managing GFH after LAGBP. Though GFH complications were rare, we significantly reduced its occurrence by altering the surgical order in LAGBP to plication followed by banding.","Chang, Po-Chih; Dev, Anshuman; Katakwar, Abhishek; Hsin, Ming-Che; Tai, Chi-Ming; Huang, Chih-Kun",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,381,1

Capabilities for continuous monitoring of pressure and temperature at the skin-prosthesis interface can be valuable in the fitting process and in monitoring for the development of dangerous regions of increased pressure and temperature as limb volume changes during daily activities. Conventional pressure transducers and temperature sensors cannot provide comfortable, irritation-free measurements because of their relatively rigid construction and requirements for wired interfaces to external data acquisition hardware. Here, we introduce a millimeter-scale pressure sensor that adopts a soft, three-dimensional design that integrates into a thin, flexible battery-free, wireless platform with a built-in temperature sensor to allow operation in a noninvasive, imperceptible fashion directly at the skin-prosthesis interface. The sensor system mounts on the surface of the skin of the residual limb, in single or multiple locations of interest. A wireless reader module attached to the outside of the prosthetic socket wirelessly provides power to the sensor and wirelessly receives data from it, for continuous long-range transmission to a standard consumer electronic device such as a smartphone or tablet computer. Characterization of both the sensor and the system, together with theoretical analysis of the key responses, illustrates linear, accurate responses and the ability to address the entire range of relevant pressures and to capture skin temperature accurately, both in a continuous mode.

However, basic mechanisms of Ad5-FMDV vaccine function including virus tropism, transgene expression, and antigen presentation, remain incompletely understood. The current study characterized the dynamics of Ad5 viral vector (Ad5-FMDV-A24 and Ad5-luciferase) infection in cell lines and early post-inoculation vector-host interactions in cattle. Adenovirus dissemination was described utilizing novel rPCR, rRT-PCR, luminometry, and immunomicroscopy techniques. In vitro infection of human and bovine cells with both Ad5 vectors resulted in dose-dependent detection of vector DNA, mature mRNA transcripts, and transgene-encoded proteins. Subsequent to intramuscular inoculation of cattle, Ad5 and transgene products were detected at the injection sites of all animals at all time-points examined (6, 24, and 48 hpi). Microscopically, injection sites were characterized by marked infiltrates of interstitium consisting of predominantly large mononuclear cells. Immunomicroscopy indicated these cells infrequently contained adenovirus and/or transgenic proteins and were phenotypically consistent with antigen-presenting cells (macrophages and dendritic cells). Vector DNA and mature mRNA transcripts were first detected at the draining and local lymph nodes as early as 6 hpi and systemically at 24 hpi. These results provide novel insights for understanding Ad5-mediated immunity against FMDV using novel techniques that will contribute to ongoing efforts for the improvement of future Ad-FMDV vaccine platforms.","Montiel, Nestor; Smoliga, George; Arzt, Jonathan",Vaccine,381,23

However, some experience is required to get accustomed to its unpredictable fluoroscopic visibility during injection. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of radiopacity change in a simulated embolization procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using a bench-top Onyx injection experiment simulating a typical brain arteriovenous malformation embolization, nine cycles of casting modes (continuous injection) and plugging modes (injection with intermittent pauses) were performed. Radiodensity of Onyx droplets collected from the microcatheter tip and the distal head portion of the microcatheter were measured as time lapsed. Distribution of droplet radiodensity (radiodensity) and distribution of radiographic grade (grade) were analyzed and compared by repeated measurements. RESULTS Within-group analysis revealed no significant radiodensity change with time (P>0.05). The radiodensity was significantly higher in the casting mode than in the plugging mode (P<0.01). The lateral radiograph of the microcatheter showed higher radiopacity (P<0.01) and better evenness (P<0.01) in the casting mode than in the plugging mode. A significant difference in microcatheter attenuation (both radiographic grade mean and SD; P<0.01) was noted between the two modes. Radiodensity had a significant influence on the radiopacity and radiopacity evenness of the microcatheter. CONCLUSION The radiopacity of the Onyx can vary significantly over time because of early precipitation of tantalum powder. Radiopacity decreased significantly during plugging modes, characterized by pauses between injections.","Jiang, Yuan Yuan; Jo, Ye-Eun; Woo, Jung Min; Lim, Ok Kyun; Hwang, Changmo; Maeng, Jun Young; Kim, Jieun; Kim, Namkug; Lee, Deok Hee",Neurointervention,381,1

As a result of high mortality rate among the severe COVID-19 patients, the early detection of the disease stage and early effective interventions are very important in reducing mortality. Hence, it is important to differentiate severe and non-severe cases from each other. To date, there are no proven diagnostic or prognostic parameters that can be used in this manner. Due to the expensive and not easily accessible tests that are performed for COVID-19, researchers are investigating some parameters that can be easily used. In some recent studies, hematological parameters have been evaluated to see if they can be used as predictive parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS In the current study, almost all hematological parameters were used, including the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio, monocyte/lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to platelet ratio, plateletcrit, and D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio (DFR), neutrophil/lymphocyte/platelet scoring system, and systemic immune-inflammation index. A total of 750 patients, who were admitted to Ankara City Hospital due to COVID-19, were evaluated in this study. The patients were classified into 2 groups according to their diagnosis (confirmed or probable) and into 2 groups according to the stage of the disease (non-severe or severe). RESULTS The values of the combinations of inflammatory markers and other hematological parameters in all of the patients with severe COVID-19 were calculated, and the predicted values of these parameters were compared. According to results of the study, nearly all of the hematological parameters could be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers for subsequent analysis, because the area under the curve (AUC) was higher than 0.50, especially for the DFR and NLR, which had the highest AUC among the parameters. CONCLUSION Our findings indicate that, the parameters those enhanced from complete blood count, which is a simple laboratory test, can help to identify and classify COVID-19 patients into non-severe to severe groups.","Şan, İshak; GemcİoĞlu, Emİn; DavutoĞlu, Mehmet; ÇatalbaŞ, Ramİs; KarabuĞa, Berkan; Kaptan, Enes; Erden, Abdulsamet; KÜÇÜkŞahİn, Orhan; AteŞ, İhsan; KaraahmetoĞlu, Selma; HasanoĞlu, İmran; İnan, Osman; Ünal, BÜŞra Nur; Erdemİr, Ecem; Kahraman, Fatİh Ahmet; GÜner, Hatİce Rahmet",Turkish journal of medical sciences,381,31

The author proposes that creating a more alkaline extracellular environment that is unsuitable for the fusion between the envelope of SARS-CoV-2 and the host cell membrane is a promising method to prevent the entry of coronaviruses into human cells. The alkaline environment could be achieved by exposing the general public to water-clustered negative air ions (NAIs), both indoors and outdoors, to induce a gradual increase in the pH of the human body.

Furthermore, different neurotropic viruses will affect the CNS at distinct developmental stages, from early prenatal brain development to the aged brain. With the unique flexibility and scalability of human pluripotent stem cell technology, it is now possible to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying acute infection and latency, determine which CNS subpopulations are specifically infected, study temporal aspects of viral susceptibility, perform high-throughput chemical or genetic screens for viral restriction factors and explore complex cell-non-autonomous disease mechanisms.

Inappropriate grasping force can cause damage or serious bleeding to the liver. In addition, instability of grasping can result unsafe operations or wavered cutting. We propose a surgical device to improve stability of liver manipulation. METHODS A proposed device adheres to the liver surface with suction fixation, then tunes its stiffness to being hard and shapes like as a bulge on the liver surface to be grasped with laparoscopic forceps. It consists of two soft beams, a chamber sponge, membrane covering the device upper, suburb extrusion wing membrane, a vacuuming tube and to-be-grasped bars. The beams are designed as being non-stretchable and easy to bend. The device is connected to a medical vacuuming pump to vacuum air in the device and then gets hard to transfer forceps operation well. This stiffness tuning mechanism by pneumatic control features the device for achieving good liver shape followability and forceps operation propagation less invasively. The proposed device was tested with rubber phantoms and porcine livers on shape followability, stiffness transition, liver invasiveness and operational usability in the experiments. RESULTS Performance of the proposed device was assessed in experiments. The device showed good object-shape followability. It held the liver with 2.43-N force for vertical lifting and 4.90-N shear force with - 80 kPa vacuuming pressure. Invasiveness was reduced to acceptable level of liver damage. In usability test, the device grasped the liver stably and transferred surgical forceps operations to the liver surface well. CONCLUSION The proposed device showed effective performance to improve laparoscopic liver manipulation. It held the liver stably and less invasively and transferred forceps operation force to the liver surface well.","Nakajima, Yoshikazu; Suzuki, Rina; Suzuki, Yutaro; Sugino, Takaaki; Kawase, Toshihiro; Onogi, Shinya; Seki, Haruna; Fujiwara, Tatsuki; Ouchi, Katsuhiro",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,381,12

BACKGROUND Although there is extensive literature investigating the clinical effectiveness of ERP, little is known regarding its cost-effectiveness. METHODS A systematic literature search identified all relevant articles published between 1997 and 2012 that performed an economic evaluation of ERP for colorectal surgery. Studies were included only if their ERP included all 5 of the key components (patient information, preservation of GI function, minimization of organ dysfunction, active pain control, and promotion of patient autonomy). Quality assessment was performed using the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria instrument (scored 0-19; high quality ≥ 12). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated if sufficient data were provided, using difference in length of stay and overall complication rates as effectiveness measures. RESULTS Of a total of 263 unique records identified (253 from databases and 10 from other sources), 10 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included for full qualitative synthesis. Overall quality was poor (mean quality 7.8). Eight reported lower costs for ERP. The majority (8 of 10) of studies were performed from an institutional perspective and therefore did not include costs related to changes in productivity and other indirect costs (eg, caregiver burden). Five studies provided enough information to calculate ICERs, of which ERP was dominant (less costly and more effective) in all cases for reduction in length of stay and was dominant or potentially cost-effective in 4 and questionable (no difference in costs nor effectiveness) in 1 for reduction in overall complications. CONCLUSIONS The quality of the current evidence is limited but tends to support the cost-effectiveness of ERP. There is need for well-designed trials to determine the cost-effectiveness of ERP from both the institutional and societal perspectives.","Lee, Lawrence; Li, Chao; Landry, Tara; Latimer, Eric; Carli, Franco; Fried, Gerald M; Feldman, Liane S",Annals of surgery,381,1

In this study, we examined the cardiovascular function of anesthetized rats before, during and after being constricted by boas (Boa constrictor) to examine the effect of constriction on the prey's circulatory function. The results demonstrate that within 6 s of being constricted, peripheral arterial blood pressure (PBP) at the femoral artery dropped to 1/2 of baseline values while central venous pressure (CVP) increased 6-fold from baseline during the same time. Electrocardiographic recordings from the anesthetized rat's heart revealed profound bradycardia as heart rate (fH) dropped to nearly half of baseline within 60 s of being constricted, and QRS duration nearly doubled over the same time period. By the end of constriction (mean 6.5±1 min), rat PBP dropped 2.9-fold, fH dropped 3.9-fold, systemic perfusion pressure (SPP=PBP-CVP) dropped 5.7-fold, and 91% of rats (10 of 11) had evidence of cardiac electrical dysfunction. Blood drawn immediately after constriction revealed that, relative to baseline, rats were hyperkalemic (serum potassium levels nearly doubled) and acidotic (blood pH dropped from 7.4 to 7.0). These results are the first to document the physiological response of prey to constriction and support the hypothesis that snake constriction induces rapid prey death due to circulatory arrest.","Boback, Scott M; McCann, Katelyn J; Wood, Kevin A; McNeal, Patrick M; Blankenship, Emmett L; Zwemer, Charles F",The Journal of experimental biology,381,32

METHODS Six thawed adult male dog carcasses were placed in the Trendelenburg position after placing three surgical ports in triangulation. ICG (0.5 mg/ml; 0.05 mg/kg) was administered to five of the carcasses (one carcass was a pilot) via ID in the left torso and IPP (right position, by surgical access) to stain the lymphatic pathway and medial iliac lymph node (MILN). Fluorescence quality, staining time, structures stained, and lymph node histopathology were assessed. Thoracic duct staining was also evaluated. RESULTS ID administration showed staining of parts of the lymphatic pathway of the iliosacral lymph center in all cases using a single dose of ICG, with left MILN visualization in four carcasses. IPP administration showed staining of the right MILN in all cases, using a single dose in four carcasses. ICG reached the thoracic duct in one case. The two administration routes showed similar results in terms of required ICG volume, staining time, and visualization quality, although IPP was more effective in staining the MILN. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms the feasibility of staining the iliosacral lymph center (mainly the MILNs) by LFL in thawed dog carcasses via ID or IPP administration of ICG.

The aggressive nature of the outbreak in the region was dramatic, leading to a 2-month period of lockdown. Within the Policlinico, the historic hospital in the center of Milan, many units were rapidly converted into intensive care units or semi-intensive units for adult patients. During lockdown, the pediatric inpatient units had to face daily reorganization caused by the necessary logistic and structural transformations, thus restricting routine care pathways for chronic patients, while the Pediatric Emergency Unit had to develop a system able to effectively separate the children and caregivers infected with COVID-19 from those who were not affected. These 2 months enhanced resilience among both doctors and nurses, and facilitated the transversal transmission of data aimed at helping colleagues and patients in any way possible, in spite of the restrictive measures limiting the rate of activity in pediatric care.

Disease from endemic respiratory and enteric pathogens such as Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mh) and Lawsonia intracellularis (LI) are common in swine production. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine if pigs selected for high vs. low FE based on residual feed intake (RFI) respond differently to a dual respiratory and enteric challenge. Pigs selected for low RFI (LRFI, high FE) are considered more FE compared to their high RFI (HRFI, low FE) selected counterparts. Using a 2 × 2 factorial design, 25 littermate pairs from the HRFI and 25 littermate pairs from the LRFI line (barrows, 50 ± 7 kg BW) were selected, with one pig from each pair assigned to individual pens in either the challenge or the nonchallenge (control) rooms (n = 25 barrows/line/challenge). On days post inoculation (dpi) 0, the challenged pigs were inoculated with LI and Mh (MhLI). Feed intake, BW, fecal swabs, and serum samples were collected and recorded weekly for 42 d. On dpi -2 and 47, 14 littermate pairs (n = 7 barrows/line/challenge) were utilized for initial and final body composition scans using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to calculate longitudinal whole body tissue accretion rates for lean, protein, fat, and bone mineral content. Serum antibody levels and fecal shedding of LI were used to confirm infection. Control pigs remained negative by all measures during the 6-wk trial and MhLI inoculated pigs were confirmed positive via serological antibody responses by dpi 14 for LI and Mh. There were no interactions between RFI line and challenge status for any overall performance parameter (P > 0.05). The 6-wk MhLI challenge resulted in a 17% reduction in ADG, a 12% reduction in ADFI, and a 7% reduction in G:F vs. Controls (P < 0.05). In addition, compared to the Control pigs, MhLI challenge reduced lean, protein, and lipid accretion rates by 16% (P < 0.05). Genetic selection for high FE resulted in decreased ADFI and increased G:F (P < 0.01), but did not impact ADG or tissue accretion vs. low FE pigs. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a dual enteric and respiratory pathogen challenge reduced ADG, ADFI, G:F, and tissue accretion in growing pigs. Further, there was no evidence that selection for enhanced FE based on RFI index affects response to disease.","Helm, Emma T; Outhouse, Amanda C; Schwartz, Kent J; Dekkers, Jack C M; Lonergan, Steven M; Rauw, Wendy M; Gabler, Nicholas K",Journal of animal science,381,16

It is considered a promising and safe alternative pain therapy. Different targets have been tested, each having their own particular mechanisms for modulating pain perception. AREAS COVERED We discuss the current state of the art of tDCS to manage pain and future strategies to optimize tDCS' effects. Current strategies include primary motor cortex tDCS, prefrontal tDCS and tDCS combined with behavioral interventions while future strategies, on the other hand, include high intensity tDCS, transcutaneous Spinal Direct Current Stimulation, cerebellar tDCS, home-based tDCS and tDCS with extended number of sessions. EXPERT COMMENTARY It has been shown that the stimulation of the prefrontal and primary motor cortex is efficient for pain reduction while a few other new strategies, such as high intensity tDCS and network-based tDCS, are believed to induce strong neuroplastic effects, although the underlying neural mechanisms still need to be fully uncovered. Hence, conventional tDCS approaches demonstrated promising effects to manage pain and new strategies are under development to enhance tDCS effects and make this approach more easily available by using, for instance, home-based devices.","Pacheco-Barrios, Kevin; Cardenas-Rojas, Alejandra; Thibaut, Aurore; Costa, Beatriz; Ferreira, Isadora; Caumo, Wolnei; Fregni, Felipe",Expert review of medical devices,381,1

BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected over a million people, with over 65,000 deaths as of the first quarter of 2020. The current limitation of effective treatment options with no approved vaccine or targeted therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 has posed serious global health threats. This has necessitated several drug and vaccine development efforts across the globe. To date, the farthest in the drug development pipeline so far is Remdesivir. OBJECTIVES We perform molecular dynamics simulation, quantify the energy contributions of binding site residues using per-residue energy decomposition calculations, and subsequently generate a pharmacophore model for the identification of potential SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors. METHODS Integrative molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamic calculations coupled with advanced postmolecular dynamics analysis techniques were employed. RESULTS Our analysis showed that the modulatory activity of Remdesivir is characterized by an extensive array of highaffinity and consistent molecular interactions with specific active site residues that anchor Remdemsivir within the binding pocket for efficient binding. These residues are ASP452, THR456, ARG555, THR556, VAL557, ARG624, THR680, SER681, and SER682. Results also showed that Remdesivir binding, induces minimal individual amino acid perturbations, subtly interferes with deviations of C-α atoms and restricts the systematic transition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the ""buried"" hydrophobic region to the ""surface-exposed"" hydrophilic region. We also mapped a pharmacophore model based on observed high-affinity interactions with SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which showcased the crucial functional moieties of Remdesivir and was subsequently employed for virtual screening. CONCLUSION The structural insights and the optimized pharmacophoric model provided would augment the design of improved analogs of Remdesivir that could expand treatment options for COVID-19.","Agoni, Clement; Soliman, Mahmoud E S",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,381,27

Herein is a discussion of our experience gained from the initial 130 patients enrolled in transgastric pre-NOTES and NOTES protocols at our institution. METHODS A retrospective review of our research database was performed for all patients enrolled in NOTES protocols. The infectious risk of a gastrotomy with and without a NOTES procedure was assessed in 100 patients. Eighty patients completed a true NOTES protocol looking at staging, access, and insufflation with select patients evaluating the potential for bacterial contamination of the abdominal compartment. RESULTS A total of 130 patients have completed pre-NOTES and NOTES protocols at our institution. We observed no clinically significant contamination of the abdomen secondary to transgastric procedures in 100 patients. Diagnostic transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy (DTEP) was completed in 20 patients with pancreatic head masses and found to have a 95% concordance with laparoscopic exploration for assessment of peritoneal metastases. Blind endoscopic gastrotomy and DTEP were evaluated in 40 patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures (LSRYGB) and were found to be safe, reliable, and without a clinically significant risk of contamination. Endoscopic peritoneal insufflation was successfully established and correlated with standard laparoscopic insufflation in 20 patients. CONCLUSIONS Transgastric NOTES is a safe alternative approach to accessing the peritoneal cavity in humans. The risk of bacterial contamination secondary to peroral and transgastric access is clinically insignificant. A device for the facile closure of the gastric defect is the sole factor limiting institution of this methodology as a standalone technique.","Nau, Peter; Ellison, E Christopher; Muscarella, Peter; Mikami, Dean; Narula, Vimal K; Needleman, Bradley; Melvin, W Scott; Hazey, Jeffrey W",Surgical endoscopy,381,1

Bovine blood and nasal swab samples collected on FTA cards were extracted using the commercially available GenSolve kit with a minor modification. The call rate and concordance of genotypes from each sample were compared to those obtained from whole blood samples extracted by standard PCI extraction. FINDINGS An ANOVA analysis indicated no significant difference (P > 0.72) in BovineSNP50 genotype call rate between DNA extracted from FTA cards by the GenSolve kit or extracted from whole blood by PCI. Two sample t-tests demonstrated that the DNA extracted from the FTA cards produced genotype call and concordance rates that were not different to those produced by assaying DNA samples extracted by PCI from whole blood. CONCLUSION We conclude that DNA extracted from FTA cards by the GenSolve kit is of sufficiently high quality to produce results comparable to those obtained from DNA extracted from whole blood when assayed by the Illumina iSelect technology. Additionally, we validate the use of nasal swabs as an alternative to venous blood or buccal samples from animal subjects for reliably producing high quality genotypes on this platform.","McClure, Matthew C; McKay, Stephanie D; Schnabel, Robert D; Taylor, Jeremy F",BMC research notes,381,1

Regarding Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), few programs have been tested; nevertheless, results are promising. The therapeutic alliance is an important factor predicting treatment outcome in BPD. However, we do not know yet to what extent BPD patients form a therapeutic alliance with an eHealth tool and how this relationship differs from the relationship with their human therapist. This study aims to address this question using priovi, an interactive schema therapy-based eHealth tool for BPD. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore how patients perceived the therapeutic alliance with priovi and its differences compared to the alliance with their human therapist (N = 9). Interview data were analyzed following the procedures of qualitative content analysis. Additionally, the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-SR) was administered in two versions (regarding the human therapist and priovi, N = 16) every three months during the treatment phase of one year. Results indicate that patients were able to form a good therapeutic relationship with priovi, but it differed from the relationship to their human therapist. Important categories were ""priovi is helpful, supportive and always there"" and ""priovi is less flexible"". WAI ratings for the task subscale were high in both relationships but significantly higher in WAItherapist compared to WAIpriovi in two measurements (nine-months measurement: t = 2.76, df = 15, p = 0.015; twelve-months measurement: t = 3.44, df = 15, p = 0.004).

Playing videogames has been encouraged by several organizations to help individuals cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictive measures. This longitudinal study was the first to examine gaming in the context of the pandemic and its association with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Methods The sample comprised 1,778 children and adolescents (50.7% male) who were part of the Project of School Mental Health in Southwest China. Data were collected at two-time intervals: before the COVID-19 pandemic (October to November 2019 - [T1]) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (April to May 2020 - [T2]). Data were collected on perceived COVID-19 impacts, videogame use, Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD), and depressive and anxiety symptoms. Cross-lagged panel models were computed to examine longitudinal relationships. Results The results indicated that both videogame use and IGD increased significantly for adolescents at T2. The cross-lagged panel model results suggested that depressive and anxiety symptoms at T1 positively predicted IGD and videogame use at T2 (especially for boys), but not inversely. Perceived COVID-19 impacts mediated the relationship between depressive and anxiety symptoms at T1 and IGD at T2. Conclusion Children and adolescents both increased videogame use at T2, but only adolescents significantly increased IGD severity at T2. The findings supported the compensatory hypothesis, and are consistent with the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model as individual responses to COVID-19 may function as a mediator between personal predisposing variables and IGD.","Teng, Zhaojun; Pontes, Halley M; Nie, Qian; Griffiths, Mark D; Guo, Cheng",Journal of behavioral addictions,381,1

Furthermore, estimating the prevalence of such infectious diseases and associated factors is key to assess the disease impact and design control programs. In this study, we identified a high herd-level seroprevalence of EBL in cattle from the semi-arid Paraíba state, Northeast Region of Brazil, using a planned cross-sectional survey. Herd-level and animal-level prevalence were estimated using a two-stage random sampling survey. In total, 2067 cows aged ≥24 months from 400 herds were sampled. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect specific antibodies directed to the bovine leukosis virus gp51 antigen in both individual and pooled sera. The herd-level and animal-level prevalence was 23.4 % (95 % CI = 19.2-28.1 %) and 10.8 % (95 % CI = 7.5 %-15.3 %), respectively. There were no significant clusters of positive herds (within a radius of 2 km). The factors associated with herd-level prevalence were the exclusive use of hand milking (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.88), herd size (PR = 1.005), artificial insemination (PR = 2.03), purchase of animals in the previous year (PR = 1.87), and peri-urban farms (PR = 2.09). Prevention measures should be applied at the herd-level, particularly for farms located in peri-urban areas, focusing on good hygiene in hand milking, robust practices and standards for artificial insemination, and serological testing of animals prior to purchase.","Ramalho, Gisele Cândida; Silva, Maria Luana Cristiny Rodrigues; Falcão, Brunna Muniz Rodrigues; Limeira, Clécio Henrique; Nogueira, Denise Batista; Dos Santos, Amanda Martins; Martins, Camila Marinelli; Alves, Clebert José; Clementino, Inácio José; de Sousa Américo Batista Santos, Carolina; de Azevedo, Sérgio Santos",Preventive veterinary medicine,381,1

Anthropogenic emissions that are harmful to human health have been reduced substantially under COVID-19 lockdown. Satellite remote sensing for air pollution assessments can be highly effective in public health research because of the possibility of estimating air pollution levels over large scales. In this study, we utilized both satellite and surface measurements to estimate air pollution levels in 20 cities across the world. Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) application were used for both spatial and time-series assessment of tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) statuses during the study period (1 February to 11 May 2019 and the corresponding period in 2020). We also measured Population-Weighted Average Concentration (PWAC) of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and NO2 using gridded population data and in-situ air pollution estimates. We estimated the economic benefit of reduced anthropogenic emissions using two valuation approaches: (1) the median externality value coefficient approach, applied for satellite data, and (2) the public health burden approach, applied for in-situ data. Satellite data have shown that ∼ 28 tons (sum of 20 cities) of NO2 and ∼ 184 tons (sum of 20 cities) of CO have been reduced during the study period. PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 are reduced by ∼37 (μg/m3), 62 (μg/m3), and 145 (μg/m3), respectively. A total of ∼1310, ∼401, and ∼430 premature cause-specific deaths were estimated to be avoided with the reduction of NO2, PM2.5, and PM10. The total economic benefits (Billion US$) (sum of 20 cities) of the avoided mortality are measured as ∼10, ∼3.1, and ∼3.3 for NO2, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. In many cases, ground monitored data was found inadequate for detail spatial assessment. This problem can be better addressed by incorporating satellite data into the evaluation if proper quality assurance is achieved, and the data processing burden can be alleviated or even removed. Both satellite and ground-based estimates suggest the positive effect of the limited human interference on natural environments. Further research in this direction is needed to explore this synergistic association more explicitly.","Sannigrahi, Srikanta; Kumar, Prashant; Molter, Anna; Zhang, Qi; Basu, Bidroha; Basu, Arunima Sarkar; Pilla, Francesco",Environmental research,381,9

Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was measured at baseline and during rebreathing followed by a maximal end-inspiratory apnea. In women, baseline MSNA was greater in the midluteal (ML) than early-follicular (EF) phase of the menstrual cycle. Baseline MSNA burst incidence was greater in men than women, while burst frequency and total MSNA were similar between men and women only in the ML phase. Chemoreflex activation evoked graded increases in MSNA burst frequency, amplitude, and total activity in all participants. In women, this sympathoexcitation was greater in the EF than ML phase. The sympathoexcitatory response to chemoreflex stimulation of the EF phase in women was also greater than in men. Nonetheless, changes in total peripheral resistance were similar between sexes and menstrual cycle phases. This indicates that neurovascular transduction was attenuated during the EF phase during chemoreflex activation, thereby offsetting the exaggerated sympathoexcitation. Chemoreflex-induced increases in mean arterial pressure were similar across sexes and menstrual cycle phases. During acute chemoreflex stimulation, reduced neurovascular transduction could provide a mechanism by which apnea-associated morbidity might be attenuated in women relative to men.","Usselman, Charlotte W; Gimon, Tamara I; Nielson, Chantelle A; Luchyshyn, Torri A; Coverdale, Nicole S; Van Uum, Stan H M; Shoemaker, J Kevin",American journal of physiology.

The purpose of this study was to identify variables associated with early cholecystectomy, to target opportunities to improve adherence to best practices. METHODS Adult patients admitted to surgical units with ACC at two hospitals in a university hospital network between June 2010 and January 2015 were reviewed. Patients with concurrent pancreatitis, cholangitis or severe ACC (with organ system failure) were excluded. Early cholecystectomy was defined as surgery performed during same admission and within 7 days of presentation. Non-operative management was defined as admission for ACC treated conservatively, with or without eventual delayed cholecystectomy. The primary outcome was early cholecystectomy versus initial non-operative management; secondary outcomes included time to cholecystectomy, complications, and total hospital length of stay (LOS). RESULTS A total of 374 patients were included. Two hundred and forty six patients (66%) underwent early cholecystectomy, 60 (16%) were treated non-operatively and had delayed cholecystectomy, and 68 (18%) were only treated non-operatively. Median time to OR from initial presentation was 38 h [22-63] for early cholecystectomy patients and 69 days [29-116] for the non-operative patients who had delayed cholecystectomy. When comparing both groups, early cholecystectomy patients were younger and were treated more often at site 1. There were no differences in complications during hospitalization, but early cholecystectomy patients had a lower median total LOS (3 [2-5] vs. 5 [4-9], p < 0.001), and they had fewer gallstone-related events after discharge (1 vs. 18%, p < 0.001). On multiple logistic regression analysis, lower age, hospital site and lower risk of concurrent choledocholithiasis were all significantly associated with early cholecystectomy (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Our data supports early cholecystectomy as best practice in management of ACC with no differences in complications during hospitalization, shorter median LOS and fewer gallstone-related events compared to non-operative management. We identified patient and institutional factors associated with early cholecystectomy. This suggests that multiple strategies will be necessary to promote adherence to best practices in the management of ACC within our institution.","Paci, Philippe; Mayo, Nancy E; Kaneva, Pepa A; Fiore, Julio F; Fried, Gerald M; Feldman, Liane S",Surgical endoscopy,381,1

We also reviewed the most recent articles on the subject. RNA and viral receptor proteins expression was observed in numerous anatomical sites, which partially coincides with the information reported in the literature. High expression in testicular cells markedly stood out, and it would be therefore important ruling out whether this anatomical site is a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir; otherwise, germ cell damage, as it is observed in infections with other RNA viruses, should be determined.","López-Romero, Ricardo; Nambo-Lucio, María de Jesús; Salcedo-Carrillo, Emmanuel; Hernández-Cueto, María de Los Ángeles; Salcedo-Vargas, Mauricio",Gaceta medica de Mexico,381,31

Many intensive care units have been understaffed and the majority of nurses working in these units have little experience. OBJECTIVE To describe how the skilled tele-intensive care unit nurses in our health system quickly changed from a patient-focused strategy to a clinician-focused approach during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis. METHODS We modified workflows, deployed home workstations, and changed staffing models with the goal of providing additional clinical support to bedside colleagues while reducing exposure time and conserving personal protective equipment for those caring for this highly contagious patient population. The unit changed focus and granted more than 300 clinicians access to technology that enabled them to care for patients remotely, added nearly 200 mobile carts, and allowed more than 20 tele-intensive care unit nurses to work from home. RESULTS Tele-intensive care unit nursing provided clinical knowledge to the nurses covering current and expanded critical care units. Using technology, virtual rounding, and increased collaboration with nurses, tele-intensive care unit nursing minimized the risk to bedside nurses while maintaining a high level of care for patients. CONCLUSION Tele-intensive care unit nurses provided a proactive, holistic approach to caring for critically ill patients via camera as part of their routine workflow. In addition, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, these nurses created a new strategy in virtual health care to be implemented during a crisis.","Arneson, Sandy L; Tucker, Sara J; Mercier, Marie; Singh, Jaspal",Critical care nurse,381,24

Hence, tissue cells infected with SARS-CoV are unable to launch an IFN response. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells, however, produce high levels of IFN after infection. We recently demonstrated that minute amounts of IFN applied before infection (IFN priming) can ameliorate the IFN response of tissue cells to SARS-CoV. IFN priming of SARS-CoV-infected cells activated genes for IFN transcription, IFN signaling, antiviral effector proteins, ubiquitinylation and ISGylation, antigen presentation, and other cytokines and chemokines, whereas IFN treatment or infection alone had no major effect. Thus, the IFN which is produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells could enable tissue cells to at least partially overturn the SARS-CoV-induced block in innate immune activation.","Kuri, Thomas; Weber, Friedemann",Virulence,381,1

METHODS A total of 90 patients with COVID-19 accompanied with insomnia were randomly divided into an observation group (45 cases, 3 cases dropped off) and a control group (45 cases). In the observation group, baduanjin, a traditional Chinese fitness activity, was practiced everyday. Besides, auricular point sticking therapy was exerted at ear-shenmen (TF 4), subcortex (AT 4), heart (CO 15), occiput (AT 3), etc. These auricular points were pressed and kneaded three times a day, 30 s at each point each time, consecutively for 12 days. In the control group, estazolam tablets were prescribed for oral administration, 1 mg, once daily, consecutively for 12 days. Before and after treatment, the score of Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the score of self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), the score of self-rating depression scale (SDS) and the score of symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were observed in the two groups and the clinical therapeutic effect was evaluated. RESULTS After treatment, the scores of every item and the total scores in PSQI were all reduced as compared with those before treatment in the two groups (P<0.01). The scores of sleep time and sleep efficiency in the observation group were lower than those in the control group after treatment (P<0.05). SAS scores and SDS scores in the observation group and SAS score in the control group after treatment were all reduced as compared with those before treatment (P<0.01), and SDS score in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (P<0.01). After treatment, in the observation group, the score of each of the symptoms of TCM, i.e. unsound sleep, irritability and hot temper, profuse sputum and sticky feeling in the mouth, bitter taste in the mouth and foul breath, abdominal distention and poor appetite, as well as lassitude was reduced as compared with that before treatment successively (P<0.01), and the scores aforementioned (excepted for the unsound sleep) in the observation group were all lower than the control group (P<0.05). The total effective rates were 83.3% (35/42) in the observation group and 84.4% (38/45) in the control group, without statistical difference in comparison (P>0.05). CONCLUSION The combined treatment of baduanjin and auricular point sticking therapy improves sleep quality, the conditions of anxiety and depression and the symptoms in TCM for patients of COVID-19 with insomnia. The therapeutic effect of this combined treatment is better than the oral administration of estazolam.","Yang, Chao; Ma, Yan; Mei, Jun-Hua; Gong, Xue; Wang, Meng; Liu, Kun",Zhongguo zhen jiu = Chinese acupuncture & moxibustion,381,1

Management of emergent groin hernias remains challenging, due to limited consensus in surgical approach and repair options (eg, mesh vs nonmesh, biological mesh, and polypropylene [PP] mesh). Methods. A 5-year retrospective study was conducted on 118 patients who received emergency incarcerated groin hernia repair in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital. The incidence of surgical site infection (SSI), preoperative mortality, sepsis, and ileus was noted. In the follow-up, postoperative foreign body sensation, chronic pain, seroma/hematoma, and recurrence were recorded. The outcomes of different surgical procedures (with mesh/without mesh, biological mesh/PP mesh, transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP)/Lichtenstein repair) were compared and analyzed. Results. Out of the 118 patients, 14 cases received suture repair (as group A); 104 cases had TAPP repair (n = 44) or Lichtenstein repair (n = 60) with meshes, including 23 cases of biological mesh (as group B); and 81 cases had repair with PP mesh (group C). There were no significant differences between the 3 groups regarding SSI, mortality, sepsis, and ileus. After 20.5 months of follow-up (range from 6 to 65 months), 21.4% of group A developed recurrence, a rate significantly higher than that of group B (4.3%) and group C (0). The incidence of seroma/hematoma in group B was higher than that in group A (7.1%) and group C (7.4%). The results between TAPP group and Lichtenstein group were comparable. Conclusion. Tension-free mesh repair in the treatment of emergency incarcerated groin hernia is safe and effective, which can reduce hernia recurrence without increasing infection risk. The results of biological mesh and PP mesh were comparable.","Chen, Fuqiang; Liu, Min; Jin, Cuihong; Wang, Fan; Shen, Yingmo; Zhao, Fenglin; Chen, Jie",Surgical innovation,381,1

We examined this phenomenon in order to understand COVID-19 better. Methods: We observed an older female with COVID-19 and concomitant acquired monocular blindness. The following indicators were monitored during the course of the disease: ocular examinations, flash visual evoked potential examination, a blood test for COVID-19 IgM antibodies, as well as nasopharyngeal swab and tear sample tests for COVID-19 nucleic acid. Results: The patient's visual acuity for the left eye was NLP and the intraocular pressure was 51 mmHg. Keratic precipitates similar to mutton-fat were spread over the corneal endothelium of the left eye. The funduscopic examination of the patient's left eye revealed severe retinal arterial ischemia, and the color of the retina was off-white. Compared to the right eye, the flash visual evoked potential examination revealed a moderate decrease in P2 wave amplitude for the left eye. A blood test was positive for COVID-19 IgM antibodies, and a nasopharyngeal swab test taken for COVID-19 nucleic acid was positive on May 4, 2020. A sample of the patient's tears was taken, and the nucleic acid test for COVID-19 was still positive two weeks later. Conclusions: Our study was the first to find that acute viral retinitis could occur in patients with COVID-19 and severe blindness could be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, physicians should consider the possibility of coronavirus infection in patients with an abnormal fundus or suddenly vision loss.","Liu, Ling; Cai, Danrui; Huang, Xin; Shen, Yin",Current eye research,381,17

The healthcare system has been overwhelmed by the huge number of patients in need of mechanical ventilation or intensive care, resulting in a delay of treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), due to a crash in STEMI networks and closure of a certain number of hub centers, and to a delay in patients' seeking for medical evaluation for chest pain or angina-equivalent symptoms. METHODS in the Trentino region, a mountainous area with about 500,000 inhabitants, very close to Lombardy that was the epicenter of the pandemic in Italy, to avoid these dramatic consequences, we developed a new protocol tailored to our specificity to keep our institution, and above all the cath-lab, clean from the SARS-CoV-2 infection, to ensure full operativity for cardiologic emergencies. RESULTS Applying this protocol during the two months of the peak of the infection in Italy no one of the staff members of the cath-lab, the ICCU or the cardiology ward tested positive to nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and the same result was obtained for all the patients admitted to our units. CONCLUSIONS our real world experience shows that during the COVID-19 pandemic, quick activation of an appropriate protocol defining specific pathways for patients with a medical urgency is effective in minimizing healthcare personnel exposure and to preserve full operativity of the hub centers.

We explore here how TB infection prevention and control (IPC) policies, historically focused on hospitals, are being implemented within primary care facilities. We spoke to 15 policy actors using in-depth interviews about barriers to effective TB-IPC and opportunities for improving implementation. We identified four drivers of poor policy implementation: fragmentation of institutional responsibility and accountability for TB-IPC; struggles by TB-IPC advocates to frame TB-IPC as an urgent and addressable policy problem; barriers to policy innovation from both a lack of evidence as well as a policy environment dependent on 'new' evidence to justify new policy; and the impact of professional medical cultures on the accurate recognition of and response to TB risks. Participants also identified examples of TB-IPC innovation and described conditions necessary for these successes. TB-IPC is a long-standing, complex health systems challenge. As important as downstream practices like mask-wearing and ventilation are, sustained, effective TB-IPC ultimately requires that we better address the upstream barriers to TB-IPC policy formulation and implementation.","Colvin, Christopher J; Kallon, Idriss I; Swartz, Alison; MacGregor, Hayley; Kielmann, Karina; Grant, Alison D",Global public health,381,1

Rearrangement or redeployment of the workforce was reported in 53.3% and 34.1% of laboratories, respectively. The majority of the respondents reported a significant reduction (>10%) in caseload associated with both gynecological (82.0%) and nongynecological specimens (78.4%). Most laboratories reported no significant change in the malignancy rates of both gynecological (67.7%) and nongynecological specimens (58.7%) compared with the same period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS The results of the survey demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant reduction in the number of cytology specimens examined along with the need to implement new biosafety protocols. These findings underscore the need for the worldwide standardization of biosafety protocols and cytology practice.","Wang, Yeh-Han; Bychkov, Andrey; Chakrabarti, Indranil; Jain, Deepali; Liu, Zhiyan; He, Shurong; Hanum, Sitti Fatimah; Bakrin, Ikmal; Templo, Felipe; Nguyen, Truong; Kumarasinghe, Priyanthi; Jung, Chan Kwon; Kakudo, Kennichi; Chen, Chien-Chin",Cancer cytopathology,381,1

Endotracheal intubation is one of the procedures mostly generating aerosol and, therefore, requiring full protection of medical personnel against the infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this paper, basing on a literature review, the recommended intubation procedure is presented together with recommendations for personal protection during intubation. Additionally, a proposal of a simple and cheap protective barrier is described against spreading aerosol outside the intubation area. The aim was to propose a simple and cheap method to increase the safety of medical personnel performing AGPs in patients infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, which could be easily introduced into clinical practice. RESULTS The presented method is the authors' own idea, based on their experience gathered from working in an operating room. Judging from their clinical experience, the presented method is effective and safe for patients. CONCLUSIONS Endotracheal intubation is one of the most common AGPs and adequate actions must be taken in order to protect medical personnel against the infection and to prevent the spreading of aerosol around the intubation area. The proposed barrier is easy to set with disposable materials and standard equipment available in every operating room.","Gaszynski, Tomasz; Fedorczak, Michał; Pondel, Jakub",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,381,1

Despite decades of telemedicine in clinical practice, it is rare to find it used in small-metro and academic settings. Following the decision to limit face-to-face care, we tracked our practice's transition to telemedicine. METHODS This was a prospective quality improvement project following Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to optimize the use of telemedicine (both telephone and video in this practice) encounters. Central to the PDSA cycles was the use of a post-encounter questionnaire to track patient, appointment, and physician factors. Throughout the cycles, inferential statistics were used to inform process improvement. RESULTS In Cycle 2, a logistic regression model showed length of encounter, need for physical examination, and physician satisfaction correctly predicted a physician's preferred medium (χ2(3) = 40.56, P < .001). In Cycle 3, a χ2 test showed the reason for visit predicted the preferred medium (χ2(4) = 47.30, P < .001). In cycle 4, week of telemedicine, need for physical examination, length of encounter and physician satisfaction predicted the preferred medium (χ2(9) = 172.52, P < .001). DISCUSSION Using the variables that predicted preference for telemedicine, we were able to adjust our processes through PDSA cycles. CONCLUSION Early use of the PDSA cycle allows for informed quality improvement at the local level. Our findings highlight factors to consider when implementing telemedicine such as need for physical examination and type or length of encounter. In addition, physician satisfaction can encourage use of telemedicine, and tools for learning and practicing telemedicine should be available.","Silver, Sabrina L; Lewis, Meghan N; Ledford, Christy J W",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,381,1

The use of zero-valent nanoparticles have been arisen as a highly effective method due to the high specific surface area of zero-valent nanoparticles. Then, the development of nanosized materials in general, and the improvement of the properties of the nano-iron in particular, has facilitated their application in remediation technologies. As the result, highly efficient and versatile nanomaterials have been obtained. Among the possible nanoparticle systems, the reactivity and availability of zero-valent iron nanoparticles (NZVI) have achieved very interesting and promising results make them particularly attractive for the remediation of subsurface contaminants. In fact, a large number of laboratory and pilot studies have reported the high effectiveness of these NZVI-based technologies for the remediation of groundwater and contaminated soils. Although the results are often based on a limited contaminant target, there is a large gap between the amount of contaminants tested with NZVI at the laboratory level and those remediated at the pilot and field level.

These gels are surprisingly soft due to loop formation at the expense of bridges between physical junctions. Molecular-level evidence of loop formation is provided by strong fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) between distinct chromophores placed at the C- and N-termini of labelled chains diluted in an excess of unlabelled chains. The tendency to form loops originates from the compact size of the random coil midblock (mean RH(C10)≈ 20 Å, determined from quasi-elastic light scattering of C10), and is facilitated by the ability of the leucine zipper domains to form antiparallel aggregates. Although the aggregation number of the leucine zipper domains is small (tetrameric, determined from multi-angle static light scattering of AC10 diblock), the average center-to-center distance between aggregates is roughly 1.5 times the average end-to-end distance of the C10 domain in a 7% w/v network. To avoid stretching the C10 domain, the chains tend to form loops. Changes in pH or ionic strength that expand the polyelectrolyte midblock favor bridging, leading to greater G'∞ as long as leucine zipper endblocks do not dissociate. Understanding of the network structure provided successful design strategies to increase the rigidity of these hydrogels. In contrast to intuitive design concepts for rubber and gel materials, it was shown that increasing either the length or the charge density of the midblock increases rigidity, because fewer chains are wasted in loop formation.","Shen, Wei; Kornfield, Julia A; Tirrell, David A",Soft matter,381,1

Abstract Introduction An evidence gap persists concerning the impact of extreme socio-structural disadvantage, such as homelessness, on the nature and effectiveness of coping with severe mental illness (SMI). While existing reviews of qualitative research into homelessness have focused on processes such as escaping homelessness and managing concurrent problem substance use, as well as on the experiences of specific vulnerable groups such as women and youth, no analogical review has been dedicated to understanding the management of SMI during an episode of homelessness. Aim/Question A qualitative metasynthesis of first-person accounts was conducted to understand how individuals cope with SMI when experiencing homelessness. Method The systematic search strategy yielded 481 potentially eligible sources. Following the team-based full-text screening and the two-tiered quality appraisal, 14 studies involving 377 participants with lived experience were synthesized following Noblit and Hare's metaethnographic method. Results Seven third-order concepts were derived capturing the complex nature and processual character of coping, as well as the web of contextual influences upon coping strategies. The resultant line-of-argument synthesis reveals the dialectical relationship between the two higher-order constructs-""the continuum of coping"" and ""the assemblage of disadvantage."" Discussion Despite the profoundly adverse impacts of biographical and socio-structural conditions, many individuals mobilized internal and external resources to enable various coping processes. Coping in the context of multiple disadvantage is not a monolith but rather a multidimensional, contingent and fluid phenomenon. Implications for practice Nursing practice should espouse a humanizing, structurally competent, and strength- and meaning-oriented approach in order to meet the complex and multifaceted needs of such multiply disadvantaged persons.","Karadzhov, Dimitar; Yuan, Yeqing; Bond, Lynden",Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing,381,8

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a 10-week randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose (duloxetine 60/120 mg/day), placebo-controlled trial that enrolled adult outpatients who had persistent moderate pain (≥4 on a 0-10 numerical rating scale) due to OA of the knee, despite, per protocol, having received optimized oral NSAID therapy (specific drug, dose, and frequency at investigator discretion). CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT01018680. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Patients entered daily pain ratings in a telephone-based diary. The primary efficacy outcome was the weekly mean of the daily average pain rating at week 8. Safety outcomes were assessed during the entire 10-week study. RESULTS A total of 524 patients randomly received duloxetine 60/120 mg/day (N = 264) or placebo (N = 260). In total, 74% of the patients completed the study. Mean age was 61 years (SD 9.2), 57% were female, and 81% were white. Duloxetine-treated patients had significantly greater pain reduction at week 8 (p < 0.001) than placebo-treated patients. In addition, relative to placebo at week 8, duloxetine-treated patients had significant improvements in physical function as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (p < 0.001), and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (p < 0.001). Compared to placebo, significantly more nausea, dry mouth, constipation, fatigue and decreased appetite were reported by patients taking duloxetine (each p < 0.05). Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred more commonly in the duloxetine group than the placebo group (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION Duloxetine added to oral NSAID therapy provided additional significant pain reduction, improved function, and patient-rated impression of improvement. Adverse events were consistent with those seen in previous duloxetine trials. The short duration of the study may not reflect the longer term efficacy and safety of NSAID/duloxetine cotherapy.","Frakes, Elijah P; Risser, R C; Ball, T D; Hochberg, M C; Wohlreich, M M",Current medical research and opinion,381,16

Early reports of this infection due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) consisted of mostly adult patients. As the outbreak spreads rapidly beyond the epicentre of Wuhan, it becomes clear that infants and children of all ages are susceptible to this infection. In China, there have been more than 1200 paediatric cases. Most paediatric patients acquire the infection through household contact with infected adults. The disease in children is usually self-limiting and most infected children will recover uneventfully within 7-10 days. Other than symptoms of the respiratory tract, many children may present with gastrointestinal symptoms. Older children are more likely to have asymptomatic infection. Although deaths related to SARS-CoV-2 are rarely reported in the paediatric age group, young children and those with underlying medical conditions are more likely to develop severe illness. Only a small fraction of neonates born to infected mother would acquire the virus by vertical transmission. Because a large proportion of children and adolescents may have asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection, children are likely to play an important role in community transmission of this infection. Screening of children who have a definitive contact history will facilitate early diagnosis and isolation of all infected children. This review summarises the lessons learned in China with regard to the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the paediatric population.","Lu, Xiaoxia; Xing, Yuhan; Wong, Gary Wing-Kin",Archives of disease in childhood,381,5

Design: Using a cross-sectional study design, we used shotgun next-generation sequencing (NGS) to evaluate microbiome composition and diversity in both patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed infections presenting to Ventura Clinical Trials for care from March 2020 through January 2021 and SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative exposed controls. Patients were classified as being asymptomatic or having mild, moderate, or severe symptoms based on NIH criteria.1 Exposed controls were individuals with prolonged or repeated close contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or their samples, e.g. household members of patients or frontline healthcare workers. Microbiome diversity and composition were compared between patients and exposed controls and across patient subgroups at all taxonomic levels. Results: There were 52 patients and 20 controls.

Additionally, there was an inverse association between disease severity and both bacterial diversity and Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium abundance. Conclusion: We hypothesize that low bacterial diversity and depletion of Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium genera either before or after infection led to reduced pro-immune function, thereby allowing SARS-CoV-2 infection to become symptomatic.

To investigate the genomic underpinnings of unique bat adaptations, we sequenced the genomes of the Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) and the Mesoamerican mustached bat (Pteronotus mesoamericanus) and compared them to a diverse collection of 13 additional bat species together with other mammals. We used the Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read platform to generate highly complete assemblies (N50: 28-29Mb) and facilitate analysis of complex genomic regions containing duplicated genes. Using gene family size analysis, we found that the type I interferon locus was contracted by eight genes in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of bats, shifting the proportion of interferon-ω to interferon-α and making interferon-ω the most common type I interferon in bats. Antiviral genes stimulated by type I interferons were also rapidly evolving, with interferon-induced transmembrane genes experiencing a lineage-specific duplication and strong positive selection in the gene IFIT2. Moreover, the lineage of phyllostomid bats showed an unprecedented expansion of PRDM9, a recombination-related gene also involved in infection responses, raising the possibility that this gene contributes to bat antiviral defenses. These modifications in the bat innate immune system may be important adaptations allowing them to harbor viruses asymptomatically. We additionally found evidence of positive selection on the branch leading to the MRCA of bats acting on 33 tumor suppressors and six DNA repair genes, which may contribute to the low cancer rates and longevity observed across bats. These new genomic resources enable insights into the extraordinary adaptations of bats, with implications for mammalian evolutionary studies and public health.","Scheben, Armin; Mendivil Ramos, Olivia; Kramer, Melissa; Goodwin, Sara; Oppenheim, Sara; Becker, Daniel J; Schatz, Michael C; Simmons, Nancy B; Siepel, Adam; McCombie, W Richard",bioRxiv,381,1

The initial radiological findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia at the early stage on a computed tomography (CT) scan include multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial inflammation, predominantly distributed in the peripheral one-third of the lungs. Gradually, it develops into multiple ground glass opacities and infiltrates in the lungs. Furthermore, pulmonary consolidation is observed, but pleural effusion is rare. Objective From time of presentation to complete recovery, CT scans show significant morphological changes in the lesions, but very few literatures have reported cavitary lesion in the lungs. We present the case of a 64-year-old patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who had typical manifestations of the disease on a CT scan along with constantly changing small cavity in the lung. Discussion Delayed cavitation is a rarely described radiological manifestation of COVID-19. Atypical presentations of COVID-19 raise possibility of other infections or additional diagnoses. Bacterial and fungal infection should be excluded, as well as cavity-causing organisms. Although the proper mechanism of cavitation in COVID-19 pneumonia is not known, it may be due to intra- alveolar hemorrhage, diffuse alveolar damage, and necrosis of parenchymal cells based on findings of autopsy reports. Early and late complications associated with COVID-19 are yet to be defined. Conclusion Common causes of cavitary lesions must be investigated properly in all patients. Most cases are self-limited hence managed conservatively. The clinical spectrum of disease due to COVID-19 continues to evolve. Physicians must be aware of evolving radiological findings of COVID-19 and must conduct regular follow-up of convalescent patients with COVID-19 to ensure complete recovery.","Behera, D.; Subhankar, S.; Venkataram, R.; Jagaty, S.

This work assessed the response of a intensive care mechanical ventilator to CPR using a patient manikin ventilated in three conventional modes. Methods: Volume controlled (VCV), pressure controlled (PCV) and pressure regulated volume controlled (PRVC) ventilation were applied in a thorax physical model with or without chest compressions. The mechanical ventilator was set with inspiratory time of 1.0 s, ventilation rate of 10 breaths/minute, positive end-expiratory pressure of 0 cmH2O, FiO2 of 1.0, target tidal volume of 600 ml and trigger level of -20 cmH2O. Airway opening pressure and ventilatory flow signals were continuously recorded. . Results: Chest compression resulted in increased airway peak pressure in all ventilation modes (p<0.001), specially with VCV (137% in VCV, 83% in PCV, 80% in PRVC). However, these pressures were limited to levels similar to release valves in manual resuscitators (~60 cmH2O). In pressure controlled modes tidal/minute volumes decreased (PRVC=11%, p=0.027 and PCV=12%, p<0.001), while still within the variability observed during bag-valve-mask ventilation. During VCV, variation in tidal/minute volumes were not significant (p=0.140). Respiratory rates were constant with and without chest compression. Conclusions: A intensive care mechanical ventilator could provide adequate ventilation during compressions in a manikin model while using conventional ventilation modes.","Neumamm, L. B. d.

Consequently, public sentiment is likely to fluctuate during this change, influencing the best course of action. The detection of public sentiment can help the service of various industries and the governmentx2019;s subsequent formulation of measures and policies. In recent times, social media has become a prevalent way for the public to express emotions and opinions. Therefore, sentiment analysis of social media texts may detect and provide a valuable indication of public sentiment. We present Senti-COVID19, an interactive visual analytic system for reflecting and analyzing public sentiment and detecting sentiment fluctuation triggers on social media. Compared to other visual analytic tools, Senti-COVID19 focuses on sentiment analysis of COVID-19 related tweets and classifies them based on the dominant sentiment category. The system emphasizes analyzing tweets that mainly discuss the epidemic situation with keywords and hashtags related to COVID-19. Senti-COVID19 adopts lexicon-based sentiment analysis to divulge the public sentiment to COVID-19 events, employing libraries to extract keywords and statistics for providing detailed information. In addition, it offers visualization views for presenting the analysis results and extracted information.We design evaluations and a usage scenario, which we used to assess the effectiveness of Senti-COVID19. The results show that Senti-COVID19 can effectively analyze sentiment from social media text and provide interactive visual analysis for users to explore derived data and identify insights from the front-end.

It relies on the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for the detection of target analytes in the liquid phase. There are many research studies reporting the application of MPS for detecting a variety of analytes including viruses, toxins, nucleic acids, and so forth. Herein, we report a modified version of the MPS platform with the addition of a one-stage lock-in design to remove the feedthrough signals induced by external driving magnetic fields, thus capturing only MNP responses for improved system sensitivity. This one-stage lock-in MPS system is able to detect as low as 781 ng multi-core Nanomag50 iron oxide MNPs (micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH) and 78 ng single-core SHB30 iron oxide MNPs (Ocean NanoTech). We first demonstrated the performance of this MPS system for bioassay-related applications. Using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a model, we have achieved a detection limit of 125 nM (equal to 5 pmole) for detecting spike protein molecules in the liquid phase. In addition, using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a proof-of-concept, we show that these single-core SHB30 MNPs can be used for Brownian relaxation-based bioassays while the multi-core Nanomag50 cannot be used. The effects of MNP amount on the concentration-dependent response profiles for detecting streptavidin were also investigated. Results show that by using a lower concentration/amount of MNPs, concentration-response curves shift to a lower concentration/amount of target analytes. This lower concentration-response indicates the possibility of improved bioassay sensitivities by using lower amounts of MNPs.","Chugh, V. K.; Wu, K.; Krishna, V. D.; di Girolamo, A.; Bloom, R.

The opinions of experts from different countries of the world on the consequences of coronavirus disease depending on racial, ethnic, age differences and delivery time. Immunological and hormonal protection during pregnancy against viral influences is noted. In the context of a pandemic, the number of premature births (for various reasons) and the birth of children with low birth weight significantly increased, but their relationship with COVID-19 infection has not been proven. Risk factors for the hospitalization of pregnant woman infected with COVID-19 are high body mass index, obesity and concomitant diseases (diabetes mellitus, hypertension. Women in older reproductive age also need hospitalization more often. During pregnancy, innate and adaptive immune responses shift from an inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory phenotype to prevent affection of the fetus and promote passive transmission of maternal antibodies to the fetus. These COVID-19 protection effects are largely mediated by estradiol and progesterone. New data on the impact of COVID-19 on erythropoiesis, hemoglobin and ferritin levels are presented, and risk groups of a more severe course of the disease are identified: elderly adults, patients, patients with arterial hypertension, obesity and diabetes mellitus, pregnant women, patients with primary and acquired immunodeficiency, with oppression of the hematopoiesis, HIV-infected and with cancer.

This effect could be enhanced by mutations in positions 417, 484 and 493 (especially K417N, E484K, Q493K and Q493R), and to a lesser extent by mutations in positions 486 and 499 (such as F486L and P499T). Such enhancements due to more favourable binding interactions with residues on the complementary angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interface, are however, unlikely to sustain mouse infectivity on their own based on theoretical and experimental evidence to date. Our current understanding thus points to the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants of concern infecting mice, while Delta and ‘Delta Plus’ lack a similar biomolecular basis to do so. This paper identifies a list of countries where local field surveillance of mice is encouraged because they may have come in contact with humans who had the virus with adaptive mutation(s).

To fill this niche, this article uses critical discourse analysis to investigate how China’s state-run media resisted what it deemed to be undue foreign hostility towards China over the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Based on an analysis of 63 reports in China’s English-language news media, the article finds that the Chinese media developed a discourse of resistance via three main strategies: enemification, victimisation and heroisation. These strategies draw on a variety of linguistic mechanisms, specifically argumentative topoi, nominations, predications and metaphors. The discourse of resistance constructed by the Chinese media has implications for how nationalism and humanitarianism are practised and promoted in China. The article shows that the state-run media constructed a discourse of resistance as part of China’s response to the COVID crisis, to help shape China’s national image and to convey its geopolitical messages to the world.

In Brazil, municipalities were empowered to define regulatory measures, potentially resulting in diverse effects on CVD morbimortality. Objective: To analyse the impact of COVID-19 pandemics on CVD outcomes in Belo Horizonte (BH), the 6th greater capital city in Brazil, including: mortality, mortality at home, hospitalizations, intensive care unit utilization, and in-hospital mortality; and the differential effect according to sex, age range, social vulnerability, and pandemics phase. Methods: Ecological study analysing data from the Mortality and Hospital Information System of BH residents aged [≥]30 years. CVD was defined as in Chapter IX from ICD-10. Social vulnerability was classified by a composite socioeconomic index as high, medium and low. The observed age-standardized rates for epidemiological weeks 10-48, 2020, were compared to the expected rates (mean of 2015-2019). Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test differences, and risk ratios with their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. National demographic estimates was used to calculate rates. Results: We found no changes in CVD mortality rates (RiR 1.01, 95%CI 0.96-1.06). However, CVD deaths occurred more at homes (RiR 1.32, 95%CI 1.20-1.46) than in hospitals (RiR 0.89, 95%CI 0.79-0.99), as a result of a substantial decline in hospitalization rates, even though proportional in-hospital deaths increased. The rise in home deaths was greater in older adults and in had an increasing gradient in those more socially vulnerable (RiR 1.45); for high (RiR 1.45), medium (RiR 1.32) and low vulnerability (RiR 1.21). Conclusion: The greater occurrence of CVD deaths at home, in parallel with lower hospitalization rates, suggests that CVD care was disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemics, which more adversely affected older and more socially vulnerable individuals, exacerbating health inequities in BH.","Brant, L.

Given the vulnerabilities of LGBTQ+ populations, it is important for researchers to identify pandemic-related stressors that may affect the psychological and physiological well-being of LGBTQ+ people and how coping and resilience strategies may mitigate or buffer the negative psychological effects of pandemic-related stressors. The present study was conducted to identify ways that researchers and helping professionals may intervene to support LGBTQ+ people during the pandemic. The study was cross-sectional and survey based, and it included 220 participants from the United States who self-identified as LGBTQ+. Using a moderated mediation model, the researchers evaluated whether resilience moderates the association between pandemic concerns and general anxiety symptoms when anxiety is included as a mediator of the effect of pandemic concerns on physiological symptoms of distress. The primary hypothesis, that higher levels of resilience would weaken the effect of pandemic concerns on anxiety, was supported and the full model was significant, F(3, 216) = 27.98, p < .001. These findings indicate that resilience buffers the negative effect of COVID-19 pandemic concerns on anxiety and other health indicators. Implications for helping professionals and advocates are discussed, particularly regarding ways that resilience may be harnessed as a way to buffer the impact of pandemic concerns on already elevated rates of distress in LGBTQ+ populations.","Goldbach, C.; Knutson, D.; Milton, D.

Methods: A validated questionnaire comprising three parts was distributed to all critical care respiratory therapists registered with the Saudi Society for Respiratory Care through the official social networks. Results: A total of 74 respiratory therapists completed the survey. The mean (±standard deviation) of intensive care unit beds was 67 ± 79. Clinical presentation (54%) and arterial blood gas (38%) were the two main diagnostic tools used to initiate ventilatory support. While protocols for the initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV;81%) were widely available, participants had limited availability of protocols for the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV;34%) and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC;34%). In mild cases of COVID-19, most respondents used HFNC (57%), while IMV was mostly used in moderate (43%) and severe (93%) cases. Regular ventilator check was mostly done every 4 h (57%).

To study the humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV, the authors evaluated IgG and IgM specific antibodies in patients' sera. METHODS Two methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA), were used to detect specific serum IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV in 98 SARS patients and 250 controls consisting of patients with pneumonia, health-care professionals and healthy subjects. The serum antibody profiles were investigated at different times over one and a half years in 18 of the SARS patients. RESULTS The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA for detecting IgG against SARS-CoV were 100.0% and 97.2% and for IgM 89.8% and 97.6% respectively; the figures using IFA for IgG were 100.0% and 100.0% and for IgM 81.8% and 100.0% respectively. During the first seven days of the antibodies trace test, no IgG and IgM were detected, but on day 15, IgG response increased dramatically, reaching a peak on day 60, remaining high up to day 180 and decreasing gradually until day 540. On day 15, IgM was detected, rapidly reached a peak, then declined gradually until day 180 when IgM was undetectable.

This study evaluates the first year with POS at Kolding Hospital, the Southern Region of Denmark. METHODS All apparently healthy newborns were offered POS few hours postpartum. Both pre- and post-ductal POS were carried out using a well-known protocol and registered as POS approved; POS repeated and approved; or POS not approved, paediatrician called. Paediatricians registered clinical data, and general experiences regarding POS were collected. RESULTS POS was performed in 2,855 newborns; 2,715 were approved immediately, 81 were repeated. Paediatric assistance was required for 59 newborns; 16 could stay in the maternity ward following assessment, while 18 were admitted for observation until their saturation normalised. One newborn had CCHD, while ten had other conditions needing treatment and 14 had more benign respiratory disorders. One sick newborn would not have been picked up by post-ductal screening only. No midwives performing the screening and no parents refrained from POS.

Methods The authors examined results of PPA (Positive Percent Agreement, sensitivity) and NPA (Negative Percent Agreement, specificity) from 73 laboratory experiments for molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 as reported to the FIND database, and for two manufacturers' claims in FDA EUA submissions.PPA and NPA were converted to likelihood ratios to calculate post-test probability of disease based on clinical opinion of pre-test probability. Confidence intervals were based on the number of samples tested. An online calculator was created to help clinicians identify false-positive, or false-negative SARS-CoV-2 test results for COVID-19 disease. Results Laboratory results from the same test methods did not mirror each other or the manufacturer. Laboratory studies showed PPA from 17% to 100% and NPA from 70.4% to 100%.

Efforts have been undertaken for the development of minimally invasive techniques that reduce tissue trauma and offer improved cosmetic results, one of such being the single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). AIM To present a minimally invasive technique for appendectomy (SILS) undertaken with conventional instruments. METHOD Eleven patients were treated in the emergency care center presenting abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa that was suggestive of appendicitis. Diagnostic investigation was subsequently conducted, including physical examination, laboratory and imaging exams (CT scan with intravenous contrast or total abdominal ultrasound), and the results were consistent with acute appendicitis. Thus, after consent, these patients underwent SILS appendectomy under general anesthesia with three trocars (two 10 mm and one 5 mm), using conventional and optical laparoscopic tweezers (10 mm, 30º). The base and pedicle of the appendix were ligated with titanium LT 400 clips. The procedure occurred uneventfully. Inclusion criteria were absence of diffuse peritonitis, BMI (body mass index) less than 35 and absence of serious comorbidities or sepsis. RESULTS Seven men and four women were operated with average age of 25.7 years and underwent appendectomy through this technique. Mean procedure duration was of 37.2 min. Regarding surgical findings, three had appendicitis in stage 1, four in stage 2 and four in stage 3. All patients improved well, without surgical complications, and did not require conversion to open surgery or conventional laparoscopy technique. CONCLUSION Appendectomy conducted through Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery is a feasible and promising technique that can be performed with conventional laparoscopic instruments.","Pinheiro, Rodrigo Nascimento; Sousa, Renato Costa; Castro, Fernanda Mesquita de Brito; Almeida, Roberta Oliveira de; Gouveia, Gustavo de Castro; Oliveira, Viviane Rezende de",Arquivos brasileiros de cirurgia digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian archives of digestive surgery,381,33

Optimal care during the COVID-19 outburst required rapid adjustment to changes, ensuring staff and patients' safety while maintaining close and direct contact with patients. OBJECTIVES To explore obstetricians' experiences during the first outburst, focusing on their challenges, needs and ways of coping. METHODS Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted online with 13 senior physicians and residents (7 women, 6 men) from four hospitals, who worked in obstetrics. The interviews were analyzed using the Immersion/Crystallization method developed in medicine focused on their experiences. RESULTS The findings revealed that alongside the impressive mobilization of the teams during this period, physicians encountered various challenges. These included being overwhelmed with the ever-changing and often conflicting guidelines; a feeling of lack of transparency and loss of trust in the system that did not always protect them nor provided their basic needs; difficulty in maintaining daily needed routines, such as communication within the team; dealing with patients' and their families anxiety; and striving to maintain a positive childbirth atmosphere along with having to set boundaries and keep distance. The teams felt the need for training in dealing with patients' and staff's emotional needs as well as finding ways to maintain a professional-friendly relationship among team members. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 period forced obstetricians to change procedures and conduct themselves differently. They demonstrated a great commitment to assuring that women have a positive childbirth experience, even within the limitations of COVID. They experienced great difficulty as they themselves were dealing with fears of the virus, distancing from others, and addressing new emerging needs. DISCUSSION Reports from around the world and the findings of the current study indicate the importance of developing processes that will enhance physicians' and patients' trust, to allow physicians to feel safe and cared for and to be able to provide high-quality care Identifying the challenges, needs and strengths of the medical teams can help in dealing with this and future pandemics. This requires caring for physicians, as individuals, as family members, as team members, along with provision of training that can help them communicate well to provide high-quality safe care.","Karnieli-Miller, Orit; Maymon, Ron; Benyamini, Yael",Harefuah,381,24

Three viral proteases cleave these precursors into 12 nonstructural proteins, which direct both genome replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription. Immunofluorescence assays showed that most EAV replicase subunits localize to membranes in the perinuclear region of the infected cell. Using replicase-specific antibodies and cryoimmunoelectron microscopy, unusual double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) were identified as the probable site of EAV RNA synthesis. These DMVs were previously observed in cells infected with different arteriviruses but were never implicated in viral RNA synthesis. Extensive electron microscopic analysis showed that they appear to be derived from paired endoplasmic reticulum membranes and that they are most likely formed by protrusion and detachment of vesicular structures with a double membrane. Interestingly, very similar membrane rearrangements were observed upon expression of ORF1a-encoded replicase subunits nsp2 to nsp7 from an alphavirus-based expression vector. Apparently, the formation of a membrane-bound scaffold for the replication complex is a distinct step in the arterivirus life cycle, which is directed by the ORF1a protein and does not depend on other viral proteins and/or EAV-specific RNA synthesis.","Pedersen, K W; van der Meer, Y; Roos, N; Snijder, E J",Journal of virology,381,19

To investigate the potential of these molecules to provide protection against enteric infections when supplied orally, SIPs were generated against Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a highly pathogenic porcine virus. Different variants of TGEV-specific SIPs were created, of epsilon and alpha isotypes, by exploiting the dimerizing domains epsilonCH4 and alphaCH3 of human and swine origin. Transfected cells secreted these recombinant mini-antibodies efficiently, mainly as dimers stabilized covalently by inter-chain disulphide bridges. The specificity and functionality of the recombinant TGEV-specific SIPs were determined by in vitro binding, neutralization and infection-interference assays. The neutralization indices of the TGEV-specific SIPs were all very similar to that of the original TGEV-specific mAb, thus confirming that the immunological properties have been preserved in the recombinant SIPs. In vivo protection experiments on newborn piglets have, in addition, demonstrated a strong reduction of virus titre in infected tissues of animals treated orally with TGEV-specific SIPs. It has therefore been demonstrated that it is possible to confer passive immunization to newborn pigs by feeding them with recombinant SIPs.","Bestagno, Marco; Sola, Isabel; Dallegno, Eliana; Sabella, Patricia; Poggianella, Monica; Plana-Durán, Juan; Enjuanes, Luis; Burrone, Oscar R",The Journal of general virology,381,1

Ultrastructurally, BGP was localized to microfilaments of the fuzzy coat of the columnar cells at the luminal surface and the upper crypts. Additionally, BGP was found in cryptal caveolated cells. The results are consistent with primary transcriptional regulation of BGP production and suggest that BGP synthesis is controlled by the degree of cytodifferentiation.

The objective of this study was to compare NAVA and pressure support ventilation (PSV) in the early phase of weaning from mechanical ventilation. METHODS A multicentre randomized controlled trial of 128 intubated adults recovering from acute respiratory failure was conducted in 11 intensive care units. Patients were randomly assigned to NAVA or PSV. The primary outcome was the probability of remaining in a partial ventilatory mode (either NAVA or PSV) throughout the first 48 h without any return to assist-control ventilation. Secondary outcomes included asynchrony index, ventilator-free days and mortality. RESULTS In the NAVA and PSV groups respectively, the proportion of patients remaining in partial ventilatory mode throughout the first 48 h was 67.2 vs. 63.3 % (P = 0.66), the asynchrony index was 14.7 vs. 26.7 % (P < 0.001), the ventilator-free days at day 7 were 1.0 day [1.0-4.0] vs. 0.0 days [0.0-1.0] (P < 0.01), the ventilator-free days at day 28 were 21 days [4-25] vs. 17 days [0-23] (P = 0.12), the day-28 mortality rate was 15.0 vs. 22.7 % (P = 0.21) and the rate of use of post-extubation noninvasive mechanical ventilation was 43.5 vs. 66.6 % (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS NAVA is safe and feasible over a prolonged period of time but does not increase the probability of remaining in a partial ventilatory mode. However, NAVA decreases patient-ventilator asynchrony and is associated with less frequent application of post-extubation noninvasive mechanical ventilation.

The expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), migration inhibitory factor (MIF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor, collagen I and human fibroblast collagenase 1 were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. VAC significantly increased the expression of ICAM-1, MIF, VEGF and collagen I compared with that induced by CWC at the protein and mRNA levels. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that VAC therapy is an effective method for treating severe traumatic wounds, as it increases the expression of cytokines in wounds.

Public awareness of the potential seriousness of influenza was heightened by media coverage of pandemic-associated hospitalizations and deaths, especially among younger persons. In the fall, the distribution of two separate influenza vaccines began, with distinct, although overlapping, recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). In addition, 2009-10 was the first full season in which ACIP's recommendation to vaccinate all children aged 5--18 years was implemented. To provide preliminary state-specific estimates of seasonal influenza vaccination coverage, CDC analyzed Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) data collected during October 2009-February 2010. By January 31, estimated state seasonal influenza vaccination coverage among persons aged >or=6 months ranged from 30.3% to 54.5% (median: 40.6%). Median coverage was 41.2% for children aged 6 months-17 years, 38.3% for adults aged 18--49 years with high-risk conditions, 28.8% for adults aged 18-49 years without high-risk conditions, 45.5% for adults aged 50-64 years, and 69.3% for adults aged >or=65 years. These results, compared with the previous season, suggest large increases in coverage for children and a moderate increase for adults aged 18-49 years without high-risk conditions. Health departments should identify best practices that lead to higher vaccination coverage and should support effective vaccination services (e.g., school-located vaccination programs and office-based protocols, such as reminder/recall and standing orders).",,MMWR.

These are performed in two phases: Stage A (written examination) and Stage B (the final Board oral examination). The COVID-19 pandemic started in Israel a few weeks before the scheduled spring 2020 Stage B exams and had a major impact, not only on the health and economic systems in Israel, but also on the residency exams. AIMS To describe the efforts of the Israeli Scientific Council to execute the spring 2020 Stage B exams during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to the worldwide data, and to deduce the appropriate management during potential future crises. METHODS We present a description of the activity of the Israeli Scientific Council since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic according to documents and other sources, An internet search was conducted on the destiny of residency examinations throughout the world, and a comparison between them. RESULTS Due to rapid worsening in the restrictions enforced in Israel, the spring 2020 oral board exams were cancelled. However, a decision was made to execute them in the summer. This new schedule dictated a delay in the schedule of other residency examinations and forced condensation of 5 periods into 10 months instead of 14. The examination team prepared the new summer exams period under the assumption that heavy restrictions will still be implemented. Indeed, COVID-19 was still around and the restrictions were still enforced. Despite that, all oral Board examinations were perfectly executed. This contrasts with the rest of the world, in which most residency exams were cancelled, even without a solution or an alternative date. CONCLUSIONS Recruitment of all involved and preparation for the worst-case scenario enabled the perfect execution of the previously cancelled exams, and will enable the execution of future residency exams under conditions of potential health or war crises. DISCUSSION To the best of our knowledge, the Israeli Scientific Council is the only communal body in the world which organized an alternative period for the cancelled oral exams, only 4 months after the cancelled dates. Due to an enormous effort and rigorous preparations, Israel is also the only place in which oral exams were successfully executed, physically, under an active disease and very heavy restrictions.","Eliashar, Ron; Fishbain, Dana; Paret, Gidi; Kashtan, Hanoch",Harefuah,381,17

The antigen was cell-associated except in the late phase of the infection, when a low amount (4 micrograms per 10(6) cells) was released in the culture supernatant. The cell-associated antigen consisted of 2 polypeptides of 160 K and 175 K, respectively. The 160 K polypeptide comigrated with the authentic S' precursor from PRCV-infected cells. The 175 K polypeptide had the same mobility as the authentic mature S protein from PRCV-infected cells and from PRCV released in the supernatant. The extracellular recombinant antigen corresponded with the 175 K mature protein.

MATERIALS AND METHOD Front-faced fluorescence measurement was used to determine adhesion of fluorescent polystyrene microspheres with different surface functional groups. Contact angle measurements and sticking bubble technique were used to measure relative surface hydrophobicity of the polymers. RESULTS Adhesion of fluorescent polystyrene microspheres using front-faced fluorescence measurement revealed the hydrophobic phospholipid lining of the in vitro gastric mucus model did not allow adhesion of microspheres with -COOH and -NH(2) functional groups, whereas it did allow adhesion of microspheres with hydrophobic attributes. In addition, in vitro adhesive force studies using diblock copolymers of polystyrene and polyacrylate showed that the in vitro adhesive force between the hydrophobic phospholipid lining of the in vitro gastric mucus model and the polymer increased when the surface hydrophobicity of the polymer increased. CONCLUSION The hydrophobic phospholipid acts as an adhesion barrier to hydrophilic bioadhesive polymers and polymers with surface functional groups of carboxylic acid and amine.

Different herd factors were examined as potential risk indicators for the percentage of pigs with antibodies against the 4 pathogens. The median within-herd seroprevalences of the pathogens were: Mh 76%, H1N1 100%, H3N2 40% and ADV 53%. There was a positive association between the seroprevalences of both influenza viruses, and a negative association between the seroprevalences of ADV and H1N1. The percentage of pigs seropositive for Mh increased with the purchase of gilts and with the season (slaughter date in March-April). The within-herd seroprevalences of both influenza viruses were higher in the case of a higher density of pig herds in the municipality. A higher number of fattening pigs per pen additionally increased the risk of being seropositive for H3N2. The percentage of pigs with anti-gE-antibodies against the wild type ADV increased with higher airspace stocking density in the finishing unit, increasing herd size, increasing number of pig herds in the municipality and slaughter date in March-April. Increased seroprevalences for these 4 respiratory pathogens were mostly associated with pig density in the herd and its vicinity, the winter period, and with the purchase of gilts. Purchase of gilts, number of fattening pigs per pen and airspace stocking density are risk factors that can be managed directly by farmers striving to attain a high respiratory health status of pigs.","Maes, D; Deluyker, H; Verdonck, M; Castryck, F; Miry, C; Vrijens, B; de Kruif, A",Veterinary research,381,12

Our method sweeps a maximum inscribed sphere through the aneurysmal region of the vessel and directly generates a stent surface touching the vessel wall without needing to iteratively grow a deformable stent surface. Our resulting stent mesh has guaranteed smoothness and variable pore density to achieve an enhanced occlusion performance.

Forty-nine cases of the avian influenza H5N1 covering a 6-week period (January 19, 2004, through March 9, 2004) were compiled from the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and the World Health Organization. Geographic information systems (GIS) techniques combined with statistical techniques were used to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of reported cases of avian influenza. Using Oden's direction method, we also explored the spatiotemporal interaction of individual-level avian influenza cases during the study duration. The peak period (temporal clustering) for the epidemiological avian influenza outbreak occurred between the third and fourth weeks. Although we observed a major northeast-southwest distribution of the avian influenza H5N1 cases, there was no significant spatiotemporal association in average ""direction of advance"" of these cases. The directional finding is very consistent with the major migratory bird routes in East Asia, but owing to weak surveillance and reporting systems in the region, the study findings warrant further evaluation.","Oyana, Tonny J; Dai, Dajun; Scott, Kara E",Avian diseases,381,21

The aim of the current paper was to study the possible relationship of the season of birth and current clinical symptoms in unipolar major depression. METHODS The study sample included 45 DSM-IV major depressive patients and 90 matched controls. The SCAN v. 2.0, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS) were used to assess symptomatology, and the 1 mg Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST) was used to subcategorize patients. RESULTS Depressed patients as a whole did not show differences in birth season from controls. However, those patients born during the spring manifested higher HDRS while those born during the summer manifested the lowest HAS scores. DST non-suppressors were almost exclusively (90%) likely to be born during autumn and winter. No effect from the season of birth was found concerning the current severity of suicidal ideation or attempts. DISCUSSION The current study is the first in this area of research using modern and rigid diagnostic methodology and a biological marker (DST) to categorize patients. Its disadvantages are the lack of data concerning DST in controls and a relatively small size of patient sample. The results confirm the effect of seasonality of birth on patients suffering from specific types of depression.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Iacovides, Apostolos; Karamouzis, Michael; Kaprinis, George S; Ierodiakonou, Charalambos",Annals of general psychiatry,381,24

CypA has an important role in viral infection which either facilitates or inhibits their replication. Inhibition of CypA via inhibitors is useful for overcoming several viral infections, indicating that CypA is an attractive target for anti-viral therapy.

METHODS A retrospective audit evaluated the clinical outcomes of SILS cholecystectomies at regional hospitals in the 17 Anglophone Caribbean countries. Any cholecystectomy using a laparoscopic approach in which all instruments were passed through one access incision was considered a SILS cholecystectomy. The following data were collected: patient demographics, indications for operation, intraoperative details, surgeon details, surgical techniques, specialized equipment, conversions, morbidity and mortality. Descriptive statistics were generated using SPSS 12.0. RESULTS There were 85 SILS cholecystectomies in women at a mean age of 37.4 ± 8.5 years with a mean BMI of 30.9 ± 2.8. There were 59 elective and 26 emergent cases. Specialized access platforms were used in the first 35 cases and reusable instruments were passed directly across fascia in the latter 50 cases. The mean operative time was 62.9 ± 17.9 minutes. There was no mortality, 2 conversions to multi-trocar laparoscopy and 5 minor complications. Ambulatory procedures were performed in 43/71 (60.6%) patients scheduled for elective operations. CONCLUSION In the Caribbean setting, SILS cholecystectomy is a feasible and safe alternative to conventional multi-trocar laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder disease.","Cawich, Shamir O; Albert, Matthew; Singh, Yardesh; Dan, Dilip; Mohanty, Sanjib; Walrond, Maurice; Francis, Wesley; Simpson, Lindberg K; Bonadie, Kimon O; Dapri, Giovanni",International journal of biomedical science : IJBS,381,26

It is caused by a new coronavirus (CoV) of suspect animal origin. The emergence of SARS stunned medical scientists, but veterinary virologists had previously recognized CoVs as causing fatal respiratory or enteric disease in animals with interspecies transmission and wildlife reservoirs. Because of its public health impact, major efforts are focused on development of SARS vaccines. Occurrence of CoV disease at mucosal surfaces necessitates the stimulation of local immunity, having an impact on the vaccine type, delivery and adjuvant needed to achieve mucosal immunity. Such immunity is often short-lived, requires frequent boosting and may not prevent re-infection, all factors complicating CoV vaccine design. SARS vaccine efforts should be enhanced by understanding the correlates of protection and reasons for the success or failure of animal CoV vaccines. This review will focus on studies of immunity and protection in swine to the enteric CoV, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) versus the respiratory variant, porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV), comparing live, inactivated and subunit vaccines, various vaccine vectors, routes and adjuvants. In addition avian infectious bronchitis CoV (IBV) vaccines targeted for protection of the upper respiratory tract of chickens are discussed. Unfortunately, despite long-term efforts, effective vaccines to prevent enteric CoV infections remain elusive, and generally live, but not killed vaccines, have induced the most consistent protection against animal CoVs. Confirmation of the pathogenesis of SARS in humans or animals models that mimic SARS may further aid in vaccine design and evaluation.","Saif, L J",Developments in biologicals,381,16

This review analyzes which methods of teledermatology patients prefer by categorizing how recent studies have defined satisfaction, conducted surveys and concluded patients respond to the different modalities of teledermatology. Using PubMed and Cochrane databases, we reviewed studies from April 5th, 2010 to April 5th, 2020 that included the search terms patient satisfaction and teledermatology. All studies that included patient satisfaction as an outcome were included, but studies not published in English were excluded. We examined domains of satisfaction, survey method, study characteristics (including patient population, country, age, study design and evidence score), findings and statistical comparisons. We thoroughly reviewed 23 studies. Definitions of satisfaction varied, but all concluded patients were satisfied with the live-interactive and store-and-forward modalities. The studies reveal that store-and-forward is appropriate for clinicians with established patients who require regular follow-up. Verified areas of care include treatment of chronic conditions, topical skin cancer therapy, wound monitoring, and post-procedural follow-up. Only four studies conducted statistical analyses. One of those studies compared patient preference for each modality of teledermatology with face-to-face dermatology. While this study reported high satisfaction with each mode of teledermatology, patients still preferred face-to-face. Favorable responses to remote diagnostic capabilities suggest that these offerings improve preference for teledermatology. With only one study evaluating preference between each modality and face-to-face dermatology, more studies should address the discrepancy. Surveys that cover all domains of satisfaction may improve assessments and identify where gaps in preference exist.","Hadeler, Edward; Gitlow, Howard; Nouri, Keyvan",Arch. dermatol. res,381,21

Deficiencies in kinetochore function can lead to chromosomal instability and aneuploidy-a hallmark of cancer cells. Kinetochore function is controlled by recruitment of regulatory proteins, many of which have been documented, however their function often remains uncharacterized and many are yet to be identified. To identify candidates of kinetochore regulation we used a proteome-wide protein association strategy in budding yeast and detected many proteins that are involved in post-translational modifications such as kinases, phosphatases and histone modifiers. We focused on the Polo-like kinase, Cdc5, and interrogated which cellular components were sensitive to constitutive Cdc5 localization. The kinetochore is particularly sensitive to constitutive Cdc5 kinase activity. Targeting Cdc5 to different kinetochore subcomplexes produced diverse phenotypes, consistent with multiple distinct functions at the kinetochore. We show that targeting Cdc5 to the inner kinetochore, the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), increases the levels of centromeric RNA via an SPT4 dependent mechanism.","Ólafsson, Guðjón; Thorpe, Peter H",PLoS Genet,381,1

This study was performed to evaluate the clinical validation of reusing N95 respirators following stringent fit test protocols. Methods After passing the first fit test, we prospectively enrolled healthcare workers who used N95 respirators for two hours per shift (duckbill-shaped HPR-R/HPR-S, dome-shaped Hi-Luck 350, and three-panel flat-fold respirators 9211) in settings such as bronchoscopy or respiratory specimen sampling. These procedures were repeated for up to three weeks, with the fit test performed every week. At each timing of the fit test, we used a fit-testing system for quantitatively evaluating particle leakage. Results A total of 41 participants were enrolled, including 24 doctors and 17 nurses, of whom 25 were women. The pass rate of successful reuse over three observational weeks using four fit tests was 85.4%, which was comparable among the three types of N95 respirators. Six (14.6%) participants failed the fit test, while no participants dropped out of protocol due to either N95 respirator damage or contamination. Among the six dropped out participants, four reused the duckbill-shaped type and two reused the three-panel flat-fold type. All participants using the cup-shaped type mask successfully completed the protocol. However, the passing rate of this study was not statistically different among the three types of N95 respirators. Conclusion This study shows that N95 respirators can be safely reused for a short period irrespective of their type, as quantitatively assessed by fit tests.","Nakamoto, Keitaro; Saraya, Takeshi; Kurai, Daisuke; Fukukawa, Naokatsu; Taneoka, Takako; Shimasaki, Teppei; Ishii, Haruyuki",Cureus,381,20

Since the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 can be more severe in patients with underlying cardiorespiratory diseases, we aimed at verifying the impact of a preexisting cardiorespiratory comorbidity on multidisciplinary rehabilitation in post-COVID-19 patients. We enrolled 95 consecutive patients referring to the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Unit of Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri Spa SB, IRCCS of Telese Terme, Benevento, Italy after being discharged from the COVID-19 acute care ward and after recovering from acute COVID-19 pneumonia. Forty-nine of them were not suffering from underlying comorbidities, while 46 had a preexisting cardiorespiratory disease. Rehabilitation induced statistically significant improvements in respiratory function, blood gases and the ability to exercise both in patients without any preexisting comorbidities and in those with an underlying cardiorespiratory disease. Response to the rehabilitation cycle tended to be greater in those without preexisting comorbidities, but DLco%-predicted was the only parameter that showed a significant greater improvement when compared to the response in the group of patients with underlying cardiorespiratory comorbidity.

METHODS: We assessed the presence of viral RNA in samples from environmental surfaces before and after UV LED irradiation in COVID-19 patient rooms after patient discharge. RESULTS: We analyzed 216 environmental samples from 17 rooms: 2 from airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 15 from isolation rooms in the community treatment center (CTC). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was detected in 40 (18.5%) of 216 samples after patient discharge: 12 (33.3%) of 36 samples from AIIRs in the ICU, and 28 (15.6%) of 180 samples from isolation rooms in the CTC. In 1 AIIR, all samples were PCR negative after UV LED irradiation. In the CTC rooms, 14 (8.6%) of the 163 samples were PCR positive after UV LED irradiation. However, viable virus was not recovered from the culture of any of the PCR-positive samples. CONCLUSIONS: Although no viable virus was recovered, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on various environmental surfaces. The use of a UV LED disinfection robot was effective in spacious areas such as an ICU, but its effects varied in small spaces like CTC rooms. These findings suggest that the UV LED robot may need enough space to disinfect rooms without recontamination by machine wheels or insufficient disinfection by shadowing.","Choi, Hee Kyoung; Cui, Chunguang; Seok, Hyeri; Bae, Joon-Yong; Jeon, Ji Hoon; Lee, Gee Eun; Choi, Won Suk; Park, Man-Seong; Park, Dae Won",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,381,1

In the acute phase, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the aerodigestive tract limited activities in the gastroenterology clinic and procedures to emergencies only. Motility and function testing was interrupted and as we enter the recovery phase, restarting these procedures requires a safety-focused approach with adequate infection prevention for patients and healthcare professionals. METHODS: We summarized knowledge on the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the aerodigestive tract and the risk of spread with motility and functional testing. We surveyed 39 European centers documenting how the pandemic affected activities and which measures they are considering for restarting these measurements. We propose recommendations based on current knowledge as applied in our center. RESULTS: Positioning of catheters for gastrointestinal motility tests carries a concern for aerosol-borne infection of healthcare workers. The risk is low with breath tests. The surveyed centers stopped almost all motility and function tests from the second half of March. The speed of restarting and the safety measures taken varied highly. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Based on these findings, we provided recommendations and practical relevant information for motility and function test procedures in the COVID-19 pandemic era, to guarantee a high-quality patient care with adequate infection prevention.","Tack, Jan; Schol, Jolien; Geeraerts, Annelies; Huang, I-Hsuan; Mori, Hideki; Scarpellini, Emidio; Sinonquel, Pieter; Carbone, Florencia; Colomier, Esther; Geysen, Hannelore; Jandee, Sawangpong; Moonen, An; Pannemans, Jasper; Timmermans, Lien; Van den Houte, Karen; Verbeure, Wout; Wauters, Lucas; Bisschops, Raf; Hoffman, Ilse; Roelandt, Philip; Rommel, Nathalie; Simren, Magnus; Suzuki, Hidekazu; Tornblom, Hans; Verbeke, Kristin; Vanuytsel, Tim",Neurogastroenterol Motil,381,26

The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in residents' awareness about COVID-19 and to characterize those who were more aware and responsive during the early stages of the pandemic in Louisiana. METHODS: In response to the mounting threat of COVID-19, we added questions to an ongoing food preference study held at Louisiana State University from March 3rd through March 12th, 2020. We asked how likely it was that the spread of the coronavirus will cause a national public health crisis and participants' level of concern about contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events. We used regression and classification tree analysis to identify correlations between these responses and (a) national and local COVID case counts; (b) personal characteristics and (c) randomly assigned information treatments provided as part of the food preference study. RESULTS: We found participants expressed a higher likelihood of an impending national crisis as the number of national and local confirmed cases increased. However, concerns about contracting COVID-19 by attending campus events rose more slowly in response to the increasing national and local confirmed case count. By the end of this study on March 12th, 2020 although 89% of participants agreed that COVID-19 would likely cause a public health crisis, only 65% of the participants expressed concerns about contracting COVID-19 from event attendance. These participants were significantly more likely to be younger students, in the highest income group, and to have participated in the study by responding to same-day, in-person flyer distribution. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide initial insights about the perceptions of the COVID-19 public health crisis during its early stages in Louisiana.

Apart from antivirals and respiratory support, anticoagulants, corticoids and immunomodulators are increasingly being prescribed, especially for more severe cases. We describe the clinical outcome of a large cohort of patients preferentially treated with glucocorticoids and interleukin inhibitors. Methods Single center and retrospective case series. Adult patients admitted with COVID-19 related respiratory insufficiency were included.Patients who died within 2 days after admission and those testing positive but asymptomatic were excluded. We defined two study periods: from March 3rd to March 31 st, 2020 (beginning of epidemic until peak of incidence) and April 1 st to May 7 th,2020 (second half of epidemic). The majority of patients received respiratory support,combinations of antimicrobials, anticoagulants, corticoids and interleukin inhibitors.Antivirals were preferentially given in the first period. The clinical outcome (death and ventilator dependency) of both periods was compared. Results From March 3 rd to May 7 th, 685 patients were included for analysis (58.4% males, mean age 68.9 years). Patients in the first period (n=408) were younger (66.6 vs 71.1 years, p=0.003),presented lower mean P a O 2/F i O2 ratio at admission (256.5 vs 270.4 mm Hg,p=0.0563), higher ferritin (1520 vs 1221 ng/ml, p=0.01), higher IL-6 (679 vs 194 pg/ml,p<0.0001) and similar D-dimer levels (3.59 vs 3.39 µg/mL, p=0.65) compared to the second period (n=277). Lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon were preferentially given in the first period (23.8% and 32% vs 1.8% and 11.9%, p<0.0001). Use of corticoids (88.2% vs 87.4%, p=0,74) and tocilizumab (26.29 vs 20.22% p=0.06) were similarly administered in both periods. Patients in the second period needed less mechanical ventilation (4.9% vs 16.9%, p<0.0001), fewer ICU admission (6.1% vs 20.1%,p<0.0001) and showed similar mortality (17.7% vs 15.4%, p=0.43).

With the spread of the coronavirus around the world and its epidemic among humans, we are losing many humans. The long process of treatment in hospitalized patients who are receiving intensive care and medication is associated with physical weakness. It has been suggested that lifelong exercise can create a safe margin for a person that allows them to avoid becoming infected with the virus. The current study was conducted to assess the effects of low-intensity exercise and breathing exercises on cardiorespiratory responses and physical status in an overweight 20-year-old woman infected with COVID-19. The patient was referred to Hazrat Ali Ibn Abitaleb Hospital in Rafsanjan. The patient had initial symptoms of coronavirus including weakness, shortness of breath, fever, and chills, and the initial tests confirmed that the person was infected with the coronavirus. Although COVID-19 reduces respiration and blood oxygen and severely reduces movement and physical activity, low-intensity rehabilitation and breathing exercises along with medication can improve blood oxygen status, resting heart rate, blood pressure, and hand power status in patients and possibly speeding up the healing process.

In this study, an in-house library of 117 steroidal plant-derived pregnanes (PDPs) was docked in the active regions of human glucocorticoid receptors (hGRs) in a comparative molecular docking analysis. Based on the minimal binding energy and a comparative dexamethasone binding mode analysis, a list of top twenty ranked PDPs docked in the agonist conformation of hGR, with binding energies ranging between -9.8 and -11.2 kcal/mol, was obtained and analyzed for possible interactions with the human Janus kinases 1 and Interleukins-6 and SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, Papain-like protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. For each target protein, the top three ranked PDPs were selected. Eight PDPs (bregenin, hirundigenin, anhydroholantogenin, atratogenin A, atratogenin B, glaucogenin A, glaucogenin C and glaucogenin D) with high binding tendencies to the catalytic residues of multiple targets were identified. A high degree of structural stability was observed from the 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation analyses of glaucogenin C and hirundigenin complexes of hGR. The selected top-eight ranked PDPs demonstrated high druggable potentials and favourable in silico ADMET properties. Thus, the therapeutic potentials of glaucogenin C and hirundigenin can be explored for further in vitro and in vivo studies.","Gyebi, Gideon A; Ogunyemi, Oludare M; Ibrahim, Ibrahim M; Afolabi, Saheed O; Adebayo, Joseph O",Comput Biol Med,381,1

METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TCZ versus placebo/control, for treatment of adults with COVID-19. Primary outcome was 28-30 days all-cause mortality. Search was conducted up to April 1st 2021. Two independent reviewers screened citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled. We performed subgroup analysis for patients with critical illness and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included, assessing 6,481 patients with mostly severe non-critical COVID-19 infection. TCZ was associated with a reduction in all-cause 28-30-day mortality compared to placebo/control (RR = 0.89, 95%CI 0.82-0.96). Among the subgroup of critically ill patients no reduced mortality was demonstrated (RR = 0.94, 95%CI 0.74-1.19). No mortality benefit with TCZ was demonstrated in trials that used steroids for >80% of patients. TCZ was associated with significantly reduced risk for mechanical ventilation (MV); for combined endpoint of death or MV; and for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. No significant difference in adverse events was demonstrated. Risk of serious superinfection was significantly lower with TCZ (RR = 0.57, 95%CI 0.35-0.93). CONCLUSION: The treatment with TCZ reduces 28-30 days all-cause mortality, ICU admission, superinfections, MV and the combined endpoint of death or MV. Among critically ill patients, and when steroids were used for most patients, no mortality benefit was demonstrated. Additional research should further define sub-groups that would benefit most and preferred timing of administration of TCZ in severe COVID-19.","Avni, Tomer; Leibovici, Leonard; Cohen, Ido; Atamna, Alaa; Guz, Dmitri; Paul, Mical; Gafter-Gvili, Anat; Yahav, Dafna",QJM,381,26

However, using that objective ignores that some of these interventions, like bans of public events or lockdowns, must be transitory and as short as possible because of their significant economic and societal costs. Here, we derive a simple and mathematically rigorous criterion for designing optimal transitory non-pharmaceutical interventions for mitigating epidemic outbreaks. We find that reducing the reproduction number below one is sufficient but not necessary. Instead, our criterion prescribes the required reduction in the reproduction number according to the desired maximum of disease prevalence and the maximum decrease of disease transmission that the interventions can achieve. We study the implications of our theoretical results for designing non-pharmaceutical interventions in 16 cities and regions during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we estimate the minimal reduction of each region's contact rate necessary to control the epidemic optimally. Our results contribute to establishing a rigorous methodology to design optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention policies for mitigating epidemic outbreaks.","Angulo, Marco Tulio; Castaños, Fernando; Moreno-Morton, Rodrigo; Velasco-Hernández, Jorge X; Moreno, Jaime A",J R Soc Interface,381,24

METHODS: In thisretrospective, multicenter study, the medical records of elderly patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Hunan province, China, from January 21 to February 19, 2020 were reviewed. The characteristics of young-old patients and old-old patients were compared. RESULTS: Of the 105 elderly patientsconfirmed withCOVID-19, 81.0% were young-old patients, and 19.0% were old-old patients; 54.3% of elderly patients were females. Overall, 69.5% of elderly patients had underlying diseases, and the most common comorbidities included hypertension (43.8%), diabetes (25.7%), and cardiac disease (16.2%). Of the elderly patients, 22.9% were severe and 10.5% were critical severe cases. On admission, the most frequent symptoms in elderly patients included fever (66.7%), cough (64.8%), and fatigue (33.3%). Lymphopenia (31.4%), increased D-dimer (38.1%), depressed albumin (36.2%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (41.0%), and a high level of C-reactive protein (79.0%) were common among elderly patients with COVID-19. The median prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were longer in old-old patients than young-old patients (PT median 12.3 vs. 13.1 s, p = 0.007; APTT median 39.0 vs. 33.5 s, p = 0.045). Young-old patients showed fewer complications (14.1%) than old-old patients (40.0%; p = 0.0014) and fewer received invasive ventilator support (3.5 vs. 25.0%, p = 0.006). As of March 11, 2020, 85.7% of elderly patients had been discharged, 3 deaths had occurred, and 11.4% were still hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients usually have chronic medical illness and are likely to have a severe or critically severe condition. They could show atypical symptoms without fever or cough and multiple organ dysfunction. Old-old patients tend to have more complications than young-old patients during hospitalization. Careful nursing, observation, and systemic treatment are very important in elderly patients.","Guo, Ting; Shen, Qinxue; Guo, Wei; He, Wenlong; Li, Jinhua; Zhang, Yi; Wang, Yunnian; Zhou, Zhiguo; Deng, Dingding; Ouyang, Xiaoli; Xiang, Zhi; Jiang, Minyan; Liang, Minyong; Huang, Peng; Peng, Zaimei; Xiang, Xudong; Liu, Wenlong; Luo, Hong; Chen, Ping; Peng, Hong",Gerontology,381,2

However, data from patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are sparse. METHODS: Determination of PRA was made in 550 patients with ACS, including a subgroup of 287 patients not on treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or diuretics, and without heart failure. We evaluated the relations between PRA and all-cause mortality after three years and long-term, and to cardiovascular events after median 8.7 years. Adjustments were made for variables that influenced the hazard ratio (HR) > 5% for the relation between PRA and outcome. RESULTS: Baseline PRA was associated with all-cause mortality during three-years (unadjusted HR 1.74 per 1 SD increase in logarithmically transformed PRA; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-2.16, p < 0.0001) and long-term (HR 1.12, CI 1.00-1.25, p = 0.046). After adjustments, only the three-year association remained significant. In unadjusted analyses, PRA was associated with cardiovascular death, but not with nonfatal cardiovascular events. In the subgroup there was an inverse relation between PRA and long-term all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: Higher PRA was a significant independent predictor of all-cause mortality after three years, but not at long-term follow-up and not significantly associated with cardiovascular incidence. The renin-angiotensin-system pathophysiology is of great interest, not least due to its association with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings indicate a need for further research on the prognostic/predictive aspects of the renin-angiotensin-system in ACS.","Hartford, Marianne; Herlitz, Hans; Perers, Elisabeth; Karlsson, Thomas; Herlitz, Johan; Persson, Anita; Caidahl, Kenneth",Int. j. cardiol,381,16

As such, it includes a summary and categorisation of the findings, extending to consumption preferences worldwide. After the indiscriminate stockpiling of food, which was witnessed in many countries following the implementation of the lockdown, the impact of COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease-2019) on consumer habits has inversely varied in function of personal attitudes, individual and household experiences, and characteristics. Specific contexts, and the financial, economic, and logistic nature of these contexts, have also been found to be of relevance in examining the research relating to the coronavirus pandemic and food-purchasing behaviour. Concurrent with the pandemic, some worldwide trends have emerged—home cooking has been rediscovered, leading to an increase in the demand for staple foodstuffs, and purchases from small, local retailers and online food shopping have been accorded preferential treatment. Despite price volatility and concern about future household incomes, a significant proportion of consumers have shifted to buying healthier, more sustainable food. Moreover, food wastage has seen a notable decrease in volume. Such an occasion should be strategically exploited by manufacturers and retailers in satisfying this consumer demand. Finally, the COVID-19 crisis would seem to offer an unparalleled opportunity to re-engineer the agro-food market by driving the transition toward more sustainable supply and production patterns. Thus, stronger and more equitable partnerships between farmers, manufacturers, retailers, and citizens may be in the process of being forged.","Borsellino, Valeria Sina Ahmadi Kaliji Schimmenti Emanuele",Sustainability,381,1

Different efforts have been made, with compartmental models in epidemiology and statistical models such as AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or computing intelligence models. These efforts have proved useful in some instances by allowing decision makers to distinguish different scenarios during the emergency, but their accuracy has been disappointing, forecasts ignore uncertainties and less attention is given to local areas. In this study, we propose a simple Multiple Linear Regression model, optimised to use call data to forecast the number of daily confirmed cases. Moreover, we produce a probabilistic forecast that allows decision makers to better deal with risk. Our proposed approach outperforms ARIMA, ETS and a regression model without call data, evaluated by three point forecast error metrics, one prediction interval and two probabilistic forecast accuracy measures. The simplicity, interpretability and reliability of the model, obtained in a careful forecasting exercise, is a meaningful contribution to decision makers at local level who acutely need to organise resources in already strained health services. We hope that this model would serve as a building block of other forecasting efforts that on the one hand would help front-line personal and decision makers at local level, and on the other would facilitate the communication with other modelling efforts being made at the national level to improve the way we tackle this pandemic and other similar future challenges.","Rostami-Tabar, Bahman; Rendon-Sanchez, Juan F.",,381,1

A better understanding is required on how operation affects product selectivity. This study demonstrated that the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and organic loading rate (OLR) selected fermentation pathways in a single-stage, semi-continuous stirred tank reactor. Three combinations of HRT and OLR were tested to distinguish the effect of each parameter. Three fermentation profiles with distinct microbial communities were obtained. Predominantly n-butyric acid (13 ± 2 gCOD L-1, 55 ± 14% of carboxylates) was produced at an HRT of 8.5 days and OLR around 12 gCOD L-1d-1. Operating at an HRT two days longer, yet with similar OLR, stimulated chain elongation (up to 13.6 gCOD L-1 of n-caproic acid). This was reflected by a microbial community twice as diverse at longer HRT as indicated by first and second order Hill number (1D = 24 ± 4, 2D = 12 ± 3) and by a higher relative abundance of genera related to secondary fermentation, such as the VFA-elongating Caproiciproducens spp., and secondary lactic acid fermenter Secundilactobacillus spp.. Operating at a higher OLR (20 gCOD L-1d-1) but HRT of 8.5 days, resulted in typical lactic acid fermentation (34 ± 5 gCOD L-1) harbouring a less diverse community (1D = 8.0 ± 0.7, 2D = 5.7 ± 0.9) rich in acid-resistant homofermentative Lactobacillus spp. These findings demonstrate that a flexible product portfolio can be achieved by small adjustments in two key operating conditions.

Hypobaic hypoxia (HH) and cold are conditions characteristic of high altitude environment. HH is always considered as the central causative factor for the development of HACE, but the effect of cold stress on HACE has been rarely investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role of cold stress in the development of HACE and establish a stable experimental animal model. Male SPF Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups for this experiment, control group (altitude, 1400 m, temperature, 25 â), NC + 2 â group (altitude, 1400 m, temperature, 2 â), HH group (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 25 â), HH+2 â group (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 2 â) and HH + 12/2 â (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 12 â/2 â light/dark cycle). After exposure for 72 h, the blood and brain tissues were collected. Brain water content (BWC) and Evans Blue dye extravasation were used to assess the brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, respectively. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum were assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Oxidative stress markers and ATPase activity were determined using commercial kits. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of related proteins. Compared to control, HH+2 â could significantly increase the BWC and BBB permeability, and these changes were further exacerbated by HH + 12/2 â. Furthermore, HH+2 â and HH + 12/2 â markedly increased the levels of H2O2 and MDA, restrained SOD and GSH levels and decreased Na+/K+-ATPase activitie compared with the control group. In addition, HH+2 â and HH + 12/2 â enhanced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1ß, TNF-&#945; and IL-6 in serum and significantly increased the expression of VEGF in brain compared with the control group, but only HH + 12/2 â could increase the expression of AQP4. However, compared with control group, no significant differences in these parameters were observed in HH and NC+2 âgroups. These results demonstrated that HH or cold stress alone did not successfully induce brain damage, while HH+2 â could induce the onset of HACE via provoking injury caused by HH. HH + 12/2 â was more obvious and efficient. Collectively, we firstly suggest that cold stress may promote the formation of HACE by aggravating the brain injury induced by HH exposure and supply an effective and reliable experimental rat model of HACE via HH combined with temperature fluctuation.","Jing, Linlin; Wu, Ningzi; He, Lei; Shao, Jin; Ma, Huiping",Brain Res Bull,381,21

This study aims to examine the psychometric properties of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in Turkish people and to determine the level of fear of COVID-19 among Turkish people. METHODS: The research was carried out between March and April 2020. A Personal Information Form and the FCV-19S were used to collect the research data. In the validity and reliability stage, 84 people were contacted randomly for data collection. After the validity and reliability analyses of the scale, a total of 431 Turkish people volunteered to participate in the study and answered the questions in the online questionnaire form using a convenience and snowball sampling method. Confirmatory factor analysis, item-total correlation and Cronbach's alpha coefficient were calculated for psychometric evaluation. Bivariate analysis was applied to determine the level of fear of COVID-19. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.89, which is stated to have high reliability. FCV-19S scores of participants were determined to be 21.47 ± 6.28. FCV-19S scores of females were determined as 20.48 ± 6.33 and FCV-19S scores of males were determined as 19.78 ± 7.34 according to the bivariate analysis (p < .05). Age, marital status, having children and living alone or with others, tobacco use and anxiety about going to the hospital during the pandemic did not affect on fear of COVID-19 (p > .05). Particularly being female, the presence of chronic disease requiring long-term medication and rarely taking protective measures recommended by the Ministry of Health and having a chronic disease had a significant effect on higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (p < .05). CONCLUSION: The FCV-19S is a valid and reliable tool for determining the fear of COVID-19.

Methods: The literature related to the above topic was reviewed including papers that analysed the connections, actions, interactions, consequences and occasionally suggestions for rational interventions. Results/Conclusion: Severe broncho-alveolar inflammation seems to be caused, at least in part, by upregulation of the KKS that increases plasma and/or local tissue concentrations of bradykinin (BK) in patients with COVID-19 infection. Besides KKS activation, suppression of ACE activity results in decreased bradykinin degradation, and these changes in concert can lead to excessive BK B1 and B2 receptor (BKB1R/BKB2R) activation. Aminopeptidase P (APP), and carboxypeptidase N also degrade bradykinin, but their protein expression and activity are unclear in COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, ACE2 expression is upregulated in patients with COVID-19 infection, so ACE2 activity is unlikely to be decreased despite blockade of part of ACE2 by the virus for entry into the cells. ACE2 cleaves lys-des-arginine9BK and arg-des-arginine9BK, the active metabolites of bradykinin, which stimulate the BKB1R receptor. Stimulation of BKB1R/BKB2R can exacerbate the pulmonary inflammatory response by causing vascular leakage and edema, vasodilation, smooth muscle spasm and stimulation of pain afferent nerves. Despite all uncertainties, it seems rational to treat comorbid COVID patients with serious respiratory distress syndrome with ARBs instead of high-dose ACE inhibitor (ACEi) that will further decrease bradykinin degradation and enhance BKB1R/BKB2R activation, but ACEi may not be contraindicated in patients with mild pulmonary symptoms.","Székács, B; Várbíró, S; Debreczeni, L",Physiol. int,381,12

Design/methodology/approach: Mental health conditions and emotions are captured via markers, which link social media contents with lexicons. First, the authors build time series models that describe the evolution of markers and their correlation with crisis events. Second, the authors use the time series for forecasting markers and identifying high prevalence points for the estimated markers. Findings: The authors evaluated different forecasting strategies that yielded different performance and capabilities. In the best scenario, high prevalence periods of emotions and mental health issues can be satisfactorily predicted with a neural network strategy, even at early stages of a crisis (e.g. a training period of seven days). Practical implications: This work contributes to a better understanding of how psychological processes related to crises manifest in social media, and this is a valuable asset for the design, implementation and monitoring of health prevention and communication policies. Originality/value: Although there have been previous efforts to predict mental states of individuals, the analysis of mental health at the collective level has received scarce attention.

The high rates of morbidity and mortality and the absence of vaccines cause fear among the people regardless of age, gender, or social status. People's fear is heightened by misinformation spread across all media types, especially on social media. Filipino college students are one of the top Internet users worldwide and are very active in social media. Hence they are very prone to misinformation. This paper aims to ascertain the levels of knowledge, precaution, and fear of COVID-19 of the college students in Iloilo, Philippines, and determine the effects of their information-seeking behavior on the variables above. This paper is a cross-sectional survey that used a qualitative-quantitative method and snowball sampling technique. Data were gathered among 228 college students using an online survey instrument a few months after the pandemic began. College students were knowledgeable of the basic facts about the highly infectious COVID-19. However, the majority were inclined to believe the myths and misinformation regarding the pandemic. Television was the primary, most believable, and preferred source when seeking information. The Internet as a preferred source of information was significantly associated with a high level of knowledge. In contrast, the information sourced from interpersonal channels were found to make college students very cautious. The local presence of COVID-19 cases had caused college students to fear, likely exacerbated by the plethora of information about the pandemic, mostly from Facebook. This is the first study conducted on the effects of the information-seeking behavior on the levels of knowledge, precaution, and fear of COVID-19 of the college students in Iloilo, Philippines.","Superio, Daryl L.; Anderson, Kristen L.; Oducado, Ryan Michael F.; Luceño, Myrna T.; Palcullo, Vince Ervin V.; Bendalian, Maria Vanessa T.",International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,381,22

A key aspect to providing care for those with COVID-19 and checking its further spread is early and accurate diagnosis of infection, which has been generally done via methods for amplifying and detecting viral RNA molecules. Detection and quantitation of peptides using targeted mass spectrometry-based strategies has been proposed as an alternative diagnostic tool due to direct detection of molecular indicators from non-invasively collected samples as well as the potential for high-throughput analysis in a clinical setting;many studies have revealed the presence of viral peptides within easily accessed patient samples. However, evidence suggests that some viral peptides could serve as better indicators of COVID-19 infection status than others, due to potential misidentification of peptides derived from human host proteins, poor spectral quality, high limits of detection etc. RESULTS: Using PepQuery for confirming peptide spectrum matches, we were able to narrow down the 639-peptide possibilities to 87 peptides that were most robustly detected and specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The specificity of these sequences to coronavirus taxa was confirmed using Unipept and BLAST-P. Through stringent p-value cutoff combined with manual verification of peptide spectrum match quality, 4 peptides derived from the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and membrane protein were found to be most robustly detected across all cell culture and clinical samples, including those collected non-invasively. CONCLUSION: We propose that these peptides would be of the most value for clinical proteomics applications seeking to detect COVID-19 from patient samples. We also contend that samples harvested from the upper respiratory tract and oral cavity have the highest potential for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from easily collected patient samples using mass spectrometry-based proteomics assays.","Rajczewski, A.

The challenges of having only lacunary information about daily new infections and mortality counts are compounded by geographic heterogeneity of the population. This complicates prediction, particularly when using models assuming well-mixed populations. To address this problem, we account for the differences between rural and urban settings using network-based, distributed models where the spread of the pandemic is described in distinct local cohorts with nested SE(A)IR models, i.e., modified SEIR models that include infectious asymptomatic individuals. The model parameters account for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission mostly via human-to-human contact, and the fact that contact frequency among individuals differs between urban and rural areas, and may change over time. The probability that the virus spreads into an uninfected community is associated with influx of individuals from communities where the infection is already present, thus each node is characterized by its internal contact and by its connectivity with other nodes. Census data are used to set up the adjacency matrix of the network, which can be modified to simulate changes in mitigation measures. Our network SE(A)IR model depends on easily interpretable parameters estimated from available community level data. The parameters estimated with Bayesian techniques include transmission rate and the ratio asymptomatic to symptomatic infectious individuals. The methodology predicts that the latter quantity approaches 0.5 as the epidemic reaches an equilibrium, in full agreement with the May 22, 2020 CDC modeling. The network model gives rise to a spatially distributed computational model that explains the geographic dynamics of the contagion, e.g., in larger cities surrounded by suburban and rural areas. The time courses of the infected cohorts in the different counties predicted by the network model are remarkably similar to the reported observations. Moreover, the model shows that monitoring the infection prevalence in each county, and adopting local mitigation measures as infections climb beyond a certain threshold, is almost as effective as blanket measures, and more effective than reducing inter-county mobility.","Calvetti, Daniela; Hoover, Alexander P.; Rose, Johnie; Somersalo, Erkki",Front.

The World Health Organization (WHO) announced in a press conference on January 29, 2020 that the death rate of COVID-19 was 2% on the case fatality rate (CFR). It was underestimated assuming no lag days from symptom onset to deaths while many CFR formulas have been proposed, the estimation on Bays theorem is worthy of interpretation. Hence, it is hypothesized that the over-loaded burdens of treating patients and capacities to contain the outbreak (LSBHRS) may increase the CFR. METHODS: We downloaded COVID-19 outbreak numbers from January 21 to February 14, 2020, in countries/regions on a daily basis from Github that contains information on confirmed cases in >30 Chinese locations and other countries/regions. The pros and cons were compared among the 5 formula of CFR, including [A] deaths/confirmed; [B] deaths/(deathsâ+ârecovered); [C] deaths/(cases x days ago); [D] Bayes estimation based on [A] and the outbreak (LSBHRS) in each country/region; and [E] Bayes estimation based on [C] deaths/(cases x days ago). The coefficients of variance (CVâ=âthe ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) were applied to measure the relative variability for each CFR. A dashboard was developed for daily display of the CFR across each region. RESULTS: The Bayes based on (A)[D] has the lowest CV (=0.10) followed by the deaths/confirmed (=0.11) [A], deaths/(deathsâ+ârecoveries) (=0.42) [B], Bayes based on (C) (=0.49) [E], and deaths/(cases x days ago) (=0.59) [C]. All final CFRs will be equal using the formula (from, A to E). A dashboard was developed for the daily reporting of the CFR. The CFR (3.7%) greater than the prior CFR of 2.2% was evident in LSBHRS, increasing the CFR. A dashboard was created to present the CFRs on COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We suggest examining both trends of the Bayes based on both deaths/(cases 7 days ago) and deaths/confirmed cases as a reference to the final CFR. An app developed for displaying the provisional CFR with the 2 CFR trends can improve the underestimated CFR reported by WHO and media.","Chang, Chi-Sheng; Yeh, Yu-Tsen; Chien, Tsair-Wei; Lin, Jui-Chung John; Cheng, Bor-Wen; Kuo, Shu-Chun",Medicine (Baltimore),381,33

In addition, an inverse association between mean daily calcitriol dose and COVID-19 severity or mortality was observed in treated patients, independently of renal function. Our findings point out that patients with advanced chronic kidney disease could benefit from calcitriol supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Oristrell, Joaquim Oliva Joan Carles Subirana Isaac Casado Enrique Domínguez Didier Toloba Andrea Aguilera Patricia Esplugues Joan Fafián Pilar Grau Maria",Biomedicines,381,29

Re-establishing elective surgery in a manner that ensures patient and staff safety has been a priority. We report our experience and patient outcomes from setting up a ""COVID protected"" robotic unit for colorectal and renal surgery that housed both the da Vinci Si (Intuitive, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and the Versius (CMR Surgical, Cambridge, UK) robotic systems. ""COVID protected"" robotic surgery was undertaken in a day-surgical unit attached to the main hospital. A standard operating procedure was developed in collaboration with the trust COVID-19 leadership team and adapted to national recommendations. 60 patients underwent elective robotic surgery in the initial 10-weeks of the study. This included 10 colorectal procedures and 50 urology procedures. Median length of stay was 4 days for rectal cancer procedures, 2 days less than prior to the COVID period, and 1 day for renal procedures. There were no instances of in-patient coronavirus transmission. Six rectal cancer patients waited more than 62 days for their surgery because of the initial COVID peak but none had an increase T-stage between pre-operative staging and post-operative histology. Robotic surgery can be undertaken in ""COVID protected"" units within acute hospitals in a safe way that mitigates the increased risk of undergoing major surgery in the current pandemic. Some benefits were seen such as reduced length of stay for colorectal patients that may be associated with having a dedicated unit for elective robotic surgical services.","Huddy, Jeremy R; Crockett, Matthew; Nizar, A Shiyam; Smith, Ralph; Malki, Manar; Barber, Neil; Tilney, Henry S",J. robot. surg.

However, it is not easy to get students to notice the importance of ethical behavior in courses that traditionally focus on the communication of technical knowledge and facts. We set out to create an academic space in which pharmacology students have the opportunity to reflect on ethical dilemmas as professionals and citizens. Methods This innovation was implemented during 2020 in a pharmacology course that is offered to second-year medical students. The course included an interaction space (initially in the classroom and then virtual, following the confinements brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic). Groups of students worked on a dilemma in pharmacological sciences. The challenges could be historical situations (such as the thalidomide tragedy) or current news about the use of medicines in the national or global context (conflicts of interest in health personnel, medication administration errors, drug adulteration, research misconduct, etc). The activity was divided into the following stages: 1. Students participated in a role-play, creating a video news show, in which they covered a dilemma. Each report included the arguments and points of view of different stakeholders (health personnel, scientists, the pharmaceutical industry, patients, government officials, and ethics experts). 2. Each team, acting as teachers, uploaded their videos, assigned a complementary reading, and designed an integration activity to promote and assess mastery of the key concepts in their peers. 3. The effectiveness of the activities was evaluated by their peers and the instructor Finally, a survey was applied to evaluate the perception of learning and the usefulness of the innovation. Twenty-five learning outcomes, including examples of student, professional, and citizen behaviors and reflections on several ethical principles, were assessed. Results In 24 of the 25 outcomes, more than 88% of the students reported that the activities helped them improve their attitude, knowledge, and ideas about an ethical principle or behavior. In 1 of the 25 items, only 67% of the students improved their learning perception (adoption of sustainable consumption habits). Evaluation of the effectiveness of each stage of the activities resulted in an average score of 89%. Conclusions In summary, a role-playing strategy in which students address an ethical dilemma in a reporting/news format can be easily incorporated into a pharmacology course. This strategy appears to be an effective mechanism for promoting student engagement and strengthening professional and ethical behavior competencies in pharmacology students.","Pena-Silva, Ricardo Sierra-Velandia Ana Cocoma-Arciniegas Gonzalo Zuluaga-Rodriguez Linda",The FASEB Journal,381,24

On 18 September, the Ethiopian Minister of Health advised the Parliament the possibility of reopening schools provided certain conditions were met. Schools are currently reopening in the country for the first time since March 2020. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the knowledge and preventive health behaviours toward COVID-19 and associated factors among secondary school students. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2020 in Gondar city, Northwest Ethiopia. A total of 370 secondary school students were included. Bivariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression model were fitted to identify the predictors of knowledge about COVID-19. Simple and multiple linear regression analysis were done to identify factors associated with preventive behaviour. A p<0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. RESULTS: Only one-fourth (23.5%, 95% CI 19.5% to 28.1%) of the participants had a good knowledge about COVID-19. The mean score of preventive behaviour was 22.8±SD 6.2. Marital status, religion, father education, living arrangement and sources of information were significantly associated with knowledge about COVID-19. Being female and using health professionals as source of information increased the engagement in preventive behaviours. On the other hand, student whose father employed in non-governmental organisation and other jobs had decreased engagement in preventive health behaviours. CONCLUSION: Significant number of the students had inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 and poorly engaged in COVID-19 preventive behaviour. Thus, it is suggested to include and disseminate about COVID-19 in related academic sessions, using school clubs and minimedias. The sources of COVID-19-related information need to strengthen the dissemination of tailored, credible and timely message to enhance the knowledge and engagement of the students in preventive behaviours.","Handebo, Simegnew; Adugna, Asmamaw; Kassie, Ayenew; Shitu, Kegnie",BMJ Open,381,10

Combined with many trends that were already under way pre-pandemic, the current situation has generated significant disruption and underscored the need for change within and across AMCs. In this article, the authors explore some of the major issues and propose actionable solutions in 3 areas of concentration. First, the impact on medical students is considered, particularly the tradeoffs associated with online learning and the need to place greater pedagogical emphasis on virtual care delivery and other skills that will be increasingly in demand. Solutions described include greater utilization of technology, building more public health knowledge into the curriculum, and partnering with a wide range of academic disciplines. Second, leadership recruiting, vital to long-term success for AMCs, has been complicated by the crisis. Pressures discussed include adapting to the dynamics of competitive physician labor markets as well as attracting candidates with the skill sets to meet the requirements of a shifting AMC leadership landscape. Solutions proposed in this domain include making search processes more focused and streamlined, prioritizing creativity and flexibility as core management capabilities to be sought, and enhancing efforts with assistance from outside advisors. Finally, attention is devoted to the severe financial impact wrought by the pandemic, creating challenges whose resolution is central to planning future AMC directions. Specific challenges include recovery of lost clinical revenue and cash flow, determining how to deal with research funding, and the precarious economic balancing act engendered by the need to continue distance education. A full embrace of telehealth, collaborative policy-making among the many AMC constituencies, and committing fully to being in the vanguard of the transition to value-based care form the solution set offered.","Godley, Bernard F; Lawley, Thomas J; Rubenstein, Arthur; Pizzo, Philip A",Acad. med,381,20

First experience with a portable ECG-recording device,17.755638,7.6628213,2021,"BACKGROUND: The recent COVID-19 outbreak has generated an unprecedented public health crisis, with millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Using hospital-based or mortality data, several COVID-19 risk factors have been identified, but these may be confounded or biased. METHODS: Using SARS-CoV-2 infection test data (n = 4509 tests; 1325 positive) from Public Health England, linked to the UK Biobank study, we explored the contribution of demographic, social, health risk, medical and environmental factors to COVID-19 risk. We used multivariable and penalized logistic regression models for the risk of (i) being tested, (ii) testing positive/negative in the study population and, adopting a test negative design, (iii) the risk of testing positive within the tested population. RESULTS: In the fully adjusted model, variables independently associated with the risk of being tested for COVID-19 with odds ratio >1.05 were: male sex; Black ethnicity; social disadvantage (as measured by education, housing and income); occupation (healthcare worker, retired, unemployed); ever smoker; severely obese; comorbidities; and greater exposure to particulate matter (PM) 2.5 absorbance. Of these, only male sex, non-White ethnicity and lower educational attainment, and none of the comorbidities or health risk factors, were associated with testing positive among tested individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We adopted a careful and exhaustive approach within a large population-based cohort, which enabled us to triangulate evidence linking male sex, lower educational attainment and non-White ethnicity with the risk of COVID-19. The elucidation of the joint and independent effects of these factors is a high-priority area for further research to inform on the natural history of COVID-19.","Chadeau-Hyam, Marc; Bodinier, Barbara; Elliott, Joshua; Whitaker, Matthew D; Tzoulaki, Ioanna; Vermeulen, Roel; Kelly-Irving, Michelle; Delpierre, Cyrille; Elliott, Paul",Int. j. epidemiol,381,26

A systematic review of home-based visual acuity for telemedicine,17.786753,7.252521,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is high morbidity in clinical patients with duodenum bulb inflammation. Mucosa-associated microbiota, which are closely related to inflammatory processes, may have a pathogenic role, but the duodenum bulb microbial signature is poorly studied. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize microbial changes associated with duodenum bulb inflammation. METHODS: Mucosal biopsy is commonly used to assess microbial communities associated with the intestinal mucosa. Sixteen patients (8 with duodenum bulb inflammation and 8 controls) underwent gastroscopy, and duodenal bulb biopsies were obtained. Diagnoses were based on both endoscopic and histological findings. To determine microbiota composition and diversity, 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA and multiple bioinformatics analyses were performed. OTU-level alpha diversity indices, such as the Chao1 richness estimator, abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) metric, Shannon diversity index, and Simpson index, were calculated using the OTU table in QIIME. RESULTS: More OTUs were identified in the normal samples (781) than in the inflammatory samples (553). Metastats analysis identified 19 phyla and 97 genera that were significantly different between the two groups, and the beta diversity was significantly different between the two groups (unweighted UniFrac: Pâ¯=â¯0.001; weighted UniFrac: Pâ¯=â¯0.001). For all individuals, composition analyses showed that the most abundant phyla in the duodenal bulb samples were Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. The phylogenetic diversity of the microbiota in the duodenal bulbs of healthy volunteers was higher than that in volunteers with inflammation. Dominant microbes differed between the DN samples and DI samples. The most frequently represented genera in the DN samples were Cetobacterium, Aeromonadaceae, and Clostridium (accounting for 58.4%, 8.5%, and 4.8% of the total, respectively), and the dominant genera in the DI samples were Cetobacterium, Cupriavidus, and Helicobacter (accounting for 43.6%, 13.1%, 4.5% of the total, respectively). Significant differences in the microbiota were observed between those exhibiting an inflammatory state and the controls.

METHODS: We provided remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support. Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment. This report is based on data from patients who received remdesivir during the period from January 25, 2020, through March 7, 2020, and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day. RESULTS: Of the 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, data from 8 could not be analyzed (including 7 patients with no post-treatment data and 1 with a dosing error). Of the 53 patients whose data were analyzed, 22 were in the United States, 22 in Europe or Canada, and 9 in Japan. At baseline, 30 patients (57%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and 4 (8%) were receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) had an improvement in oxygen-support class, including 17 of 30 patients (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation who were extubated. A total of 25 patients (47%) were discharged, and 7 patients (13%) died; mortality was 18% (6 of 34) among patients receiving invasive ventilation and 5% (1 of 19) among those not receiving invasive ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%). Measurement of efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy.

Thus, the purpose of this review was to summarize the response of various hormonal changes involved in these physiologic functions to dehydration. A comprehensive literature search for peer-reviewed research in the databases PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and SportDiscus was conducted. Studies were included if they contained samples of adults (>18 years) and experimentally induced dehydration as measured by acute body mass loss. Twenty-one articles were eligible for inclusion. Findings suggested cortisol is significantly elevated with hypohydration (standard mean difference [SMD] = 1.12, 95% CI [0.583, 1.67], p < 0.0001). Testosterone was significantly lower in studies where hypohydration was accompanied by caloric restriction (SMD= -1.04, 95% CI [-1.93, -0.14], p = 0.02), however, there were no changes in testosterone in studies examining hypohydration alone (SMD = -0.17, 95% CI [-0.51 0.16], p = 0.30). Insulin and ghrelin were unaffected by acute total body water losses. Acute hypohydration increases markers of catabolism but has a negligible effect on markers of glycemic regulation, appetite, anabolism and stress. Given the brevity of existing research, further research is needed to determine the impact of hydration on glucagon, leptin, peptide YY and the subsequent outcomes relevant to both health and performance.","Zaplatosch, Mitchell E; Adams, William M",Nutrients,381,1

METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based study was perfomed in patients with chronic coronary syndromes. A sample of 205 patients was randomly drawn from the RICO (Observatoire des infarctus de Côte d'Or) cohort. Eight trained interviewers collected data by phone interview during week 16 (April 13 to April 19), i.e. 4 weeks after implementation of the French lockdown (start March 17, 2020). RESULTS: Among the 195 patients interviewed (of the 205, 3 had died, 1 declined, 6 lost), mean age was 65.5 ± 11.1 years. Only six patients (3%) reported drug discontinuation, mainly driven by media influence or family members. All 166 (85%) patients taking aspirin continued their prescribed daily intake. Lifestyle rules were less respected since almost half (45%) declared >25% reduction in physical activity, 26% of smokers increased their tobacco consumption by >25%, and 24% of patients increased their body weight > 2 kg. The decrease in physical activity and the increase in smoking were significantly greater in urban patients (P < .05).

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane library was conducted for all eligible studies range from inception to February 29, 2020. Studies with control group were included. Treatment group received convalescent plasma therapy, and control group may receive any therapy other than convalescent plasma therapy. Odds ratios (ORs), mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled for categorical and continuous outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1997 patients from 13 studies were included, and seven studies were prospectively designed. Pooled analysis indicated convalescent plasma treatment significantly reduced the mortality by 51% (OR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.67). Subgroup analyses by publication time, study design, and influenza A revealed similar results. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the results were stable. In addition, convalescent plasma therapy reduced mechanical ventilation requirement (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.59), while it was not associated with less use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 0.83 to 4.83) and shorter length of hospital stay (MD: -2.20, 95% CI: -4.98 to 0.57days). Pooled estimates showed there was no difference in serious adverse effects between the convalescent plasma treatment and control groups (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.13). CONCLUSION: Convalescent plasma therapy significantly reduced the mortality and mechanical ventilation requirements of patients with virus-induced severe acute respiratory infections, without serious adverse effects.

Yet, it remains unclear how temporal changes in the salience of a grand challenge impact innovation performances of partnerships. We address this research gap by bridging the literature on issue salience, responsible innovation and interorganizational relationships. We argue that shocks either aid or harm the performance of partnerships for responsible innovation depending on whether their domains are directly or indirectly affected. The Ebola outbreak in 2014 sets the empirical context to test our theory. We find that while the innovation performance of Ebola partnerships formed after the outbreak rose eleven-fold, the performance of partnerships treating Influenza fell by 84.9 per cent.

An electronic questionnaire regarding the strictest confinement period in Norway (13 March-17 April 2020) was distributed to dental staff. Among the 1237 respondents, 727 (59%) treated patients, of whom 170 (14%) worked in clinics designated to treat patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. Out of them 88% (143) received training and 64% (103) simulation in additional infection prevention procedures, while 27 (24%) respondents reported deviation. In total, 1051 (85%) respondents perceived that dental staff had a high risk of being infected, 1039 (84%) that their workplace handled the current situation well, 767 (62%) that their workplace had adequate infection control equipment and 507 (41%) agreed that their workplace is well equipped to handle an escalation. Before an appointment, 1182 (96%) respondents always/often inquired per phone information if a patient experienced symptoms of COVID-19, and 1104 (89%) asked about a history of travel to affected areas. Twice as many patients on average per week were treated by phone than in a clinic. A lower proportion of dental staff in high incidence counties applied additional infection prevention measures compared to low and medium incidence counties. To conclude, urgent dental health care was managed relatively well in Norway. Additional training of the dental staff in adequate infection prevention and step-by-step procedures may be needed. These results may be used to improve the dental health service's response to future outbreaks.","Stangvaltaite-Mouhat, Lina; Uhlen, Marte-Mari; Skudutyte-Rysstad, Rasa; Szyszko Hovden, Ewa Alicja; Shabestari, Maziar; Ansteinsson, Vibeke Elise",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),381,16

This article reviews current and new trends in NORA, trends in anesthesia management in nonoperating room settings, and the evolving debates surrounding these trends. RECENT FINDINGS: National data suggests that NORA cases will continue to rise relative to operating room (OR) anesthesia and there will continue to be a shift towards performing more interventional procedures outside of the OR. These trends have important implications for the safety of interventional procedures as they become increasingly more complex and patients continue to be older and more frail. In order for anesthesia providers and proceduralists to be prepared for this future, rigorous standards must be set for safe anesthetic care outside of the OR.Although the overall association between NORA and patient morbidity and mortality remains unclear, focused studies point toward trends specific to each non-OR procedure type. Given increasing patient and procedure complexity, anesthesiology teams may see a larger role in the interventional suite. However, the ideal setting and placement of anesthesia staff for interventional procedures remain controversial. Also, the impact of COVID-19 on the growth and utilization of non-OR anesthesia remains unclear, and it remains to be seen how the pandemic will influence the delivery of NORA procedures in postpandemic settings. SUMMARY: NORA is a rapidly growing field of anesthesia. Continuing discussions of complication rates and mortality in different subspecialty areas will determine the need for anesthesia care and quality improvement efforts in each setting. As new noninvasive procedures are developed, new data will continue to shape debates surrounding anesthesia care outside of the operating room.","Du, Austin L; Robbins, Kimberly; Waterman, Ruth S; Urman, Richard D; Gabriel, Rodney A",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,381,21

Liquid chalk is a commonly used accessory in gyms and is comprised of magnesium carbonate and alcohol that quickly evaporates on the hands to leave a layer of dry chalk. We investigated whether liquid chalk is an antiseptic against highly pathogenic human viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, and noroviruses. Chalk was applied before or after virus, inoculum and recovery of infectious virus was determined to mimic the use in the gym. We observed that addition of chalk before or after virus contact led to a significant reduction in recovery of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus but had little impact on norovirus. These observations suggest that the use and application of liquid chalk can be an effective and suitable antiseptic for major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games. IMPORTANCE To restrict the potential transmission and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the use of liquid chalk has been a requirement in an active gym setting. However, its effectiveness has not been scientifically proven. Here, we show that the application of liquid chalk before or after virus inoculum significantly impacts recovery of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses but not noroviruses. Thus, our study has shown that the implementation and application of liquid chalk in communal social gym settings is effective in reducing the infectivity of respiratory viruses, and this supports the use of liquid chalk in major sporting events to restrict the impact of COVID-19 on our communities.","McAuley, Julie L; Deerain, Joshua M; Hammersla, William; Aktepe, Turgut E; Purcell, Damian F J; Mackenzie, Jason M",mSphere,381,24

A scoping review,17.778921,7.137088,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein is the target for the antiviral drug Remdesivir (RDV). With RDV clinical trials on COVID-19 patients showing a reduced hospitalisation time. During the spread of the virus, the RdRp has developed several mutations, with the most frequent being A97V and P323L. The current study sought to investigate whether A97V and P323L mutations influence the binding of RDV to the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 compared to wild-type (WT). The interaction of RDV with WT-, A97V-, and P323L-RdRp were measured using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and the free binding energies were extracted. Results showed that RDV that bound to WT- and A97V-RdRp had a similar dynamic motion and internal residue fluctuations, whereas RDV interaction with P323L-RdRp exhibited a tighter molecular conformation, with a high internal motion near the active site. This was further corroborated with RDV showing a higher binding affinity to P323L-RdRp (-24.1 kcal/mol) in comparison to WT-RdRp (-17.3 kcal/mol). This study provides insight into the potential significance of administering RDV to patients carrying the SARS-CoV-2 P323L-RdRp mutation, which may have a more favourable chance of alleviating the SARS-CoV-2 illness in comparison to WT-RdRp carriers, thereby suggesting further scientific consensus for the usage of Remdesivir as clinical candidate against COVID-19.","Mohammad, Anwar; Al-Mulla, Fahd; Wei, Dong-Qing; Abubaker, Jehad",Biomolecules,381,16

In this study, we aimed to analyze the control measures implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as evaluating the responses and outcomes at different phases for epidemic control in Taiwan. (2) Methods: This case study reviewed responses to COVID-19 and the effectiveness of a range of control measures implemented for epidemic control in Taiwan and assessed all laboratory-confirmed cases between 11 January until 20 December 2020, inclusive of these dates. The confirmation of COVID-19 infection was defined as the positive result of a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction test taken from a nasopharyngeal swab. Test results were reported by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. The incidence rate, mortality rate, and testing rate were compiled, and the risk ratio was provided to gain insights into the effectiveness of prevention measures. (3) Results and Discussion: This study presents retrospective data on the COVID-19 incidence rate in Taiwan, combined with the vital preventive control measures, in a timeline of the early stage of the epidemic that occurred in Taiwan. The implementation of multiple strategy control measures and the assistance of technologies to control the COVID-19 epidemic in Taiwan led to a relatively slower trend in the outbreak compared to the neighboring countries. In Taiwan, 766 confirmed patients were included, comprised of 88.1% imported cases and 7.2% local transmission cases, within the studied period. The incidence rate of COVID-19 in Taiwan during the studied period was 32 per million people, with a mortality rate of 0.3 per million people. Our analysis showed a significantly raised incidence risk ratio in the countries of interest in comparison to Taiwan during the study period; in the range of 1.9 to 947.5. The outbreak was brought under control through epidemic policies and hospital strategies implemented by the Taiwan Government. (4) Conclusion: Taiwan's preventive strategies resulted in a drastically lower risk for Taiwan nationals of contracting COVID-19 when new pharmaceutical drug or vaccines were not yet available. The preventive strategies employed by Taiwan could serve as a guide and reference for future epidemic control strategies.","Tan, Ting Wan; Tan, Han Ling; Chang, Man Na; Lin, Wen Shu; Chang, Chih Ming",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),381,1

We hypothesized that the eNose could also be used as an early monitoring tool to identify responders more accurately at early stage of treatment when compared to baseline. In this proof-of-concept study we aimed to definitely discriminate responders from non-responders after six weeks of treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational study in patients with advanced NSCLC eligible for anti-PD-1 treatment. The efficacy of treatment was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 at 3-month follow-up. We analyzed SpiroNose exhaled breath data of 94 patients (training cohort n = 62, validation cohort n = 32). Data analysis involved signal processing and statistics based on Independent Samples T-tests and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) followed by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: In the training cohort, a specificity of 73% was obtained at a 100% sensitivity level to identify objective responders. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.95 (CI: 0.89-1.00). In the validation cohort, these results were confirmed with an AUC of 0.97 (CI: 0.91-1.00). CONCLUSION: Exhaled breath analysis by eNose early during treatment allows for a highly accurate, non-invasive and low-cost identification of advanced NSCLC patients who benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy.","Buma, Alessandra I G; Muller, Mirte; de Vries, Rianne; Sterk, Peter J; van der Noort, Vincent; Wolf-Lansdorf, Marguerite; Farzan, Niloufar; Baas, Paul; van den Heuvel, Michel M",Lung Cancer,381,1

Early diagnosis is the milestone in their mitigation, control, and eradication. Many diagnostic techniques are showing great success and have many advantages, such as the rapid turnover of the results, high accuracy, and high specificity and sensitivity. However, some of these techniques have several pitfalls if samples were not collected, processed, and transported in the standard ways and if these techniques were not practiced with extreme caution and precision. This may lead to false-negative/positive results. This may affect the downstream management of the affected cases. These techniques require regular fine-tuning, upgrading, and optimization. The continuous evolution of new strains and viruses belong to the coronaviruses is hampering the success of many classical techniques. There are urgent needs for next generations of coronaviruses diagnostic assays that overcome these pitfalls. This new generation of diagnostic tests should be able to do simultaneous, multiplex, and high-throughput detection of various coronavirus in one reaction. Furthermore, the development of novel assays and techniques that enable the in situ detection of the virus on the environmental samples, especially air, water, and surfaces, should be given considerable attention in the future.

AHNE usually involves the subcortical white matter but not the cortical grey matter. This study describes the disruptive effects of AHNE associated with SARS-CoV-2 on cognitive function in a previously healthy and sound middle-aged woman resulting from alterations in cortical areas involved in the cognitive network. CASE REPORT A 44-year-old previously healthy woman with a history of inter-state travel developed a flu-like illness, followed by acute, steadily progressive cognitive impairment. She was admitted in a comatose state after a first tonic-clonic seizure. Blood tests were non-informative. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was indicative of AHNE. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed mild lymphocytosis with normal protein and normal glucose but an elevated IgG index. After testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, she was administered steroids. Treatment was ineffective, and the patient died. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 is a potential central nervous system (CNS) pathogen, which may manifest as AHNE. These patients may present with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and frontal dysexecutive syndrome, with cognitive impairment being the presenting feature of neuro-coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The patient described in this report is unique for acute-onset and isolated cognitive impairments due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of clinical or radiological respiratory manifestations. These findings may help in the early detection and diagnosis of neuro-COVID-19, especially among clinicians and neurologists working in areas of endemic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ghosh, Ritwik; Dubey, Souvik; Finsterer, Josef; Chatterjee, Subham; Ray, Biman Kanti",Am J Case Rep,381,1

The research was carried out in an area inhabited by 200,000 people. The amount of waste collected in the communes in yellow containers in 2016-2019 increased systematically in communes: rural by 75.8, urban-rural by 44.9 and urban by 17.8%. The collection efficiency expressed in the degree of collection was the highest and grew fastest in rural areas (from 25.1 to 35.5%). In cities, it practically did not change (14.4-15.8%). The weight of recyclable components represented on average 39.9% of the weight of yellow bag waste. Plastic bottles (PET) packaging prevailed, the share of which changed from 19.6 to 14.8%, including the share of colourless PET decreasing from 7.9 to 5.8%. At present, revenue from the sale of secondary raw materials obtained from waste collected separately to yellow bags covers only 26% of the costs related to the recycling and recovery of waste delivered to the installation. Support for separate collection of plastics through recovery organisations, i.e., entrepreneurs who are obliged to recover and recycle waste, is symbolic.","Polomka, Jacek; Jedrczak, Andrzej; Myszograj, Sylwia",,381,7

Susceptibility to these diseases is partly due to the intrinsic ageing process, characterized by genomic, cellular and metabolic hallmarks and immunosenescence, and is associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota. Importantly, in the lungs, ageing is also associated with a dysbiosis and loss of resilience of the resident microbiota and alterations of the gut-lung axis. Notably, as malnutrition is often observed in the elderly, nutrition is one of the most accessible modifiable factors affecting both senescence and microbiota. This article reviews the changes affecting the lung and its resident microbiota during ageing, as well as the interconnections between malnutrition, senescence, microbiota, gut-lung axis and respiratory health. As the communication along the gut-lung axis becomes more permissive with ageing, this review also explores the evidence that the gut and lung microbiota are key players in the maintenance of healthy lungs, and as such, are potential targets for nutrition-based preventive strategies against lung disease in elderly populations.","Saint-Criq, Vinciane; Lugo-Villarino, Geanncarlo; Thomas, Muriel",Ageing Res Rev,381,1

Indeed, several of the manifestations of COVID-19, such as inflammation, hypercoagulation, hyperferritinemia, and immune dysfunction are also reminiscent of iron overload. Although iron is essential for all living cells, free unbound iron, resulting from iron dysregulation and overload, is very reactive and potentially toxic due to its role in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS react with and damage cellular lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins, with consequent activation of either acute or chronic inflammatory processes implicated in multiple clinical conditions. Moreover, iron-catalyzed lipid damage exerts a direct causative effect on the newly discovered nonapoptotic cell death known as ferroptosis. Unlike apoptosis, ferroptosis is immunogenic and not only leads to amplified cell death but also promotes a series of reactions associated with inflammation. Iron chelators are generally safe and are proven to protect patients in clinical conditions characterized by iron overload. There is also an abundance of evidence that iron chelators possess antiviral activities. Furthermore, the naturally occurring iron chelator lactoferrin (Lf) exerts immunomodulatory as well as anti-inflammatory effects and can bind to several receptors used by coronaviruses thereby blocking their entry into host cells. Iron chelators may consequently be of high therapeutic value during the present COVID-19 pandemic.","Habib, Hosam M; Ibrahim, Sahar; Zaim, Aamnah; Ibrahim, Wissam H",Biomed Pharmacother,381,24

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 63 patients of both sexes aged 11-18 years. Orthodontic treatment was carried out for the close position of the teeth with a distal permanent bite (K07.2) and cleft palate and lips (Q37.1). Patients were divided into three groups depending on the type of toothbrush used for individual oral hygiene: group 1 (n=21) - an orthodontic manual toothbrush (Professor Persin, «Spazzolificio Piave¼, Italy); Group 2 (n=22) - an ultrasonic toothbrush (Emmi-dent, EMAG AG, Germany) and group 3 (n=20) - an electric toothbrush (""Oral-B Pro-Expert, «Procter & Gamble¼, USA). RESULTS: The amount of soft plaque was assessed by the Silness-Loe hygiene index in the subgingival region. The activity of proteolytic enzymes - elastase, collagenase, and a &#945;-inhibitor of proteinases was determined by the enzymatic method using a XL 200 biochemical analyzer («Erba Lachema¼, Czech Republic). The accumulation of plaque in the gingival region on both jaws during the entire period of orthodontic treatment is most pronounced when using a manual brush compared to ultrasonic and electric brushes. An increase in proteolytic activity in the gingival fluid with a simultaneous decrease in antiprotease potential with long-term orthodontic treatment of patients was observed when using a manual orthodontic brush, which can be regarded as an increase in the activity of the pathogenic factors for the development of local inflammatory and destructive changes. CONCLUSION: To prevent inflammatory and destructive changes during prolonged orthodontic treatment of patients, the use of ultrasonic and electric toothbrushes in daily oral hygiene is justified.","Zorina, O A; Boriskina, O A; Starikova, N V; Petrukhina, N B; Nechaev, A A; Prohodnaja, V A",Stomatologiia (Mosk),381,2

PBMCs from rhesus macaques vaccinated with a DNA vaccine encoding the full-length S protein were isolated, and an ELISPOT assay was used to identify the recognized T cell epitopes among a total of 158 18-mer and 10-aa-overlapping peptides spanning the full-length S protein. Six multipeptide-based epitopes located in the S1 region, with four of the six located in the receptor-binding domain, were defined as the most frequently recognized epitopes in macaques. The conservation of the epitopes across species was also verified, and peptide mixtures for T cell response detection were established. Six newly defined T cell epitopes were found in the current study, which may provide a novel potential target for T cell response detection and the diagnosis and vaccine design of SARS-CoV-2 based on multipeptide subunit-based epitopes.","Liu, Xiaojuan; Li, Yuzhong; Xiao, Hongjian; Bi, Yanwei; Gong, Yue; Hu, Zhengrong; Zeng, Yaxin; Sun, Ming; He, Zhanlong; Lu, Shan; Li, Qihan; Cun, Wei",J Immunol,381,26

However, few studies focused on the mental health of ICU healthcare workers. This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19 on ICU healthcare workers in China. Methods: We distributed the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and seven-item General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) online to ICU healthcare workers in China. Respondents were divided into frontline and second-line according to whether they have contact with COVID-19 patients. Depressive and anxiety symptoms of all respondents were evaluated based on their questionnaire scores. Results: There were 731 ICU healthcare workers finally enrolled in our study, including 303 (41.5%) male, 383 (52.4%) doctors, and 617 (84.4%) aged 26-45 years. All in all, 482 (65.9%) ICU healthcare workers reported symptoms of depression, while 429 (58.7%) reported anxiety. There was no significant difference between frontline (n = 325) and second-line (n = 406) respondents in depression (P = 0.15) and anxiety severity (P = 0.56). Logistic regression analysis showed that being female, ICU work time >5 years, and night duty number &#8805;10 were risk factors of developing depressive and anxiety symptoms. Income reduction was separately identified as risk of anxiety. Additionally, ICU work time >5 years was also identified as risk of developing moderate-severe depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: Frontline ICU work was not associated with higher risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic remission period in China. Actions like controlling night duty number, ensuring vacation, and increasing income should be taken to relieve mental health problem.

It mainly attacks people's respiratory system. Many patients with severe COVID-19 require a ventilator to support breathing, and their lung function is often impaired to varying degrees after ventilator weaning. Acupuncture has been reported to improve respiratory function, but there is no evidence that it can improve respiratory function in ventilator users with COVID-19 after they are removed from the machine. The protocol of the systematic review and meta-analysis will clarify safety and effectiveness of acupuncture on respiratory rehabilitation after weaning from the ventilator during the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: We will search PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, Wanfang Database, Clinical Trials and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. Relevant English language and Chinese language literature will be included. A combination of subject words and free text words will be applied in the searches.

We must integrate the humane 'into the loop' of human-AT interactions to realize the full potential of wireless inclusion for people with disabilities and older adults. Embedding ethics into these new technologies is critical and requires a co-design approach, with end users participating throughout. Developing humane AT begins with a participatory, user-centered design embedded in an iterative co-creation process, and guided by an ethos prioritizing beneficence, user autonomy and agency. To gain insight into plausible AT development pathways ('futures'), we use scenario planning as a tool to articulate themes in the research literature. Four plausible scenarios are developed and compared to identify one as a desired 'humane' future for AT development. Policy and practice recommendations derived from this scenario, and their implications for the role of AT in the advancement of human potential are explored.","Bricout, John; Greer, Julienne; Fields, Noelle; Xu, Ling; Tamplain, Priscila; Doelling, Kris; Sharma, Bonita",,381,21

While preclinical studies have shown promising therapeutic effects of low-intensity tFUS in AD models, its efficacy and safety remain unclear in humans. In this pilot study, we investigated the effects of low-intensity tFUS on blood-brain barrier opening, the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglu), and cognition in patients with AD. METHODS: After receiving institutional review board approval, four patients with AD received tFUS to the hippocampus immediately after an intravenous injection of a microbubble ultrasound contrast agent. Sonication was delivered at low-intensity, at a pressure level below the threshold for blood-brain barrier opening. Patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography, and neuropsychological assessments before and after the tFUS procedure. A whole-brain voxel-wise paired t test was conducted to compare rCMRglu before and after tFUS. RESULTS: The sonication, as anticipated, did not show evidence of active blood-brain barrier opening on T1 dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. rCMRglu in the superior frontal gyrus (P<0.001), middle cingulate gyrus (P<0.001), and fusiform gyrus increased after tFUS (P=0.001). Patients demonstrated mild improvement in measures of memory, executive, and global cognitive function following tFUS. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that hippocampal sonication with low-intensity tFUS may have beneficial effects on cerebral glucose metabolism and cognitive function in patients with AD. Further larger studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of tFUS in AD.","Jeong, Hyeonseok; Im, Jooyeon Jamie; Park, Jong-Sik; Na, Seung-Hee; Lee, Wonhye; Yoo, Seung-Schik; Song, In-Uk; Chung, Yong-An",,381,24

Methods: Number, characteristics and delay to presentation of ACAs to our institution during the study period (28 February-30 April 2020) were compared with the corresponding 2019 period. Non-parametric correlation analyses between daily SARS-CoV-2 cases in Malta, Italy and the UK and daily ACAs were performed. Differences in cardiac death distribution (community vs. in-hospital) during the two periods were analysed. Results: There was a significant decline in daily ACAs in 2020 (median 3 [IQR 3]) vs. 2019 (median 5 [IQR 4]), p < 0.001. Patient characteristics were comparable. Delay to presentation for 2020 ACAs was significantly higher across all categories (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] median: 2019 [1 h, IQR 1] vs. 2020 [4 h, IQR 43.8], p = 0.009; non-ST-elevation-acute coronary syndrome [NSTE-ACS] median: 2019 [4 h, IQR 71] vs. 2020 [48 h, IQR 199], p = 0.001; non-ACS median: 2019 [24 h, IQR 95] vs. 2020 [84 h, IQR 499.8], p < 0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between ACAs and daily Malta SARS-CoV-2 infection cases (r s = -0.298, p = 0.018) but not with cases in Italy and the UK when controlling for Malta cases. Significantly more cardiac deaths occurred in the community in 2020 (107, 61.8%) compared to 2019 (87, 46.8%) (p = 0.004). Conclusion: Fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection led to a significant avoidance of acute cardiac care with an accompanying rise in community cardiac deaths, suggesting a need for better public education on recognising and addressing cardiovascular symptoms.","Grech, Neil; Xuereb, Rachel; England, Kathleen; Xuereb, Robert G; Caruana, Maryanne",Z Gesundh Wiss,381,26

Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cornerstone of an effective public health response. However, efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents, limitations in the availability of swabs used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, limitations in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers collecting the NPS specimens, and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens. Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses. OBJECTIVE: We aim to document the ability of patients to self-collect sufficient specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and serology. METHODS: Patient self-collection of samples will be done with observation by a health care provider during a telemedicine session. Participants will be mailed a specimen collection kit, engage in a telehealth session with a provider through a HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)-compliant video meeting, and collect specimens while being observed by the provider. Providers will record whether they are confident in the suitability of the specimen for laboratory testing that would inform clinical decision making. We will objectively assess the sufficiency of biological material in the mailed-in specimens. RESULTS: The protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) on March 30, 2020 (Protocol number 371). To date, we have enrolled 159 participants. CONCLUSIONS: Defining a conceptual framework for assessing the sufficiency of patient-collected samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses to infection is critical for facilitating public health responses and providing PPE-sparing options to increase testing. Validation of alternative methods of specimen collection should include objective measures of the sufficiency of specimens for testing. A strong evidence base for diversifying testing modalities will improve tools to guide public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sullivan, Patrick Sean; Sailey, Charles; Guest, Jodie Lynn; Guarner, Jeannette; Kelley, Colleen; Siegler, Aaron Julius; Valentine-Graves, Mariah; Gravens, Laura; Del Rio, Carlos; Sanchez, Travis Howard",JMIR Public Health Surveill,381,20

For a household located in Kragujevac (Central Serbia), 4 simulation scenarios were analyzed (S1 - reference case, S2 - mild protection measures, S3 - semi-quarantine measures, S4 - complete quarantine) to assess the link between people's behavior (on the one hand) and the consumption of natural gas, electricity and water (on the other hand), in the residential sector, in unforeseen circumstances, such as the COVID-19 virus pandemic. The analysis was conducted numerically for the month of March 2020, using EnergyPlus software packages. In defining the above scenarios, a one-minute time step schedule of people's behavior was used, taking into account the number of family members in the household, their age, occupation, lifestyle, habits (all in accordance with cultural and socio-economic circumstances), as well as the measures taken by the Government of the Republic of Serbia to fight the pandemic. Also, an analysis of energy consumption at the level of the city of Kragujevac for the past three years was made, based on data obtained from public companies - distributors (thermal energy, natural gas, electricity, water). In this paper, an analysis of air quality for the same time period was conducted, which is closely related to energy consumption and limited population movement. The simulatinos show that the consumption of natural gas can increase by 21.26% (S2), electricity by 58.39% (S4), and the consumption of water from the city water supply network by 25.45% (S3) compared to the reference case (S1). On the other hand, based on the invoice for payment of services to distributors, the actual energy consumption that was made on the analyzed house during the month of March 2020 was: natural gas (260.36 Sm3), electricity (1 418 kWh), and water (22.5 m3). The conducted economic analysis showed that the largest funds at the level of the entire facility were allocated in S3 (27.33% more than in S1), and that the actual costs were 15.09% higher than in S1, and 16.41% lower than in S2.","Cvetkovic, Dragan; Nesovic, Aleksandar; Terzic, Ivana",Energy Build,381,1

The investigation is focused on indicators such as weight, physical activity, and consumption habits through the adoption of healthy and not healthy food. Centered on a quantitative approach, the research is based on the application of a questionnaire to a sample of 741 Portuguese consumers, between November 2020 and February 2021, a period during which the most severe measures of social isolation were imposed by the Portuguese government, since the beginning of the pandemic. Moreover, the questionnaire was applied to consumers over 18 years old. According to this population, and considering a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of 4%, the sample has a minimum of 601 responses. Being so, the results of this research are representative for the Portuguese food consumers. The theoretical model was estimated using Partial Least Squares (PLS) in the Smart PLS 3.0 software. The obtained results allowed us to conclude that the Portuguese perception of their weight did not change in the pandemic, despite showing that in general, the pandemic had a negative impact on their physical condition. On the other hand, the results show that the Portuguese associate the practice of physical exercise with physical well-being. Respondents also confirm a positive relationship between “positive eating behaviors (such as consumption of fruits and vegetables, low saturated foods and rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats” and water consumption) and “the perception of physical health in general”. On the contrary, respondents’ perception of the choice of negative eating behaviors (measured by the consumption of products with a high content of salt and sugar, snacks, and processed frozen and pre-cooked foods) have a negative impact on the “assessment of physical health, in the COVID-19 pandemic”. Hence, it was concluded that the Portuguese consider that an eventual increase in weight does not necessarily correspond to a perception of worse physical health;the practice of physical exercise and good eating habits corresponds to a perception of better physical health;the adoption of bad eating habits corresponds to the perception of bad physical health.","Oliveira, José Santos Tânia Sousa Marlene Lopes João M.; Gomes, Sofia Oliveira Márcio",Social Sciences,381,20

We aimed to better understand the factors that influence the trajectory of tracheostomy care in this population to facilitate capacity planning and improve outcomes. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of patients in a high-volume centre in the worst-affected region of the UK including all patients that underwent tracheostomy for COVID-19 pneumonitis ventilatory wean from 1st March 2020 to 10th May 2020. The primary outcome was time from insertion to decannulation. The analysis utilised Cox regression to account for patients that are still progressing through their tracheostomy pathway. RESULTS: At the point of analysis, a median 21 days (IQR 15-28) post-tracheostomy and 39 days (IQR 32-45) post-intubation, 35/69 (57.4%) patients had been decannulated a median of 17 days (IQR 12-20.5) post-insertion. The overall median age was 55 (IQR 48-61) with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. In Cox regression analysis, FiO2 at tracheostomy &#8805; 0.4 (HR 1.80; 95% CI 0.89-3.60; p = 0.048) and last pre-tracheostomy peak cough flow (HR 2.27; 95% CI 1.78-4.45; p = 0.001) were independent variables associated with prolonged time to decannulation. CONCLUSION: Higher FiO2 at tracheostomy and higher pre-tracheostomy peak cough flow are associated with increased delay in COVID-19 tracheostomy patient decannulation. These finding comprise the most comprehensive report of COVID-19 tracheostomy decannulation to date and will assist service planning for future peaks of this pandemic.","Tornari, Chrysostomos; Surda, Pavol; Takhar, Arunjit; Amin, Nikul; Dinham, Alison; Harding, Rachel; Ranford, David A; Archer, Sally K; Wyncoll, Duncan; Tricklebank, Stephen; Ahmad, Imran; Simo, Ricard; Arora, Asit",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,381,1

Targeting the main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is an appealing approach for drug development because this enzyme plays a significant role in the viral replication and transcription. The available crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro determined in the presence of different ligands and inhibitor-like compounds provide a platform for the quick development of selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. In this study, we utilized the structural information of co-crystallized SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for the structure-guided drug discovery of high-affinity inhibitors from the PubChem database. The screened compounds were selected on the basis of their physicochemical properties, drug-likeliness, and strength of affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Finally, we have identified 6-Deaminosinefungin (PubChem ID: 10428963) and UNII-O9H5KY11SV (PubChem ID: 71481120) as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro which may be further exploited in drug development to address SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Both compounds are structural analogs of known antivirals, having considerable protease inhibitory potential with improved pharmacological properties. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations suggested SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with these compounds is stable during the simulation period with minimal structural changes. This work provides enough evidence for further implementation of the identified compounds in the development of effective therapeutics of COVID-19.","Mohammad, Taj; Shamsi, Anas; Anwar, Saleha; Umair, Mohd; Hussain, Afzal; Rehman, Md Tabish; AlAjmi, Mohamed F; Islam, Asimul; Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz",Virus Res,381,24

In this study, pre-processing is used to reduce the effect of intensity variations between CT slices. Then histogram thresholding is used to isolate the background of the CT lung scan. Each CT lung scan undergoes a feature extraction which involves deep learning and a Q-deformed entropy algorithm. The obtained features are classified using a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network classifier. Subsequently, combining all extracted features significantly improves the performance of the LSTM network to precisely discriminate between COVID-19, pneumonia and healthy cases.

The RAS is a complicated network of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (i.e., AT1R, AT2R, MASR, and MRGD) orchestrating the effects of several hormones (i.e., angiotensin II, angiotensin (1-7), and alamandine) produced by protease-based transmembrane receptors (ACE1 and ACE2). Two signaling axes have been identified in the RAS endocrine system that mediate the proliferative actions of angiotensin II (i.e., the AT1R-based pathway) or the anti-proliferative effects of RAS hormones (i.e., the AT2R-, MAS-, and MRGD-based pathways). Disruption of the balance between these two axes can cause different diseases (e.g., cardiovascular pathologies and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2- (SARS-CoV-2)-based COVID-19 disease). It is now accepted that all the components of the RAS endocrine system are expressed in cancer, including cancer of the breast. Breast cancer (BC) is a multifactorial pathology for which there is a continuous need to identify novel drugs. Here, I reviewed the possible roles of both axes of the RAS endocrine network as potential druggable pathways in BC. Remarkably, the analysis of the current knowledge of the different GPCRs of the RAS molecular system not only confirms that AT1R could be considered a drug target and that its inhibition by losartan and candesartan could be useful in the treatment of BC, but also identifies Mas-related GPCR member D (MRGD) as a druggable protein. Overall, the RAS of GPCRs offers multifaceted opportunities for the development of additional compounds for the treatment of BC.","Acconcia, Filippo",,381,27

After infection, large amounts of inflammatory cytokines are secreted, known as the cytokine storm. These cytokines can cause pulmonary damage induced by inflammation resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. One of the therapeutic approaches for treatment of ARDS is a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). MSCs suppress inflammation and reduce lung injury through their immunomodulatory properties. MSCs also have the potential to prevent apoptosis of the lung cells and regenerate them. But our suggestion is using MSCs-derived exosomes. Because these exosomes apply the same immunomodulatory and tissue repair effects of MSCs and they don't have problems associated to cell maintenance and injections. For investigation the hypothesis, MSCs should be isolated from tissues and characterized. Then, the exosomes should be isolated from the supernatants and characterized. These exosomes should be injected into a transgenic animal for COVID-19. In the final section, lung function assessment, histological examination, micro-CT, differential leukocyte, viral load analysis, cytokine assay, and CRP level analysis can be investigated. COVID-19 treatment is currently focused on supportive therapies and no vaccine has been developed for it. So, numerous researches are needed to find potential therapies.

Findings: The authors show that accounting numbers, techniques and quantitative information were mobilised by the government as a way of formulating and implementing the JobKeeper scheme, a program designed to minimise the economic impacts of COVID-19. Originality/value: The authors demonstrate the centrality of accounting concepts as a rhetorical device and their use by government in times of crisis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Nikidehaghani, M.; Cortese, C.","Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal",381,20

(Special Issue: COVID-19 in metabolism.),17.533037,7.0329056,2020,"BACKGROUND: African-Americans/Blacks have suffered higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 than all other racial groups. This study aims to identify the causes of this health disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment interventions. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients admitted over a 52-day period at the height of the pandemic in the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population. RESULTS: Of the 1103 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 529 required hospitalization and were included in the study. 88% of patients were Black; and a majority (52%) were 61-80 years old with a mean body mass index in the ""obese"" range. 98% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (79%) pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (56%) and chronic kidney disease (17%). Patients with chronic kidney disease who received hemodialysis were found to have lower mortality, than those who did not receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis Age > 60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox proportional hazards modeling for time to death demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD/Asthma, and favorable effects on outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg/L), LDH (551, 638 U/L), glucose (182, 163 mg/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng/mL), and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (8.3:10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at 48-96 h. Of the 529 inpatients 48% died, and one third of them died within the first 3 days of admission. 159/529patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 86% died and of the remaining 370 patients, 30% died. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients in our predominantly Black neighborhood had higher in-hospital mortality, likely due to higher prevalence of comorbidities. Early dialysis and pre-admission intake of ACE inhibitors/ARBs improved patient outcomes. Early escalation of care based on comorbidities and key laboratory indicators is critical for improving outcomes in African-American patients.","Gupta, Raavi; Agrawal, Raag; Bukhari, Zaheer; Jabbar, Absia; Wang, Donghai; Diks, John; Alshal, Mohamed; Emechebe, Dokpe Yvonne; Brunicardi, F Charles; Lazar, Jason M; Chamberlain, Robert; Burza, Aaliya; Haseeb, M A",BMC Infect Dis,381,32

Here, we ask who was most likely to do so during the first wave of the pandemic. DESIGN: Quota-sampled cross-sectional and panel data from eight Western democracies (Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States). METHODS: We fielded online public opinion surveys to 26,508 citizens between 19 March and 16 May. The surveys included questions about protective behaviour, perceptions of the pandemic (threat and self-efficacy), as well as broader attitudes towards society (institutional and interpersonal trust). We employ multilevel and fixed-effects regression models to analyse the relationship between these variables. RESULTS: Consistent with prior research on epidemics, perceptions of threat turn out as culturally uniform determinants of both avoidant and preventive forms of protective behaviour. On this basis, authorities could foster compliance by appealing to fear of COVID-19, but there may be normative and practical limits to such a strategy. Instead, we find that another major source of compliance is a sense of self-efficacy. Using individual-level panel data, we find evidence that self-efficacy is amendable to change and exerts an effect on protective behaviour. Furthermore, the effects of fear are small among those who feel efficacious, creating a path to compliance without fear. In contrast, two other major candidates for facilitating compliance from the social sciences, interpersonal trust and institutional trust, have surprisingly little motivational power during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHOD: Ecological study that used epidemiological, demographic, environmental and variables on the structure of health services as explanatory variables. The analysis period was from March 15th (the start of the alarm state) until April 22nd, 2020. Incidence and mortality rates were the main response variables. The magnitude of the associations has been estimated using the Spearman correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Incidence and mortality rates at the time of decree of alarm status are associated with current incidence, mortality and hospital demand rates. Higher mean temperatures are significantly associated with a lower current incidence of COVID-19 in the autonomous communities. Likewise, a higher proportion of older people in nursing homes is significantly associated with a higher current mortality in the autonomous communities. CONCLUSION: It is possible to predict the evolution of the epidemic through the analysis of incidence and mortality. Lower temperatures and the proportion of older people in residences are factors associated with a worse prognosis. These parameters must be considered in decisions about the timing and intensity of the implementation of containment measures. In this sense, strengthening epidemiological surveillance is essential to improve predictions.","Medeiros Figueiredo, Alexandre; Daponte-Codina, Antonio; Moreira Marculino Figueiredo, Daniela Cristina; Toledo Vianna, Rodrigo Pinheiro; Costa de Lima, Kenio; Gil-García, Eugenia","Gac. sanit.

We evaluated sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, and agreement with a vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudoneutralization assay for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Sensitivity and agreement between Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay and pseudoneutralization assay measurements were evaluated using samples from patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, a majority of whom were hospitalized. Specificity was evaluated using samples from routine diagnostic testing/blood donors collected before December 2019 and thus deemed negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Cross-reactivity was evaluated using samples containing a wide range of potentially cross-reacting analytes, purchased from commercial vendors. For sensitivity and specificity, point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Agreement between the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay and the pseudoneutralization assay was calculated. The sensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in patients with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was 99.5% (95% CI, 97.0 to 100.0%) at &#8805;14 days post-PCR confirmation. Overall specificity (n = 10,453) was 99.80% (95% CI, 99.69 to 99.88%).

Application for community testing of symptomatic individuals for disease control purposes however raises challenges. SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests might offer an alternative, but quality evidence on their performance is limited. METHODS: We conducted an evaluation of the test accuracy of the 'BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2' (VRD) compared to qRT-PCR on combined nose/throat swabs obtained from symptomatic individuals at Municipal Health Service (MHS) COVID-19 test centers in the Netherlands. In part one of the study, with the primary objective to evaluate test sensitivity and specificity, all adults presenting at one MHS test center were eligible for inclusion. In part two, with the objective to evaluate test sensitivity stratified by Ct (cycle threshold)-value and time since symptom onset, adults who had a positive qRT-PCR obtained at a MHS test center were eligible. FINDINGS: In part one (n = 352) SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 4.8%, overall specificity 100% (95%CI: 98·9%-100%) and sensitivity 94·1% (95%CI: 71·1%-100%).

Quantitative and qualitative coronary angiography were analyzed by two observers in an independent core lab. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were included, of whom 142 (93.4%) had COVID-19 diagnosis confirmation. The median time between symptom onset and hospital admission was 5 (1-10) days. A total of 83 (54.6%) patients presented with ST-elevation MI. The median angiographic Syntax score was 16 (9.0-25.3) and 69.0% had multi-vessel disease. At least one complex lesion was found in 73.0% of patients, 51.3% had a thrombus containing lesion, and 57.9% had myocardial blush grades 0/1. The overall in-hospital mortality was 23.7%. ST-segment elevation MI presentation and baseline myocardial blush grades 0 or 1 were independently associated with a higher risk of death (HR 2.75, 95%CI 1.30-5.80 and HR 3.73, 95%CI 1.61-8.61, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have a MI in the context of ongoing COVID-19 mostly present complex coronary morphologies, implying a background of prior atherosclerotic disease superimposed on a thrombotic milieu. The in-hospital prognosis is poor with a markedly high mortality, prompting further investigation to better clarify this newly described condition.","Abizaid, Alexandre; Campos, Carlos M; Guimarães, Patrícia O; Costa, José de Ribamar; Falcão, Breno A A; Mangione, Fernanda; Caixeta, Adriano; Lemos, Pedro A; S de Brito, Fabio; Cavalcante, Ricardo; Bezerra, Cristiano Guedes; Cortes, Leandro; Ribeiro, Henrique B; de Souza, Francis R; Huemer, Natassja; do Val, Renata M; Caramelli, Bruno; Calderaro, Daniela; Lima, Felipe G; Hajjar, Ludhmila A; Mehran, Roxana; Filho, Roberto Kalil",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,381,20

A buffer with the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 at the time of sample collection could simplify and expand testing for COVID-19 to non-conventional settings. METHODS: We evaluated a guanidium thiocyanate-based buffer, eNAT&#8482; (Copan) as a possible transport and inactivation medium for downstream Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing to detect SARS-CoV-2. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 in eNAT and in diluted saliva was studied at different incubation times. The stability of viral RNA in eNAT was also evaluated for up to 7 days at room temperature (28°C), refrigerated conditions (4°C) and at 35°C. RESULTS: SARS-COV-2 virus spiked directly in eNAT could be inactivated at >5.6 log10 PFU/ml within a minute of incubation. When saliva was diluted 1:1 in eNAT, no cytopathic effect (CPE) on VeroE6 cells was observed, although SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected even after 30 min incubation and after two cell culture passages. A 1:2 (saliva:eNAT) dilution abrogated both CPE and detectable viral RNA after as little as 5 min incubation in eNAT. SARS-CoV-2 RNA from virus spiked at 5X the limit of detection remained positive up to 7 days of incubation in all tested conditions. CONCLUSION: eNAT and similar guanidinium thiocyanate-based media may be of value for transport, stabilization, and processing of clinical samples for RT-PCR based SARS-CoV-2 detection.","Banik, Sukalyani; Saibire, Kaheerman; Suryavanshi, Shraddha; Johns, Glenn; Chakravorty, Soumitesh; Kwiatkowski, Robert; Alland, David; Banada, Padmapriya P",PLoS One,381,16

As such, there has been a rapid escalation in scientific and clinical activity aimed at increasing our comprehension of this virus. This volume of work has led to early insights into risk factors associated with severity of disease, and mechanisms that underpin the virulence and dynamics involved in viral transmission. These insights ultimately may help guide potential therapeutics to reduce the human, economic and social impact of this pandemic. Importantly, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has emerged as an important organ influencing propensity to, and potentially severity of, COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, the gut microbiome has been linked to a variety of risk factors for COVID-19 infection, and manipulation of the gut microbiome is an attractive potential therapeutic target for a number of diseases. While data profiling the gut microbiome in COVID-19 infection to date are limited, they support the possibility of several routes of interaction between COVID-19, the gut microbiome, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) expression in the small bowel and colon and gut inflammation. This article will explore the evidence that implicates the gut microbiome as a contributing factor to the pathogenesis, severity and disease course of COVID-19, and speculate about the gut microbiome's capability as a therapeutic avenue against COVID-19. Lay summary: It has been noted that certain baseline gut profiles of COVID-19 patients are associated with a more severe disease course, and the gut microbiome impacts the disease course of several contributory risk factors to the severity of COVID-19. A protein called ACE-2, which is found in the small intestine among other sites, is a key receptor for COVID-19 virus entry; there is evidence that the gut microbiome influences ACE-2 receptor expression, and hence may play a role in influencing COVID-19 infectivity and disease severity. Furthermore, the gut microbiome plays a significant role in immune regulation, and hence may be pivotal in influencing the immune response to COVID-19. In terms of understanding COVID-19 treatments, the gut microbiome is known to interact with several drug classes being used to target COVID-19 and should be factored into our understanding of how patients respond to treatment. Importantly, our understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in COVID-19 infection remains in its infancy, but future research may potentially aid our mechanistic understanding of viral infection, and new ways in which we might approach treating it.","Segal, Jonathan P; Mak, Joyce W Y; Mullish, Benjamin H; Alexander, James L; Ng, Siew C; Marchesi, Julian R",Therap Adv Gastroenterol,381,25

Minimizing the spread of coronavirus and its economic consequences, and creating a new and safe lifestyle has now become the common goals of governments all over the world. Although governments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing various rules while interacting with relevant organizations to provide health service, vaccine research, and production of essential items, the complexities in the interactions between various stakeholders have proved to be challenging to have efficient and timely outputs. When different stakeholders (i.e. governments, organizations, and the public) are interacting with each other, a systems thinking process needs to be applied to capture the nuances of the interactions and the subsequent emergent behavior to effectively contribute to the system output (i.e. a safer way of life). This paper applied a system-thinking-inspired process called System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to analyze the current response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis treated various stakeholders as a part of the system, and it focused on the interactions among different stakeholders (i.e. functional blocks) within the system - i.e. 'Government', 'Foreign Governments', 'Organizations', and 'General Public', as well as the interactions with 'W.H.O'. The STPA analysis found 236 potential Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) (or unsafe interactions) among the stakeholder interactions, each of the UCAs was then further analyzed. In total 1440 causal factors of the UCAs were identified, and 2880 requirements were proposed to avoid such unsafe interactions.","Chen, Shufeng; Khastgir, Siddartha; Jennings, Paul",Saf Sci,381,14

It is the type of RNA virus that might infect animal and human species. In the severe stage, it causes pneumonia in human beings. In this research, hand-crafted and deep microscopic features are used to classify lung infection. The proposed work consists of two phases; in phase I, infected lung region is segmented using proposed U-Net deep learning model. The hand-crafted features are extracted such as histogram orientation gradient (HOG), noise to the harmonic ratio (NHr), and segmentation based fractal texture analysis (SFTA) from the segmented image, and optimum features are selected from each feature vector using entropy. In phase II, local binary patterns (LBPs), speeded up robust feature (Surf), and deep learning features are extracted using a pretrained network such as inceptionv3, ResNet101 from the input CT images, and select optimum features based on entropy. Finally, the optimum selected features using entropy are fused in two ways, (i) The hand-crafted features (HOG, NHr, SFTA, LBP, SURF) are horizontally concatenated/fused (ii) The hand-crafted features (HOG, NHr, SFTA, LBP, SURF) are combined/fused with deep features. The fused optimum features vector is passed to the ensemble models (Boosted tree, bagged tree, and RUSBoosted tree) in two ways for the COVID19 classification, (i) classification using fused hand-crafted features (ii) classification using fusion of hand-crafted features and deep features.

It is the largest hospital in Israel and was the first to face coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients in the country at the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To describe our experience with the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on our triage method in the emergency department (ED). Our goal was to keep the main hospitalization buildings clean of infection by separating COVID-19 positive patients from COVID-19 negative patients. METHODS: We divided our ED into two separate sections: a regular non-COVID-19 ED and an advanced biological ED. We created clear protocols of triage for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. We reviewed the data of patients admitted to our ED during the month of March and analyzed the results of our triage method in separating COVID-19 positive from negative patients. RESULTS: During the month of March 2020, 7957 patients were referred to our ED. Among them 2004 were referred to the biological ED and 5953 were referred to the regular ED. Of the 2004 patients referred to the biological ED, 1641 (81.8%) were sampled for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction of whom 143 (8.7%) were positive. Only two COVID-19 positive patients unintentionally entered the main clean hospital, making our triage almost full proof. CONCLUSIONS: Our triage method was successful in separating COVID-19 positive from negative patients and maintained the regular hospital clean of COVID-19 allowing treatment continuation of regular non-COVID-19 patients.","Levy, Yuval; Frenkel Nir, Yael; Ironi, Avinoah; Englard, Hindy; Regev-Yochay, Gili; Rahav, Galia; Afek, Arnon; Grossman, Ehud",Isr Med Assoc J,381,24

AIMS: To investigate the trajectory of mental health and well-being during the first 6 weeks of lockdown in adults in the UK. METHOD: A quota survey design and a sampling frame that permitted recruitment of a national sample was employed. Findings for waves 1 (31 March to 9 April 2020), 2 (10 April to 27 April 2020) and 3 (28 April to 11 May 2020) are reported here. A range of mental health factors was assessed: pre-existing mental health problems, suicide attempts and self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, defeat, entrapment, mental well-being and loneliness. RESULTS: A total of 3077 adults in the UK completed the survey at wave 1. Suicidal ideation increased over time. Symptoms of anxiety, and levels of defeat and entrapment decreased across waves whereas levels of depressive symptoms did not change significantly. Positive well-being also increased. Levels of loneliness did not change significantly over waves. Subgroup analyses showed that women, young people (18-29 years), those from more socially disadvantaged backgrounds and those with pre-existing mental health problems have worse mental health outcomes during the pandemic across most factors. CONCLUSIONS: The mental health and well-being of the UK adult population appears to have been affected in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasing rates of suicidal thoughts across waves, especially among young adults, are concerning.","O039,; Connor, Rory C; Wetherall, Karen; Cleare, Seonaid; McClelland, Heather; Melson, Ambrose J; Niedzwiedz, Claire L; Carroll, Ronan E; Connor, Daryl B; Platt, Steve; Scowcroft, Elizabeth; Watson, Billy; Zortea, Tiago; Ferguson, Eamonn; Robb, Kathryn A",Br J Psychiatry,381,24

With the world scampering for a possible vaccine, early detection and containment are the only redress. Existing diagnostic technologies with high accuracy like RT-PCRs are expensive and sophisticated, requiring skilled individuals for specimen collection and screening, resulting in lower outreach. So, methods excluding direct human intervention are much sought after, and artificial intelligence-driven automated diagnosis, especially with radiography images, captured the researchers' interest. This survey marks a detailed inspection of the deep learning-based automated detection of COVID-19 works done to date, a comparison of the available datasets, methodical challenges like imbalanced datasets and others, along with probable solutions with different preprocessing methods, and scopes of future exploration in this arena. We also benchmarked the performance of 315 deep models in diagnosing COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia from X-ray images of a custom dataset created from four others. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/rgbnihal2/COVID-19-X-ray-Dataset. Our results show that DenseNet201 model with Quadratic SVM classifier performs the best (accuracy: 98.16%, sensitivity: 98.93%, specificity: 98.77%) and maintains high accuracies in other similar architectures as well. This proves that even though radiography images might not be conclusive for radiologists, but it is so for deep learning algorithms for detecting COVID-19. We hope this extensive review will provide a comprehensive guideline for researchers in this field.","Rahman, Sejuti; Sarker, Sujan; Miraj, Md Abdullah Al; Nihal, Ragib Amin; Nadimul Haque, A K M; Noman, Abdullah Al",Cognit Comput,381,22

This study explores the students’ readiness for online learning and investigates the aspect that tangles their online learning. A total of 188 students, from first-year students to senior students, participated in this study. The Online Learning Readiness Scale (OLRS) and interview were used to appraise the students’ readiness for online learning. Internet self-efficacy, self-directed learning, learner control, motivation for learning, and online communication self-efficacy were assessed. The result of the scale revealed that the students were at a moderate level of online learning readiness. The highest contribution to their readiness was from their motivation for online learning. Moreover, surprisingly, the biggest challenge was the learner control. They were mainly distracted by other online activities during their online learning. Also, conducting online learning needs to involve various technologies and more structured activities to enhance their readiness.","Wulanjani, Arum Nisma; Indriani, Lilia; en,",Nobel: Journal Of Literature And Language Teaching,381,26

This can lead to under- or over-identification of DLD in this population. This study endeavors to contribute to overcoming this problem, by determining whether two specific clinical markers used with the Italian monolingual population can also be used with early L2 acquiring children, namely clitic production and non-word repetition. Our study involved two groups of 5-year-old L2 learners of Italian from various language backgrounds; 18 children had been referred to Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) services (EL2_DLD), and 30 children were typically developing (EL2_TD). The participants completed an Italian clitic production task and a non-word repetition task based on Italian phonotactics. Data was also collected from the participants' caregivers with the ALDeQ Parental Questionnaire to obtain information about the children's L1. Our results suggest that non-word repetition and clitic production in Italian are potentially useful for identifying L2 learners of Italian with DLD, at the age of 5 years. The repetition of non-words is highly accurate in identifying children with DLD among the participants, while clitic production is somewhat less discriminative in this sample. This study is a first step towards uncovering clinical markers that could be used to determine the presence of DLD in children acquiring their L2.","Guasti, Maria Teresa; White, Michelle J; Bianco, Gabriele; Arosio, Fabrizio; Camilleri, Bernard; Hasson, Natalie",Clin Linguist Phon,381,24

Under these circumstances, experts instead of admitting ignorance, feel obliged to give an answer, often pressurized by political or other authorities, even when such an answer is unavailable. Under these circumstances, publications based on fallacious reasoning are virtually unavoidable. In the present review, we summarize examples underlying fallacious reasoning recommendations regarding treatment with Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi) in the COVID-19 context. Most scientific societies emphasize that RAASi use is safe and that these agents should not be discontinued, based mainly on the results of observational studies (OSs) and occasionally preprints, as relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are currently lacking. However, over the past 4 decades, results from successful RCTs have repeatedly proved that practices based on OSs were wrong. Lack of RCTs results in uncertainty. In this setting, the physician's wisdom and knowledge related to pathophysiologic mechanisms and effect of pharmacologic agents become even more important as they may limit fallacies. Based on these principles, in diseases (e.g., mild, or moderate arterial hypertension, etc.) where equally effective alternative therapies to RAASi are available, these therapies should be applied, whereas in diseases (e.g., heart failure, diabetic kidney disease, etc.), where equally effective alternative therapy compared to RAASi is not available, RAASi should be used. Admittedly this strategy, like all the other recommendations, is not based on solid evidence but is intended to be individualized and follows the Hippocratic ""Primum non nocere"".","Triposkiadis, Filippos; Boudoulas, Konstantinos Dean; Xanthopoulos, Andrew; Boudoulas, Harisios",Hell. j. cardiol,381,21

However, during the unprecedented coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the risk of infection with the highly contagious virus has proven detrimental to the continuation of MSW as a valuable resource. The volume of waste, especially household waste, is higher; face masks, PPE (personal protective equipment), and hazardous materials such as batteries and empty chlorine bottles are examples of extra waste that have arisen during the pandemic. Various countries have set up initiatives for MSW management, including safety measurements for employees in the MSW management sector. The use of disinfectant prior to sorting waste, as well as storing waste for 9 days, may help to inactivate the COVID-19 virus, ensuring an appropriate safety level for MSW management. This work aimed at studying different MSW management strategies, specific challenges, and possible solutions for better understanding for those involved in waste management, in addition to providing a possible management strategy during and post-COVID-19 pandemic.","Das, Atanu Kumar; Islam, Md Nazrul; Billah, Md Morsaline; Sarker, Asim",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,381,16

Since the heart and the vessels also express ACE2, they both could become targets of the virus. However, at present the extent and importance of this potential involvement are unknown. Cardiac troponin levels are significantly higher in patients with more severe infections, patients admitted to intensive care units or in those who have died. In the setting of COVID-19, myocardial injury, defined by an increased troponin level, occurs especially due to non-ischaemic myocardial processes, including severe respiratory infection with hypoxia, sepsis, systemic inflammation, pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, cardiac adrenergic hyperstimulation during cytokine storm syndrome, and myocarditis. At present, there are limited reports on definite diagnosis of myocarditis caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans and limited demonstration of the virus in the myocardium. In conclusion, although the heart and the vessels are potential targets in COVID-19, there is currently limited evidence on the direct infection of the myocardium by SARS-CoV-2. Additional pathological studies and autopsy series will be very helpful to clarify the potentiality of COVID-19 to directly infect the myocardium and cause myocarditis.","Imazio, Massimo; Klingel, Karin; Kindermann, Ingrid; Brucato, Antonio; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Adler, Yehuda; De Ferrari, Gaetano Maria",Heart,381,15

An estimated 1,670 kidney transplant opportunities may be lost, which will lead to 6,317 active patients on the kidney-alone waiting list, compared to 4,649 based on usual activity estimates. This will result in 1,324 additional patients on dialysis who would otherwise have been transplanted. COVID-19 will lead to a marked loss of transplant opportunities and a significantly larger national waiting list. The existing strain on dialysis capacity will be exacerbated as patients remain on dialysis as the only available form of renal replacement therapy.

The analyzed data were extracted from the public database (DATASUS) of the Ministry of Health of Brazil. The data showed an increase in the number of Herpes Zoster diagnoses over the years, and the negative impact from the COVID-19 disease, revealing an increase corresponding to an average of over extra 10.7 cases per million of inhabitants during the COVID-19 pandemic in all Brazilian Regions. Therefore, although the association between HZ and COVID-19 is not well stablished, we observed in this study an increase in HZ cases during the COVID -19 pandemic, which suggests a correlation between these diseases.","Maia, Célia Márcia Fernandes; Marques, Nelson Pereira; de Lucena, Edson Hilan Gomes; de Rezende, Luiz Fernando; Martelli, Daniella R Barbosa; Martelli-Júnior, Hercílio",Int. j. infect. dis,381,16

Cape Town has many vulnerable communities because of poverty, overcrowding and comorbidities, although it has a relatively small elderly population. Amongst the unique and early responses to the pandemic in South Africa has been the strategy of community screening and testing (CST). This process has been drawn from health department's prior adoption of a community-orientated primary care (COPC) approach, which relies on teams of community health workers working in delineated communities to prevent disease and provide early interventions for those at higher risk. The COPC principles were applied in the CST programme, which involved collaboration between facility and community-based teams, linking public health and primary care approaches, careful mapping of cases in highly vulnerable communities, targeted screening around cases, testing of those that screened positive, health education and linkage to primary care. The overall aim was to slow down transmission through early identification and isolation of diagnosed cases. Key challenges involved the designing of a screening tool with appropriate sensitivity and specificity as well as the logistics of staffing, transport, consumables, data collection and capture, security, ablutions and personal protective equipment. Key opportunities included synergies between CST and evolving commitment to COPC in the health system. Key threats were the deteriorating security situation in the most vulnerable communities because of loss of income, food insecurity and CST distrust as well as increasing turn-around-times for test results.","David, Neal; Mash, Robert",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,381,5

Results show that the majority of Indonesians intensively use (1) private television, (2-4) websites and social media accounts of actors providing information on the crisis and (5) public television to get information regarding the pandemic. The findings indicate that other types of media such as radio and local television are used to a much lower extent. Results also show that there are two media-use gratifications sought during the crisis: (1) information and direction gratification sought and (2) entertainment and comparison gratification sought. Sociodemographic factors such as gender, age and education level demonstrate some significant influence on public media use and the gratification sought during the coronavirus outbreak.

While doomsday prepping has traditionally been reported in the context of extremists, during the COVID-19 pandemic, excessive stockpiling leading to supply shortages has been reported globally. It is unclear what psychological or demographic factors are associated with this stockpiling. This study investigated doomsday prepping beliefs and behaviors in relation to COVID-19 proximity, demographics, coping strategies, psychopathology, intolerance of uncertainty (IU), and personality in 384 participants (249 female) in an online study. Participants completed a number of questionnaires including the Post-Apocalyptic and Doomsday Prepping Beliefs Scale and a scale designed for the current study to measure prepping in the context of COVID-19. These were analyzed using ANOVAs, correlational, and mediation analyses to examine relationships between psychometric variables and stockpiling. Prepping beliefs and behaviors were higher in males than females and positively associated with anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, IU, and traditional masculinity traits. Older age, male gender, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and traditional masculinity predicted unique variance in prepping. The relationship between gender and stockpiling was mediated by social learning (witnessing other people panic buying) and the perceived threat of COVID-19 (doomsday interpretations) while proximity and personal vulnerability to COVID-19 were non-significant. Results indicate that panic buying was influenced more by witnessing others stockpiling, personality, and catastrophic thinking rather than by proximity to danger. Education could target these factors in ongoing waves of the pandemic or future catastrophes.","Smith, N.; Thomas, S. J.",Frontiers in Psychology,381,16

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multi-center, observational study of consecutive hospitalized adults in the NYC metropolitan area with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of new neurologic disorders (as diagnosed by a neurologist) was recorded and in-hospital mortality and discharge disposition were compared between COVID-19 patients with and without neurologic disorders. RESULTS: Of 4,491 COVID-19 patients hospitalized during the study timeframe, 606 (13.5%) developed a new neurologic disorder in a median of 2 days from COVID-19 symptom onset. The most common diagnoses were: toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (6.8%), seizure (1.6%), stroke (1.9%), and hypoxic/ischemic injury (1.4%). No patient had meningitis/encephalitis, or myelopathy/myelitis referable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and 18/18 CSF specimens were RT-PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with neurologic disorders were more often older, male, white, hypertensive, diabetic, intubated, and had higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores (all P<0.05). After adjusting for age, sex, SOFA-scores, intubation, past history, medical complications, medications and comfort-care-status, COVID-19 patients with neurologic disorders had increased risk of in-hospital mortality (Hazard Ratio[HR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.17-1.62, P<0.001) and decreased likelihood of discharge home (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63-0.85, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic disorders were detected in 13.5% of COVID-19 patients and were associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality and decreased likelihood of discharge home. Many observed neurologic disorders may be sequelae of severe systemic illness.","Frontera, Jennifer A; Sabadia, Sakinah; Lalchan, Rebecca; Fang, Taolin; Flusty, Brent; Millar-Vernetti, Patricio; Snyder, Thomas; Berger, Stephen; Yang, Dixon; Granger, Andre; Morgan, Nicole; Patel, Palak; Gutman, Josef; Melmed, Kara; Agarwal, Shashank; Bokhari, Matthew; Andino, Andres; Valdes, Eduard; Omari, Mirza; Kvernland, Alexandra; Lillemoe, Kaitlyn; Chou, Sherry H-Y; McNett, Molly; Helbok, Raimund; Mainali, Shraddha; Fink, Ericka L; Robertson, Courtney; Schober, Michelle; Suarez, Jose I; Ziai, Wendy; Menon, David; Friedman, Daniel; Friedman, David; Holmes, Manisha; Huang, Joshua; Thawani, Sujata; Howard, Jonathan; Abou-Fayssal, Nada; Krieger, Penina; Lewis, Ariane; Lord, Aaron S; Zhou, Ting; Kahn, D Ethan; Czeisler, Barry M; Torres, Jose; Yaghi, Shadi; Ishida, Koto; Scher, Erica; de Havenon, Adam; Placantonakis, Dimitris",Neurology,381,24

This review expounds on lessons learned for ICU preparedness during the pandemic and for future mass casualty events. RECENT FINDINGS: In the 21st century, there have already been several outbreaks of infectious diseases that have led to mass casualties creating ICU strain, providing multiple opportunities for hospitals and hospital systems to prepare their ICUs for future events. Unfortunately, the sheer scale and rapidity of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to overwhelming strain on every aspect of ICU disaster preparedness. Yet, by analyzing experiences of hospitals throughout the first 7 months of the current pandemic in the areas of infection control, equipment preparedness, staffing strategies, ICU spatial logistics as well as acute and postacute treatment, various important lessons have already emerged that will prove critical for successful future ICU preparedness. SUMMARY: Preemptive planning, beginning with the early identification of staffing resources, supply chains and alternative equipment sources, coupled with strong infection control practices that also provide for the flexibility for evolving evidence is of utmost importance. However, there is no single approach that can be applied to every health system.","Harris, Gavin; Adalja, Amesh",Curr Opin Pulm Med,381,25

To address this, we analyzed the relationship between in vitro neutralization levels and the observed protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using data from seven current vaccines and from convalescent cohorts. We estimated the neutralization level for 50% protection against detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 20.2% of the mean convalescent level (95% confidence interval (CI) = 14.4-28.4%). The estimated neutralization level required for 50% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3% of the mean convalescent level; 95% CI = 0.7-13%, P = 0.0004). Modeling of the decay of the neutralization titer over the first 250 d after immunization predicts that a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralization titers against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared with the vaccine strain, and our model predicts the relationship between neutralization and efficacy against viral variants. Here, we show that neutralization level is highly predictive of immune protection, and provide an evidence-based model of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.","Khoury, David S; Cromer, Deborah; Reynaldi, Arnold; Schlub, Timothy E; Wheatley, Adam K; Juno, Jennifer A; Subbarao, Kanta; Kent, Stephen J; Triccas, James A; Davenport, Miles P",Nat Med,381,16

Convalescent plasma (CP) containing antibodies against the virus has been used with some success. We did a systematic review to synthesize the available data on CP therapy for treatment of Covid-19 to study the efficacy and safety outcomes. Methods: Two reviewers searched the published and pre-published literature between 1 January 2019 and 23 June 2020 for studies comparing the use of CP with standard therapy for Covid-19 patients. Data from the selected studies were abstracted and analysed for efficacy and safety outcomes. Critical appraisal of the evidence was done by using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool and the quality of evidence was graded as per GRADE. Results: We found 13 case series and 1 randomized trial that fulfilled our search criteria. Of the 12 case series with a total of 264 patients that reported the efficacy outcomes, 11 studies showed favourable results with survival benefit. The only RCT with 103 patients did not show any mortality benefit but was terminated early prior to complete enrolment. A single large study of 5000 patients reported safety outcomes and showed no major adverse events in patient streated with CP. Conclusion: There is very low-quality evidence to suggest efficacy and safety of CP in patients with Covid-19 infection.

We use the SIR epidemiology model and a linear economy to formalize the planner's dynamic control problem. The optimal policy depends on the fraction of infected and susceptible in the population. We parametrize the model using data on the COVID19 pandemic and the economic breadth of the lockdown. The quantitative analysis identifies the features that shape the intensity and duration of the optimal lockdown policy. Our baseline parametrization is conditional on a 1% of infected agents at the outbreak, no cure for the disease, and the possibility of testing. The optimal policy prescribes a severe lockdown beginning two weeks after the outbreak, covers 60% of the population after a month, and is gradually withdrawn covering 20% of the population after 3 months. The intensity of the lockdown depends on the gradient of the fatality rate as a function of the infected, and on the assumed value of a statistical life. The absence of testing increases the economic costs of the lockdown, and shortens the duration of the optimal lockdown which ends more abruptly.

Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear how hospitals in the federal states of Berlin and Brandenburg are structured with regard to structural adaptions, personnel situations, protective equipment and trainings. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare the current status of all hospitals in both states. Methods: In April 2020, an online survey of all hospitals in Berlin and Brandenburg (n = 99) was carried out. Structural capacities, the personnel situation, protective equipment and training were investigated. Results: The hospitals (response rate: 31.3 %) have made all structural changes except for n = 1 facility. The majority of the failure rate is critically stated as 5 - 10 % before (58.6 %) and during the pandemic (51.5 %). The proportion with > 10 % default rate increases from 20.7 % to 31.0 %. 45.2 % of hospitals report that they rarely have shortage in protective clothing. Nurses at peripheral wards are often trained in handling with respiratory patients. The duration is in median 2 - 8 hours. No significant differences between Berlin and Brandenburg were found. Conclusions: At the time of the survey, the hospitals in Berlin and Brandenburg were well prepared for the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, the results indicate that hospitals are well prepared to ensure the health care provision.","Gräske, Johannes; Lengert-Brzozowski, Sandra; Neumann, Fränze; Görsch, Luisa; Biniok, Maria; Koppe, Louise",Pflege,381,16

Sulphate green rust (GRSO4), a naturally occurring mixed-valent iron layered double hydroxide has shown to be highly effective in the reduction of Cr(VI) to poorly soluble Cr(III), giving promise for its use as reactant for in situ remedial applications. However, little is known about its immobilization efficiency inside porous geological media, such as soils and sediments, where this reactant would ultimately be applied. In this study, we tested the removal of Cr(VI) by GRSO4 in quartz sand fixed-bed column systems (diameter × length = 1.4 cm × 11 cm), under anoxic conditions. Cr(VI) removal efficiency (relative to the available reducing equivalents in the added GRSO4) was determined by evaluating breakthrough curves performed at different inlet Cr(VI) concentrations (0.125-1 mM) which are representative of Cr(VI) concentrations found at contaminated sites, different flow rates (0.25-3 ml/min) and solution pH (4.5, 7 and 9.5). Results showed that (i) increasing Cr(VI) inlet concentration substantially decreased Cr(VI) removal efficiency of GRSO4, (ii) flow rates had a lower impact on removal efficiencies, although values tended to be lower at higher flow rates, and (iii) Cr(VI) removal was enhanced at acidic pH conditions compared to neutral and alkaline conditions. For comparison, Cr(VI) removal by sulphidized nanoscale zerovalent iron (S-nZVI) in identical column experiments was substantially lower, indicating that S-nZVI reactivity with Cr(VI) is much slower compared to GRSO4. Overall, GRSO4 performed reasonably well, even at the highest tested flow rate, showing its versatility and suitability for Cr(VI) remediation applications in high flow environments.","Digiacomo, Flavia; Tobler, Dominique J; Held, Thomas; Neumann, Thomas",Geochem Trans,381,33

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the incidence of TC in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and what is the relationship between the dose of anticoagulant therapy and the incidence of TC? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: All consecutive patients referred to eight French ICUs for COVID-19 were included in this observational study. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from ICU admission to day 14, including anticoagulation status and thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The effect of high-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (either at intermediate or equivalent to therapeutic dose), defined using a standardized protocol of classification, was assessed using a time-varying exposure model using inverse probability of treatment weight. RESULTS: Of 538 patients included, 104 patients experienced a total of 122 TCs with an incidence of 22.7% (95% CI, 19.2%-26.3%). Pulmonary embolism accounted for 52% of the recorded TCs. High-dose prophylactic anticoagulation was associated with a significant reduced risk of TC (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99) without increasing the risk of bleeding (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.70-1.75). INTERPRETATION: High-dose prophylactic anticoagulation is associated with a reduction in thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 without an increased risk of hemorrhage. Randomized controlled trials comparing prophylaxis with higher doses of anticoagulants are needed to confirm these results.

While previous investigations have reported that individuals' sexual preferences are influenced by a pathogen threat, the empirical support for face preference is mixed (i.e., the association of pathogenic threat and individuals' preferences for masculine and/or feminine faces is equivocal). The COVID-19 pandemic provides the opportunity to investigate the association of pathogenic threat and men's and women's preferences for sexual dimorphism of faces in the opposite sex in a real-world pathogenic situation. Methods: Data were collected during COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020) from men and women in the United States, and women in Iran, on preferences for masculinity in men's faces using women participants, and femininity in women's faces using men. Results: Results showed that concern about an actual pathogenic threat (i.e., contracting COVID-19) predicts men's preference for female facial femininity, but not women's preference for male facial masculinity (for both U.S. and Iranian women). Conclusion: By using an actual pathogenic threat, our results support previous findings that men's preferences for female faces are shifted to less feminine faces under pathogenic threat. Moreover, our results provide support for the distinction between the behavioral immune system and pathogen disgust, at least for men's preference for feminine female faces.

The protruded IVD were macroscopically graded according to the Thompson scale, and the corresponding spinal cord segment was histologically analyzed for nervous tissue compression. Of the 30 dogs, twelve (40%) presented disc protrusion, and of these 12 dogs, seven (58%) presented more than one protruded disc. Disc protrusion was observed in 3.2% (25/780) of all IVD evaluated.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This single centre retrospective observational cohort study took place in a French hospital where the number of patients exceeded the ICU capacity despite an increase from 18 to 32 beds. Because of this, 59 (37%) of the 159 patients requiring ICU care were referred to other hospitals. From 27th March to 23rd April, consecutive patients who had respiratory failure or were unable to maintain an SpO2 > 90%, despite receiving 10-15 l/min of oxygen with a non-rebreather mask, were treated by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) unless the ICU physician judged that immediate intubation was indicated. We describe the characteristics, clinical course, and outcomes of these patients. The main outcome under study was CPAP discontinuation. RESULTS: CPAP was initiated in 49 patients and performed out of ICU in 41 (84%). Median age was 65 years (IQR = 54-71) and 36 (73%) were men. Median respiratory rate before CPAP was 36 (30-40) and median SpO2 was 92% (90-95) under 10 to 15 L/min oxygen flow. Median duration of CPAP was 3 days (IQR = 1-5). Reasons for discontinuation of CPAP were: intubation in 25 (51%), improvement in 16 (33%), poor tolerance in 6 (12%) and death in 2 (4%) patients. A decision not to intubate had been taken for 8 patients, including the 2 who died while on CPAP. Two patients underwent less than one hour CPAP for poor tolerance. In the end, 15 (38%) out of 39 evaluable patients recovered with only CPAP whereas 24 (62%) were intubated. CONCLUSIONS: CPAP is feasible in a non-ICU environment in the context of massive influx of patients. In our cohort up to 1/3 of the patients presenting with acute respiratory failure recovered without intubation.","Alviset, Sophie; Riller, Quentin; Aboab, Jérôme; Dilworth, Kelly; Billy, Pierre-Antoine; Lombardi, Yannis; Azzi, Mathilde; Ferreira Vargas, Luis; Laine, Laurent; Lermuzeaux, Mathilde; Mémain, Nathalie; Silva, Daniel; Tchoubou, Tona; Ushmorova, Daria; Dabbagh, Hanane; Escoda, Simon; Lefrançois, Rémi; Nardi, Annelyse; Ngima, Armand; Ioos, Vincent",PLoS One,381,15

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of these restrictions on behaviours and well-being and whether individual differences predict changes in well-being. METHODS: Australian adults participated in a cross-sectional, online survey during May 2020. The survey captured demographic information; health behaviours; personality traits; life satisfaction and COVID-19-related attitudes, financial concerns, perceived risks and impacts. RESULTS: In total, 3745 (86.8% of 4313) participants completed all items. Participants were mostly female (85.7%) and 56.4 years (standard deviation [SD] = 12.6) on average. Over 95.0% of the sample indicated they had been social distancing or isolating. Health behaviours and well-being had generally worsened, with social connections being the most negatively affected. Life satisfaction was significantly lower since restrictions. For changes in life satisfaction, extroversion was a risk factor and openness to experience was a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, well-being was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing particularly in this sample containing mainly older women. In future, it will be crucial to understand why and who may be differentially affected, to encourage behaviours that are protective of well-being.","Brindal, Emily; Ryan, Jillian C; Kakoschke, Naomi; Golley, Sinead; Zajac, Ian T; Wiggins, Bonnie",J. public health (Oxf),381,10

Although there is no treatment for AD, exposure to enriched environment (EE) in mice, as well as physical and mental activity in human subjects have been shown to have a protective effect by slowing the disease's progression and reducing AD-like cognitive impairment. However, the molecular mechanism of this mitigating effect is still not understood. One of the mechanisms that has recently been shown to be involved in neuronal degeneration is microRNAs (miRNAs) regulation, which act as a post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. miR-128 has been shown to be significantly altered in individuals with AD and in mice following exposure to EE. Here, we focused on elucidating the possible role of miR-128 in AD pathology and found that miR-128 regulates the expression of two proteins essential for synaptic transmission, SNAP-25, and synaptotagmin1 (Syt1). Clinically relevant, in 5xFAD mouse model for AD, this miRNA's expression was found as downregulated, resembling the alteration found in the hippocampi of individuals with AD. Interestingly, exposing WT mice to EE also resulted in downregulation of miR-128 expression levels, although EE and AD conditions demonstrate opposing effects on neuronal functioning and synaptic plasticity. We also found that miR-128 expression downregulation in primary hippocampal cultures from 5xFAD mice results in increased neuronal network activity and neuronal excitability. Altogether, our findings place miR-128 as a synaptic player that may contribute to synaptic functioning and plasticity through regulation of synaptic protein expression and function.","Shvarts-Serebro, Inna; Sheinin, Anton; Gottfried, Irit; Adler, Lior; Schottlender, Nofar; Ashery, Uri; Barak, Boaz",J. mol. neurosci,381,30

Herein, we describe an unusual case of giant cell-rich SFT (GCRSFT) occurring in the nasopharynx. A 64-year-old man experienced dizziness and headache for more than 10 years with no obvious cause. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 3.9 cm × 2 cm tumor on the posterior lateral wall of the left nasopharynx, and angiography revealed a hypervascular tumor fed by branches of the left carotid artery. Hence, preoperative embolization was performed, and then the tumor was endoscopically resected. The symptoms were relieved after the resection, and postoperative head CT and video laryngoscopy showed that the tumor was completely resected. We next characterized the specific pathological characteristics of the resected tumor. Histologically, the tumor was characterized by varying cellular proliferation of cytologically bland spindle cells within a collagenous stroma, with prominent interspersed branching vessels. Mitotic activity was low (2/50HPF), and there was no evidence of pleomorphism or tumor necrosis. Moreover, multinucleated giant cells with deep nuclear staining and distributed in pseudovascular spaces were found within the tumor. We ruled out the possibility that our case was giant cell fibroblastoma (GCF) by immunohistochemical analysis, showing that the tumor cells were positive for CD34, CD99, STAT6, and BCL-2, and that the Ki-67 labeling index was 3%, indicating that our case was SFT and not GCF. The patient's condition is generally good after a 14-month follow-up. This report serves to broaden the morphologic spectrum of GCRSFT and will help clinicians and pathologists better understand this entity to prevent misdiagnosis.","Dong, Shuang-Shuang; Wang, Ning; Yang, Cui-Ping; Zhang, Guo-Chang; Liang, Wei-Hua; Zhao, Jin; Qi, Yan",Onco Targets Ther,381,27

She denies any cough, congestion, fever, muscle aches, shortness of breath, sore throat, loss of taste, or smell sensation. On Investigation: Early march IgG antibody positive for covid-19 and in late May, she was tested positive for RT-PCR covid-19 without symptoms both times. On both occasions, she was working with healthcare workers without strict preventive protocols, who came negative for tests. Her family and close contacts tested negative for COVID-19. Diagnosis: Asymptomatic covid 19 carriers. Treatment: Close monitoring for symptoms. Discussion: Over the last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant concern worldwide due to its rapid spread. There are few notable symptomatic cases that are hospitalized and two months after discharge, they still tested positive on the RT-PCR COVID-19 test. It means they are a dormant carrier for COVID-19. But, in our case, the patient was asymptomatic and positive for COVID-19 antibody and RT-PCR test. Surprisingly, all healthcare workers in the clinic came negative on repeated testing. We presumed that she encountered some covid-19 strain, which remains dormant in the body and non-contagious.

We present a novel unsupervised framework for tracing textual sources of moral change toward entities through time. We characterize moral change with probabilistic topical distributions and infer the source text that exerts prominent influence on the moral time course. We evaluate our framework on a diverse set of data ranging from social media to news articles. We show that our framework not only captures fine-grained human moral judgments, but also identifies coherent source topics of moral change triggered by historical events.

How these diverse receptor recognition patterns affect viral entry is unknown. Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is the only known coronavirus that uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike to recognize a protein receptor, CEACAM1a. Here we determined the cryo-EM structure of MHV spike complexed with mouse CEACAM1a. The trimeric spike contains three receptor-binding S1 heads sitting on top of a trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk. Three receptor molecules bind to the sides of the spike trimer, where three NTDs are located. Receptor binding induces structural changes in the spike, weakening the interactions between S1 and S2. Using protease sensitivity and negative-stain EM analyses, we further showed that after protease treatment of the spike, receptor binding facilitated the dissociation of S1 from S2, allowing S2 to transition from pre-fusion to post-fusion conformation. Together these results reveal a new role of receptor binding in MHV entry: in addition to its well-characterized role in viral attachment to host cells, receptor binding also induces the conformational change of the spike and hence the fusion of viral and host membranes. Our study provides new mechanistic insight into coronavirus entry and highlights the diverse entry mechanisms used by different viruses.","Shang, Jian; Wan, Yushun; Liu, Chang; Yount, Boyd; Gully, Kendra; Yang, Yang; Auerbach, Ashley; Peng, Guiqing; Baric, Ralph; Li, Fang",PLoS Pathog,381,20

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has disproportionately affected Black and Latinx populations in the USA. No literature exists comparing state-level CSC. It is unknown how equitably CSC would allocate resources. METHODS: The authors identified all publicly available state-level CSC through online searches and communication with state governments. Publicly available CSC were systematically reviewed for content including ethical framework and prioritization strategy. RESULTS: CSC were identified for 29 states. Ethical principles were explicitly stated in 23 (79.3%). Equity was listed as a guiding ethical principle in 15 (51.7%); 19 (65.5%) said decisions should not factor in race, ethnicity, disability, and other identity-based factors. Ten states (34.4%) allowed for consideration of societal value, which could lead to prioritization of health care workers and other essential personnel. Twenty-one (72.4%) CSC provided a specific strategy for prioritizing patients for critical care resources, e.g., ventilators. All incorporated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores; 15 (71.4%) of these specific CSC considered comorbid conditions (e.g., cardiac disease, renal failure, malignancy) in resource allocation decisions. CONCLUSION: There is wide variability in the existence and specificity of CSC across the USA. CSC may disproportionately impact disadvantaged populations due to inequities in comorbid condition prevalence, expected lifespan, and other effects of systemic racism.","Cleveland Manchanda, Emily C; Sanky, Charles; Appel, Jacob M",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),381,30

Occupational patterns and work-related injury patterns vary with age. This study aimed to compare the incidence and characteristics of work-related injuries in older and younger workers in Korea. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of the characteristics of workers hospitalised with work-related injuries from January 2010 to December 2014, using data from the National Hospital Discharge In-Depth Injury Survey in South Korea. The analysis was stratified by age into older (aged &#8805;65 years) and younger (aged 20-64 years) workers. RESULTS: The hospitalisation rate in older workers was double that of younger workers (2014 IRR: 2.06, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.76). Compared with workers of conventional working-age, a higher proportion of injured older workers were female (33.1% vs 13.6%, p<0.001), injured due to falls (40.8% vs 28.5%) and injured while working on a farm (46.5% vs 6.3%, p<0.001). In older workers, work-related injuries were seasonal and peaked during summer, but there was little seasonality in injuries among younger workers. CONCLUSION: Older workers are more vulnerable to work-related injuries and have a different profile of work-related injuries from younger workers. Age-related differences in the injury profile need to be considered when developing workplace injury prevention policies and programmes, and the specific vulnerabilities of older workers need to be addressed.","Lee, Kyung-Eun; Kim, Jinhee; Lee, Jihye",Inj. prev,381,24

Studies from China, where the virus first spread, have reported increased psychological strain in healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychosocial burden of physicians and nurses depending on their degree of contact with COVID-19 patients. In addition, we explored which supportive resources they used and which supportive needs they experienced during the crisis. Methods: Data were collected between March and April 2020 at the University Hospital Augsburg. A total of 75 nurses and 35 physicians, working either in a special COVID-19 ward or in a regular ward, took part in the survey. The participants filled in two standardized questionnaires (the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ; and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, MBI), and reported their fear of a COVID-19 infection and stress at work on a 10-point Likert scale. Finally, they answered three open-ended questions about causes of burden, supportive resources and needs during the crisis. Results: Nurses working in the COVID-19 wards reported higher levels of stress, exhaustion, and depressive mood, as well as lower levels of work-related fulfilment compared to their colleagues in the regular wards. Physicians reported similar scores independent of their contact with COVID-19 patients. The most common causes for burden were job strain and uncertainty about the future. Psychosocial support as well as leisure time were listed as important resources, and a better infrastructure adjustment to COVID-19 at the hospital (e.g. sufficient staff, keeping teams and working schedules stable) as suggestion for improvement. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that especially nurses working in COVID-19 wards are affected psychologically by the consequences of the pandemic. This might be due to a higher workload and longer time in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, compared to physicians.","Zerbini, Giulia; Ebigbo, Alanna; Reicherts, Philipp; Kunz, Miriam; Messman, Helmut",Ger Med Sci,381,1

An understanding of the challenges and correlates to vaccine acceptance will aid the acceleration of vaccine administration within these populations. Acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women and mothers of children younger than 18-years-old, as well as potential predictors, were assessed through an online survey, administered by Pregistry between October 28 and November 18, 2020. 17,871 total survey responses from 16 countries were obtained. Given a 90% COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, 52.0% of pregnant women (n = 2747/5282) and 73.4% of non-pregnant women (n = 9214/12,562) indicated an intention to receive the vaccine. 69.2% of women (n = 11,800/17,054), both pregnant and non-pregnant, indicated an intention to vaccinate their children. Vaccine acceptance was generally highest in India, the Philippines, and all sampled countries in Latin America; it was lowest in Russia, the United States and Australia. The strongest predictors of vaccine acceptance included confidence in vaccine safety or effectiveness, worrying about COVID-19, belief in the importance of vaccines to their own country, compliance to mask guidelines, trust of public health agencies/health science, as well as attitudes towards routine vaccines. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and its predictors among women vary globally.

Mice are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to low-affinity binding to the murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. Here, we evaluated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in male and female mice expressing the human ACE2 gene under the control of the keratin 18 promoter (K18). In contrast to nontransgenic mice, intranasal exposure of K18-hACE2 animals to 2 different doses of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in acute disease, including weight loss, lung injury, brain infection, and lethality. Vasculitis was the most prominent finding in the lungs of infected mice. Transcriptomic analysis from lungs of infected animals showed increases in transcripts involved in lung injury and inflammatory cytokines. In the low-dose challenge groups, there was a survival advantage in the female mice, with 60% surviving infection, whereas all male mice succumbed to disease. Male mice that succumbed to disease had higher levels of inflammatory transcripts compared with female mice. To our knowledge, this is the first highly lethal murine infection model for SARS-CoV-2 and should be valuable for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and for the assessment of MCMs.","Golden, Joseph W; Cline, Curtis R; Zeng, Xiankun; Garrison, Aura R; Carey, Brian D; Mucker, Eric M; White, Lauren E; Shamblin, Joshua D; Brocato, Rebecca L; Liu, Jun; Babka, April M; Rauch, Hypaitia B; Smith, Jeffrey M; Hollidge, Bradley S; Fitzpatrick, Collin; Badger, Catherine V; Hooper, Jay W",JCI insight,381,16

Tissue factor (TF) is the primary cellular initiator of coagulation. Most of the TF expressed on cell surfaces remains cryptic. Sphingomyelin (SM) is responsible for maintaining TF in the encrypted state, and hydrolysis of SM by acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) increases TF activity. ASMase was shown to play a role in virus infection biology. In the present study, we investigated the role of ASMase in SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced TF procoagulant activity. Infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) with SARs-CoV-2 spike protein pseudovirus (SARS-CoV-2-SP-PV) markedly increased TF procoagulant activity at the cell surface and released TF+ extracellular vesicles (EVs). The pseudovirus infection did not increase either TF protein expression or phosphatidylserine externalization. SARS-CoV-2-SP-PV infection induced the translocation of ASMase to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which led to the hydrolysis of SM in the membrane. Pharmacological inhibitors or genetic silencing of ASMase attenuated SARS-CoV-2-SP-PV-induced increased TF activity. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, attenuated SARS-CoV-2-SP-PV-induced increased TF activity. Overall, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection activates the coagulation by decrypting TF through activation of ASMase. Our data suggest that the FDA-approved functional inhibitors of ASMase may help treat hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Jue; Pendurthi, Usha R; Yi, Guohua; Rao, L Vijaya Mohan",Blood,381,24

Government requirements to stay at home and avoid social and school settings may impact psychological well-being by modifying various behaviors such as problematic phone and Internet use, yet there is a paucity of research on this issue. This study examined whether the COVID-19 outbreak may have impacted problematic smartphone use (PSU), problematic gaming (PG), and psychological distress, specifically the pattern of relationships between PSU, PG, and psychological distress in schoolchildren. METHODS: Longitudinal data on psychological distress, PSU, and PG were collected from 575 children in primary schools in 3 waves: Waves 1 and 2 were conducted before the COVID-19 outbreak and Wave 3 during the outbreak. Cross-lagged panel models were used to examine relationships between factors across the 3 waves. RESULTS: Cross-lagged models found that higher levels of PSU were not significantly related prospectively to greater psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak, but this prospective relationship became significant during the COVID-19 outbreak. Whereas PG was associated prospectively with psychological distress before the COVID-19 outbreak (ie, between Waves 1 and 2), this association became nonsignificant during the COVID-19 lockdown (ie, between Waves 2 and 3). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak has seemed to change prospective relationships between PSU and psychological distress and PG and psychological distress in schoolchildren. Future research should examine whether restrictions on or information provided to schoolchildren may exacerbate PSUs effects on psychological distress.","Chen, Chao-Ying; Chen, I-Hua; Hou, Wen-Li; Potenza, Marc N; O039,; Brien, Kerry S; Lin, Chung-Ying; Latner, Janet D",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),381,16

The objective of this study is to explore the changing characteristics and environmental behaviors of disposable masks when exposed to the shoreline environment. The transformation of chain structure and chemical composition of masks as well as the decreased mechanical strength of masks after UV weathering were observed. The melt-blown cloth in the middle layer of masks was found to be particularly sensitive to UV irradiation. A single weathered mask can release more than 1.5 million microplastics to the aqueous environment. The physical abrasion caused by sand further exacerbated the release of microplastic particles from masks, with more than 16 million particles released from just one weathered mask in the presence of sand. The study results indicate that shorelines are not only the main receptor of discarded masks from oceans and lands, but also play host to further transformation of masks to plastic particles.","Wang, Zheng; An, Chunjiang; Chen, Xiujuan; Lee, Kenneth; Zhang, Baiyu; Feng, Qi",J Hazard Mater,381,24

We sought to understand the longer-term effects of the pandemic on blood usage via changes in case volume and clinical intensity as well as whether the blood needs of COVID-19-positive patients differed from other transfused patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective study of blood use in 2020 as compared to 2014-2019 was conducted at a tertiary care center. Statistical analysis was performed in an R-based workflow. p values are reported using two-sided t-tests for total hospital blood usage and using Mann-Whitney U tests for comparisons of patient blood usage. RESULTS: Mean monthly red cell usage in 2020 decreased by 11.2% (p = .003), plasma usage decreased by 23.8%, (p < .001) platelet usage decreased by 11.4% (p < .001), and monthly cryoprecipitate use increased by 18% (p = .03). A linear regression model predicted significant associations between total blood usage and the year, number of Medicare eligible discharges, and Case Mix Index. COVID-19-positive patients requiring at least one blood product did not use significantly different amounts of red cells, plasma, or platelets from all other transfused patients. CONCLUSIONS: Year 2020 began with decreased blood usage that was normalized by late spring. Reassuringly, transfused COVID-19-positive patients in general and those requiring ICU level care do not use significantly increased amounts of blood as compared to similar transfused hospital patients.","Murphy, Colin; Fontaine, Magali; Luethy, Paul; McGann, Heather; Jackson, Bryon",Transfusion,381,15

Based on the scientific literature and our clinical/research experiences, we identify risk and protective factors and provide a guide to assessing and managing suicidality in an outpatient medical setting. A clinical case is used to illustrate how information from this article can be applied. Characteristics of ME/CFS that make addressing suicidality challenging include absence of any disease-modifying treatments, severe functional limitations, and symptoms which limit therapies. Decades-long misattribution of ME/CFS to physical deconditioning or psychiatric disorders have resulted in undereducated healthcare professionals, public stigma, and unsupportive social interactions. Consequently, some patients may be reluctant to engage with mental health care. Outpatient medical professionals play a vital role in mitigating these effects. By combining evidence-based interventions aimed at all suicidal patients with those adapted to individual patients' circumstances, suffering and suicidality can be alleviated in ME/CFS. Increased access to newer virtual or asynchronous modalities of psychiatric/psychological care, especially for severely ill patients, may be a silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chu, L.; Elliott, M.; Stein, E.; Jason, L.

However, there is limited information on the quality of antibody responses generated with these vaccine modalities. To better understand antibody responses induced by spike protein-based vaccines, we performed a qualitative study by immunizing rabbits with various SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigens: S ectodomain (S1+S2; amino acids 16 to 1213), which lacks the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (CT-TM), the S1 domain (amino acids 16 to 685), the receptor binding domain (RBD) (amino acids 319 to 541), and the S2 domain (amino acids 686 to 1213, lacking the RBD, as control). Resulting antibody quality and function were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), RBD competition assay, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) against different spike proteins in native conformation, and neutralization assays. All three antigens (S1+S2 ectodomain, S1 domain, and RBD), but not S2, generated strong neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination-induced antibody repertoire was analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 spike genome fragment phage display libraries (SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL), which identified immunodominant epitopes in the S1, S1-RBD, and S2 domains. Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that the RBD immunogen elicited a higher antibody titer with five-fold higher affinity antibodies to native spike antigens compared with other spike antigens, and antibody affinity correlated strongly with neutralization titers. These findings may help guide rational vaccine design and facilitate development and evaluation of effective therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19 disease.","Ravichandran, Supriya; Coyle, Elizabeth M; Klenow, Laura; Tang, Juanjie; Grubbs, Gabrielle; Liu, Shufeng; Wang, Tony; Golding, Hana; Khurana, Surender",Sci. transl. med,381,1

Only a limited number of human-derived cells are capable of supporting SARS-CoV-2 replication and the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in these cells remains poor. In contrast, monkey-derived Vero cells are highly susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2, although they are not suitable for the study of antiviral effects by small molecules due to their limited capacity to metabolize drugs compared to human-derived cells. In this study, our goal was to generate a virus-susceptible human cell line that would be useful for the identification and testing of candidate drugs. Towards this end, we stably transfected human lung-derived MRC5 cells with a lentiviral vector encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Our results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in MRC5/ACE2 cells. Furthermore, viral RNA replication and progeny virus production were significantly reduced in response to administration of the replication inhibitor, remdesivir, in MRC5/ACE2 cells compared with Vero cells.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiviral activity of photodynamic therapy (PDT) against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. METHODS: Vero E6 cells and SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Russia were used for PDT with methylene blue (MB) and Radahlorin. A continuous laser with wavelength &#955; = 662 nm in doses of 16 J/cm2 and 40 J/cm2 laser irradiation was used for PDT of a viral suspension and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. The direct cytopathogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated via light microscopy to calculate the TCID50 in the samples and perform statistical analysis. RESULTS: Viral suspensions of SARS-CoV-2 that had a TCID50 greater than 103 were inactivated by PDT in the presence of MB and Radahlorin. Vero E6 cells were protected from 104 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 by PDT post infection. The range of protective concentrations was 1.0-10.0 µg/ml and 0.5-5.0 µg/ml for MB and Radahlorin, respectively. Additionally, it was found that MB and Radahlorin also possess significant antiviral activity even without PDT. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) against 102 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 0.22 and 0.33 µg/ml with the addition of MB and Radahlorin, respectively, to cells concomitantly with virus, whereas in the case of applying the photosensitizers at 3.5 hours post infection, the IC50 was 0.6 and 2.0 µg/ml for MB and Radahlorin, respectively.

In the United States, strict social distancing during the first wave of virus spread has resulted in different types of infection dynamics. In some states, such as New York, extensive infection spread was followed by a pronounced decline of infection levels. In other states, such as California, less infection spread occurred before strict social distancing, and a different pattern was observed. Instead of a pronounced infection decline, a long-lasting plateau is evident, characterized by similar daily new infection levels. Here we show that network models, in which individuals and their social contacts are explicitly tracked, can reproduce the plateau if network connections are cut due to social distancing measures. The reason is that in networks characterized by a 2D spatial structure, infection tends to spread quadratically with time, but as edges are randomly removed, the infection spreads along nearly one-dimensional infection ""corridors"", resulting in plateau dynamics. Further, we show that plateau dynamics are observed only if interventions start sufficiently early; late intervention leads to a ""peak and decay"" pattern. Interestingly, the plateau dynamics are predicted to eventually transition into an infection decline phase without any further increase in social distancing measures. Additionally, the models suggest that a second wave becomes significantly less pronounced if social distancing is only relaxed once the dynamics have transitioned to the decline phase. The network models analyzed here allow us to interpret and reconcile different infection dynamics during social distancing observed in various US states.","Komarova, Natalia L; Azizi, Asma; Wodarz, Dominik",Epidemics,381,16

The development of vaccines has taken one year, which is why it is necessary to investigate whether some already-existing alternatives that have been successfully developed in recent years can mitigate the pandemic's advance. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have proved effective in antiviral action. Thus, in this review, several in vitro and in vivo studies of the effect of AgNPs on viruses that cause respiratory diseases are analyzed and discussed to promote an understanding of the possible interaction of AgNPs with SARS-CoV-2. The study focuses on several in vivo toxicological studies of AgNPs and a dose extrapolation to humans to determine the chief avenue of exposure. It can be concluded that the use of AgNPs as a possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2 could be viable, based on comparing the virus' behavior to that of similar viruses in in vivo studies, and that the suggested route of administration in terms of least degree of adverse effects is inhalation.

Although the pathogen generally infects the respiratory system, whether it is present in the bloodstream and whether it poses a threat to the blood supply during the period of the outbreak is of serious public concern. In this study, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to screen total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 2199 blood donors, who had donated blood at the Guangzhou Blood Center during the epidemic. The Ig-reactive samples were further characterized for IgA, IgG, and IgM subtypes by ELISA and viral nucleic acid by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among the 2199 plasma samples, seven were reactive under total antibodies' screening. Further testing revealed that none of them had detectable viral nucleic acid or IgM antibody, but two samples contained IgA and IgG. The IgG antibody titers of both positive samples were 1:16 and 1:4, respectively. Our results indicated a low prevalence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in our blood donors, as none of the tests were positive for viral nucleic acid and only 2 out of 2199 (0.09%) of samples were positive for IgG and IgA. There would be a limited necessity for the implementation of such testing in blood screening in a COVID-19 low-risk area.","Xu, Ru; Huang, Jieting; Duan, Chaohui; Liao, Qiao; Shan, Zhengang; Wang, Min; Rong, Xia; Li, Chengyao; Fu, Yongshui; Wang, Hao",J. med. virol,381,6

One of the main sources of difficulty is that a very limited amount of daily COVID-19 case data is available, and with few exceptions, the majority of countries are currently in the""exponential spread stage,""and thus there is scarce information available which would enable one to predict the phase transition between spread and containment. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predicting the spread of COVID-19 based on dictionary learning and online nonnegative matrix factorization (online NMF). The key idea is to learn dictionary patterns of short evolution instances of the new daily cases in multiple countries at the same time, so that their latent correlation structures are captured in the dictionary patterns. We first learn such patterns by minibatch learning from the entire time-series and then further adapt them to the time-series by online NMF. As we progressively adapt and improve the learned dictionary patterns to the more recent observations, we also use them to make one-step predictions by the partial fitting. Lastly, by recursively applying the one-step predictions, we can extrapolate our predictions into the near future. Our prediction results can be directly attributed to the learned dictionary patterns due to their interpretability.","Lyu, Hanbaek; Strohmeier, Christopher; Menz, Georg; Needell, Deanna",,381,1

Modern medicine has revealed some connections between the lung and large intestine in tissue origin and mucosal immunity, and preliminarily illuminated the material basis and possible regulatory mechanism of the theory. Recently, this theory has been applied to guide the treatment of refractory lung and intestine diseases such as COVID-19 and ulcerative colitis and has obtained reliable efficacy. Existing research results show that the anatomical homogeneity of lung and large intestine promotes the correlation between lung-bowel mucosal immunity, and mucosal immunity and migration and homing of innate lymphocytes are one of the physiological and pathological mechanisms for lung and large intestine to share. Under the guidance of this theory, Chinese medicines with heat-clearing and detoxifying or tonic effects are commonly used in the treatment of the lung and intestinal diseases by regulating lung-bowel mucosal immunity and they can be candidate drugs to treat lung/intestinal diseases simultaneously. However, the existing studies on immune regulation are mainly focused on the expression levels of sIgA and cytokines, as well as the changes in the number of immune cells such as innate lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. While the following aspects need further investigation: the airway/intestinal mucous hypersecretion, the functional changes of pulmonary and intestinal mucosal barrier immune cells, the dynamic process of lung/intestinal mucosal immune interaction, the intervention effect of local pulmonary/intestinal microecology, the correlation and biological basis between the heat-clearing and detoxifying effect and the tonic effect, and its regulation of pulmonary/intestinal mucosal immunity. In this paper, we try to analyze the internal relationship between lung and intestine related diseases from the point of view of the common mucosal immune system of lung and intestine, and summarize the characteristics and rules of traditional Chinese medicine compound and its active ingredients, which have regulatory effect on lung and intestine mucosal immune system, so as to further explain the theoretical connotation of ""lung and large intestine being interior-exteriorly related"" and provide reference for the research and development of drugs for related diseases.","Lou, Zhaohuan; Zhao, Huajun; Lyu, Guiyuan",Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,381,2

DESIGN: A multi-centre, observational, retrospective study. METHODS: Only COVID-19 positive patients who required an emergency department evaluation for dyspnoea were considered. The primary objective of the study was to compare the ROX value obtained during triage with the medical diagnosis of ARDS and intubation in 72 h of the triage evaluation. The ROX index value was also compared with objective outcomes, such as the pressure of arterial O2 (PaO2 )/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) ratio and the lung parenchyma volume involved in COVID-19-related inflammatory processes, based on 3D reconstructions of chest computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: During the study period, from 20 March 2020 until 31 May 2020, a total of 273 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The predictive ability of ROX for the risk of developing ARDS in 72 h after triage evaluation was associated with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.845 (0.797-0.892, p < 0.001), whereas the AUROC value was 0.727 (0.634-0.821, p < 0.001) for the risk of intubation. ROX values were strongly correlated with PaO2 /FiO2 values (r = 0.650, p < 0.001), decreased ROX values were associated with increased percentages of lung involvement based on 3D CT reconstruction (r = -0.371, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The ROX index showed a good ability to identify triage patients at high evolutionary risk. Correlations with objective but more invasive indicators (PaO2 /FiO2 and CT) confirmed the important role of ROX in identifying COVID-19 patients with extensive pathological processes. IMPACT: During the difficult triage evaluation of COVID-19 patients, the ROX index can help the nurse to identify the real severity of the patient. The triage systems could integrate the ROX in the rapid patient assessment to stratify patients more accurately.","Zaboli, Arian; Ausserhofer, Dietmar; Pfeifer, Norbert; Sibilio, Serena; Tezza, Giovanna; Ciccariello, Laura; Turcato, Gianni",J. adv. nurs,381,1

Due to ADCs' congregate nature and participants' compromised health status, many ADCs have been forced to close during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unknown how closures have impacted service delivery at ADCs. Guided by the Resiliency Activation Framework, we (a) identified consequences resulting from closures of ADCs during the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) described factors that have enabled the ADC community to remain resilient in the wake of challenges brought on by the pandemic. We conducted 2 focus groups in California (n = 12), and individual interviews with ADC staff members (n = 8) in 7 other states. The results of a directed content analysis revealed perceived declines in physical, cognitive, and mental health of ADC users and increased caregiver strain. Access to human, social, economic, and political capital were essential for supporting ADCs in buffering the impacts of the pandemic on the older adults they serve but were not consistently available. Research is urgently needed that quantifies the impacts of the pandemic on ADC users and their caregivers to inform policy and advocacy efforts in the wake of the pandemic.","Sadarangani, Tina; Zhong, Jie; Vora, Paayal; Missaelides, Lydia",J Gerontol Soc Work,381,6

Severity of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is likely associated with the infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We therefore aimed to assess the association between SARS-CoV-2 exposure within households and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We performed a Danish nationwide register-based cohort study including laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals from 22 February to 6 October 2020. Household exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was defined as having one individual tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within the household. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate the association between 'critical COVID-19' within and between households with and without secondary cases. RESULTS: From 15,063 multi-person households, 19,773 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals were included; 11,632 were categorized as index cases without any secondary household cases, 3,431 as index cases with secondary cases, i.e. 22.8% of multi-person households, and 4,710 as secondary cases. 'Critical COVID-19' occurred in 2.9 % of index cases living with no secondary cases, 4.9 % of index cases with secondary cases, and 1.3 % of secondary cases. The adjusted hazard ratio for 'critical COVID-19' among index cases versus secondary cases within the same household was 2.50 (95%CI=1.88-3.34), 2.27 (95%CI=1.77-2.93) for index cases in households with no secondary cases versus secondary cases, and 1.1 (95%CI=0.93-1.30) for index cases with secondary cases versus index cases without secondary cases. CONCLUSION: We found no increased hazard ratio of 'critical COVID-19' among household members of infected SARS-CoV-2 index cases.","Broccia, Marcella M; de Knegt, Victoria Elizabeth V E; Mills, Elisabeth Helen Anna E H A; Møller, Amalie Lykkemark A L; Gnesin, Filip F; Fischer, Thea K T K; Zylyftari, Nertila N; Blomberg, Stig Nikolaj S N; Andersen, Mikkel Porsborg M P; Schou, Morten M; Fosbøl, Emil E; Kragholm, Kristian K; Christensen, Helle Collatz H C; Polcwiartek, Laura Bech L B; Phelps, Matthew M; Køber, Lars L; Torp-Pedersen, Christian C",Clin. infect. dis,381,24

Moreover, fear of COVID-19 could lead oncological patients to experience feelings of hopelessness related to their medical care. Patient-centered communication may act as a buffer against the aforementioned variables. This study aimed to test the role of doctor–patient communication in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and hopelessness. Methods: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a sample of 90 oncological outpatients was recruited (40 males (44.4%) and 50 females (55.6%), mean age = 66.08 (SD = 12.12)). A structured interview was developed and used during the pandemic to measure the patients’ perceived (A) fear of COVID-19, and (B) feelings of hopelessness, and (C) physicians’ use of empathetic and (D) clear language during the consultation. A multiple mediation model was tested, and the effects between males and females were also compared. Results: Empathetic and clear doctor–patient communication buffered the adverse effect of the fear of COVID-19 on hopelessness through a full-mediation model. The effects did not differ between males and females in the overall model but its indirect effects. Discussions: Patient-centered communication using empathy and clear language can buffer the adverse effect of the fear of COVID-19 and protect oncological patients from hopelessness during the pandemic. These findings might help to improve clinical oncological practice.","Rossi, Alessandro Alberto Marconi Maria Taccini Federica Verusio Claudio Mannarini Stefania",Behavioral Sciences,381,24

The only measures for controlling the outbreak are testing and isolation of infected cases. Molecular real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are very sensitive but require highly equipped laboratories and well-trained personnel. In this study, a rapid point-of-need detection method was developed to detect the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), envelope protein (E), and nucleocapsid protein (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 based on the reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay. RdRP, E, and N RT-RPA assays required approximately 15 min to amplify 2, 15, and 15 RNA molecules of molecular standard/reaction, respectively. RdRP and E RT-RPA assays detected SARS-CoV-1 and 2 genomic RNA, whereas the N RT-RPA assay identified only SARS-CoV-2 RNA. All established assays did not cross-react with nucleic acids of other respiratory pathogens. The RT-RPA assay's clinical sensitivity and specificity in comparison to real-time RT-PCR (n = 36) were 94 and 100% for RdRP; 65 and 77% for E; and 83 and 94% for the N RT-RPA assay. The assays were deployed to the field, where the RdRP RT-RPA assays confirmed to produce the most accurate results in three different laboratories in Africa (n = 89). The RPA assays were run in a mobile suitcase laboratory to facilitate the deployment at point of need. The assays can contribute to speed up the control measures as well as assist in the detection of COVID-19 cases in low-resource settings.","El Wahed, Ahmed Abd; Patel, Pranav; Maier, Melanie; Pietsch, Corinna; Rüster, Dana; Böhlken-Fascher, Susanne; Kissenkötter, Jonas; Behrmann, Ole; Frimpong, Michael; Diagne, Moussa Moïse; Faye, Martin; Dia, Ndongo; Shalaby, Mohamed A; Amer, Haitham; Elgamal, Mahmoud; Zaki, Ali; Ismail, Ghada; Kaiser, Marco; Corman, Victor M; Niedrig, Matthias; Landt, Olfert; Faye, Ousmane; Sall, Amadou A; Hufert, Frank T; Truyen, Uwe; Liebert, Uwe G; Weidmann, Manfred",Anal Chem,381,22

This has heavily affected the quality of life in border regions, which are often found to be at a disadvantage when compared to other regions in terms of employment, accessibility, social services and economic growth. Based upon developing threads in the literature concerning the untapped potential for development in border regions, we argue that the Mission-Oriented Approach (MOA) can fit well with the ambitious goal to revitalize those territories in the aftermath of the pandemic. Despite the surge of MOA in discourses on innovation policy, we seek to implement it in a regional development perspective, pursuing both economic and social policy objectives. The authors unravel the policy concept of MOA into three main aspects: I) address a sound societal challenge; II) Research & Development (R&D) regional agenda embedded in a cross-border regional development vision; III) mobilizing multiple cross-sectorial projects. Through a desk study analysis, the authors draw insights from selected case studies where these aspects have been implemented to inspire policy intervention in the aftermath of COVID-19.

Recent positive results for noiseless group testing have motivated the study of practical noise models, a prominent one being dilution noise. Under the dilution noise model, items in a test pool have an i.i.d. probability of being diluted, meaning their contribution to a test does not take effect. In this setting, we investigate the number of tests required to achieve vanishing error probability with respect to existing algorithms and provide an algorithm-independent converse bound. In contrast to other noise models, we also encounter the interesting phenomenon that dilution noise on the resulting test outcomes can be offset by choosing a suitable noise-level-dependent Bernoulli test design, resulting in matching achievability and converse bounds up to order in the high noise regime.","Arpino, Gabriel; Grometto, Nicolo; Bandeira, Afonso S.",,381,33

Since 2014, haploidentical transplants have surpassed UCB transplants performed in the United States (CIBMTR Summary Slides, 2018, available at https://www.cibmtr.org). Increased use of haploidentical transplants has brought to light concerns about UCB transplants, including delayed engraftment and graft failure, increased nonrelapse mortality, increased infection risk, and UCB acquisition costs [Lancet Oncol 2010;11:653-660; Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 2019;1456-1464]. These concerns will need to be addressed for UCB to remain a viable option as a graft source for hematopoietic cell transplant. Other promising therapeutic benefits for UCB, in addition to hematopoietic cell transplant, is its use in regenerative medicine and immune modulation, which is currently being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials.","Kindwall-Keller, Tamila L; Ballen, Karen K",Stem cells transl. med.

Objective: To determine the neurological phenotypes, incidence, and outcomes among adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients with clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at 28 centers, representing 13 countries and 4 continents. The study was performed by the Global Consortium Study of Neurologic Dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID) from March 1 to September 30, 2020, and the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Neuro-COVID Registry (ENERGY) from March to October 2020. Three cohorts were included: (1) the GCS-NeuroCOVID all COVID-19 cohort (n = 3055), which included consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with and without neurological manifestations; (2) the GCS-NeuroCOVID COVID-19 neurological cohort (n = 475), which comprised consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had confirmed neurological manifestations; and (3) the ENERGY cohort (n = 214), which included patients with COVID-19 who received formal neurological consultation. Exposures: Clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Neurological phenotypes were classified as self-reported symptoms or neurological signs and/or syndromes assessed by clinical evaluation. Composite incidence was reported for groups with at least 1 neurological manifestation. The main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Results: Of the 3055 patients in the all COVID-19 cohort, 1742 (57%) were men, and the mean age was 59.9 years (95% CI, 59.3-60.6 years). Of the 475 patients in the COVID-19 neurological cohort, 262 (55%) were men, and the mean age was 62.6 years (95% CI, 61.1-64.1 years). Of the 214 patients in the ENERGY cohort, 133 (62%) were men, and the mean age was 67 years (95% CI, 52-78 years). A total of 3083 of 3743 patients (82%) across cohorts had any neurological manifestation (self-reported neurological symptoms and/or clinically captured neurological sign and/or syndrome). The most common self-reported symptoms included headache (1385 of 3732 patients [37%]) and anosmia or ageusia (977 of 3700 patients [26%]). The most prevalent neurological signs and/or syndromes were acute encephalopathy (1845 of 3740 patients [49%]), coma (649 of 3737 patients [17%]), and stroke (222 of 3737 patients [6%]), while meningitis and/or encephalitis were rare (19 of 3741 patients [0.5%]). Presence of clinically captured neurologic signs and/or syndromes was associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.99; 95% CI, 4.33-8.28) after adjusting for study site, age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Presence of preexisting neurological disorders (aOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.80-2.75) was associated with increased risk of developing neurological signs and/or syndromes with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: In this multicohort study, neurological manifestations were prevalent among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and were associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Preexisting neurological disorders were associated with increased risk of developing neurological signs and/or syndromes in COVID-19.","Chou, Sherry H-Y; Beghi, Ettore; Helbok, Raimund; Moro, Elena; Sampson, Joshua; Altamirano, Valeria; Mainali, Shraddha; Bassetti, Claudio; Suarez, Jose I; McNett, Molly",JAMA Netw Open,381,25

Despite their ubiquity in the real-world deployments, these distribution shifts are under-represented in the datasets widely used in the ML community today. To address this gap, we present WILDS, a curated benchmark of 10 datasets reflecting a diverse range of distribution shifts that naturally arise in real-world applications, such as shifts across hospitals for tumor identification; across camera traps for wildlife monitoring; and across time and location in satellite imaging and poverty mapping. On each dataset, we show that standard training yields substantially lower out-of-distribution than in-distribution performance. This gap remains even with models trained by existing methods for tackling distribution shifts, underscoring the need for new methods for training models that are more robust to the types of distribution shifts that arise in practice.

The search for natural therapeutic agents includes compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. Among the many steps involved in bioprospection, extraction is the first and most critical step for obtaining bioactive compounds. One of the main advantages of using compressed fluids extraction is the high quality of the final product obtained due to the use of green solvents, while the selectivity towards target compounds can be tuned by adjusting the process parameters, especially pressure, temperature and solvent characteristics. In this review, a discussion is provided on the power of compressed fluids, such as supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and subcritical water extraction (SWE) to obtain antiviral and anti-inflammatory compounds from natural sources. In addition, an adequate knowledge about the identity and quantity of the compounds present in the extract is essential to correlate biological activity with chemical composition. Phytochemical profiling tools used for identification and quantification of these bioactive natural compound are also discussed. It can be anticipated that after the current SARS-COV-2 pandemic, the search of new natural compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity will be a hot research topic, so, this review provides an overview on the technologies currently used that could help this research.","Poletto, Patrícia; Alvarez-Rivera, Gerardo; Torres, Talyta M.S.; Mendiola, Jose A.; Ibañez, Elena; Cifuentes, Alejandro",TrAC Trends Anal.

In this regard, there are two completely different approaches governments can take: a restrictive one, in which drastic measures such as self-isolation can seriously damage the economy, and a more liberal one, where more relaxed restrictions may put at risk a high percentage of the population. The optimal approach could be somewhere in between, and, in order to make the right decisions, it is necessary to accurately estimate the future effects of taking one or other measures. In this paper, we use the SEIR epidemiological model (Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered) for infectious diseases to represent the evolution of the virus COVID-19 over time in the population. To optimize the best sequences of actions governments can take, we propose a methodology with two approaches, one based on Deep Q-Learning and another one based on Genetic Algorithms. The sequences of actions (confinement, self-isolation, two-meter distance or not taking restrictions) are evaluated according to a reward system focused on meeting two objectives: firstly, getting few people infected so that hospitals are not overwhelmed with critical patients, and secondly, avoiding taking drastic measures for too long which can potentially cause serious damage to the economy. The conducted experiments prove that our methodology is a valid tool to discover actions governments can take to reduce the negative effects of a pandemic in both senses. We also prove that the approach based on Deep Q-Learning overcomes the one based on Genetic Algorithms for optimizing the sequences of actions.","Miralles-Pechu'an, Luis; Jim'enez, Fernando; Ponce, Hiram; Mart'inez-Villasenor, Lourdes",,381,16

This cross-sectional study included 1156 respondents who participated in an internet survey evaluating mask-related behaviors. All the WHO criteria were complied with by 1.4% of participants, regardless of medical profession, specialty or place of employment. HCW mostly adhered to criterion 1 (C1; strict covering of the face and mouth with the mask; 90.8%), C4 (washing/disinfecting the hands after touching/taking off the mask; 49%) and C3 (taking off the mask properly without touching the anterior surface; 43.4%), whereas C2 (avoidance of touching the mask with hands) was complied with least commonly (6.8%). HCW with mask-induced itch (31.6%) complied to C2 less often (odds ratio 0.53; p = 0.01). The study reveals that Polish HCW rarely adhere to all the 2020 WHO guidance criteria on the use of masks, whereas the adherence to particular criteria is variable and may be associated with the presence of skin-related conditions and other factors.

The Chinese government proposes that both Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine can be used in combination to treat pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV2, and TCM effectively provides continuous prevention and treatment. METHODS: The present review analyzes and summarizes the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with TCM. A classified analysis of the efficacy and advantages of TCM for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 was performed, and the mechanisms of TCM in treating COVID-19 are summarized. RESULTS: TCM is effective in preventing COVID-19, and medical staff can prevent an iatrogenic infection by taking a decoction made based on the principles of TCM. As of March 13, 2020, new cases of COVID-19 in China have decreased in number to single digits. TCM's curative effect was outstanding, with a national participation rate of over 90%. More than 70,000 people were cured of COVID-19 and discharged from the hospital. Only approximately 10,000 patients are currently being treated, and the total treatment time is approximately 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: TCM is currently the best choice for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, and it is expected that it will be promoted by countries around the world.","Zhao, Zhenyu; Li, Yanda; Zhou, Liangyun; Zhou, Xiuteng; Xie, Bowen; Zhang, Wenjin; Sun, Jiahui",Phytomedicine,381,24

In addition, well-continued ribbons of ultramicrotomed sections can be obtained, which are suitable for the above mentioned analyses.

This article discusses the principles, superiorities and challenges of this combined process. The feasibility of the combined process depends on the efficiency of electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonium and the conditions in the anammox process to use the reduced ammonium as the substrate to achieve deep nitrogen removal. The article provides a feasible strategy for using the electrochemical reduction and anammox combined process to treat nitrate-rich wastewater.","Zou, Xinyi; Chen, Chongjun; Wang, Changhong; Zhang, Qun; Yu, Zhuowei; Wu, Haiping; Zhuo, Chao; Zhang, Tian C",Sci Total Environ,381,21

In comparison, the diurnal temperature range (26.8 ± 0.4%) and temperature seasonality (14.6 ± 0.8%) had the highest impacts in the sub-arctic region. Our results also show that September and October have favorable climatic conditions for the COVID-19 spread in the sub-arctic and humid continental regions, respectively.

This review describes the history, mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic applications, and safety profile of hydroxychloroquine as an immunomodulatory and antiviral agent. It also summarizes the major studies that launched and assessed the use of hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: More recent literature calls into question the long-held dogma that endolysosomal alkalinization is the primary mode of action of hydroxychloroquine. Ongoing uncertainty about the multiple potential mechanisms contributing to the therapeutic effect of hydroxychloroquine in rheumatic and viral disease led to a natural avenue for exploration in the treatment of COVID-19. Taken as a whole, the literature does not support utilizing hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This is, at least in part, due to the wide variability in hydroxychloroquine pharmacokinetics between patients and difficulty achieving adequate target tissue concentrations of hydroxychloroquine without encountering unacceptable toxicities. Hydroxychloroquine continues to be a routinely prescribed, well-tolerated, effective, and low-cost treatment for rheumatic disease. Its therapeutic versatility has led to frequent repurposing for other conditions, most recently as an investigative treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Despite overall negative findings, the intense study of hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 infection has enhanced our overall understanding of how hydroxychloroquine operates in autoimmune disease and beyond.","Udupa, Akrithi; Leverenz, David; Balevic, Stephen J; Sadun, Rebecca E; Tarrant, Teresa K; Rogers, Jennifer L",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,381,24

However, the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 infection is poorly understood. Previous studies established clinical and biological phenotypes among classical ARDS cohorts, with important therapeutic implications. The phenotypic profile of COVID-19 associated ARDS remains unknown. Methods: We used latent class modeling via a multivariate mixture model to identify phenotypes from clinical and biochemical data collected from 263 patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital intensive care unit with COVID-19-associated ARDS between March 13 and August 2, 2020. Findings: We identified two distinct phenotypes of COVID-19-associated ARDS, with substantial differences in biochemical profiles despite minimal differences in respiratory dynamics. The minority phenotype (class 2, n = 70, 26·6%) demonstrated increased markers of coagulopathy, with mild relative hyper-inflammation and dramatically increased markers of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., creatinine, troponin). The odds of 28-day mortality among the class 2 phenotype was more than double that of the class 1 phenotype (40·0% vs.· 23·3%, OR = 2·2, 95% CI [1·2, 3·9]). Interpretation: We identified distinct phenotypic profiles in COVID-19 associated ARDS, with little variation according to respiratory physiology but with important variation according to systemic and extra-pulmonary markers. Phenotypic identity was highly associated with short-term mortality. The class 2 phenotype exhibited prominent signatures of coagulopathy, suggesting that vascular dysfunction may play an important role in the clinical progression of severe COVID-19-related disease.","Ranjeva, Sylvia; Pinciroli, Riccardo; Hodell, Evan; Mueller, Ariel; Hardin, C Corey; Thompson, B Taylor; Berra, Lorenzo",EClinicalMedicine,381,24

Hence, it is necessary to study the effects of land use for oil palm and the linkage between each impact for a holistic understanding. Besides, the consideration of various impact aspects in terms of a nexus is necessary for suggesting appropriate practices or zoning, because a single impact evaluation may not be comprehensive. Therefore, this study assessed the land use impacts from oil palm plantations in the five regions of Thailand. The land use impacts studied were greenhouse gas emissions, water scarcity, soil quality, and biodiversity. The assessment indicated the southern region to be the most suitable for further expansion of oil palm plantations, which is consistent with the government recommendation. However, if the expansion of oil palm in other regions is necessary, the central region is recommended because of available irrigation supply and better soil fertility compared to other regions. This study found that the land use impacts resulted from unsuitable management of oil palm plantations in the past. The increase of greenhouse gas emissions was mainly due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers for soil quality improvement and water pumping from irrigation water consumption. Meanwhile, the deficiency of water availability led to the degradation of biodiversity and ecosystems. To decrease the land use impacts in the long run, suitable practice is important for sustainable oil palm plantations.","Jaroenkietkajorn, Ukrit; Gheewala, Shabbir H",Sci Total Environ,381,14

It is termed sector diffusion. We combine it with all six variants of the classical super-resolution observational model that arise from permutations of its three operators for warping, blurring, and downsampling.

In addition to establishing the exact criteria regarding whether treatment for a newly arriving patient shows a sufficient likelihood of success, it is also necessary to ask whether patients already undergoing treatment whose prospects are low should be moved into palliative care if new patients with better prospects arrive. This question has led to divergent ethical guidelines. This paper explores the distinction between withholding and withdrawing medical treatment during times of scarcity. As a first central point, the paper argues that a revival of the ethical distinction between doing and allowing would have a revisionary impact on cases of voluntary treatment withdrawal. A second systematic focus lies in the concern that withdrawal due to scarcity might be considered a physical transgression and therefore more problematic than not treating someone in the first place. In light of the persistent disagreement, especially concerning the second issue, the paper concludes with two pragmatic proposals for how to handle the ethical uncertainty: (1) triage protocols should explicitly require that intensive care attempts are designed as time-limited trials based on specified treatment goals, and this intent should be documented very clearly at the beginning of each treatment; and (2) lower survival prospects can be accepted for treatments that have already begun, compared with the respective triage rules for the initial access of patients to intensive care.","Dufner, Annette",Bioethics,381,23

Validating the CoV consensomes, we show that high confidence transcriptional targets (HCTs) of MERS, SARS1 and SARS2 infection intersect with HCTs of signaling pathway nodes with known roles in CoV infection. Among a series of novel use cases, we gather evidence for hypotheses that SARS2 infection efficiently represses E2F family HCTs encoding key drivers of DNA replication and the cell cycle; that progesterone receptor signaling antagonizes SARS2-induced inflammatory signaling in the airway epithelium; and that SARS2 HCTs are enriched for genes involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

The present cross-sectional study investigated the associations between financial stress and dietary intake and dietary risk scores among higher education students (undergraduate and graduate students) in the U.S. and examined whether poor sleep quality and short sleep duration mediated the relationship between financial stress and dietary risk score. Validated tools were used to assess financial stress, sleep quality, sleep duration, dietary intake, and dietary risk. A total of 1280 students from three large U.S. universities completed the study. Results indicated that higher financial stress was associated with lower vegetable, fruit, fiber, and calcium intake, higher added sugar intake from sugar sweetened beverages, and higher dietary risk score. Further, the positive relationship between financial stress and dietary risk score was completely mediated by poor sleep quality among students who reported poor sleep quality and by short sleep duration among students who slept less than 7 h per night. These findings suggest that students might benefit from both financial management training and sleep education services to reduce undesirable dietary behaviors.","Du, Chen Wang Wenyan Hsiao Pao Ying Ludy Mary-Jon Tucker Robin M.",Behavioral Sciences,381,1

METHODS: Nine women between 51 and 59 years old with climacteric syndrome in menopause or perimenopause were included. Patients with hormone replacement therapy, psychiatric treatment with antidepressants, or acupuncture treatment in the last 3 months were excluded. A 4 Hz EA treatment was performed at acupoints Shenshu (BL-23), Pishu (BL-20), Guanyuan (REN-4), Taixi (KID-3), Fuliu (KID-7), Sanyinjiao (SP-6) and Neiguan (P-6) points. Women were treated two times a week for five consecutive weeks for a total treatment of 10 sessions. The menopause rating scale (MRS) was used to evaluate symptoms reduction and CGRP gene expression was measured before and after 10 EA session. RESULTS: The results shown that climacteric symptoms diminish significantly after EA therapy. CGRP gene expression was down-regulated, evidencing a decrease of 5-fold after EA therapy respect to the initial condition. CONCLUSION: EA treatment was associated with improvement in patients with climacteric syndrome and may be related to modulation of CGRP levels.","Pinzón-Galvis, Camilo Alberto; Román-García, Karina; Rosas-Martínez, María Isabel; Becerril-Chávez, Flavia; Medel-Flores, Olivia; Sánchez-Monroy, Virginia",Explor.

Modern handheld, ultra-portable ultrasound devices have been developed by multiple companies and are contributing to make bedside ultrasound evaluation a practice available to all physicians. The significance of making point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) a common practice that all physicians eventually can use in the evaluation of their patients is changing the way medicine is practiced, allowing physicians to quickly obtain valuable information to complement the traditional physical examination. Despite the proven benefits of using bedside ultrasound imaging as a part of the patient evaluation and for procedure guidance, adoption of this technology still is not widespread among anesthesiology clinicians nor is there uniform teaching of ultrasound skills to anesthesia residents and faculty. Among obstacles that have been identified as precluding achievement of the goal of widespread utilization of POCUS among anesthesia professionals and trainees, are the availability of equipment for all physicians when it is needed and lack of instructor supervision for trainees who desire to use ultrasound but do not always have an instructor knowledgeable in POCUS with them when an ultrasound examination is warranted. Herein, the characteristics, advantages, and limitations of available ultra-portable, handheld ultrasound devices are analyzed, with a focus on the Butterfly iQ (Butterfly Network, Inc, Guilford, CT) pocket probe, which is available at the authors' institution, and how some of its features, such as the capacity to emulate multiple transducers and its cloud-sharing and teleguidance technology, may contribute to increase the availability and use of POCUS by anesthesia clinicians.","Baribeau, Yanick; Sharkey, Aidan; Chaudhary, Omar; Krumm, Santiago; Fatima, Huma; Mahmood, Feroze; Matyal, Robina",J. cardiothoracic vasc. anest,381,2

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 55 patients with haematological disorders and COVID-19, including 52 with malignancy, two with bone marrow failure and one immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). COVID-19 diagnosis coincided with a new diagnosis of a haematological malignancy in four patients. Among patients, 82% were on systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Of hospitalised patients, 37% (19/51) died while all four outpatients recovered. Risk factors for severe disease or mortality were similar to those in other published cohorts. Raised C-reactive protein at diagnosis predicted an aggressive clinical course. The majority of patients recovered from COVID-19, despite receiving recent SACT. This suggests that SACT, where urgent, should be administered despite intercurrent COVID-19 infection, which should be managed according to standard pathways.

However, the consequences of such measures on activity and mobility patterns among social groups in Global South cities remain unclear. This paper seeks to provide reliable evidence from changes in behaviors across income groups at the urban scale. We report a detailed analysis from a web-based survey to understand the effects of the early and complete lockdown adopted to contain the COVID-19 spread on activity and travel patterns in Bogotá. We also performed a geographical proximity analysis of non-work services and facilities located around surveyed households to challenge the rhetoric about the ‘15-minute’ city. We found that low-income people are more socially exposed to contagion being forced to go out to find their daily sustenance and having adverse economic and travel effects than other income groups. However, even though Bogotá is not so far from meeting the goal of 15 min proximity, particularly for non-work-related activities, we found marked inequalities among income groups regarding access to essential services in proximity. The paper's findings serve as a reminder that travel behavior and accessibility are not the remits of only urban transport planning and that land-use and urban planning play a determining role in redressing social and spatial inequalities in a city. © 2021 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies","Guzman, L.

Among the various safety measures taken, much attention has been given to school closure as a non-pharmaceutical mitigation tool to curb the spread of the disease through ensuring ""social"" (physical) distancing. Nearly 1.725 billion children in over 95% of countries worldwide have been affected by school closures implemented in April 2020 as the virus continued to spread. In the field of education, policymakers' attention has been directed at keeping students on board through remote learning and addressing the immediate needs of schools upon reopening. The study presented in this article focuses on who remains absent after schools resume. Using publicly available survey data from the USAID Demographic Health Surveys Program and the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey from before and after the 2013-2016 Ebola pandemic in Guinea and Sierra Leone in West Africa, the author examined changes in school enrolment and dropout patterns, with targeted consideration given to traditionally marginalised groups. At the time, schools closed for between seven to nine months in the two countries; this length and intensity makes this Ebola pandemic the only health crisis in the recent past to come close to the pandemic-related school closures experienced in 2020. The author's findings suggest that post-Ebola, youth in the poorest households saw the largest increase in school dropout. Exceeding expected pre-Ebola dropout rates, an additional 17,400 of the poorest secondary-age youth were out of school. This evidence is important for minimising the likely post-COVID-19 expansion in inequality.

The nation-wide NOx emission reduction of 53.4% due to the lockdown in 2020 quarter one in China may represent the current upper limit of China's NOx emission control. During the Chinese New Year Holiday (P2), NOx emission intensity in China declined by 44.7% compared to the preceding 3 weeks (P1). NOx emission intensity increased by 20.3% during the 4 weeks after P2 (P3), despite the unchanged NO2 column. It recovered to 2019 level at the end of March (P4). The East China (22°N - 42°N, 102°E - 122°E) received greater influence from COVID-19. Overall NOx emission from East China for 2020 first quarter is 40.5% lower than 2019, and in P4 it is still 22.9% below the same period in 2019. The 40.5% decrease of NOx emission in 2020 first quarter in East China lead to 36.5% increase of surface O3 and 12.5% decrease of surface PM2.5. The elevated O3 promotes the secondary aerosol formation through heterogeneous pathways. We recommend that the complicated interaction between PM2.5 and O3 should be considered in the emission control strategy making process in the future.","Zhang, Qianqian; Pan, Yuepeng; He, Yuexin; Walters, Wendell W; Ni, Qianyin; Liu, Xuyan; Xu, Guangyi; Shao, Jiali; Jiang, Chunlai",Sci Total Environ,381,24

The present study was designed to answer to this question. METHODS: The population study was the Covid-Clinic-Toul cohort which records data about all hospitalized patients with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for a SARS-CoV-2 infection at Toulouse University hospital, France. Exposure to systemic corticosteroids was assessed at hospital admission. A propensity score (PS) according to corticosteroid exposure was calculated including comorbidities, clinical, radiological and biological variables that impact COVID-19 severity. The primary outcome was composite, including admission to intensive care unit, need of mechanical ventilation and death occurring during the 14 days after hospital admission. Logistic regression models adjusted for the PS (overlap weighting) provided odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Overall, 253 patients were included in the study. Median age was 64 years, 140 patients (59.6%) were men and 218 (86.2%) had at least one comorbidity. Seventeen patients (6.7%) were exposed to corticosteroids before hospital admission. Chronic inflammatory disease (n = 8) was the most frequent indication. One hundred and twenty patients (47.4%) met the composite outcome. In the crude model, the OR of previous exposure to systemic corticosteroids was 1.64; 95% CI: 0.60-4.44. In the adjusted model, it was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.65-1.83). CONCLUSION: Overall, this study provide some evidences for an absence of an increased risk of unfavorable outcome with previous exposure to corticosteroids in the general setting of patients hospitalized for COVID-19.","Lafaurie, Margaux; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Delobel, Pierre; Kamar, Nassim; Charpentier, Sandrine; Sommet, Agnès; Moulis, Guillaume",BMC Pharmacol Toxicol,381,25

Computation modeling predicts that RAI-S-37 lands at the palm domain of RdRp and prevents conformational changes required for nucleotide incorporation by RdRp. In addition, combination of RAI-S-37 with remdesivir exhibits additive activity against anti-SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among students and employees of two higher education institutions in Lahore, Pakistan, namely the University of Lahore and the Gulab Devi Educational Complex. Participants were recruited using a convenient sampling method. A validated 45-item, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Total possible scores were 0-14 for knowledge (scores < 7, 7-10 and > 10 were considered to indicate poor, moderate and good knowledge, respectively); 0-7 for attitude (scores > 5 were considered to indicate a good attitude); and 0-18 for COVID-19 preventative practices (scores > 12 were considered to indicate good preventative practices). Results: Of the 417 enrolled participants, 416 reported that they were aware of COVID-19 and social media was the major source of their information. Mean scores were 10.12 ± 2.20 for knowledge (good, moderate and poor knowledge in 50.2%, 42.8% and 7.0% of participants, respectively); 5.74 ± 1.28 for attitude (65.4% of individuals had a positive attitude); and 11.04 ± 3.34 for COVID-19 preventative practices (only 36.5% of participants had good preventive practices). Conclusion: Pakistani university students and employees have good knowledge and attitudes regarding COVID-19, but unsatisfactory preventive practices. Therefore, health regulators should use multiple communication approaches, such as electronic, print and social media, phone messages, etc., to increase awareness and improve practices related to COVID-19.","Salman, Muhammad; Mustafa, Zia Ul; Asif, Noman; Zaidi, Haider Abbas; Hussain, Khalid; Shehzadi, Naureen; Khan, Tahir Mehmood; Saleem, Zikria",Drugs Ther Perspect,381,2

Cardiac damage is attributed mostly to a bystander effect: the aberrant host response to acute respiratory infection. However, direct infection of cardiac tissue by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also occurs. We examined here the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) that beat spontaneously. These cardiomyocytes express the angiotensin I converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and a subset of the proteases that mediate spike protein cleavage in the lungs, but not transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection was productive: viral transcripts accounted for about 88% of total mRNA. In the cytoplasm of infected hiPSC-CM, smooth walled exocytic vesicles contained numerous 65-90 nm particles with typical ribonucleocapsid structures, and virus-like particles with knob-like spikes covered the cell surface. To better understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spread in hiPSC-CM we engineered an expression vector coding for the spike protein with a monomeric emerald-green fluorescent protein fused to its cytoplasmic tail (S-mEm). Proteolytic processing of S-mEm and the parental spike were equivalent. Live cell imaging tracked spread of S-mEm signal from cell to cell and documented formation of syncytia. A cell-permeable, peptide-based molecule that blocks the catalytic site of furin abolished cell fusion. A spike mutant with the single amino acid change R682S that inactivates the furin cleavage site was fusion inactive. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in hiPSC-CM and furin activation of its spike protein is required for fusion-based cytopathology. This hiPSC-CM platform provides an opportunity for target-based drug discovery in cardiac COVID-19. Author SummaryIt is unclear whether the cardiac complications frequently observed in COVID-19 patients are due exclusively to systemic inflammation and thrombosis. Viral replication has occasionally been confirmed in cardiac tissue, but rigorous analyses are restricted to rare autopsy materials. Moreover, there are few animal models to study cardiovascular complications of coronavirus infections. To overcome these limitations, we developed an in vitro model of SARS-CoV-2 spread in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. In these cells, infection is highly productive: viral transcription levels exceed those documented in permissive transformed cell lines. To better understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spread we expressed a fluorescent version of its spike protein that allowed to characterize a fusion-based cytopathic effect. A mutant of the spike protein with a single amino acid mutation in the furin cleavage site lost cytopathic function. The spike protein of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus drove cardiomyocyte fusion with slow kinetics, whereas the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and the respiratory coronavirus 229E were inactive. These fusion activities correlated with the level of cardiovascular complications observed in infections with the respective viruses. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to cause cardiac damage by fusing cardiomyocytes.","Navaratnarajah, Chanakha K.; Pease, David R.; Halfmann, Peter; Taye, Biruhalem; Barkhymer, Alison; Howell, Kyle G.; Charlesworth, Jon E.; Christensen, Trace A.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Cattaneo, Roberto; Schneider, Jay W.; Timothy J.

Cardiovascular liabilities are not consistently detected in early-stage clinical trials and often become apparent when drugs are administered chronically for extended periods of time. Vital sign data collection outside of the clinic offers an opportunity for deeper physiological characterization of drug candidates and earlier safety signal detection. A working group representing expertise from biopharmaceutical and technology sectors, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) public-private partnerships, academia, and regulators discussed and presented a remote cardiac monitoring case study at the FNIH Biomarkers Consortium Remote Digital Monitoring for Medical Product Development workshop to examine applicability of the biomarker qualification evidentiary framework by the FDA. This use case examined the components of the framework, including the statement of need, the context of use, the state of the evidence, and the benefit/risk profile. Examination of results from 2 clinical trials deploying 510(k)-cleared devices for remote cardiac data collection demonstrated the need for analytical and clinical validity irrespectively of the regulatory status of a device of interest, emphasizing the importance of data collection method assessment in the context of intended use. Additionally, collection of large amounts of ambulatory data also highlighted the need for new statistical methods and contextual information to enable data interpretation. A wider adoption of this approach for drug development purposes will require collaborations across industry, academia, and regulatory agencies to establish methodologies and supportive data sets to enable data interpretation and decision-making.","Izmailova, Elena S.; Wood, William A.; Liu, Qi Zipunnikov Vadim Bloomfield Daniel Homsy Jason Hoffmann Steven C.; Wagner, John A.; Menetski, Joseph P.",Digital Biomarkers,381,20

Considering elevators as a high-risk environment for the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases via surface transmission, common methods of manually applying liquid-form disinfectants are impractical for sanitizing the elevator panel after each use. Therefore, an automated UVC light surface sanitization device with integrated sensing components to avoid UVC light-human interaction and perform frequent sanitization was developed. Algorithmically, the system uses a motion sensor, an inertial measurement unit, and a door sensor to determine when the elevator is empty, stationary, and shut. Once these conditions are met, the UVC lamp is enabled to safely sanitize the elevator control panel. The device's UVC irradiation capabilities were tested by applying UVC light to a mock control panel. A minimum power density of 0.31 mW/cm2 was detected, which can deactivate SARS-CoV-2. The sensing and control system was tested in an elevator and it was demonstrated to be able to detect operating conditions and activate the UVC light at appropriate instances. Our device operates using inexpensive hardware and it can be easily integrated into existing elevator infrastructures. © 2021 by ASME.","Hu, J.; O039,; Brien, J.; Joshi, A. S.; Navabi, Z.

The present cross-sectional study aims to investigate the perceived risk and protective behaviors regarding COVID-19 among pregnant women, in Hamadan, Iran. Using a two-stage cluster sampling method, 225 pregnant women referring to the health centers completed the questionnaires. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman correlation tests as well as a stepwise linear regression model at 95% confidence level. Results: 93.8% of pregnant women had a high level of knowledge, 97.3% had a high performance in protective behaviors, and 72.9% had a moderate level of risk perception related to COVID-19. The highest mean score of knowledge was observed in women who had a history of influenza in their previous pregnancies (90.97 ± 5.94). The mean score of protective behaviors was significantly higher in women with a high economic level (97.78 ± 5.11), and the highest level of risk perception was observed in nulliparous women (59.97 ± 9.80). Risk perception was an independent predictor of protective behaviors related to COVID-19 (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Pregnant women had a high level of knowledge, high performance in protective behaviors, and a moderate level of risk perception related to COVID-19. History of influenza in previous pregnancies, high economic level, and nulliparity were associated with higher levels of knowledge, protective behaviors, and risk perception, respectively. Risk perception of pregnant women regarding COVID-19 can predict their protective behaviors.","Aghababaei, Soodabeh; Bashirian, Saeed; Soltanian, Alireza; Refaei, Mansoureh; Omidi, Tahereh; Ghelichkhani, Samereh; Soltani, Farzaneh",Middle East Fertil Soc J,381,16

Methods: In this large cohort study, 15,409 confirmed patients with the COVID-19 of different severities were followed-up from three specialized COVID-19 hospitals between March 18 and October 11, 2020 in Iraqi Kurdistan. The predictors of mortality and severity were examined in binary logistic regression analysis. Results: The incidence rate of severe/critical status was 12.3% with a median age of 36.0 and case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.98%. The incidence rate of severe/critical conditions and CFR rose with increased age groups;except for 0–14 years (11.9%). The incidence rate of severe/critical patients and CFR was 8.3% and 0.5%, 21.1% and 4.0%, and 23.7% and 8.7% in 15–49 years, 50–64 years, and 65 and older age groups, respectively. The severity of the disease and CFR was associated with coexisting chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (18.2% and 3.1%) and diabetes mellitus (19.8% and 3.4%). The asymptomatic patients (8400 and 54.5%) had statistically higher CFR;2.3% versus 1.6% (P = 0.006). The most common symptoms on diagnosis were fever (31.9%), cough (23.5%), loss of smell/taste (16.3%), sore throat (15.7%), shortness of breath (9.8%), and headache (9.5%). The results showed that being older was the only predictor of mortality and severity in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: This region has a low incidence of severe-critic status and CFR. The patients with coexisting medical conditions are more likely to have severe conditions and die of COVID-19. The older age predicts severe/critic status and higher CFR.

The current research aimed to explore whether the search-engine query patterns could serve as a potential tool for monitoring the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: We collected the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases between January 11, 2020, and April 22, 2020, from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). The search index values of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, fatigue) were retrieved from the Baidu Index. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to analyze the association between the Baidu index values for each COVID-19-related symptom and the number of confirmed cases. Regional distributions among 34 provinces/ regions in China were also analyzed. RESULTS: Daily growth of confirmed cases and Baidu index values for each COVID-19-related symptom presented robust positive correlations during the outbreak (fever: rs=0.705, p=9.623× 10- 6; cough: rs=0.592, p=4.485× 10- 4; fatigue: rs=0.629, p=1.494× 10- 4; sputum production: rs=0.648, p=8.206× 10- 5; shortness of breath: rs=0.656, p=6.182× 10-5). The average search-to-confirmed interval (STCI) was 19.8 days in China. The daily Baidu Index value's optimal time lags were the 4 days for cough, 2 days for fatigue, 3 days for sputum production, 1 day for shortness of breath, and 0 days for fever. CONCLUSION: The searches of COVID-19-related symptoms on the Baidu search engine were significantly correlated to the number of confirmed cases. Since the Baidu search engine could reflect the public's attention to the pandemic and the regional epidemics of viruses, relevant departments need to pay more attention to areas with high searches of COVID-19-related symptoms and take precautionary measures to prevent these potentially infected persons from further spreading.","Tu, Bizhi; Wei, Laifu; Jia, Yaya; Qian, Jun",BMC Infect Dis,381,16

While analysis of nasal and throat swabs from patients is the main way to detect COVID-19, analyzing chest images could offer an alternative method to hospitals, where health care personnel and testing kits are scarce. Deep learning (DL), in particular, has shown impressive levels of performance when analyzing medical images, including those related to COVID-19 pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to perform a systematic review with a meta-analysis of relevant studies to quantify the performance of DL algorithms in the automatic stratification of COVID-19 patients using chest images. METHODS: A search strategy for use in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science was developed, where we searched for articles published between January 1 and April 25, 2020. We used the key terms ""COVID-19,"" or ""coronavirus,"" or ""SARS-CoV-2,"" or ""novel corona,"" or ""2019-ncov,"" and ""deep learning,"" or ""artificial intelligence,"" or ""automatic detection."" Two authors independently extracted data on study characteristics, methods, risk of bias, and outcomes. Any disagreement between them was resolved by consensus. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies were included in the meta-analysis, which included 5896 chest images from COVID-19 patients. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the DL models in detecting COVID-19 were 0.95 (95% CI 0.94-0.95) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.96-0.97), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98. The positive likelihood, negative likelihood, and diagnostic odds ratio were 19.02 (95% CI 12.83-28.19), 0.06 (95% CI 0.04-0.10), and 368.07 (95% CI 162.30-834.75), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing other types of pneumonia from COVID-19 were 0.93 (95% CI 0.92-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.94-0.95), respectively. The performance of radiologists in detecting COVID-19 was lower than that of the DL models; however, the performance of junior radiologists was improved when they used DL-based prediction tools. CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings show that DL models have immense potential in accurately stratifying COVID-19 patients and in correctly differentiating them from patients with other types of pneumonia and normal patients. Implementation of DL-based tools can assist radiologists in correctly and quickly detecting COVID-19 and, consequently, in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.","Poly, Tahmina Nasrin; Islam, Md Mohaimenul; Li, Yu-Chuan Jack; Alsinglawi, Belal; Hsu, Min-Huei; Jian, Wen Shan; Yang, Hsuan-Chia",JMIR Med Inform,381,15

Similarities and dissimilarities between the cases regarding what counted as data, what data were taken to count, what data counted for, and how data were counted provide the basis for considering how the bounds of democratic accountability are constituted. Based on these two cases, the article sets out the metaphors of leaks and cascades as ways of characterising the data practices whereby counts, counting and accountability get configured.

However, the definition of well-being and the evidence base behind such guidelines remain unclear. AIMS: The aims of the study are to assess the applicability of well-being guidelines in practice, identify unaddressed healthcare workers' needs and provide recommendations for supporting front-line staff during the current and future pandemics. METHOD: This paper discusses the findings of a qualitative study based on interviews with front-line healthcare workers in the UK (n = 33), and examines them in relation to a rapid review of well-being guidelines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 14). RESULTS: The guidelines placed greater emphasis on individual mental health and psychological support, whereas healthcare workers placed greater emphasis on structural conditions at work, responsibilities outside the hospital and the invaluable support of the community. The well-being support interventions proposed in the guidelines did not always respond to the lived experiences of staff, as some reported not being able to participate in these interventions because of understaffing, exhaustion or clashing schedules. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers expressed well-being needs that aligned with socio-ecological conceptualisations of well-being related to quality of life. This approach to well-being has been highlighted in literature on support of healthcare workers in previous health emergencies, but it has not been monitored during this pandemic. Well-being guidelines should explore the needs of healthcare workers, and contextual characteristics affecting the implementation of recommendations.","Vera San Juan, Norha; Aceituno, David; Djellouli, Nehla; Sumray, Kirsi; Regenold, Nina; Syversen, Aron; Mulcahy Symmons, Sophie; Dowrick, Anna; Mitchinson, Lucy; Singleton, Georgina; Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia",BJPsych Open,381,16

Out of 842,197 tests, 11.7% were positive and 88.3% negative. The prevalence of HIV was 6.25 and 6.31% in the SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative cohort, respectively (p = 0.444). However, the prevalence of HIV-positive individuals in the critical cohort (9.15%) was higher than in the noncritical group (6.24%) (p = 0.011). Active tuberculosis infection was approximately 50% less in SARS-CoV-2-positive than in SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals. The prevalence of uncontrolled diabetes was 3.4 times higher in SARS-CoV-2-positive cases but was not higher in the critical vs. noncritical cases (p = 0.612). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, coagulation markers, urea, and cardiac- and liver-related analytes were significantly elevated in the critical compared to noncritical cases. Platelet count and creatinine concentration did not differ significantly between the two groups. These findings do not support increased prevalence of HIV or tuberculosis in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection but do suggest an association of increased disease severity with HIV-positive status.

Methods: We performed the experiment on only Twitter data (tweets) regarding vaccine. The duration of data collection was between 17 January 2017 and 14 March 2018. We formulated cluster based on the information on its contents and sources it resides (i.e., website domains). We only focused the topics which were related to vaccine. To detect the structure and network of community, we applied Louvain community algorithm along with Random walks called Info map method over vaccines related tweeter user. We defined the communities based on various measures derived from the information shared by Twitter users. Representations and visualizations of the communities based on these derived measures help the public health organization to make understand the possible cause of the rejecting the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Results: To analyse people perception over social media, we downloaded 6,591,566 tweets. We distinguished 1,860,662 users who were posting related to vaccine. We applied Louvain community detection algorithm along with DMM values and we found 192 communities. It also produced higher alignment values as long as the number of topics were low. With the increase of topics number, the alignment becomes lower. The total tweets were divided into two parts based on their characterizes. The first category contained 163,148 (57.16%) tweets which were based as evidence and advocacy and the second category contained 6244 (2.19%) tweets which were based on the experiences and opinion.

METHODS: Multicentre-combined (retrospective-prospective) cohort study with AC patients in the Community of Madrid between 1st March and 30th May 2020. 257 AC patients were involved in 16 public hospital. Multivariant binomial logistic regression (MBLR) was applied to mortality. RESULTS: Of COVID-19 patients, 30 were diagnosed at admission and 12 patients were diagnosed during de admission or 30 days after discharge. In non-COVID-19 patients, antibiotic therapy was received in 61.3% of grade I AC and 40.6% of grade II AC. 52.4% of grade III AC were treated with percutaneous drainage (PD). Median hospital stay was 5 [3-8] days, which was higher in the non-surgical treatment group with 7.51 days (p < 0.001) and a 3.25% of mortality rate (p < 0.21). 93.3% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission were treated with non-surgical treatment (p = 0.03), median hospital stay was 11.0 [7.5-27.5] days (p < 0.001) with a 7.5% of mortality rate (p > 0.05). In patients with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, 91.7% of grade I-II AC were treated with non-surgical treatment (p = 0.037), with a median hospital stay of 16 [4-21] days and a 18.2% mortality rate (p > 0.05). Hospital-acquired infection risk when hospital stay is > 7 days is OR 4.7, CI 95% (1.3-16.6), p = 0.009. COVID-19 mortality rate was 11.9%, AC severity adjusted OR 5.64 (CI 95% 1.417-22.64). In MBLR analysis, age (OR 1.15, CI 95% 1.02-1.31), SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 14.49, CI 95% 1.33-157.81), conservative treatment failure (OR 8.2, CI 95% 1.34-50.49) and AC severity were associated with an increased odd of mortality. CONCLUSION: In our population, during COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase of non-surgical treatment which was accompanied by an increase of conservative treatment failure, morbidity and hospital stay length which may have led to an increased risk hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the prospective attendees’ emotional responses to cancelled events. This study draws upon grief cycle theory to articulate different layers of the grief process in the event domain of inquiry. Design/methodology/approach: The National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament was selected as the research context. Taking user-generated messages from Twitter, this study first performed content analysis to organize lexical patterns into categories and higher-order themes based on the grief cycle. It also performed social network analyses using UCINET to illustrate how different grief phases are inter-related. Findings: Results not only point to attendees’ self-expression manifested through a continuum of denial, anger, bargaining and acceptance but they also reveal a three-layer hierarchy of grief, namely, event-related, socio-politics-related and crisis-related. The network analysis further illustrates how grief phases are tied into a complex network of grief messages. Originality/value: This study advances the event literature by improving knowledge about attendees’ emotional responses to cancelled events. It increases our understanding of the grieving process in the aftermath of COVID-19. The proposed triple grief cycle helps advance the literature by showcasing how voices from prospective attendees represent three pillars of grief hierarchy. The findings also underscore the emotional crisis of the COVID-19 aftermath. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Wong, I.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of COVID-19 measures on screen time and PA in Dutch children pre-, during- and post-school closures. METHODS: In cohort A (n = 102, 10.5 ± 3.6 years, 42.4% boys), data on PA and screen time during the lockdown were collected using a questionnaire. In cohort B (n = 131, 10.2 ± 0.9 years, 43.5% boys), data on PA and screen time were collected using a questionnaire and accelerometry 1 year before and after school closure. RESULTS: In cohort A, 62% reported less total PA. Self-reported screen time on week days increased 34 ± 105 min/d during the lockdown. In cohort B, sedentary time as measured by accelerometry, increased by 45 ± 67 min/d and only 20% reached PA levels of 60 min/d compared to 64% in May 2019. Self-reported screen time increased by 59 ± 112 min/d and 62 ± 130 min/d during week and weekend days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Children were less physically active, and screen time was higher during and after the school closures due to the COVID-19 lockdown.

For this one often considers the reproduction number which measures the amount of secondary cases produced by a single infectious individual. While estimates of this quantity are readily available on the national level, subnational estimates, e.g. on the county level, pose more difficulties since only few incidences occur there. However, as countermeasures to the pandemic are usually enforced on the subnational level, such estimates are of great interest to assess the efficacy of the measures taken, and to guide future policy. We present a novel extension of the well established estimator of the country level reproduction number to the county level by applying techniques from small-area estimation. This new estimator yields sensible estimates of reproduction numbers both on the country and county level. It can handle low and highly variable case counts on the county level, and may be used to distinguish local outbreaks from more widespread ones. We demonstrate the capabilities of our novel estimator by a simulation study and by applying the estimator to German case data.","Burgard, Jan Pablo; Heyder, Stefan; Hotz, Thomas; Krueger, Tyll",,381,10

In mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection, current recommendations suggest either to separate the dyad or encourage protected rooming-in under appropriate precautions. No data are available regarding the risk of mother-to-infant transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during rooming-in. Objective: To evaluate the risk of postnatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected mothers to their neonates following rooming-in and breastfeeding. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective, multicenter study enrolling mother-infant dyads from March 19 to May 2, 2020, followed up for 20 days of life (range, 18-22 days), was performed. The study was conducted at 6 coronavirus disease 2019 maternity centers in Lombardy, Northern Italy. Participants included 62 neonates born to 61 mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were eligible for rooming-in practice based on the clinical condition of the mother and infants whose results of nasopharyngeal swabs were negative at birth. Exposures: Mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection were encouraged to practice rooming-in and breastfeeding under a standardized protocol to minimize the risk of viral transmission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical characteristics and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 on neonatal nasopharyngeal swabs at 0, 7, and 20 days of life. Results: Of the 62 neonates enrolled (25 boys), born to 61 mothers (median age, 32 years; interquartile range, 28-36 years), only 1 infant (1.6%; 95% CI, 0%-8.7%) was diagnosed as having SARS-CoV-2 infection at postbirth checks. In that case, rooming-in was interrupted on day 5 of life because of severe worsening of the mother's clinical condition. The neonate became positive for the virus on day 7 of life and developed transient mild dyspnea. Ninety-five percent of the neonates enrolled were breastfed. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study provide evidence-based information on the management of mother-infant dyads in case of SARS-CoV-2 maternal infection suggesting that rooming-in and breastfeeding can be practiced in women who are able to care for their infants.","Ronchi, Andrea; Pietrasanta, Carlo; Zavattoni, Maurizio; Saruggia, Martina; Schena, Federico; Sinelli, Maria Teresa; Agosti, Massimo; Tzialla, Chryssoula; Varsalone, Felicia Filomena; Testa, Lea; Ballerini, Claudia; Ferrari, Stefania; Mangili, Giovanna; Ventura, Maria Luisa; Perniciaro, Simona; Spada, Elena; Lunghi, Giovanna; Piralla, Antonio; Baldanti, Fausto; Mosca, Fabio; Pugni, Lorenza",JAMA pediatr.

Adolescents and their families may be particularly affected by this enforced proximity, as adolescents strive to become more independent. Yet, whether these measures impact emotional well-being in families with adolescents has not been examined. In this ecological momentary assessment study, we investigated if the COVID-19 pandemic affected positive and negative affect of parents and adolescents and parenting behaviors (warmth and criticism). Additionally, we examined possible explanations for the hypothesized changes in affect and parenting. To do so, we compared daily reports on affect and parenting that were gathered during two periods of 14 consecutive days, once before the COVID-19 pandemic (2018-2019) and once during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multilevel analyses showed that only parents' negative affect increased as compared to the period before the pandemic, whereas this was not the case for adolescents' negative affect, positive affect and parenting behaviors (from both the adolescent and parent perspective). In general, intolerance of uncertainty was linked to adolescents' and parents' negative affect and adolescents' positive affect. However, Intolerance of uncertainty, nor any pandemic related characteristics (i.e. living surface, income, relatives with COVID-19, hours of working at home, helping children with school and contact with COVID-19 patients at work) were linked to the increase of parents' negative affect during COVID-19. It can be concluded that on average, our sample (consisting of relatively healthy parents and adolescents) seems to deal fairly well with the circumstances. The substantial heterogeneity in the data however, also suggest that whether or not parents and adolescents experience (emotional) problems can vary from household to household. Implications for researchers, mental health care professionals and policy makers are discussed.","Janssen, Loes H C; Kullberg, Marie-Louise J; Verkuil, Bart; van Zwieten, Noa; Wever, Mirjam C M; van Houtum, Lisanne A E M; Wentholt, Wilma G M; Elzinga, Bernet M",PLoS One,381,23

While neonates are a special population, little is known about the neonatal outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the outcomes in COVID-19 positive neonates and incidence of vertical transmission of the virus by reviewing available literature. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a narrative review of available literature on ""COVID-19 in neonates,"" for which PubMed and Google Scholar were used to search the published articles. RESULTS: We summarized the data from 39 published studies that are comprised of 326 COVID-19 positive peripartum mothers with respective neonatal outcomes. Twenty-three neonates have been reported to be COVID-19 positive. Male neonates were affected significantly more (79%) than female neonates. Approximately 3% neonates acquired infection through suspected vertical transmission. Strict infection prevention measures during the perinatal time can significantly reduce the chance of horizontal transmission of the virus. Overall, neonates were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic regardless of gestational age at birth and required only supportive measures. There was 0% mortality in COVID-19 positive neonates.

Acute Kidney Injury was reported in a considerable amount of patients suffering from COVID-19, especially in those admitted in the ICU setting. This study was undertaken to study the clinical profile, incidence, severity, requirement of renal replacement therapy, and the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with Acute Kidney Injury admitted in the Intensive Care Unit. Materials and Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary hospital recognized as Dedicated COVID Hospital during the period of May 2020 to September 2020. 218 patients hospitalised in the Intensive Care Unit during this period were monitored for the development of Acute Kidney Injury. The clinical profile, laboratory findings, requirement of invasive ventilation and renal replacement therapy, and outcomes of such patients were recorded. Data was analysed using the SPSS software. Results: Among all the patients enrolled in the Intensive Care Unit during the study period, 27.06% developed Acute Kidney Injury. 67.79% of these patients developed AKI during the first five days of hospitalisation. 76.27% of the patients with AKI required invasive mechanical ventilation, while 28.81% required renal replacement therapy. There was a significant association between the development of Acute Kidney Injury and the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0000015). 44.68% of the deaths among the 218 patients were associated with COVID-19 related AKI (p = 0.0000003). Conclusion: Acute Kidney Injury was found to be common among the hospitalised COVID-19 patients in our Intensive Care Unit.

Only hysterectomies performed under general anesthesia from 2012 to 2017 were included to minimize interprocedural variability. Respiratory depression was defined as episodes of apnea, hypopnea, hypoxemia, pain-sedation mismatch, unplanned positive airway pressure device application, or naloxone administration in the post-anesthesia care unit. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association with clinical characteristics. From 1,974 hysterectomies, 253 had postoperative respiratory depression, yielding an incidence of 128 (95% confidence interval, 114-144) per 1,000 surgeries. Risk factors associated with respiratory depression were older age (odds ratio 1.22 [95% confidence interval 1.02-1.46] per decade increase, p = 0.03), lower body weight (0.77 [0.62-0.94] per 10 kg/m2, p = 0.01), and higher intraoperative opioid dose (1.05 [1.01-1.09] per 10 mg oral morphine equivalents, p = 0.01); while sugammadex use was associated with a reduced risk (0.48 [0.30-0.75], p = 0.002).

The majority of epidemic prevention and control policies implemented focused on travel restrictions, which severely affected urban mobility during the epidemic. Considering the impacts of epidemic and associated control policies, this study analyzes the relationship between COVID-19, travel of residents, Point of Interest (POI), and social activities from the perspective of taxi travel. First, changes in the characteristics of taxi trips at different periods were analyzed. Next, the relationship between POIs and taxi travels was established by the Geographic Information System (GIS) method, and the spatial lag model (SLM) was introduced to explore the changes in taxi travel driving force. Then, a social activities recovery level evaluation model was proposed based on the taxi travel datasets to evaluate the recovery of social activities. The results demonstrated that the number of taxi trips dropped sharply, and the travel speed, travel time, and spatial distribution of taxi trips had been significantly influenced during the epidemic period. The spatial correlation between taxi trips was gradually weakened after the outbreak of the epidemic, and the consumption travel demand of people significantly decreased while the travel demand for community life increased dramatically. The evaluation score of social activity is increased from 8.12 to 74.43 during the post-epidemic period, which may take 3-6 months to be fully recovered as a normal period.

Since filtration efficiency depends on particle diameter and air face velocity, the relevance of material filtration or prototype fit data depends on test conditions. We investigate whether characterizing a material in a filter holder at a range of face velocities enabled precise prediction of the filtration performance of a novel sewn mask design. While larger particles (&gt;500 nm) are more relevant for inhalation exposure to respiratory emissions, we compare this mask and a N95 FFR (as a control) with smaller particles more similar to those in the N95 test method. Sewn from sterilization wrap, our mask (sealed to a mannequin head with silicone) filters 85 ± 1% of 136 nm particles (NaCl, 85 L min–1) and passes quantitative fit tests for 4 of 6 volunteers, representing intermediate protection between a surgical mask and N95 FFR. Filter holder material measurements overpredict the sewn mask’s filtration efficiency by 8.2% (95% CI 7.4–9.1%) (136 or 200 nm). While testing flat material in a filter holder enables comparison between materials, filtration performance does not precisely scale-up from filter holder to mannequin tests.

This has led to widespread research for the identification of molecular-based biomarkers. Among them, survivin is a recently characterized protein which is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family. The aim of this study is evaluating the expression of survivin in oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and OSCC compared with normal mucosa. Materials and Methods: The retrospective study consisted of twenty cases of oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and OSCC in the age group of 20-70 years. Twenty cases of normal mucosa made up the control group. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with the use of survivin polyclonal antibody. Grades of expression of survivin were evaluated. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for statistical analysis. Results: The expression of survivin was higher in OSCC (80%) when compared to oral leukoplakia (70%), oral lichen planus (45%), and normal mucosa (35%). The variation in the expression of survivin between the samples was statistically significant with P = 0.015 (Kruskal-Wallis test significant at 0.01 level).

We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of conditions placing individuals in these risk categories to the extent possible. We also examined the sociodemographic characteristics of LTC workers by occupation and COVID-19 illness severity risk status. One percent (552 out of 52,159) of the weighted NHIS sample worked in LTC facilities. Workers in LTC facilities were disproportionately Black, female, and low income. Half of LTC workers (50%) were at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and another 19.6% were potentially at increased risk. There were few significant differences in demographic characteristics between risk groups, though those at increased risk had lower educational attainment and recent trouble affording prescription medications. Despite the high degree of vulnerability of both LTC residents and workers to severe illness from COVID-19, many LTC facilities still have inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment and COVID-19 tests. Given that state budget deficits due to the COVID-19 pandemic limit the potential for state actions, enhanced federal efforts are needed to protect LTC residents and staff from COVID-19.","Greene, Jessica; Gibson, Diane M",Prev Med,381,18

Compared with untreated subjects, those using either ACE inhibitors or ARBs showed a similar risk of severe or lethal COVID-19 (summary OR: 0.90; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.26 for ACE inhibitors; 0.92; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12 for ARBs). The results did not change when both drugs were considered together, when death was the outcome and excluding the studies with significant, divergent results. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis strongly supports the recommendation of several scientific societies to continue ARBs or ACE inhibitors for all patients, unless otherwise advised by their physicians who should thus be reassured.","Flacco, Maria Elena; Acuti Martellucci, Cecilia; Bravi, Francesca; Parruti, Giustino; Cappadona, Rosaria; Mascitelli, Alfonso; Manfredini, Roberto; Mantovani, Lorenzo G; Manzoli, Lamberto",Heart,381,13

Randomized controlled trial, cross-sectional, case-control, and case reports, case reports examining neonatal outcomes in newborns who have SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Studies were selected according to criteria around the population, intervention, comparator, outcome(s) of interest, and study design (PICOS framework). All citations and full-text articles were searched by independent five authors. The population that newborns with COVID-19 that confirmed within 28 d of birth are included. The interventions included in COVID-19 infection diagnosed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or serological. The primary outcomes were Neonatal clinical outcomes. The methodological quality of the studies was appraised using appropriate tools. Strength of the body of evidence was assessed according to the quality assessment tool for quantitative studies (QATQS). RESULTS: The electronic search identified 1051 records that were examined, after evaluating 35 of them were included in the study. Seven studies were research articles and twenty-eight were case reports. Methodological quality was medium. Most of the clinical characteristics of newborns were respiratory difficulty and secondly fever. Some newborns gastrointestinal (GIS) symptoms in the form of diarrhea and feeding intolerance and abdominal distension were present in 50%. The fatality case did not exist in any newborn due to COVID-19. Death occurred in one case due to prematurity. CONCLUSIONS: The most common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 infection in the neonatal period are respiratory tract symptoms and fever. It has been observed that the COVID-19 infection detected in the neonatal period is not fatal. However, data including more cases are needed.","Karabay, Meltem; Çinar, Nursan; Karakaya Suzan, Özge; Yalnizoglu Çaka, Sinem; Karabay, Oguz",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,381,21

METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey from 8 August to 12 September 2020 among adults (&#8805;18 years) residing in Panama. Participants were recruited through social media. Questions included demographics, access to HIV/STI testing and HIV care, and sexual behaviours 3 months before COVID-19 social distancing measures and during social distancing measures (COVID-19 measures). Logistic regression was used to identify associations between variables and behavioural changes. RESULTS: We recruited 960 participants; 526 (54.8%) identified as cis-women, 366 (38.1%) cis-men and 68 (7.1%) non-binary or another gender. The median age was 28 years (IQR: 23-37 years), and 531 of 957 (55.5%) were of mixed ethnicity (mixed Indigenous/European/Afro-descendant ancestry). Before COVID-19 measures, virtual sex was reported by 38.5% (181 of 470) of cis-women, 58.4% (184 of 315) cis-men and 45.0% (27 of 60) non-binary participants. During COVID-19 measures, virtual sex increased among 17.2% of cis-women, 24.7% cis-men and 8.9% non-binary participants. During COVID-19 measures, 230 of 800 (28.8%) participants reported decreased casual sex compared with pre-COVID-19 measures. Compared with pre-COVID-19 measures, decreased casual sex was reported more frequently during COVID-19 measures by cis-men compared with cis-women (39.2% vs 22.9%, urban/rural adjusted OR (AOR)=2.17, 95% CI 1.57 to 3.01), and by Afro-descendant compared with participants of mixed ethnicity (40.0% vs 29.8%, AOR=1.78, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.94). Compared with no change in virtual sex (16.8%), increased virtual sex (38.5%, AOR=1.78, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.88) and decreased virtual sex (86.7%, AOR=16.53, 95% CI 7.74 to 35.27) were associated with decreased casual sex encounters. During COVID-19 measures, HIV/STI testing could not be obtained by 58.0% (58 of 100) of the participants who needed a test, and interrupted HIV care was reported by 53.3% (8 of 15) of participants living with HIV. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 measures in Panama were associated with a decrease in casual sex among cis-men and Afro-descendant people, while access to HIV/STI testing and care was seriously disrupted.","Gabster, Amanda; Erausquin, Jennifer Toller; Michielsen, Kristien; Mayaud, Philippe; Pascale, Juan Miguel; Pericas, Carles; Marks, Michael; Katz, Jennifer; Talavero, Gonzalo Cabezas; de Argote, Marilu; Murillo, Anet; Tucker, Joseph D",Sex. transm. infect,381,23

The basis of suspicion was clinico-eco-epidemiologic-radiological findings as, by that time, about 20 COVID19 cases were reported from the state of Rajasthan including a big Italian group of tourists who travelled extensively in Rajasthan, including Udaipur city. Objectives: The current study presents the field experience of the Central and the State Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) in the cluster containment at Bhilwara. Methods: The information regarding the sociodemographic profile of the cases was provided by the Senior Medical Officer In-charge. The containment strategy was modeled under 6 pillars. Google Maps was used for preparing spot map. Results: Immediate public health actions of cluster containment including contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation were initiated using epidemiological approach of mapping the cluster and taking care of reservoir of infection by the District Public Health Team supported by Multidisciplinary Rapid Response Team. This was supplemented by strict enforcement of lock down in the District taking care of daily need of the community by the leadership of administration with very strong intersectoral co-ordination (locally called ""ruthless containment""). Conclusion: The forthcoming challenge resides in re-establishment of inter-district and inter-state travel, which can become a risk of re-entry of the new cases, which needs to be taken care of, with the help of stringent administrative measures and screening at all points of entry. The team in Bhilwara needs to remain vigilant to pick up any imported cases early before local transmission establishes.","Meghwal, Badrilal; Behera, Shyambhavee; Dhariwal, Akshay C; Saxena, Deepak; Singh, Rommel; Kumar, Sanjiv",Indian J Public Health,381,32

We estimate the temporal and diurnal changes of the six criteria air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and gaseous pollutants (NO2, O3, CO, and SO2) during lockdown (25th March - 3rd May 2020) across regions of India using the observations from 134 real-time monitoring sites of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Significant reduction in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO has been found in all the regions during the lockdown. SO2 showed mixed behavior, with a slight increase at some sites but a comparatively significant decrease at other locations. O3 also showed a mixed variation with a mild increase in IGP and a decrease in the South. The absolute decrease in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 was observed during peak morning traffic hours (08-10 Hrs) and late evening (20-24 Hrs), but the percentage reduction is almost constant throughout the day. A significant decrease in day-time O3 has been found over Indo Gangetic plain (IGP) and central India, whereas night-time O3 has increased over IGP due to less O3 loss. The most significant reduction (â¼40-60%) was found in PM2.5 and PM10. The highest decrease in PM was found for the north-west and IGP followed by South and central regions. A considerable reduction (â¼30-70%) in NO2 was found except for a few sites in the central region. A similar pattern was observed for CO having a â¼20-40% reduction. The reduction observed for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and enhancement in O3 was proportional to the population density. Delhi's air quality has improved with a significant reduction in primary pollutants, however, an increase in O3 was observed. The changes reported during the lockdown are combined effect of changes in the emissions, meteorology, and atmospheric chemistry that requires detailed investigations.","Singh, Vikas; Singh, Shweta; Biswal, Akash; Kesarkar, Amit P; Mor, Suman; Ravindra, Khaiwal",Environ Pollut,381,31

MethodsWe conducted a systematic review. Databases including PubMed, Web of Science, WHO COVID-19 database, and CNKI were searched on 23 July 2021. International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) was also searched to collect ongoing trials. We included published researches or ongoing clinical trials related to the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in children or adolescents (aged [≤]18 years). Meta-analysis was performed if the consistency of the included studies was high. If not, descriptive analyses were performed. ResultsEight published studies with 2851 children or adolescents and 28 ongoing clinical trials were included. Among eight published studies, two (25.0%) were RCTs, two (25.0%) case series, and four (50.0%) case reports. The results showed selected COVID-19 vaccines had a good safety profile in children and adolescents. Injection site pain, fatigue, headache, and chest pain were the most common adverse events. Some studies reported a few cases of myocarditis and pericarditis. Two RCTs showed that the immune response to BNT162b2 in adolescents aged 12-15 years was non-inferior to that in young people aged 16-25 years, while a stronger immune response was detected with 3g CoronaVac injection. Only one single RCT showed the efficacy of BNT162b2 was 100% (95% CI: 75.3 to 100). Of the 28 ongoing clinical trials, twenty-three are interventional studies. Fifteen countries are conducting interventional clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents. Among them, China (10, 43.5%) and United Stated (9, 39.1%) were the top two countries with the most trials. BNT162b2 was the most common vaccine, which is under testing. ConclusionSome of the COVID-19 vaccines have potential protective effects in children and adolescents, but awareness is needed to monitor possible adverse effects after injection. Clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine in children and adolescents with long follow-up, large sample size, and different vaccines are still urgently needed.","Lv, Meng; Luo, Xufei; Shen, Quan; Lei, Ruobing; Liu, Xiao; Liu, Enmei; Li, Qiu; Chen, Yaolong",,381,16

In these situations, classical reconstruction algorithms, like simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), cannot reconstruct high-quality CT images. Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D)-based iterative reconstruction algorithm (POCS-BM3D) has remarkable effect in dealing with CT reconstruction from noisy projections. However, BM3D may restrain noise with excessive loss of details in the case of low-SNR CT reconstruction. In order to achieve a preferable trade-off between noise suppression and edge preservation, we introduce guided image filtering (GIF) into low-SNR CT reconstruction, and propose noise suppression-guided image filtering reconstruction (NSGIFR) algorithm. In each iteration of NSGIFR, the output image of SART reserves more details and is used as input image of GIF, while the image denoised by BM3D serves as guidance image of GIF. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm displays outstanding performance on preserving structures and suppressing noise for low-SNR CT reconstruction. NSGIFR can achieve more superior image quality than SART, POCS-TV and POCS-BM3D in terms of visual effect and quantitative analysis.

The pathophysiological changes that result from elevated body weight lead to metabolic dysfunction, chronic inflammation, impaired immunological responses, and multisystem disorders, which increase vulnerability to severe illness from COVID-19. While vaccination strategies are under way across the world, the second and third waves of the pandemic, along with the emergence of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains, continue to threaten the stability of medical systems worldwide. Furthermore, evidence from previous pandemics suggests that vaccines are less effective in obese individuals than in their healthy-weight counterparts over the long term. Therefore, a consideration of lifestyle changes that can boost metabolic health and immunity is critical to reduce the risk of complications and severe illness from viral infection. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms linking excess body weight with COVID-19 morbidity. We also present evidence that intermittent fasting (IF), a dietary program that has gained popularity in recent years, may be an effective strategy to improve metabolic health and immunity and thus reduce the impact of obesity on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.","Ealey, Kafi N; Phillips, Joy; Sung, Hoon-Ki",Trends Endocrinol Metab,381,14

Albert Camus addresses this traumatic dimension in his 1947 novel The Plague, in which he reserves a rather puzzling statement for the closing paragraph: A plague never disappears, he wrote, but can lie dormant only to reappear once again ""for the education of men"". What lessons can be learned from the pandemic we are experiencing right now? While Covid-19 is often discussed from a biological perspective, the magnitude of the tragedy raises questions far beyond the confines of the natural/medical sciences, questions about humanity, our limits and possibilities, and the transcendent. This article explores the potential educational aspect of the pandemic by framing the discussion in an exegetical reading of Camus' novel. Through this reading, it claims that even within the tragic reality of its effects, the present pandemic might bring to the fore the notion of an existential kind of learning-one that is deeply personal, that cannot be programmed or learned from direct teaching, and that connects us in relevant ways to the lives of others. At the same time, this reading is not oblivious to the practical needs around decision-making on the part of educational policymakers, administrators, and teachers. As the novel shows, tragic events create a demand for quick action, so a few practical principles for curriculum decision-making are also offered.","Murillo, Fernando",Prospects (Paris),381,16

Our study highlights the role of interventional radiology (IR) during the initial phases of COVID-19 in a large health care system based in the Midwest. Materials and Methods: IR procedural volumes were compiled and stratified by service location from January 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020 for a large health care system in the Midwest. Seven-day rolling aggregate values were calculated and comparisons were made to diagnostic radiology (DR) imaging volumes during the same time frame. Percentage change in volume was calculated in relation to a state-mandated order to halt all nonessential medical care on March 17, 2020. IR procedures were stratified by category with interventional oncology (IO), dialysis interventions, and aspiration/drainage interventions comprising a majority of procedures. A Z-test for proportions was performed to assess for change in each following the state-mandated shutdown. Results: IR demonstrated a 34.9% decrease in total procedural volume following the shutdown of nonessential medical care, compared to a 45.4% decrease in DR volume. There was a 25.4% decrease in inpatient IR volume and a 41.0% decrease in outpatient volume, DR volume showed 22.2% and 57.3% decrease, respectively. Weekly outpatient volume analysis revealed the largest decrease in week 2 for IR at 49.3% and week 4 for DR at 67.0%. IO, dialysis and aspiration/drainage procedures comprised 29.1%, 13.8% and 20.4% of procedures prior to the state mandated shutdown and 31.7%, 16.2% and 26.3% afterwards. The proportion of IO and dialysis procedures were not statistically significant (P = 0.16 and 0.08 respectively) while aspiration/drainage procedures comprised a significantly higher proportion (P &lt; 0.05) after the shutdown. Conclusions: IR volumes during the initial phase of COVID-19 were relatively less affected than total DR volumes. Specific attention to outpatient IR volumes demonstrates the valuable care provided following the state-mandated shutdown of nonessential procedures. There was no significant change in oncology or dialysis interventions provided with a significant increase aspiration/drainage procedures.","Hashmi, A.; Al-Natour, M.; Azar, N.; Sutter, C.; Davidson, J.; Tavri, S.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,381,16

The purpose of this study is to compare sulodexide and its components with unfractionated heparin (UFH) to determine its suitability for the indications in which UFH is used. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) versions of sulodexide, FMH and DS were obtained from Alfasigma. API versions of UFH were obtained from Medefil Inc. Normal human citrated plasma was obtained from blood bank of the Loyola University Medical Center. Each of the individual agents were supplemented in plasma at a graded concentration of 0.0-10 µg/mL. Clotting assays (PiCT, aPTT, PT and TT), anti-Xa and anti-IIa and thrombin generation studies were carried out. Results were compiled as mean ± SD of 3 individual determination. RESULT: In the clot based (PiCT, aPTT and TT), anti-Xa and IIa assays, both the UFH and FMH produced stronger activities in these assays followed by sulodexide. DS did not show any anticoagulant activity. In the thrombin generation assay, FMH and UFH produced comparable inhibition of thrombin generation as measured by various parameters. Sulodexide was slightly weaker in this assay, whereas DS produced relatively weaker effects. CONCLUSION: In comparison to sulodexide, both UFH and FMH exhibit comparable anticoagulant activity despite differences in their molecular weight. These results suggest that sulodexide can be developed as a parenteral anticoagulant for indications in which UFH is used.","Siddiqui, Fakiha; Hoppensteadt, Debra; Bontekoe, Emily; Farooqui, Ambar; Jeske, Walter; Fareed, Jawed",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,381,3

Objective: To identify, appraise, and synthesize the scientific literature on the efficacy and effectiveness of SMT in preventing the development of infectious disease or improving disease-specific outcomes in patients with infectious disease and to examine the association between SMT and selected immunological, endocrine, and other physiological biomarkers. Evidence Review: A literature search of MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Index to Chiropractic Literature, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase was conducted from inception to April 15, 2020. Randomized clinical trials and cohort studies were included. Eligible studies were critically appraised, and evidence with high and acceptable quality was synthesized using the Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis guideline. Findings: A total of 2593 records were retrieved; after exclusions, 50 full-text articles were screened, and 16 articles reporting the findings of 13 studies comprising 795 participants were critically appraised. The literature search found no clinical studies that investigated the efficacy or effectiveness of SMT in preventing the development of infectious disease or improving disease-specific outcomes among patients with infectious disease. Eight articles reporting the results of 6 high- and acceptable-quality RCTs comprising 529 participants investigated the effect of SMT on biomarkers. Spinal manipulative therapy was not associated with changes in lymphocyte levels or physiological markers among patients with low back pain or participants who were asymptomatic compared with sham manipulation, a lecture series, and venipuncture control groups. Spinal manipulative therapy was associated with short-term changes in selected immunological biomarkers among asymptomatic participants compared with sham manipulation, a lecture series, and venipuncture control groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review of 13 studies, no clinical evidence was found to support or refute claims that SMT was efficacious or effective in changing immune system outcomes. Although there were limited preliminary data from basic scientific studies suggesting that SMT may be associated with short-term changes in immunological and endocrine biomarkers, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Given the lack of evidence that SMT is associated with the prevention of infectious diseases or improvements in immune function, further studies should be completed before claims of efficacy or effectiveness are made.","Chow, Ngai; Hogg-Johnson, Sheilah; Mior, Silvano; Cancelliere, Carol; Injeyan, Stephen; Teodorczyk-Injeyan, Julita; Cassidy, J David; Taylor-Vaisey, Anne; Côté, Pierre",JAMA Netw Open,381,26

The tournaments included 10 participating high schools from three counties. The host school (school A in county A) participated in the tournaments on both days; five high school teams from two counties participated the first day only; four additional high school teams from the three counties participated the second day. A total of 130 wrestlers, coaches, and referees attended the tournaments (Table). During December 8-9, 13 wrestlers from school A received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (Figure), including nine who were symptomatic, two who were asymptomatic, and two for whom symptom status at time of specimen collection was unknown. Local public health officials in the three counties initiated an investigation and tested specimens from an additional 40 attendees from nine of the 10 participating schools. A total of 54 (41.5%) of the 130 tournament attendees received testing, and 38 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified; the minimum attack rate was 30.2% (38 of 126§), and 70.4% (38 of 54) of tests had a positive result. Among contacts of the 38 COVID-19 patients, 446 were determined by investigators to meet the CDC definition of a close contact,¶ including 62 who were household contacts and 384 who were in-school contacts (classmates, teachers, noncompeting wrestling team members, and other school athletic team members). Among these 446 contacts, five had received a diagnosis of COVID-19 during June-November and were excluded from attack rate calculations. Among 95 (21.3%) contacts who received SARS-CoV-2 testing, 41 (43.2%) received a positive test result (minimum attack rate = 9.3% [41 of 441]); 21 (51.2%) persons with positive test results were symptomatic, eight (19.5%) were asymptomatic, and symptom status for 12 (29.3%) was unknown at the time of specimen collection. Among contacts, attack rates were highest among household members (30.0%) and wrestling team members who did not attend the tournament (20.3%), as were the percentages of positive test results (60.0% among household members and 54.2% among team members).

In this study, we evaluated changes in endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in a cohort of convalescent COVID-19 patients undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). METHODS: After swab test negativization, convalescent COVID-19 patients referring to a post-acute care facility for PR were consecutively screened for inclusion. Study procedures were performed at the time of hospitalization and discharge. RESULTS: We enrolled 82 convalescent COVID-19 patients (85.4% males, mean age 60.4 years). After PR, a significant improvement in most pulmonary function tests and exercise capacity was documented. FMD changed from 2.48% +/- 2.01 to 4.24% +/- 2.81 (p &lt; 0.001), corresponding to a 70.9% increase. Significantly higher changes in FMD were found in patients without a history of vascular events as compared to those with (+2.04% +/- 2.30 vs. +0.61% +/- 1.83, p = 0.013). Values of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%), forced vital capacity (FVC%) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO%) significantly and directly correlated with FMD both at baseline and after PR. Patients with normal FEV1% (&gt;=80% predicted) during the overall study period or those normalizing FEV1% after PR showed a more significant FMD change as compared to patients with persistently impaired FEV1% (&lt;80% predicted) (p for trend = 0.029). This finding was confirmed in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically evaluated endothelial function improves after PR in convalescent COVID-19 patients. A direct and persistent association between the severity of pulmonary and vascular disease can be hypothesized. Endothelial function testing may be useful in the follow-up of convalescent COVID-19 patients.","Ambrosino, P.; Molino, A.; Calcaterra, I.; Formisano, R.; Stufano, S.; Spedicato, G.

Fermented foods containing high loads of viable fungi and bacteria are potential sources for virus contamination. The most common include viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophage) and yeasts reported in fermented milks, sausages, vegetables, wine, sourdough, and cocoa beans. Recent molecular studies have also associated fermented foods as vehicles for pathogenic human viruses. Human noroviruses, rotavirus, and hepatitis virus have been identified in different fermented foods through multiple routes. No severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus or close members were found in fermented foods to date. However, the occurrence/persistence of other pathogenic viruses reveals a potential vulnerability of fermented foods to SARS-CoV-2 contamination. On the other side of the coin, some bacteriophages are being suggested for improving the fermentation process and food safety, as well as owing potential probiotic properties in modern fermented foods. This review will address the diversity and characteristics of viruses associated with fermented foods and what has been changed after a short introduction to the most common next-generation sequencing platforms. Also, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via fermented foods and preventive measures will be discussed.","Maske, Bruna Leal; de Melo Pereira, Gilberto Vinícius; da Silva Vale, Alexander; Marques Souza, Doris Sobral; De Dea Lindner, Juliano; Soccol, Carlos Ricardo",Food Microbiol,381,24

Here, we analyze the relationships between viral genetic variants and clinical characteristics in children. Methods: Whole-genome sequencing was performed on respiratory specimens collected for all SARS-CoV-2-positive children (n = 141) between March 13 and June 16, 2020. Viral genetic variations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome were identified and investigated to evaluate genomic correlates of disease severity. Results: Higher viral load was detected in symptomatic patients (P = .0007) and in children &lt;5 years old (P = .0004). Genomic analysis revealed a mean pairwise difference of 10.8 single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and the majority (55.4%) of SNVs led to an amino acid change in the viral proteins. The D614G mutation in the spike protein was present in 99.3% of the isolates. The calculated viral mutational rate of 22.2 substitutions/year contrasts the 13.5 substitutions/year observed in California isolates without the D614G mutation. Phylogenetic clade 20C was associated with severe cases of COVID-19 (odds ratio, 6.95;P = .0467). Epidemiological investigation revealed major representation of 3 of 5 major Nextstrain clades (20A, 20B, and 20C) consistent with multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Southern California. Conclusions: Genomic evaluation demonstrated greater than expected genetic diversity, presence of the D614G mutation, increased mutation rate, and evidence of multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Southern California. Our findings suggest a possible association of phylogenetic clade 20C with severe disease, but small sample size precludes a definitive conclusion.

The regulatory mechanisms governing the development of dendrites, however, are insufficiently understood. The evolutionary conserved Ste20/Hippo kinase pathway has been proposed to play an important role in regulating the formation and maintenance of dendritic architecture. A key element of this pathway, Ste20-like kinase (SLK), regulates cytoskeletal dynamics in non-neuronal cells and is strongly expressed throughout neuronal development. However, its function in neurons is unknown. We show that during development of mouse cortical neurons, SLK has a surprisingly specific role for proper elaboration of higher, &#8805; 3rd, order dendrites both in male and in female mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that SLK is required to maintain excitation-inhibition balance. Specifically, SLK knockdown caused a selective loss of inhibitory synapses and functional inhibition after postnatal day 15, while excitatory neurotransmission was unaffected. Finally, we show that this mechanism may be relevant for human disease, as dysmorphic neurons within human cortical malformations revealed significant loss of SLK expression. Overall, the present data identify SLK as a key regulator of both dendritic complexity during development and of inhibitory synapse maintenance.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe show that dysmorphic neurons of human epileptogenic brain lesions have decreased levels of the Ste20-like kinase (SLK). Decreasing SLK expression in mouse neurons revealed that SLK has essential functions in forming the neuronal dendritic tree and in maintaining inhibitory connections with neighboring neurons.","Schoch, Susanne; Quatraccioni, Anne; Robens, Barbara K; Maresch, Robert; van Loo, Karen M J; Cases-Cunillera, Silvia; Kelly, Tony; Opitz, Thoralf; Borger, Valeri; Dietrich, Dirk; Pitsch, Julika; Beck, Heinz; Becker, Albert J",J. neurosci,381,21

Herein, we report a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) platform that can achieve this sensitivity and rapidity without bulky lab-bound equipment. The key technology is a flattened pipette tip with an elliptical cross-section, which extends a high aspect-ratio microfluidic chip design to pipette scale, for rapid (<5 min) generation of several thousand monodispersed droplets â¼150 to 350 µm in size with a CV of â¼2.3%. A block copolymer surfactant (polyoxyalkylene F127) is used to stabilize these large droplets in oil during thermal cycling. At this droplet size and number, positive droplets can be counted by eye or imaged by a smartphone with appropriate illumination/filtering to accurately quantify up to 100 target copies. We demonstrate with 2019 nCoV-PCR assay LODs of 3.8 copies per 20 µL of sample and a dynamic range of 4-100 copies. The ddPCR platform is shown to be inhibitor resistant with spiked saliva samples, suggesting RNA extraction may not be necessary. It represents a rapid 1.5-h POC quantitative PCR test that requires just a pipette equipped with elliptical pipette tip, a commercial portable thermal cycler, a smartphone, and a portable trans-illuminator, without bulky and expensive micropumps and optical detectors that prevent POC application.","Chen, Liao; Yadav, Vivek; Zhang, Chenguang; Huo, Xiaoye; Wang, Ceming; Senapati, Satyajyoti; Chang, Hsueh-Chia",Anal Chem,381,24

One of the reasons is linked to the cases of elder abuse, not only shown by academic and scientific sources, but also by social and mass media and their impact on public perception of the institutional setting. What is more, current COVID-19 pandemic consequences on older people have provoked alarm and worry especially about what is happening in institutions. METHODS: The sample for this study consists of 286 staff working in nursing homes in Spain. This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Professional Good Care Scale in Nursing Homes (GCS-NH). RESULTS: Results of parallel analyses and exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) showed a four-factor model for the 32-item scale: humanization (9 items), non-infantilization (10 items), respect (7 items) and empowerment (6 items). Then, psychometric properties were tested analysing internal consistency (reliability) and convergent, divergent and criterion validity. High internal consistency (reliability) and different validity evidence were obtained for the total scores of the GCS-NH and its subscales. GCS-NH scores were also capable of detecting risk of probable institutional elder abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that this scale is an appropriate, valid, and reliable multidimensional instrument to evaluate good care in older institutionalized people by staff. Good care is an outcome of a complex construct in which a wide range of factors converge (staff, older people, and environmental characteristics). The GCS-NH has potential to be used as a multidimensional tool to assess good care.","Pérez-Rojo, Gema; López, Javier; Noriega, Cristina; Martínez-Huertas, José Angel; Velasco, Cristina",BMC Geriatr,381,22

Disease outcomes range from asymptomatic to severe with, so far, minimal genotypic change to the virus so understanding the host response is paramount. Transcriptomics has become incredibly important in understanding host-pathogen interactions; however, post-transcriptional regulation plays an important role in infection and immunity through translation and mRNA stability, allowing tight control over potent host responses by both the host and the invading virus. Here, we apply ribosome profiling to assess post-transcriptional regulation of host genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3). We have identified numerous transcription factors (JUN, ZBTB20, ATF3, HIVEP2 and EGR1) as well as select antiviral cytokine genes, namely IFNB1, IFNL1,2 and 3, IL-6 and CCL5, that are restricted at the post-transcriptional level by SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss the impact this would have on the host response to infection.

METHODS: We quantified the transmission risk of COVID-19 on high-speed train passengers using data from 2,334 index patients and 72,093 close contacts who had co-travel times of 0-8 hours from 19 December 2019 through 6 March 2020 in China. We analysed the spatial and temporal distribution of COVID-19 transmission among train passengers to elucidate the associations between infection, spatial distance, and co-travel time. RESULTS: The attack rate in train passengers on seats within a distance of 3 rows and 5 columns of the index patient varied from 0 to 10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3% - 19.0%), with a mean of 0.32% (95%CI 0.29% - 0.37%). Passengers in seats on the same row as the index patient had an average attack rate of 1.5% (95%CI 1.3% - 1.8%), higher than that in other rows (0.14%, 95%CI 0.11% - 0.17%), with a relative risk (RR) of 11.2 (95%CI 8.6 -14.6). Travellers adjacent to the index patient had the highest attack rate (3.5%, 95%CI 2.9% - 4.3%) of COVID-19 infections (RR 18.0, 95%CI 13.9 - 23.4) among all seats. The attack rate decreased with increasing distance, but it increased with increasing co-travel time. The attack rate increased on average by 0.15% (p = 0.005) per hour of co-travel; for passengers at adjacent seats, this increase was 1.3% (p = 0.008), the highest among all seats considered. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has a high transmission risk among train passengers, but this risk shows significant differences with co-travel time and seat location. During disease outbreaks, when travelling on public transportation in confined spaces such as trains, measures should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission, including increasing seat distance, reducing passenger density, and use of personal hygiene protection.","Hu, Maogui; Lin, Hui; Wang, Jinfeng; Xu, Chengdong; Tatem, Andrew J; Meng, Bin; Zhang, Xin; Liu, Yifeng; Wang, Pengda; Wu, Guizhen; Xie, Haiyong; Lai, Shengjie",Clin. infect. dis,381,20

METHODS: A search was conducted by two authors independently on the freely available COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We developed an automated search engine to screen a total of 59,000 articles in a few seconds. Filtering of the articles was then undertaken using keywords and questions, e.g. ""Effects of diabetes on COVID/normal coronavirus/SARS-CoV-2/nCoV/COVID-19 disease severity, mortality?"". The search terms were repeated for all the comorbidities considered in this paper. Additional articles were retrieved by searching via Google Scholar and PubMed. FINDINGS: A total of 54 articles were considered for a full review. It was observed that diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol levels possess an apparent relation to COVID-19 severity. Other comorbidities, such as cancer, kidney disease, and stroke, must be further evaluated to determine a strong relationship to the virus. CONCLUSION: Reports associating cancer, kidney disease, and stroke with COVID-19 should be carefully interpreted, not only because of the size of the samples, but also because patients could be old, have a history of smoking, or have any other clinical condition suggesting that these factors might be associated with the poor COVID-19 outcomes rather than the comorbidity itself. Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted.","Zaki, Nazar; Alashwal, Hany; Ibrahim, Sahar",Diabetes Metab Syndr,381,10

Several independent studies conducted with different approaches showed a high degree of confidence and reproducibility of the results. Computer-assisted prediction is instrumental for a quick and cost-effective solution to prevent the spread and ultimately eliminate the infection. Most efforts to develop vaccines and drugs against SARS-CoV-2 target the spike glycoprotein (protein S), the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies.

A distinction is made between precise and round numbers. Historically, using round numbers to estimate the spread of disease gave way in the 19th century to the sort precise, but not necessarily accurate, statistics that are now being used to record COVID-19. However, round numbers have continued to exert rhetorical, ‘semi-magical’ power by simultaneously conveying both quantity and quality. This is demonstrated in examples from the British government’s claims about COVID-19. The paper illustrates how senior members of the UK government use ‘good’ round numbers to frame their COVID-19 goals and to announce apparent achievements. These round numbers can provide political incentives to manipulate the production of precise number;again examples from the UK government are given.

In particular, we focus on social media platforms where we see the possibility of counteracting the spread of misinformation by providing users with more proficiency through our approaches. We argue that the omnipresent trend to abstract away and hide information from users via UI/UX design opposes their ability to self-learn. This leads us to propose a different framework in which we unify elegant and simple interfaces with nudges that promote a look behind the curtain. Such designs serve to foster a deeper understanding of employed technologies and aim to increase the critical assessment of content encountered on social platforms. Furthermore, we consider users with an intermediary skill level to be largely ignored in current approaches, as they are given no tools to broaden their knowledge without consultation of expert material. The resulting stagnation is exemplified by the tactics of misinformation campaigns, which exploit the ensuing lack of information literacy and critical thinking. We propose an approach to design that sufficiently emancipates users in both aspects by promoting a look behind the abstraction of UI/UX so that an autonomous learning process is given the chance to occur. Furthermore, we name ideas for future research within this area that take our considerations into account.","Wolff, Jan",,381,20

With an increase in awareness regarding the virus, the behavior of general population has changed dramatically. As activities such as driving and hospital presentation patterns have changed, our study aimed to assess the differences in trauma case variables before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Trauma data for the period of March 1st-June 15th were compared for the years 2015-2019 (pre-COVID) and 2020 (COVID). The data were analyzed across the following categories: injury severity score, injury mechanism, motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) vs. other blunt injuries, alcohol involvement, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: The median injury severity score pre-COVID and during COVID was 9, representing no change. There was no difference in overall distribution of mechanism of injury; however, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of MVCs pre-COVID (36.39%) vs. COVID (29.6%, P < .05). Alcohol was significantly more likely to be involved in trauma during COVID-19 (P < .05). The mean hospital stay increased from 3.87-5.4 days during COVID-19 (P < .05). DISCUSSION: We saw similar results to prior studies in terms of there being no change in trauma severity. Our observation that motor vehicle collisions have decreased is consistent with current data showing decreased use of motor vehicles during the pandemic. We also observed an increase in alcohol-related cases which are consistent with the reported changes in alcohol consumption since the pandemic began.","Devarakonda, Aditya K; Wehrle, Chase J; Chibane, Fairouz L; Drevets, Peter D; Fox, Elizabeth D; Lawson, Andrew G",Am Surg,381,1

Although children, including children with cancer, have been found to be affected less commonly and less severely than adults, indirect effects of the pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of children with cancer have been less described. METHODS: A survey was performed in the four largest tertiary pediatric hematology-oncology medical centers in Israel. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from the medical files of patients diagnosed or treated with cancer during April-October 2020. RESULTS: Seventeen patients are described, who had a significant delay in diagnosis or treatment of cancer. These represent approximately 10% of all pediatric cancer diagnosed during the study period in these centers. A main cause of delay was fear of exposure to COVID-19 (fears felt by the patient, parent, physician, or decision-makers at the institution; or the implementation of national guidelines). Delays also resulted from co-infection with COVID-19 and the attribution of the oncologic symptoms to the infection. In addition, treatment was delayed of patients already diagnosed with cancer, due to COVID-19 infection detected in the patient, a family member, or a bone marrow donor. CONCLUSION: Fear from the COVID-19 pandemic may result in delayed diagnosis and treatment of children with cancer, which may carry a risk to dismal prognosis. It is crucial that pediatricians and patients alike remember that other diseases still prevail and must be thought of and treated in a timely fashion.","Dvori, Michal; Elitzur, Sarah; Barg, Assaf; Barzilai-Birenboim, Shlomit; Gilad, Gil; Amar, Shirah; Toledano, Helen; Toren, Amos; Weinreb, Sigal; Goldstein, Gal; Shapira, Adi; Ash, Shifra; Izraeli, Shai; Gilad, Oded",Int. j. clin. oncol,381,20

This multi-country study aimed to explore risk factors that drive mortality in COVID-19 patients who received neither dexamethasone nor remdesivir. We analyzed a cohort of 568 survivors and 507 non-survivors from China, European regions, and North America. Elderly males &#8805;70 years accounted for only 25% of survivors, but this rate was significantly higher in non-survivors from China (55%), European regions (63%), and North America (47%). Compared with survivors, non-survivors had more incidences of comorbidities such as cerebrovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, p-values<0.05). Survival analyses revealed age, male gender, shortness of breath, cerebrovascular disease, and COPD as mortality-associated factors. Survival time from symptom onset was significantly shorter in elderly versus young patients (median: 29 versus 62 days), males versus females (median: 46 versus 59 days), and patients with versus without comorbidities (mean: 41 versus 61 days). Mortality risk was higher in elderly males with comorbidities than in young females without comorbidities (p-value<0.01). Elderly male survivors with comorbidities also had longer hospital stays than other survivors (25 versus 18.5 days, p-value<0.01). Overall, the high mortality risk in elderly males with COVID-19-associated comorbidities supports early prevention and critical care for elderly populations.","Li, Guangdi; Liu, Yacong; Jing, Xixi; Wang, Yali; Miao, Miao; Tao, Li; Zhou, Zhiguo; Xie, Yuanlin; Huang, Yaxiong; Lei, Jianhua; Gong, Guozhong; Jin, Ping; Hao, Yuantao; Faria, Nuno Rodrigues; Clercq, Erik De; Zhang, Min",Aging (Albany NY),381,1

In such cases, Bayesian multi-criteria decision analysis provides a framework for decision making. In this paper, we present how to construct a multi-attribute decision support system for choosing between countermeasure strategies, such as lockdowns, designed to mitigate the effects of COVID-19. Such an analysis can evaluate both the short term and long term efficacy of various candidate countermeasures. The expected utility scores of a countermeasure strategy capture the expected impact of the policies on health outcomes and other measures of population well-being. The broad methodologies we use here have been established for some time. However, this application has many novel elements to it: the pervasive uncertainty of the science; the necessary dynamic shifts between regimes within each candidate suite of countermeasures; and the fast moving stochastic development of the underlying threat all present new challenges to this domain. Our methodology is illustrated by demonstrating in a simplified example how the efficacy of various strategies can be formally compared through balancing impacts of countermeasures, not only on the short term (e.g. COVID-19 deaths) but the medium to long term effects on the population (e.g increased poverty).","Strong, Peter; Shenvi, Aditi; Yu, Xuewen; Papamichail, K.Nadia; Wynn, Henry P; Smith, Jim Q",,381,26

Public participation in decisions regarding (the relaxation of) these measures has been notably absent, despite being recommended in the literature. Here, as one of the exceptions, we report the results of 30,000 citizens advising the government on eight different possibilities for relaxing lockdown measures in the Netherlands. By making use of the novel method Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE), participants were asked to recommend which out of the eight options they prefer to be relaxed. Participants received information regarding the societal impacts of each relaxation option, such as the impact of the option on the healthcare system. The results of the PVE informed policymakers about people's preferences regarding (the impacts of) the relaxation options. For instance, we established that participants assign an equal value to a reduction of 100 deaths among citizens younger than 70 years and a reduction of 168 deaths among citizens older than 70 years. We show how these preferences can be used to rank options in terms of desirability. Citizens advised to relax lockdown measures, but not to the point at which the healthcare system becomes heavily overloaded. We found wide support for prioritising the re-opening of contact professions. Conversely, participants disfavoured options to relax restrictions for specific groups of citizens as they found it important that decisions lead to ""unity"" and not to ""division"". 80% of the participants state that PVE is a good method to let citizens participate in government decision-making on relaxing lockdown measures. Participants felt that they could express a nuanced opinion, communicate arguments, and appreciated the opportunity to evaluate relaxation options in comparison to each other while being informed about the consequences of each option. This increased their awareness of the dilemmas the government faces.","Mouter, Niek; Hernandez, Jose Ignacio; Itten, Anatol Valerian",PLoS One,381,24

Uganda reported 40,751 cases and 335 deaths as of 9 April 2021 and started its vaccination program among priority groups like health workers, teachers, those with chronic diseases among others in early March 2021. Unanimous uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine is required to subsequently avert its spread;therefore, we assessed COVID-19 vaccine acceptability, hesitancy, and associated factors among medical students in Uganda. METHODS: This study employed an online descriptive cross-sectional survey among medical students across 10 medical schools in Uganda. A structured questionnaire via Google Form was conveniently sent to eligible participants via WhatsApp. Each medical school had a coordinator who consistently shared the data tool in the WhatsApp groups. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression were used to assess the association between vaccine acceptability with demographics, COVID-19 risk perception, and vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: We surveyed 600 medical students, 377 (62.8%) were male. COVID-19 vaccine acceptability was 37.3% and vaccine hesitancy 30.7%. Factors associated with vaccine acceptability were being male (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.9, p=0.001) and being single (aOR= 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.9, p=0.022). Very high (aOR= 3.5, 95% CI 1.7-6.9, p&lt;0.001) or moderate (aOR =2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.1, p=0.008) perceived risk of getting COVID-19 in the future, receiving any vaccine in the past 5 years (aOR= 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.5, p=0.017), and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9, p=0.036). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed low levels of acceptance towards the COVID-19 vaccine among medical students, low self-perceived risks of COVID-19, and many had relied on social media that provided them with negative information. This poses an evident risk on the battle towards COVID-19 in the future especially when these future health professions are expected to be influencing decisions of the general public towards the same.","Kanyike, A.

METHODS: The search strategy was restricted to publications in English before 1 December 2019 in the PsycINFO, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus and Web of Science databases. We only included oral diseases considered as public health issues with a global burden. As a result, investigations reporting the frequency of brushing, poor lifestyle behaviours, non-white ethnicity, DMFT scores and periodontal disease as an outcome were included. The two reviewers resolved any disagreements. Reviewers analysed the full texts, considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Also, a manual search of the reference lists was performed on all the selected studies. RESULTS: In total, 11 publications were included in the meta-analysis. Findings indicate a positive association between non-white ethnicity and PQoL among PW. Among PW, those who had non-white ethnicity were 1.43 times more likely to have PQoL (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.17, 1.70). A positive association between DMFT and poor QoL among PW was also observed. Those who has suffered DMFT were 1.4 times more likely to have poor QoL (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.55). CONCLUSIONS: Results from this meta-analysis support the need for behavioural interventions for improving oral hygiene in expectant mothers.

DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review of early published, peer-reviewed, original research where researchers presented data from adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients regarding their presenting signs, symptoms, and definitive survival outcomes. DATA SOURCES: We searched the databases PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus for relevant articles published between 1 January 2020 -18 May 2020. REVIEW METHODS: We extracted data from each study and synthesized them across primary sources using a literature matrix table to provide a global impression of this rapidly growing body of literature. RESULTS: We retrieved 97 mainly descriptive observational studies. SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted between humans, particularly those in close contact. Symptomatic COVID-19 patients can present with a broad array of nonspecific symptoms. Fever and cough are the most commonly reported symptoms; some patients have atypical presentations. In patients with respiratory decompensation, disease progression can be rapid. Some patients experience mild symptoms that are self-limited; others experience organ failure and death. Risk factors for poor outcomes include older age, chronic medical conditions, male gender, obesity, and presenting with signs of declining respiratory status. CONCLUSION: Nurses can mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and sequelae of COVID-19 with prompt and capable responses. IMPACT: This study addresses the problem of the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 while little is known about this virus. This review provides nurses with a summary of the most current evidence regarding the signs, symptoms, and outcomes of adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients that they might identify COVID-19 patients rapidly on presentation to medical care and be attuned to indicators of patient decompensation.","Keller, Kristin Garrett; Reangsing, Chuntana; Schneider, Joanne Kraenzle",J Adv Nurs,381,1

SCCE includes engagement in the arts, culture and heritage, libraries and literature, sports and nature activities, volunteering, and community groups. Research has demonstrated the effects of these activities both on the prevention and management of mental illness. However, it remains unclear whether current research is focusing on the research questions that are of most immediate urgency and relevance to policy and practice. AIMS: The current project was funded as part of the UK Research and Innovation cross-disciplinary mental health network programme to develop and co-produce a new cross-disciplinary research agenda on SCCE and mental health. METHOD: Established processes and principles for developing health research agendas were followed, with a six-phase design including engagement with over 1000 key stakeholders, consultations, integration of findings and collective prioritisation of key questions. RESULTS: We identified four core themes: the mode of engagement, process of engagement, impact of engagement and infrastructure required to facilitate engagement. There were many points of agreement across all stakeholder groups on the priority questions within these themes, but also some specific questions of relevance to different sectors. CONCLUSIONS: This agenda is particularly timely given the extreme pressure on mental health services predicted to follow the current COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to identify how resources from other sectors can be mobilised, and what research questions are going to be most important to fund to support SCCE for mental health.","Fancourt, Daisy; Bhui, Kamaldeep; Chatterjee, Helen; Crawford, Paul; Crossick, Geoffrey; DeNora, Tia; South, Jane",BJPsych Open,381,6

METHODS: In the setting of the STROKOVID study including patients with acute ischemic stroke consecutively admitted to the ten hub hospitals in Lombardy, Italy, between March 8 and April 30, 2020, we compared clinical features of patients with confirmed infection and non-infected patients by logistic regression models and survival analysis. Then, we trained and tested a random forest (RF) binary classifier for the prediction of in-hospital death among patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 1013 patients, 160 (15.8%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.06-2.27) and atrial fibrillation (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.05-2.43) were independently associated with COVID-19 status. Patients with COVID-19 had increased stroke severity at admission [median NIHSS score, 9 (25th to75th percentile, 13) vs 6 (25th to75th percentile, 9)] and increased risk of in-hospital death (38.1% deaths vs 7.2%; HR 3.30; 95% CI 2.17-5.02). The RF model based on six clinical and laboratory parameters exhibited high cross-validated classification accuracy (0.86) and precision (0.87), good recall (0.72) and F1-score (0.79) in predicting in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic strokes in COVID-19 patients have distinctive risk factor profile and etiology, increased clinical severity and higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to non-COVID-19 patients. A simple model based on clinical and routine laboratory parameters may be useful in identifying ischemic stroke patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are unlikely to survive the acute phase.","Pezzini, Alessandro; Grassi, Mario; Silvestrelli, Giorgio; Locatelli, Martina; Rifino, Nicola; Beretta, Simone; Gamba, Massimo; Raimondi, Elisa; Giussani, Giuditta; Carimati, Federico; Sangalli, Davide; Corato, Manuel; Gerevini, Simonetta; Masciocchi, Stefano; Cortinovis, Matteo; La Gioia, Sara; Barbieri, Francesca; Mazzoleni, Valentina; Pezzini, Debora; Bonacina, Sonia; Pilotto, Andrea; Benussi, Alberto; Magoni, Mauro; Premi, Enrico; Prelle, Alessandro Cesare; Agostoni, Elio Clemente; Palluzzi, Fernando; De Giuli, Valeria; Magherini, Anna; Roccatagliata, Daria Valeria; Vinciguerra, Luisa; Puglisi, Valentina; Fusi, Laura; Diamanti, Susanna; Santangelo, Francesco; Xhani, Rubjona; Pozzi, Federico; Grampa, Giampiero; Versino, Maurizio; Salmaggi, Andrea; Marcheselli, Simona; Cavallini, Anna; Giossi, Alessia; Censori, Bruno; Ferrarese, Carlo; Ciccone, Alfonso; Sessa, Maria; Padovani, Alessandro",J. neurol,381,24

As a consequence, several protective measures were urged by national governments in order to limit the spread of the pandemic. Drawing on the literature on health behaviours, in the present study, we investigated the psychological factors (i.e., attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control, intentions, and risk perception) that were associated with two highly recommended behaviours: frequent hand washing and social distancing (i.e., staying at home except for essential reasons). The study employed a correlational design with a follow-up. A questionnaire including measures of psychological predictors was administered via social media to a sample of 403 adults residing in Italy during the lockdown. Self-reported behaviours were assessed one week later. Findings showed that attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control were significantly related to hand washing and social distancing through intentions. Risk perception was a significant predictor of social distancing but not of hand washing. These findings suggest that intervention and communication strategies aimed at encouraging preventive measures during the Covid-19 pandemic should be organized taking into account multiple factors which partially differ depending on the type of behaviour considered.

OBJECTIVES: We examined vape shop non-compliance with state-ordered business closures during COVID-19, changes in their marketing and experiences among consumers. METHODS: As part of a longitudinal study of vape retail in six metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs; Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City, San Diego and Seattle), we conducted: (1) legal research to determine whether statewide COVID-19 orders required vape shops to close; (2) phone-based and web-based surveillance to assess vape shop activity in March-June 2020 during shelter-in-place periods; and (3) a concurrent online survey of e-cigarette users about their experiences with vape retail. RESULTS: Non-essential business closure varied in timing/duration across states and applied to vape shops in California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma (for a brief period) and Washington (Georgia's orders were ambiguous). Surveillance analysis focused on the five MSAs in these states. Of 156 vape shops, 53.2% were open as usual, 11.5% permanently closed and 3.8% temporarily closed; 31.4% offered pick-up/delivery services. Among survey respondents (n=354, M age =23.9±4.6; 46.9% male, 71.8% white, 13.0% Hispanic), 27.4% worried their vape shop would close/go out of business during COVID-19; 7.3% said their vape shop did so. Few noticed increases in vape product delivery options (7.3%), discounts/price promotions (9.9%) and/or prices (9.3%). While 20.3% stockpiled vape products, 20.3% tried to reduce use and 15.8% tried to quit. CONCLUSIONS: Many vape shops were non-compliant with state COVID-19 orders. E-cigarette users were as likely to stockpile vape products as to attempt to reduce or quit using e-cigarettes.","Berg, Carla J; Callanan, Rachel; Johnson, Trent O; Schliecher, Nina C; Sussman, Steve; Wagener, Theodore L; Meaney, Mark; Henriksen, Lisa",Tob. control,381,10

The study aimed to evaluate the landscape co-benefits generated by the Natura 2000 networks, achieving a measure of efficiency of the policies and performance of the Management Plan, with reference to the “Timpa di Acireale” site. CVM and TCM were used for the estimation of landscape co-benefits.

The aim of this study is to achieve insight into coronavirus disease-care participation of surgical residents in the Netherlands, the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the experienced quality of surgical training, and the influence on Burn-out and Work Engagement compared with the non-coronavirus disease 2019 period in January 2020. METHODS: In this study, we have conducted 2 digital surveys immediately before and 2 months after the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We surveyed a validated Dutch questionnaire 'Utrecht Burn-out Scale,' derived from the Maslach Burn-out Inventory, and also collected the 'Utrecht Work Engagement Scale' measuring work engagement. Additionally, we describe the coronavirus disease-care participation of surgical residents, the impact on how they experienced the quality of their surgical training, and the influence on 'Burn-out and Work Engagement' compared with the pre-coronavirus disease 2019 period for surgical residents in the Netherlands. RESULTS: In January 2020, a total of 317 residents completed the online survey, and in April 2020, a total of 313 residents completed the online survey. Of the responders, 48.6%, in April, participated in coronavirus disease-care in both the coronavirus disease ward as well as the coronavirus disease intensive care unit. Residents experienced that the coronavirus disease 2019 influenced their surgical training in 85.2% of responders. In only 5% of the residents did the pandemic not affect the exposure to surgical training in the operating theater. More burn-out symptoms were noted amongst coronavirus disease ward deployed residents versus no coronavirus disease ward deployment, (16.0% vs 7.6%, P = .06). The Work-Engagement questionnaire showed a significantly lower work engagement score of 4.2 for residents who were deployed in a coronavirus disease-care intensive care unit versus a score of 4.6 for residents scheduled in a coronavirus disease ward (P = .02). CONCLUSION: This study shows a significant impact of the first months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the Dutch surgical trainee program, with a major redistribution of residents with a decrease of surgical exposure and education. We emphasize the need for adequate guidance of all surgical residents and potentially lengthening the surgical training program.","Poelmann, Floris B; Koëter, Tijmen; Steinkamp, Pieter J; Vriens, Menno R; Verhoeven, Bas; Kruijff, Schelto",Surgery (St. Louis),381,20

We assessed the psychological impact of COVID-19 on dental academics globally and on changes in their behaviors. METHODS: We invited dental academics to complete a cross-sectional, online survey from March to May 2020. The survey was based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The survey collected data on participants' stress levels (using the Impact of Event Scale), attitude (fears, and worries because of COVID-19 extracted by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), perceived control (resulting from training on public health emergencies), norms (country-level COVID-19 fatality rate), and personal and professional backgrounds. We used multilevel regression models to assess the association between the study outcome variables (frequent handwashing and avoidance of crowded places) and explanatory variables (stress, attitude, perceived control and norms). RESULTS: 1862 academics from 28 countries participated in the survey (response rate = 11.3%). Of those, 53.4% were female, 32.9% were <46 years old and 9.9% had severe stress. PCA extracted three main factors: fear of infection, worries because of professional responsibilities, and worries because of restricted mobility. These factors had significant dose-dependent association with stress and were significantly associated with more frequent handwashing by dental academics (B = 0.56, 0.33, and 0.34) and avoiding crowded places (B = 0.55, 0.30, and 0.28). Low country fatality rates were significantly associated with more handwashing (B = -2.82) and avoiding crowded places (B = -6.61). Training on public health emergencies was not significantly associated with behavior change (B = -0.01 and -0.11). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a considerable psychological impact on dental academics. There was a direct, dose-dependent association between change in behaviors and worries but no association between these changes and training on public health emergencies. More change in behaviors was associated with lower country COVID-19 fatality rates. Fears and stresses were associated with greater adoption of preventive measures against the pandemic.","Ammar, Nour; Aly, Nourhan M; Folayan, Morenike O; Khader, Yousef; Virtanen, Jorma I; Al-Batayneh, Ola B; Mohebbi, Simin Z; Attia, Sameh; Howaldt, Hans-Peter; Boettger, Sebastian; Maharani, Diah A; Rahardjo, Anton; Khan, Imran; Madi, Marwa; Rashwan, Maher; Pavlic, Verica; Cicmil, Smiljka; Choi, Youn-Hee; Joury, Easter; Castillo, Jorge L; Noritake, Kanako; Shamala, Anas; Galluccio, Gabriella; Polimeni, Antonella; Phantumvanit, Prathip; Mancino, Davide; Kim, Jin-Bom; Abdelsalam, Maha M; Arheiam, Arheiam; Dama, Mai A; Nyan, Myat; Hussein, Iyad; Alkeshan, Mohammad M; Vukovic, Ana P; Iandolo, Alfredo; Kemoli, Arthur M; El Tantawi, Maha",PLoS One,381,18

The objective of this study was to determine the health facility (HF) preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak from the perspective of RMNH providers and to determine what factors significantly predict this. An anonymous cross-sectional online survey of RMNH providers was conducted from to July 1-21, 2020 in Lagos State, Nigeria. We conducted a descriptive and ordinal regression analysis, with RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness for RMNH service delivery during the outbreak as the dependent variable. In all, 256 RMNH workers participated, 35.2% reported that RMNH services were unavailable at some time since March 2020, 87.1% felt work-related burnout, 97.7% were concerned about the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and related guidelines, and only 11.7% were satisfied with the preparedness of their HFs. Our final model was a statistically significant predictor of RMNH worker perception of HF preparedness explaining 54.7% of the variation observed. The most significant contribution to the model was communication by HF management (likelihood ratio chi-square [LRCS]: 87.94, P < 0.001) and the availability of PPE and COVID-19 guidelines (LRCS: 15.43, P < 0.001). A one-unit increase in the level of concern about the availability of PPE and COVID-19 guidelines would increase the odds of observing a higher category of satisfaction with HF COVID-19 preparedness. Adequate support of RMNH providers, particularly provision of PPE and guidelines, and appropriate communications about COVID-19 should be prioritized as part of HF preparedness.","Ameh, Charles; Banke-Thomas, Aduragbemi; Balogun, Mobolanle; Makwe, Christian Chigozie; Afolabi, Bosede Bukola",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,381,16

The Italian government was forced to introduce quarantine measures quickly, and all elective health services were stopped or postponed. This emergency has dramatically changed the management of paediatric and adult patients with congenital heart disease. We analysed data from 14 Italian congenital cardiac surgery centres during lockdown, focusing on the impact of the pandemic on surgical activity, patients and healthcare providers and resource allocation. METHODS: Fourteen centres participated in this study. The period analysed was from 9 March to 4 May. We collected data on the involvement of the hospitals in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and on limitations on regular activity and on the contagion among patients and healthcare providers. RESULTS: Four hospitals (29%) remained COVID-19 free, whereas 10 had a 39% reduction in the number of beds for surgical patients, especially in the northern area. Two hundred sixty-three surgical procedures were performed: 20% elective, 62% urgent, 10% emergency and 3% life-saving. Hospital mortality was 0.4%. Compared to 2019, the reduction in surgical activity was 52%. No patients operated on had positive test results before surgery for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. Three patients were infected during the postoperative period. Twenty-nine nurses and 12 doctors were infected. Overall, 80% of our infected healthcare providers were in northern centres. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the pandemic had a different impact on the various Italian congenital cardiac surgery centres based on the different patterns of spread of the virus across the country. During the lockdown, the system was able to satisfy all emergency clinical needs with excellent results.","Giamberti, Alessandro; Varrica, Alessandro; Agati, Salvatore; Gargiulo, Gaetano; Luciani, Giovanni Battista; Marianeschi, Stefano Maria; Pace Napoleone, Carlo; Oppido, Guido; Brunelli, Federico; Palma, Gaetano; Pak, Vitali; Arcieri, Luigi; Scalzo, Gabriele; Padalino, Massimo; Galletti, Lorenzo",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,381,0

With no vaccines or effective antiviral treatments available, the quest for novel therapeutic solutions remains an urgent priority. Rocaglates, a class of plant-derived cyclopenta[b]benzofurans, exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple RNA viruses including coronaviruses. Specifically, rocaglates inhibit eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A)-dependent mRNA translation initiation, resulting in strongly reduced viral RNA translation. Here, we assessed the antiviral activity of the synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (-) against SARS-CoV-2 using both in vitro and ex vivo cell culture models. In Vero E6 cells, CR-31-B (-) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication with an EC50 of ~1.8 nM. In primary human airway epithelial cells, CR-31-B (-) reduced viral titers to undetectable levels at a concentration of 100 nM. Reduced virus reproduction was accompanied by substantially reduced viral protein accumulation and replication/transcription complex formation. The data reveal a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by CR-31-B (-), corroborating previous results obtained for other coronaviruses and supporting the idea that rocaglates may be used in first-line antiviral intervention strategies against novel and emerging RNA virus outbreaks.","Müller, Christin; Obermann, Wiebke; Karl, Nadja; Wendel, Hans-Guido; Taroncher-Oldenburg, Gaspar; Pleschka, Stephan; Hartmann, Roland K; Grünweller, Arnold; Ziebuhr, John",Antiviral Res,381,15

As approved therapies in pulmonary fibrosis only slow disease progression, there is a significant unmet medical need. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is the inhaling of pure oxygen, under the pressure of greater than one atmosphere absolute, and it has been reported to improve pulmonary function in patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Our recent study suggested that repetitive HBO exposure may affect biological processes in mice lungs such as response to wounding and extracellular matrix. To extend these findings, a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model was used to evaluate the effect of repetitive HBO exposure on pulmonary fibrosis. Building on our previous findings, we provide evidence that HBO exposure attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. In vitro, HBO exposure could reverse, at least partially, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-induced fibroblast activation, and this effect may be mediated by downregulating TGF-beta-induced expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha. These findings support HBO as a potentially life-changing therapy for patients with pulmonary fibrosis, although further research is needed to fully evaluate this.","Yuan, Y.; Li, Y.; Qiao, G.; Zhou, Y.; Xu, Z.; Hill, C.; Jiang, Z.; Wang, Y.",Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,381,25

Here we model the effect of evictions on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, simulating viral transmission within and among households in a theoretical metropolitan area. We recreate a range of urban epidemic trajectories and project the course of the epidemic under two counterfactual scenarios, one in which a strict moratorium on evictions is in place and enforced, and another in which evictions are allowed to resume at baseline or increased rates. We find, across scenarios, that evictions lead to significant increases in infections. Applying our model to Philadelphia using locally-specific parameters shows that the increase is especially profound in models that consider realistically heterogenous cities in which both evictions and contacts occur more frequently in poorer neighborhoods. Our results provide a basis to assess eviction moratoria and show that policies to stem evictions are a warranted and important component of COVID-19 control.","Nande, Anjalika; Sheen, Justin; Walters, Emma L; Klein, Brennan; Chinazzi, Matteo; Gheorghe, Andrei H; Adlam, Ben; Shinnick, Julianna; Tejeda, Maria Florencia; Scarpino, Samuel V; Vespignani, Alessandro; Greenlee, Andrew J; Schneider, Daniel; Levy, Michael Z; Hill, Alison L",Nat Commun,381,27

DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study using a web based survey design. METHODS: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and sociodemographic, occupational, health and sleep quality variables were used to collect data during the first month of the lockdown period due to COVID-19 (March-April 2020). A snowball sampling was carried out, where participants were asked to disseminate and distribute the questionnaire among their own profiles in social networks. RESULTS: A representative sample of 5220 participants aged &#8805;18 years old took part in the study. The global PSQI score was 8.17 points (SD 4.43). A statistical association was found between the global PSQI score and several of the variables collected. Findings show that the quality of sleep was worse among women (p < 0.001), single participants (p 0.02), those working in rotating shifts (p < 0.001), on-site workers (p < 0.001), and people diagnosed with COVID-19 or who had someone in their environment diagnosed with the virus (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Findings show that the Spanish population has experienced poor quality of sleep during the lockdown period. Being a woman, working in rotating shifts, having suffered from COVID-19 or having someone close suffering from COVID-19, being unemployed or being affected by a Temporary Redundancy Scheme, as well as spending long hours in bed were associated with poorer sleep quality. On the contrary, being older and sleeping longer hours were associated with a better sleep quality.","Maestro-Gonzalez, Alba; Sánchez-Zaballos, Marta; Mosteiro-Díaz, María Pilar; Zuazua-Rico, David",Sleep Med,381,5

This study focuses on emergency general surgery services at a major trauma centre and teaching hospital. We aimed to identify whether the number of patients and the severity of their presentation has significantly changed since the implementation of a national lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of acute referrals (from general practice and accident and emergency) to the emergency general surgery team over a 14-day period before (group 1) and during (group 2) lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were reviewed by the general surgical team in group 1 and 75 in group 2 (a 50.3% reduction). The number of days with symptoms prior to presentation was significantly shorter in group 1 compared with group 2 (3 vs 4, p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in the National Early Warning Score, white blood cell count, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein on admission between the two groups of patients. There were significantly fewer patients admitted after lockdown compared with pre-lockdown (66% vs 48%, p = 0.01). Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter during lockdown compared with pre-lockdown (5 days vs 4 days, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Fewer patients were referred and admitted during lockdown compared with pre-lockdown, and the length of stay was also significantly reduced. There was also a delay in presentation to hospital, although these patients were not more unwell based on the scoring criteria used within this study.","Patel, R; Hainsworth, A J; Devlin, K; Patel, J H; Karim, A",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,381,16

The intervention has been evaluated in a single-arm feasibility study with embedded process evaluation. The feasibility study was due to open to recruitment during the COVID-19 2020-2021 pandemic, 1 month into the first UK-wide lockdown. We worked rapidly to implement adaptions to the trial procedures and intervention delivery that we believe are applicable to randomised controlled trials. Recruitment became predominantly via self-referral. Electronic consent was employed, with consent discussions occurring over the telephone. Registration, consent, eligibility assessment and data collection as well as the intervention (online physical activity tool) were via a secure, encrypted multi-user web-based platform for participants, physiotherapists and researchers accessible via various hardware. Physiotherapy consultations, as well as the process evaluation, were conducted remotely using video conferencing software or the telephone. A remote training package for physiotherapists and site initiations was also developed and electronic site files employed. Our adaptions are extremely topical given the COVID-19 situation, and whilst not what we had originally planned, have enabled successful delivery of the feasibility study and are relevant to conducting randomised controlled trials and meeting the needs of people with MS who are far more isolated than ever before.

This study aimed to investigate changes in preventive behaviors during the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. METHOD: This cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1477 adults aged 18years and older in 31 provinces of Iran. Data was collected by an anonymous online questionnaire. RESULT: Overall, engagement in preventive behaviors was relatively acceptable and more than 45% of subjects always carried out all preventive behaviors. Engaging in the all preventive behaviors had a peak in the second month and obviously declined during third month. Engagement in some preventive behaviors such as ""wearing a face mask"" and ""keeping a safe distance from others"" observed less than other behaviors. There was statistically significant difference in the engagement in preventive behaviors by gender and occupation (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Although engagement in preventive behaviors was relatively acceptable at first two months of the outbreak, it has declined gradually. This is a warning for public health decision makers. COVID-19 is still a crucial issue in Iran and it is necessary that government decision be based on the fact that Iranian people must live with a coronavirus for months, with full caution and compliance toward all preventive care protocols.","Shamsalinia, Abbas; Mohammadi, Sepideh; Ghaffari, Fatemeh; Arazi, Tajmohammad",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,381,5

METHODS: The MGH Covid-19 Registry includes confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients hospitalized at MGH and is based on manual chart reviews and data extraction from electronic health records (EHRs). We evaluated differences between White/Non-Hispanic and Hispanic patients in demographics, complications and 14-day outcomes among the N = 866 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 from March 11, 2020-May 4, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 43% of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 were women, median age was 60.4 [IQR = (48.2, 75)], 11.3% were Black/non-Hispanic and 35.2% were Hispanic. Hispanic patients, representing 35.2% of patients, were younger than White/non-Hispanic patients [median age 51y; IQR = (40.6, 61.6) versus 72y; (58.0, 81.7) (p<0.001)].

We measured two facets of depressive rumination, brooding and reflection, along with rumination about the current COVID-19 situation to see whether these different subtypes of rumination explained perceived stress among migraineurs and healthy controls. METHODS: Healthy adults (n = 64) and migraine patients (n = 73) filled out self-report questionnaires online. A multiple linear regression model was used to test whether depressive rumination (i.e. brooding and reflection) and COVID-related rumination explained perceived stress among adults with and without migraine during the times of COVID-19, after controlling for gender, age, migraine/control group status and migraine disability. RESULTS: Although we did not find any difference in the level of perceived stress among migraineurs and the control group, perceived stress was more strongly associated with brooding as well as COVID-related rumination among migraineurs than healthy controls. COVID-related rumination and brooding (but not reflection) explained the level of perceived stress after controlling for gender, age, migraine/control group status and migraine disability. CONCLUSIONS: The similar degree of perceived stress among migraineurs and the control group may imply that there is great variation in the personal experience of people regarding the pandemic, that may be determined by numerous other factors. Our results demonstrate that ruminating about the pandemic and related difficulties, as well as brooding (but not reflection) appear to be associated with higher level of perceived stress during the times of the coronavirus. This association was slightly stronger among migraineurs, hinting at the increased vulnerability of this patient group in stressful situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results also suggest that ruminating about the pandemic and its consequences is weakly associated with trait-level depressive rumination, thus may be more contingent on specific factors.","Kovács, Lilla Nóra; Baksa, Dániel; Dobos, Dóra; Eszlári, Nóra; Gecse, Kinga; Kocsel, Natália; Juhász, Gabriella; Kökönyei, Gyöngyi",BMC Psychol,381,24

Here we profile the antibody responses of 162 COVID-19 symptomatic patients in the COVID-BioB cohort followed longitudinally for up to eight months from symptom onset to find SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, as well as antibodies either recognizing SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens and nucleoprotein, or specific for S2 antigen of seasonal beta-coronaviruses and hemagglutinin of the H1N1 flu virus. The presence of neutralizing antibodies within the first weeks from symptoms onset correlates with time to a negative swab result (p = 0.002), while the lack of neutralizing capacity correlates with an increased risk of a fatal outcome (p = 0.008). Neutralizing antibody titers progressively drop after 5-8 weeks but are still detectable up to 8 months in the majority of recovered patients regardless of age or co-morbidities, with IgG to spike antigens providing the best correlate of neutralization. Antibody responses to seasonal coronaviruses are temporarily boosted, and parallel those to SARS-CoV-2 without dampening the specific response or worsening disease progression. Our results thus suggest compromised immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike to be a major trait of COVID-19 patients with critical conditions, and thereby inform on the planning of COVID-19 patient care and therapy prioritization.","Dispinseri, Stefania; Secchi, Massimiliano; Pirillo, Maria Franca; Tolazzi, Monica; Borghi, Martina; Brigatti, Cristina; De Angelis, Maria Laura; Baratella, Marco; Bazzigaluppi, Elena; Venturi, Giulietta; Sironi, Francesca; Canitano, Andrea; Marzinotto, Ilaria; Tresoldi, Cristina; Ciceri, Fabio; Piemonti, Lorenzo; Negri, Donatella; Cara, Andrea; Lampasona, Vito; Scarlatti, Gabriella",Nat Commun,381,20

Cardiac arrhythmias have been reported as frequent but their incidence is unknown. The aim of this research was to assess the real incidence of cardiac arrhythmias among COVID-19 patients admitted to Portuguese hospitals and to understand the underlying prognostic implications. METHODS: The Portuguese Association of Arrhythmology, Pacing and Electrophysiology (APAPE) conducted a survey in Portuguese hospitals to assess the occurrence of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients, their clinical characteristics, the use of experimental therapies and the impact on QT interval. RESULTS: Twenty hospitals participated, reporting 692 hospitalized patients. An arrhythmic episode occurred in 81 (11.7%) and 64 (79%) had detailed information on these episodes. New onset arrhythmias occurred in 41 (64%) patients, 45 (70.3%) male, median age 73.5 (61-80.3) years. There were 51 (79.7%) with associated comorbidities, mainly arterial hypertension (41, 64.1%). Of 53 patients (82.3%) on experimental therapy, 7 (10.9%) had an increased QTc interval. Regarding arrhythmias, two patients (3.1%) had ventricular tachycardia, 5 (7.8%) sinus bradycardia, 17 (26.6%) paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 40 (62.5%) atrial fibrillation or flutter. At the time of reporting, there had been no deaths due to arrhythmic syndrome or related complications. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of COVID-19 patients. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is high but not associated with increased cardiac mortality although it does though occur frequently in extremely ill patients and with multiple organ failure. Regardless of the use of experimental drugs, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is low and atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular arrhythmias are the most prevalent arrythmias.","Mesquita, Dinis; Carmo, Pedro; Cabanelas, Nuno; Santos, Nuno; Martins, Vítor; Sanfins, Victor; Costa, Helena Cristina; Fontes, José Paulo; Fonseca, Paulo; Parreira, Leonor",Rev. port. cardiol,381,16

We used herpes simplex virus 1, a non-Biosafety Level 3 (non-BSL3) enveloped virus, as a surrogate to develop and validate methods before assessing the survival of infectious SARS-CoV-2 on foods. Several food types, including chicken, seafood, and produce, were held at 4 °C and assessed for infectious virus survival (herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and SARS-CoV-2) at 0 h, 1 h, and 24 h post-inoculation (hpi) by plaque assay. At all three time points, recovery of SARS-CoV-2 was similar from chicken, salmon, shrimp, and spinach, ranging from 3.4 to 4.3 log PFU/mL. However, initial (0 h) virus recovery from apples and mushrooms was significantly lower than that from poultry and seafood, and infectious virus decreased over time, with recovery from mushrooms becoming undetectable by 24 hpi. Comparing infectious virus titers with viral genome copies confirmed that PCR-based tests only indicate presence of viral nucleic acid, which does not necessarily correlate with the quantity of infectious virus. The survival and high recovery of SARS-CoV-2 on certain foods highlight the importance of safe food handling practices in mitigating any public health concerns related to potentially contaminated foods.","Dhakal, Janak Jia Mo Joyce Jonathan D.; Moore, Greyson A.; Ovissipour, Reza Bertke Andrea S.",Foods,381,16

SOURCES OF DATA: We identified studies in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED, Web of Science and Google Scholar using keywords including 'mindfulness', 'meditation', and 'review', 'meta-analysis' or their variations. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: MBIs are effective for improving many biopsychosocial conditions, including depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, addiction, psychosis, pain, hypertension, weight control, cancer-related symptoms and prosocial behaviours. It is found to be beneficial in the healthcare settings, in schools and workplace but further research is warranted to look into its efficacy on different problems. MBIs are relatively safe, but ethical aspects should be considered. Mechanisms are suggested in both empirical and neurophysiological findings. Cost-effectiveness is found in treating some health conditions. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Inconclusive or only preliminary evidence on the effects of MBIs on PTSD, ADHD, ASD, eating disorders, loneliness and physical symptoms of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and respiratory conditions. Furthermore, some beneficial effects are not confirmed in subgroup populations. Cost-effectiveness is yet to confirm for many health conditions and populations. GROWING POINTS: Many mindfulness systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate low quality of included studies, hence high-quality studies with adequate sample size and longer follow-up period are needed. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: More research is needed on online mindfulness trainings and interventions to improve biopsychosocial health during the COVID-19 pandemic; Deeper understanding of the mechanisms of MBIs integrating both empirical and neurophysiological findings; Long-term compliance and effects of MBIs; and development of mindfulness plus (mindfulness+) or personalized mindfulness programs to elevate the effectiveness for different purposes.","Zhang, Dexing; Lee, Eric K P; Mak, Eva C W; Ho, C Y; Wong, Samuel Y S",Br. med. bull,381,16

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may affect susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcome of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective single-center study, we determined the serum levels of ACE-2, angiotensin II and aldosterone in patients with COVID-19 compared to control patients presenting with similar symptoms in the emergency unit. RESULTS: We analyzed serum samples from 24 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 61 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. SARS-CoV-2 positive and control patients did not differ in baseline patients characteristics, symptoms and clinical presentation. Mean serum concentrations of ACE2, angiotensin II, and aldosterone did not differ between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and the control group. In line with this, serum potassium as surrogate parameter for RAAS activity and blood pressure were similar in both groups.

The ""Big Bang Enlargement"" marked the beginning of dilemmas whether the new EU Member States fulfil the necessary rule of law criteria and opened the way for divergent views on how to implement TEU Article 2 values in practice. Furthermore, constant problems and difficulty of the candidate countries to fulfil the necessary rule of law criteria added to the complexity of the problem. In turn, the European institutions have tried to introduce a series of mechanisms and procedures to improve the oversight and make the states follow the rules - starting from the famous Treaty on the European Union (TEU) Article 7, the Rule of Law Mechanism, annual reports on the rule of law and the most recent Conditionality Regulation. The Conditionality Regulation was finally adopted in December 2020 after much discussion and opposition from certain EU Member States. It calls for the suspension of payments, commitments and disbursement of instalments, and a reduction of funding in the cases of general deficiencies with the rule of law. On the other hand, similar provisions were laid out in the February 2020 enlargement negotiation methodology specifying that in the cases of no progress, imbalance of the overall negotiations or regression, the scope and intensity of pre-accession assistance can be adjusted downward thus descaling financial assistance to candidate countries. The similarities between the two mechanisms, one for the Member States, the other for candidate countries shows an increased sharing of experiences and approaches to dealing with possible deficiencies or breaches of the rule of law through economic sanctioning, in order to resolve challenges to the unity of the European union. The Covid-19 pandemic and the crisis it has provoked on many fronts has turned the attention of the Member States (i.e. the Council) away from the long running problematic issues. Consequently, the procedures against Poland and Hungary based on the Rule of Law Mechanism have slowed down or become fully stalled, while certain measures taken up by some European states have created concerns about the limitations of human rights and liberties. This paper, therefore, analyses the efforts the EU is making in protecting the rule of law in its Member States and the candidate countries. It also analyses the new focus of the EU in the financial area where it has started to develop novel mechanisms that would affect one of the most influential EU tools - the funding of member and candidate countries through its structural and enlargement policy. Finally, it attempts to determine and provide conclusions on the efficiency of new instruments with better regulated criteria and timing of activities will be and how much they would affect the EU and its current and future member states.","Pejović, Aleksandar-Andrija PhD",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,381,23

Autorefraction (AR) is the most common examination performed prior to prescribing glasses. As technology advances, so has the accuracy and number of portable autorefractors available. Portable technology has become acutely important with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the conversion of in-person clinical evaluations to remote telemedicine encounters. Patients and providers want to do as much as possible remotely. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review of the accuracy and effectiveness of available portable automated refractors compared to the current standard of care, subjective refraction (SR). METHODS: A literature search of PubMED, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov 97 unique publications in English on portable autorefractors. Twelve studies comparing a portable AR device to at least one form of SR were systematically included in this review. RESULTS: There were four portable autorefractors (Netra, Quicksee, Retinomax and SVOne) studied against SR. There was high patient acceptance of glasses prescriptions by the Quicksee alone, with 87% subjects seeing the same or better than SR. Quicksee was more accurate than Netra and Retinomax. SVOne was preferred over Netra and outperformed Retinomax in multiple measures, despite Retinomax being the fastest test. DISCUSSION: There are numerous portable autorefractors available, but few were compared against SR. Quicksee and SVOne are the most accurate and patient-preferred devices. Quicksee was the most accurate, and it performed clinically the same as SR in some reports.","Samanta, Anindya; Shetty, Akaanksh; Nelson, Patricia C",J Telemed Telecare,381,12

While laboratory findings in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) show increased D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, the abnormalities in standard coagulation tests and platelet count are minimal. Recent studies suggest contribution of fibrinolysis shutdown to this phenomenon. Endothelial injury and alteration of its antithrombotic activity can lead to micro- and macrovascular thrombosis in the lungs, occurrence of which is associated with poor clinical outcome in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Additionally, the hypercoagulability induced by activation of coagulation pathways during the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to impaired organ perfusion.

The current pandemic involving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has highlighted limitations to the ordinary provision of personal protective equipment (PPE). For perioperative healthcare workers, N95 masks provide a stark example of PPE in short supply necessitating the creation of scientifically valid protocols for their decontamination and reuse. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify peer-reviewed articles related to N95 mask decontamination and subsequent testing for the integrity of mask filtration and facial seal. To expand this search, we additionally surveyed the official statements from key health agencies, organizations, and societies for relevant citations. RESULTS: Our initial database search resulted in five articles that met inclusion criteria, with 26 articles added from the expanded search. Our search did not reveal any relevant randomized clinical trials or cohort studies. We found that moist mask heating (65-80°C at 50-85% relative humidity for 20-30 min) and vaporous hydrogen peroxide treatment were supported by the literature to provide consistent viral decontamination without compromising mask seal and filtration efficiency. Other investigated decontamination methods lacked comprehensive scientific evidence for all three of these key criteria. CONCLUSIONS: N95 mask reprocessing using either moist heat or vaporous hydrogen peroxide is recommended to ensure healthcare worker safety.","Steinberg, Benjamin E; Aoyama, Kazuyoshi; McVey, Mark; Levin, David; Siddiqui, Asad; Munshey, Farrukh; Goldenberg, Neil M; Faraoni, David; Maynes, Jason T",Can. j. anaesth,381,12

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which is the first time that a pathogen's spread across the globe has been extensively monitored by direct detection of the pathogen itself rather just than the morbidity left in its wake, indicates such heterogeneity is not limited to outcomes of infections but whether infection of a particular host occurs at all. This suggests an important role for yet to be discovered environmental (i.e. non-genetic) factors that influence whether an exposure to the virus initiates a productive infection and, moreover, the severity of disease that results. This article discusses the emerging hypothesis that the composition of a host's commensal microbial communities, that is, its 'microbiome', may be one such determinant that influences outcomes following encounters with respiratory viral pathogens in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular. Specifically, we will review the rationales and evidence that supports this hypothesis and, moreover, speculate as to possible approaches to manipulate microbiota to ameliorate disease induced by respiratory viral pathogens.","Ngo, Vu L; Gewirtz, Andrew T",Curr Opin Virol,381,1

Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.","Fan, Deng-Ping; Zhou, Tao; Ji, Ge-Peng; Zhou, Yi; Chen, Geng; Fu, Huazhu; Shen, Jianbing; Shao, Ling",,381,27

DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of open-ended prompts included as part of an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey of pregnant women in the United States. SETTING: Online survey with participants from 47 states within the U.S. PARTICIPANTS: Self-identified pregnant women recruited through Facebook, Twitter, and other online sources. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: An anonymous, online survey of pregnant women (distributed April 3 - 24, 2020) included an open-ended prompt asking women to tell us how COVID-19 had affected their prenatal care. Open-ended narrative responses were downloaded into Excel and coded using the Attride-Sterling Framework. 2519 pregnant women from 47 states responded to the survey, 88.4% of whom had at least one previous birth. Mean age was 32.7 years, mean weeks pregnant was 24.3 weeks, and mean number of prenatal visits at the point of the survey was 6.5. Predominant themes of the open narratives included COVID-19's role in creating structural changes within the healthcare system (reported spontaneously by 2075 respondents), behavioral changes among both pregnant women and their providers (reported by 429 respondents), and emotional consequences for women who were pregnant (reported by 503 respondents) during the pandemic. Changes resulting from COVID-19 varied widely by provider, and women's perceptions of the impact on quality of care ranged from perceiving care as extremely compromised to perceiving it to be improved as a result of the pandemic. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Women who are pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic have faced enormous upheaval as hospitals and healthcare providers have struggled to meet the simultaneous and often competing demands of infection prevention, pandemic preparedness, high patient volumes of extremely sick patients, and the needs of 'non-urgent' pregnant patients. In some settings, women described very few changes, whereas others reported radical changes implemented seemingly overnight. While infection rates may drive variable responses, these inconsistencies raise important questions regarding the need for local, state, national, or even global recommendations for the care of pregnant women during a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","Javaid, Sarah; Barringer, Sarah; Compton, Sarah D; Kaselitz, Elizabeth; Muzik, Maria; Moyer, Cheryl A",Midwifery,381,1

In addition to providing essential medical services during the pandemic, telemedicine has the potential to expand health care access to underserved populations by eliminating traditional barriers to care such as transportation needs, distance from specialty providers, and approved time off from work. However, the literature regarding telehealth accessibility for low-income, non-English-speaking, and minority patients remains limited. Through a cross-sectional analysis comparing 2019 clinic visits with 2020 telehealth visits at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, we demonstrate specialty-specific changes in patient demographics, including a younger population, fewer non-English-speaking patients, and a relative preservation of minority, Medicaid, and Medicare patients among telehealth visits in comparison to clinic visits. We also demonstrate that nonsurgical specialties had significantly lower no-show rates and the greatest number of telehealth visits. Overall, our findings highlight the potential shortcomings of telemedicine in servicing non-English-speaking patients, while maintaining that it is an important tool with the potential to improve access to health care, particularly in nonprocedural specialties.","Franciosi, Ellen B; Tan, Alice J; Kassamali, Bina; Leonard, Nicholas; Zhou, Guohai; Krueger, Steven; Rashighi, Mehdi; LaChance, Avery",Telemed. j. e. health,381,16

Methods: This was a pilot retrospective cohort study of all ISBCS and DSBCS patients who underwent senior resident-performed cataract surgery from May to September 2020 at a single academic institution. Outcome measures were final corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), final manifest refraction (MRx), intraoperative and postoperative complications rates, total number of visits, and patient satisfaction assessed postoperatively by telephone questionnaire. Results: Twenty-two eyes of 14 patients and 56 eyes of 28 patients underwent senior resident-performed ISBCS and DSBCS, respectively. Final CDVA was 20/25 or better in 21 (95%) ISBCS and 51 (91%) DSBCS eyes (P = 0.670). Deviation of final MRx from target refraction was within 0.50 D in 17 (77%) ISBCS and 47 (84%) DSBCS eyes (P = 0.522). There was no significant difference in intraoperative (P = 1.000) or postoperative (P = 1.000) complications. ISBCS patients averaged 3.5 fewer visits than DSBCS patients (5.9 vs 9.5, P < 0.001). All ISBCS and 20 DSBCS patients (87%) reported they were ""very satisfied"" or ""satisfied"" with their experience (P = 0.701). Five of six senior residents responded that they preferred performing ISBCS over DSBCS. Conclusion: This early experience suggests that senior resident-performed ISBCS is as safe and effective as DSBCS, with the added benefit of averaging fewer in-person visits. Residency programs should consider offering senior resident-performed ISBCS to select patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Tiffany A; Chen, Stephanie P; Ahmad, Tessnim R; Pasricha, Neel D; Parikh, Neeti; Ramanathan, Saras",Indian J Ophthalmol,381,23

While D-dimer levels were close to the upper limit; fibrinogen levels were above the normal limit for each patient. Conclusion. The presence of hypercoagulation status in critical COVID-19 patients should be observed closely, and anticoagulation therapy can be considered in selected patients. More clinical data are needed to examine the role of anticoagulation in COVID-19 treatment.","Vartanoglu Aktokmakyan, Talar; Tokocin, Merve; Meric, Serhat; Celebi, Fatih",Surg Innov,381,1

Patencies of tibio-pedal arteries were documented pre-procedurally with palpation and/or ultrasound. With ultrasound guidance and micropuncture technique, a 5 French Glidesheath Slender (Terumo, USA) was placed and anti-spasmodic/anti-thrombotic medications were administered as previously reported for TR access. Hemostasis was achieved at embolization procedures’ end with a large TR band (Terumo, USA) reinforced with cloth tape. Proprietary catheters were used, though steam shaping of the base catheters was necessary for the initial cases. All 6 patients undergoing UAE for fibroids were discharged home the same day. Metrics evaluated were technical success, fluoroscopy time, clinical results and complications. Results: 8 of 9 UAEs were successfully performed via TP access;one patient required cross over to TF access for ipsilateral uterine artery catheterization. No clinically significant procedural complication occurred. Average fluoroscopy time was 38.3 minutes, though the last four cases performed with a proprietary cobra shaped catheter led to reduction of average fluoroscopy usage to 23.4 minutes. All patients with fibroids had either unchanged or palliated symptoms at short-term follow-up, and inpatients with acute bleeding were discharged shortly after the embolizations with cessation of hemorrhage. All patients expressed satisfaction with the vascular access, and access artery patency was objectively demonstrated from 5 hours post procedure to 6 weeks in clinic via either manual palpation or ultrasound in 6/8 patients;2 patients chose not to return to clinic during COVID-19 pandemic but were asymptomatic at phone follow-up;access arterial pulse could not be palpated in 2 asymptomatic patients at clinic follow-up (ultrasound was unavailable). Conclusions: The advantages of TP access mirror that of TR access, with few and mostly minor complications, and the risk of iatrogenic cerebral embolization is nil. Tibio-pedal arteries are a feasible alternative access for uterine artery embolization.","Smith, J.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,381,16

The rapid spread of COVID-19 has been predominantly driven by aerosol transmission, and scientific research supports the use of face masks to reduce transmission. However, a systematic and quantitative understanding of how face masks reduce disease transmission is still lacking. We used epidemic data from the Diamond Princess cruise ship to calibrate a transmission model in a high-risk setting and derive the reproductive number for the model. We explain how the terms in the reproductive number reflect the contributions of the different infectious states to the spread of the infection. We used that model to compare the infection spread within a homogeneously mixed population for different types of masks, the timing of mask policy, and compliance of wearing masks. Our results suggest substantial reductions in epidemic size and mortality rate provided by at least 75% of people wearing masks (robust for different mask types). We also evaluated the timing of the mask implementation. We illustrate how ample compliance with moderate-quality masks at the start of an epidemic attained similar mortality reductions to less compliance and the use of high-quality masks after the epidemic took off. We observed that a critical mass of 84% of the population wearing masks can completely stop the spread of the disease. These results highlight the significance of a large fraction of the population needing to wear face masks to effectively reduce the spread of the epidemic. The simulations show that early implementation of mask policy using moderate-quality masks is more effective than a later implementation with high-quality masks. These findings may inform public health mask-use policies for an infectious respiratory disease outbreak (such as one of COVID-19) in high-risk settings.","Morciglio, Anthony Zhang Bin Chowell Gerardo Hyman James M.; Jiang, Yi",Epidemiologia,381,24

While commendable, justifiable, and compassionate, EA programs are not designed to collect the necessary vital clinical data that can be later used in the New Drug Application process before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In particular, they lack the necessary rigor of properly crafted and controlled randomized controlled trials (RCT) which ensure that each patient closely monitored for side effects and other potential dangers associated with the drug, that the data is documented, stable and are traceable and that the patient population is well defined with the defined target condition. Overall, while RCTs is deemed to be of the most reliable methodologies within evidence-based medicine, morally, however, they are problematic in EA programs. Nevertheless, actionable data ought to be collected from EA patients. To this end, we look to the growing incorporation of real-world data real-world evidence as increasingly useful substitutes for data collected via RCTs, including the ethical, legal and social implications thereof.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients diagnosed with AP in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, COVID-AP) during the COVID outbreak. We formed two control groups: COVID patients without AP (COVID-non-AP) and non-COVID patients with AP (non-COVID-AP). Unadjusted comparisons between cases and controls were performed regarding 59 baseline and clinical characteristics and 4 outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 54 AP in 74,814 patients with COVID-19 attending the ED (frequency=0.72, 95%CI=0.54-0.94). This frequency was lower than in non-COVID patients (2,231/1,388,879, 1.61, 95%CI=1.54-1.67; OR=0.44, 95%CI=0.34-0.58). Etiology of AP was similar in both groups, being biliary origin in about 50%. Twenty-six clinical characteristics of COVID patients were associated with a higher risk of developing AP: abdominal pain (OR=59.4, 95%CI=23.7-149), raised blood amylase (OR=31.8; 95%CI=1.60-632) and vomiting (OR=15.8, 95%CI=6.69-37.2) being the strongest, and some inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, platelets, D-dimer) were more increased. Compared to non-COVID-AP, COVID-AP patients differed in 23 variables; the strongest ones related to COVID symptoms, but less abdominal pain was reported, pancreatic enzymes raise was lower, and severity (estimated by BISAP and SOFA score at ED arrival) was higher. The in-hospital mortality (adjusted for age and sex) of COVID-AP did not differ from COVID-non-AP (OR=1.12, 95%CI=0.45-245) but was higher than non-COVID-AP (OR=2.46, 95%CI=1.35-4.48). CONCLUSIONS: Acute pancreatitis as presenting form of COVID-19 in the ED is unusual (<1 cases). Some clinically distinctive characteristics are present compared to the remaining COVID patients and can help to identify this unusual manifestation. In-hospital mortality of COVID-AP does not differ from COVID-non-AP but is higher than non-COVID-AP, and the higher severity of AP in COVID patients could partially contribute to this increment.","Miró, Òscar; Llorens, Pere; Jiménez, Sònia; Piñera, Pascual; Burillo-Putze, Guillermo; Martín, Alfonso; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; Lambereche, Jorge; Alquézar-Arbé, Aitor; Jacob, Javier; Noceda, José; Cano, María José Cano; Fortuny Bayarri, María José; Marín Porrino, Juan Miguel; Meléndez, Napoleón; Pérez García, Carles; Brasó Aznar, José Vicente; Ponce, María Carmen; Díaz Fernández, Elena; Ejarque Martínez, Laura; Peiró Gómez, Ana; Tost, Josep; Domínguez, María Jesús; Teigell Muñoz, Francisco Javier; González Del Castillo, Juan",J. hepato-biliary-pancreat. sci.

In addressing emergencies or special cases, each medical institution in a metropolitan area typically has a siloed process for capturing emergency patient records. These approaches vary in technical capabilities and may include use of an electronic medical record system (EMR) or a hybrid paper/EMR process. Given the projected volume of patients for the COVID-19 pandemic and the proposed multi-institutional team approach needed in case of significant provider illness, IEMS sought a simple, efficient, consolidated EMR solution to support planning for the potential capacity gap. IEMS approached Regenstrief Institute (RI), an established partner with experience in supporting OpenMRS, a global good EMR platform that had been deployed in multiple settings globally. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project was to determine if OpenMRS, a global good, could be used to quickly stand up a system that would meet the needs for health emergency data collection and reporting. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION METHODS: The team used an ""all hands on deck"" approach, bringing together technical and subject matter experts, and a human-centered and iterative process to ensure the system met the key needs of IEMS. The OpenMRS Reference Application was adapted to the specific need and deployed as Docker containers to servers within the Indiana Health Information Exchange. PROJECT OUTCOMES AND LESSONS LEARNED: In less than two weeks, the Regenstrief team was able to install, configure and set up a working version of OpenMRS to support the desired electronic record requirements for the IEMS disaster field clinics. Using a human-centered approach, the RI team developed, tested, and released a user-friendly, installation-ready solution complete with an end user manual and a base support plan. IEMS and RI are sharing this approach to demonstrate how a global good can quickly generate a solution for COVID-19 and other disaster responses. CONCLUSIONS: Open source global goods can rapidly be adapted to meet local needs in an emergency. OpenMRS can be adapted to meet the needs of basic emergency medical services registration, triage, and basic data collection.","Mamlin, Burke W; Shivers, Jennifer E; Glober, Nancy K; Dick, Jonathan J",Int J Med Inform,381,17

During March 6-July 11, MDH and 1,217 partnering health care facilities assessed 21,406 HCP exposures; among these, 5,374 (25%) were classified as higher-risk§ (3). Higher-risk exposures involved direct patient care (66%) and nonpatient care interactions (e.g., with coworkers and social and household contacts) (34%). Within 14 days following a higher-risk exposure, nearly one third (31%) of HCP who were enrolled in monitoring reported COVID-19-like symptoms,¶ and more than one half (52%) of enrolled HCP with symptoms received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. Among all HCP with higher-risk exposures, irrespective of monitoring enrollment, 7% received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. Compared with HCP with higher-risk exposures working in acute care settings, those working in congregate living or long-term care settings more often returned to work (57%), worked while symptomatic (5%), and received a positive test result (10%) during 14-day postexposure monitoring than did HCP working outside of such settings. These data highlight the need for awareness of nonpatient care SARS-CoV-2 exposure risks and for targeted interventions to protect HCP, in addition to residents, in congregate living and long-term care settings. To minimize exposure risk among HCP, health care facilities need improved infection prevention and control, consistent personal protective equipment (PPE) availability and use, flexible sick leave, and SARS-CoV-2 testing access. All health care organizations and HCP should be aware of potential exposure risk from coworkers, household members, and social contacts.","Fell, Ashley; Beaudoin, Amanda; D039,; Heilly, Paige; Mumm, Erica; Cole, Cory; Tourdot, Laura; Ruhland, Abbey; Klumb, Carrie; Rounds, Josh; Bailey, Brittney; Liverseed, Gina; Peterson, Molly; Mahoehney, J P; Ireland, Malia; Bye, Maria; Setty, Sudha; Leeds, Maureen; Taylor, Joanne; Holzbauer, Stacy",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,381,24

The role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently received much more attention due to the spread of the virus and its pandemic potential. Cytokine storm is among the most critical pathological events in patients affected with coronaviruses (CoVs), i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and COVID-19, causing inflammation-induced lung injury and also occurring as a result of dysregulation of immune responses to the mentioned viruses. IL-6, along with some other inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 beta (ß), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), as well as inflammatory chemokines, can significantly contribute to, fever, lymphopenia, coagulation, lung injury, and multi-organ failure (MOF). Therefore, researchers are to explore novel approaches to treat the disease through targeting of IL-6 and its receptors based on prior experience of other disorders. In this review article, the latest findings on the role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, as well as therapeutic perspectives, were summarized and discussed.","Abbasifard, Mitra; Khorramdelazad, Hossein",Life Sci,381,1

In an effort to quantify these changes, Google released an open-source dataset pertaining to regional mobility trends—including park visitation trends. Changes in park visitation are calculated from an earlier baseline period for measurement. Park visitation is robustly linked to positive wellbeing indicators across the lifespan, and has been shown to support wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this dataset offers vast application potential, containing aggregated information from location data collected via smartphones worldwide. However, empirical analysis of these data is limited. Namely, the factors influencing reported changes in mobility and the degree to which these changes can be directly attributable to COVID-19 remain unknown. This study aims to address these gaps in our understanding of the changes in park visitation, the causes of these changes (e.g., safer-at-home orders, amount of COVID-19 cases per county, climate, etc.) and possible impacts to wellbeing by constructing and testing a spatial regression model. Results suggest that elevation and latitude serve as primary influences of reported changes in park visitation from the baseline period. Therefore, it is surmised that Google's reported changes in park-related mobility are only partially the function of COVID-19.","Rice, William L.; Pan, Bing","Wellbeing, Space and Society",381,14

METHODS: In this prospective case series, nasopharyngeal and tear sampling of 43 patients with severe COVID-19 were performed. The quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2. Ocular and systemic signs and symptoms were recorded from their medical history. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 56 ± 13 years. The average disease time from initiation of symptoms was 3.27 days, range: 1-7 days. Forty-one patients (95.3%) had fever at the time of sampling. Only one patient had conjunctivitis. Thirty (69.8%) nasopharyngeal and three (7%) tear samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The result of tear sample was positive in the patient with conjunctivitis. All patients with positive tear RT-PCR results had positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results. CONCLUSIONS: Ocular manifestation was rare in this series of severe COVID-19 patients, however, 7% of the patients had viral RNA in their conjunctival secretions.

OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the 6-month respiratory outcomes and exercise capacity of COVID-19 acute respiratory failure (ARF) patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during the first wave of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: retrospective observational study. PATIENTS: COVID-19 patients with ARF. INTERVENTIONS: CPAP during hospitalization and 6-month follow-up. MAIN MEASURES: frailty assessment through frailty index (FI), pO2/FiO2 during hospitalization and at follow-up, respiratory parameters, 6-min walking test (6MWT) and the modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) and Borg scale at follow-up. KEY RESULTS: more than half of the patients had no dyspnoea according to the mMRC scale. Lower in-hospital pO2/FiO2 correlated with higher BORG scale levels after 6MWT (&#961; 0.27; p 0.04) at follow up visit. FI was positively correlated with length of hospitalization (&#961; 0.3; p 0.03) and negatively with the 6MWT walked distance (&#961; -0.36; p 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: robust and frail patients with COVID-19 ARF treated with NIV outside the intensive care unit setting had good respiratory parameters and exercise capacity at 6-month follow-up, although more severe patients had slightly poorer respiratory performance compared to patients with higher PaO2/FiO2 and lower FI.

Although kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have higher mortality than the general population, data on their risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are unknown. Subject of Review: A recent single-center screening study from the UK (Transplantation. 2021 Jan 1;105(1):151-7) showed that 89 (10.4%) of 855 consecutive kidney transplant recipients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Risk factors for infection included a nonwhite background, diabetes, and a history of allograft rejection. Risk factors for mortality in individuals who developed COVID-19 were older age and receiving steroids. Second Opinion: This study shows that the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney transplant recipients is similar to the one observed in the general population in the same area (13%), indicating that transplant recipients are not at increased risk of COVID-19. However, the investigators raise the interesting point that since transplant individuals were advised to shelter earlier than the general population, they may be in fact more susceptible. This statement is hard to substantiate, but the identification of specific risk factors for infection and poor outcomes is crucial to tailor strategies to prevent spread of the infection. This is particularly important, considering that kidney transplant recipients may be at increased risk of prolonged viral spread and in-host viral mutations, making them not just a particularly fragile population for COVID-19 but also a potentially major source of further contagions.","Riella, Leonardo V; Azzi, Jamil R; Cravedi, Paolo",Nephron,381,6

While the therapeutic doses of raxibacumab, a monoclonal antibody for the prophylaxis and treatment of inhalational anthrax, have been based on pharmacokinetic data from adult subjects, its disposition in children has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Here we evaluate the effect of demographic covariates on the pharmacokinetic disposition of raxibacumab and explore opportunities for the optimization of the paediatric doses. METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic model was used as basis for the extrapolation of raxibacumab disposition from adults to children. Different extrapolation scenarios, including weight-banded dosing regimens, were considered to assess the effect of growth and maturation processes on the pharmacokinetic parameters of interest. AUC, Cmax , and the time of serum raxibacumab concentrations greater than or equimolar to the highest serum protective antigen concentrations observed for at least 28 days in any monkey challenged with Bacillus anthracis that died were derived and compared with the currently approved US doses. RESULTS: Based on practical considerations, a weight-banded dosing regimen consisting of four dose levels (75 mg/kg for individuals &#8804; 1.5 kg, 55 mg/kg for individuals < 10 kg, 45 mg/kg for individuals < 50 kg, 40 mg/kg for all individuals > 50 kg) was necessary to optimize target exposure across the paediatric population. CONCLUSION: Age-related maturation processes may affect raxibacumab clearance in young patients. The proposed dosing regimens take into account effects of body weight and maturation processes on the elimination of raxibacumab.","Oosterholt, Sean P; Della Pasqua, Oscar",,381,25

We used a combination of contact tracing and genomic epidemiology to trace the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the state up until May 21, 2020 (1578 cases). We obtained 91 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 which clustered into seven lineages (Pangolin lineages-A, B, B.1, B.1.80, B.1.1, B.4, and B.6). The lineages in Karnataka were known to be circulating in China, Southeast Asia, Iran, Europe and other parts of India and are likely to have been imported into the state both by international and domestic travel. Our sequences grouped into 17 contact clusters and 24 cases with no known contacts. We found 14 of the 17 contact clusters had a single lineage of the virus, consistent with multiple introductions and most (12/17) were contained within a single district, reflecting local spread. In most of the 17 clusters, the index case (12/17) and spreaders (11/17) were symptomatic. Of the 91 sequences, 47 belonged to the B.6 lineage, including eleven of 24 cases with no known contact, indicating ongoing transmission of this lineage in the state. Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka suggests multiple introductions of the virus followed by local transmission in parallel with ongoing viral evolution.

The NO3-N concentration was relatively high (300â¯mgâ¯L-1). For FS-2, the main difference with FS-1 was a lower nitrate concentration (18â¯mgâ¯L-1). The recipes were added consecutively, together with the WW, to an AGS reactor. In the case of FS-1, the system was fed with 7.2â¯kg total COD m-3d-1 and 0.5â¯kg Nitrogen m-3d-1. Undesired denitrification occurred during feeding and settling resulting in floating sludge and wash-out. In the case of FS-2, the system was fed with 8.0â¯kg total COD m-3d-1 and 0.3â¯kg Nitrogen m-3d-1. The lower NO3-N concentration in FS-2 resulted in less floating sludge, a more stabilised granular bed and better effluent concentrations. To enhance the hydrolysis of the slowly biodegradable particulates from the synthetic FS, an anaerobic stand-by period was added and the aeration period was increased. Overall, when compared to a control AGS reactor, a lower COD consumption (from 87 to 35â¯mgâ¯g-1 VSS h-1), P-uptake rates (from 6.0 to 2.0â¯mg P g VSS-1â¯h-1) and NH4-N removal (from 2.5 to 1.4â¯mg NH4-Nâ¯g VSS-1â¯h-1) were registered after introducing the synthetic FS. Approximately 40% of the granular bed became flocculent at the end of the study, and a reduction of the granular size accompanied by higher solids accumulation in the reactor was observed. A considerable protozoa Vorticella spp. bloom attached to the granules and the accumulated particles occurred; potentially contributing to the removal of the suspended solids which were part of the FS recipe.","Barrios-Hernández, Mary Luz; Buenaño-Vargas, Claribel; García, Hector; Brdjanovic, Damir; van Loosdrecht, Mark C M; Hooijmans, Christine M",Sci Total Environ,381,16

METHODS: We reviewed the best available evidence and estimated the annualized risk (p=das(1-1-p0p1(1-e)yn) for a DHP during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the following basic parameters: p0, the prevalence of asymptomatic patients in the local population; p1, the probability that a DHP gets infected by an asymptomatic patient; e, the effectiveness of the PPE; s, the probability of becoming symptomatic after getting infected from asymptomatic patient; da, the probability of dying from the disease in age group a; n, number of patients seen per day; and y, number of days worked per year. RESULTS: With the assumption that DHPs work fulltime and wear a N95 mask, the annualized probability for a DHP to acquire COVID-19 infection in a dental office, become symptomatic, and die from the infection is estimated at 1:13,000 (0.008 %) in a medium sized city in the US at the peak of the pandemic. The risk estimate is highly age-dependent. Risk to DHPs under the age of 70 is negligible when prevalence of asymptomatic cases is low in the local community. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of COVID-19 transmission in dental office is very low based on available evidence on effectiveness of PPE and prevalence of asymptomatic patients. Face shields and pre-procedure oral rinses may further reduce the risks. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: DHPs should follow guidelines on pre-appointment protocols and on PPE use during dental treatments to keep the risk low.","Ren, Yanfang; Feng, Changyong; Rasubala, Linda; Malmstrom, Hans; Eliav, Eli",J Dent,381,24

Caring for patients during an epidemic/pandemic may impact negatively on the mental health of HCPs. There is a lack of evidence-based advice on what would be effective in mitigating this impact. OBJECTIVES This rapid review synthesizes the evidence on the psychological impact of pandemics/epidemics on the mental health of HCPs, what factors predict this impact, and the evidence of prevention/intervention strategies to reduce this impact. METHOD According to rapid review guidelines, systematic searches were carried out in Embase.com , PubMed, APA PsycINFO-Ovid SP, and Web of Science (core collection). Searches were restricted to the years 2003 or later to ensure inclusion of the most recent epidemic/pandemics, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Papers written in French or English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and of quantitative design using validated measures of mental health outcomes were included. Of 1308 papers found, 50 were included. The full protocol for this rapid review was registered with Prospero (reg.no. CRD42020175985). RESULTS Results show that exposed HCPs working with patients during an epidemic/pandemic are at heightened risk of mental health problems in the short and longer term, particularly: psychological distress, insomnia, alcohol/drug misuse, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, burnout, anger, and higher perceived stress. These mental health problems are predicted by organizational, social, personal, and psychological factors and may interfere with the quality of patient care. Few evidence-based early interventions exist so far. DISCUSSION HCPs need to be provided with psychosocial support to protect their mental wellbeing if they are to continue to provide high quality patient care. Several recommendations relevant during and after an epidemic/pandemic, such as COVID-19, and in preparation for a future outbreak, are proposed.","Stuijfzand, Suzannah; Deforges, Camille; Sandoz, Vania; Sajin, Consuela-Thais; Jaques, Cecile; Elmers, Jolanda; Horsch, Antje",BMC public health,381,24

Spike (S) glycoprotein is the structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 located on the envelope surface, involve in interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a cell surface receptor, followed by entry into the host cell. Thereby, blocking the S glycoprotein through potential inhibitor may interfere its interaction with ACE2 and impede its entry into the host cell. Here, we present a truncated version of human ACE2 (tACE2), comprising the N terminus region of the intact ACE2 from amino acid position 21-119, involved in binding with receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed the in-silico potential of tACE2 to compete with intact ACE2 for binding with RBD. The protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic simulation showed that tACE2 has higher binding affinity for RBD and form more stabilized complex with RBD than the intact ACE2. Furthermore, prediction of tACE2 soluble expression in E. coli makes it a suitable candidate to be targeted for Covid-19 therapeutics. This is the first MD simulation based findings to provide a high affinity protein inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, an important target for drug designing against this unprecedented challenge.

Most importantly, schools at all levels and Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) have been completely shut down since March 26, 2020 that directly obliged stakeholders (Ministry of Education, institutes authorities, parents and other relevant bodies) to adopt online education. Due to having very less experience, in many cases no experience at all, of conducting teaching and learning wholly online by HEIs of Bangladesh, myriad challenges have been encountered by teachers and students. In order to find out a viable technique for dealing with these challenges, this paper addresses two research questions: What are the available open Source technologies that could be used as an alternative of paid LMS system for any developing countries during this COVID-19 pandemic? and Is exiting flipped classroom technique suitable for continuing teaching and learning during COVID-19 pandemic? In an effort to solve the above mentioned questions, a case study method was adopted. The findings of this study propose a pathway (framework) through which the HEIs of developing countries will be able to continue teaching and learning without investing money and organizing training during this COVID-19 pandemic and similar other emergency situations. This strategy provides a simple but reliable emergency means which is based on flipped classroom theory. The HEIs of Bangladesh particularly, and other developing countries generally will be benefited from this proposed framework while they do not have established means to carry their teaching and learning. This paper lastly addresses a few limitations of this framework and provides guidelines to the policymakers on how to incorporate it into the HEIs during this emergency context.","Khan, Md.

This paper responds to the under-addressed problem for HEI managers of understanding the varying levels of risk of harm to students and HEIs, and the HEIs’ strategic responsibilities to understand how to mitigate the risk for both parties. We develop a typology of the main types of internship placements and theorise their associated levels of risk according to the HEI’s levels of responsibility and operational control. The risk types are then plotted in a model of risk mitigation, mapped against the frequency of their occurrence and the severity of their impact, with a focus on HEIs and students. We conclude with practical and policy implications for HEIs and their managers. Our paper argues that HEIs must balance their risks and responsibilities with the costs and benefits of student internships and work placements, and contributes to understanding potential gaps between HEI strategic decision-making and operational practice at the programme level, along with solutions to address these.","Odlin, Denis; Benson-Rea, Maureen; Sullivan-Taylor, Bridgette",High Educ (Dordr),381,13

The goal was to evaluate the impact of different types of COVID-19 stressors (infection fears, lockdown, and economic stressors) on mental health and cognitive functioning. We used a sample of 262 Turkish adults. We administered an online questionnaire that included measures of COVID-19 traumatic stressors, PTSD, depression, anxiety, executive function deficits, and cumulative stressors and traumas (CST). The analyses included correlations, hierarchical regression, path analysis, and PROCESS mediation analysis. All COVID-19 traumatic stressors types and their cumulative load predicted PTSD, depression, anxiety, and executive function deficits after controlling for previous cumulative stressors and traumas and COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 lockdown’s stressors were the strongest predictors, compared to COVID-19 fears and economic stressors. Path analysis and PROCESS mediation results indicated that COVID-19 traumatic stressors had direct effects on working memory deficits, direct and indirect effects on PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and indirect effects on inhibition deficits. Anxiety, depression, and inhibition deficits mediated its indirect effects on PTSD. The results have conceptual and clinical implications. COVID-19 continuous posttraumatic stress syndrome that includes comorbid PTSD, depression, anxiety, and executive function deficits is different and does not fit within the current trauma frameworks. There is a need for a paradigm shift in current stress and trauma frameworks to account for the COVID-19 continuous global stressors and for clinical innovations in intervention to help its victims.

H(2)S fate and emissions from extended aeration activated sludge (EAAS) system in Muharram Aisha-sewage treatment plant (MA-STP) were studied using TOXCHEM model. Sensitivity analysis at different aeration flowrate, H(2)S loading rate, wastewater pH, wastewater temperature and wind speed were studied. The predicted data were validated against actual results, where all the data were validated within the limits, and the statistical evaluation of normalized mean square error (NMSE), geometric variance (VG), and correlation coefficient (R) were close to the ideal fit. The results showed that the major processes occurring in the system were degradation and emission.

The first part of the paper describes the situation in Roma settlements from the perspective of unequal access to sewerage and water pipelines. Introduced here are data on identified contagious diseases that correlated multiple health risks with the lack of sanitation and/or water infrastructure. The second section of the paper put forth typologies of government approaches towards the Roma, which based on ethnographic fieldwork, allows us to identify factors of attitudinal, structural and policy-oriented nature. Research results point to a “triad” of key circumstances: these are the structural conditions in municipalities and the history of local inter-ethnic relations and attitude of authorities towards Roma. Finally, possible solutions and approaches regarding how to mitigate the multiple health risks are discussed. It is suggested that on the one hand, in many villages there is a profound institutional discrimination of Roma with respect to water and sanitation infrastructure; on the other hand, water services are increasingly becoming an expensive commodity that not everyone can afford. The article concludes with discussion on enabling conditions and ways to ensure access to basic infrastructure in rural Roma communities. The solution is not only a compliance with principles of non-discrimination and existing technical norms and standards but also in securing the accessible funding for construction of the sanitation infrastructure in a smart way, including innovations and operation of cheaper and environmentally responsible sanitation technologies.","Filčák, Richard; Škobla, Daniel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,381,24

Patients with more severe symptoms may require intensive care treatments and face a high mortality risk. Also, thrombotic complications such as pulmonary embolisms and disseminated intravascular coagulation are frequent in these patients. Indeed, COVID-19 is characterized by an abnormal inflammatory response resembling a cytokine storm, which is associated to endothelial dysfunction and microvascular complications. To date, no specific treatments are available for COVID-19 and its life-threatening complication. Immunomodulatory drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine and interleukin-6 inhibitors, as well as antithrombotic drugs such as heparin and low molecular weight heparin, are currently being administered with some benefit. Ozone therapy consists in the administration of a mixture of ozone and oxygen, called medical ozone, which has been used for over a century as an unconventional medicine practice for several diseases. Medical ozone rationale in COVID-19 is the possibility of contrasting endothelial dysfunction, modulating the immune response and acting as a virustatic agent. Thus, medical ozone could help to decrease lung inflammation, slow down viral growth, regulate lung circulation and oxygenation and prevent microvascular thrombosis. Ozone-therapy could be considered a feasible, cost-effective and easy to administer adjuvant therapy while waiting for the synthesis of a therapy or the development of the vaccine.","Ranaldi, Giovanni Tommaso; Villani, Emanuele Rocco; Franza, Laura",Med Gas Res,381,30

Two closely related innate immunity genes, CD209 and CD209L, are particularly interesting because they directly recognize a plethora of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Both genes, which result from an ancient duplication, possess a neck region, made up of seven repeats of 23 amino acids each, known to play a major role in the pathogen-binding properties of these proteins. To explore the extent to which pathogens have exerted selective pressures on these innate immunity genes, we resequenced them in a group of samples from sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and East Asia. Moreover, variation in the number of repeats of the neck region was defined in the entire Human Genome Diversity Panel for both genes. Our results, which are based on diversity levels, neutrality tests, population genetic distances, and neck-region length variation, provide genetic evidence that CD209 has been under a strong selective constraint that prevents accumulation of any amino acid changes, whereas CD209L variability has most likely been shaped by the action of balancing selection in non-African populations. In addition, our data point to the neck region as the functional target of such selective pressures: CD209 presents a constant size in the neck region populationwide, whereas CD209L presents an excess of length variation, particularly in non-African populations. An additional interesting observation came from the coalescent-based CD209 gene tree, whose binary topology and time depth (∼2.8 million years ago) are compatible with an ancestral population structure in Africa. Altogether, our study has revealed that even a short segment of the human genome can uncover an extraordinarily complex evolutionary history, including different pathogen pressures on host genes as well as traces of admixture among archaic hominid populations.","Barreiro, Luis B.; Patin, Etienne; Neyrolles, Olivier; Cann, Howard M.; Gicquel, Brigitte; Quintana-Murci, Lluís",American journal of human genetics,381,7

It is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, a disease that can have mortality rates as high as 100% in suckling piglets. PEDV causes severe economic loss, and has been in existence for decades. A panzootic starting in 2010 renewed interest in the development of a universal vaccine toward PEDV. This report details several design changes made to a Hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg)-based recombinant vaccine strategy, and their effect in vivo. Initially, several multi-antigen vaccine candidates were able to elicit antibodies specific to three out of four B-cell epitopes inserted into the chimeric proteins. However, a lack of virus neutralization led to a redesign of the vaccines. The focus of the newly redesigned vaccines was to elicit a strong immune response to the YSNIGVCK amino acid motif from PEDV. Genetically modified new vaccine candidates were able to elicit a strong antibody (Ab) response to the YSNIGVCK epitope, which correlated with an increased ability to neutralize the CO strain of PEDV. Additionally, the location of the inserted PEDV epitopes within the vector protein was shown to affect the immune recognition toward the native HBcAg during vaccination.","Gillam, Frank; Zhang, Chenming",Vaccine,381,24

CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of Critical Illness-associated Cerebral Microbleeds in the context of Covid-19. Knowledge of Covid-19 is still partial and acute neurological complications should be explored systematically. In our case, EEG helped to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus, but revealed focal dysfunction, justifying further investigations. EEG plays a crucial role in these patients, allowing investigating the presence of focal or diffuse cerebral dysfunction. This is particularly helpful for Covid-19 patients in the ICU, where the neurological examination is challenging by the severity of the respiratory illness.","De Stefano, Pia; Nencha, Umberto; De Stefano, Ludovico; Mégevand, Pierre; Seeck, Margitta",Clin Neurophysiol Pract,381,1

Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on HCC patients who received sorafenib in British Columbia from 2008 to 2016. Patients were grouped by Statistics Canada population center (PC) size criteria: large PC (LPC), medium PC (MPC), and small PC (SPC). Access to specialists, receipt of liver-directed therapies, and survival outcomes were compared between the groups. Results: Of 286 patients, the geographical distribution was: LPC: 75%; MPC: 16%; and SPC: 9%.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional, multicentre study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Medical staff of 60 hospitals were selected from 145 designated medical institutions located in the epidemic area where the patients with COVID-19 were treated in China. RESULTS: In total, 1761 respondents wore N95 respirators (use alone 20.8%; combination use 79.2%), and the prevalence of DRPI was 59.2% (95% CI 56.93 to 61.53). A daily wearing time of >4 hours (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.35), wearing a N95 respirator in combination with goggles both with the presence of sweating (OR 13.40, 95% CI 7.34 to 23.16) and without the presence of sweating (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.14) and wearing only a N95 respirator with the presence of sweating (OR 9.60, 95% CI 7.00 to 13.16) were associated with DRPI. A correspondence analysis indicated that if there was no sweating, regardless of whether the N95 respirator was worn by itself or in combination with goggles, single-site DRPI mainly occurred on the nose bridge, cheek and auricle. If there was sweating present, regardless of whether the N95 was worn by itself or in combination with goggles, multiple DRPI sites occurred more often on the face. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of DRPI among medical staff caused by N95 respirators was very high, which was mainly associated with a longer daily wearing time and interaction with sweating. The nasal bridge, cheeks and auricles were the primary protection locations found.","Jiang, Qixia; Liu, Yuxiu; Song, Siping; Wei, Wei; Bai, Yuxuan",BMJ Open,381,20

Authors' reply,17.726074,7.158563,2021-07-30,"[Image: see text] SLOCK (sensor for circadian clock) is an electrochemical sweat-based biosensing platform designed for the diagnosis and management of circadian abnormalities. Previously, the SLOCK platform was designed to detect adrenal steroids, cortisol, and DHEA for tracking the circadian rhythm. This work aims at tuning this SLOCK platform toward the detection of the cytokine, interleukin-31, for building a noninvasive, chronic disease diagnostics and management platform. This research provides a detailed characterization of the sensing surface and immunochemistry. The results show that SLOCK has good sensitivity to IL-31 concentrations in synthetic and human sweat. The limit of detection is 50 and 100 pg/mL for synthetic and human sweat, respectively. The dynamic range of the system is 50–1000 pg/mL, which encompasses the physiological ranges of 150–620 pg/mL. This is the first demonstration of sweat-based, label-free, electrochemical detection of IL-31. In addition to this, the data show good correlation (R(2) > 0.95) for the signal sensitivity to biomarker concentration. Finally, cross-reactivity studies highlight the specificity of SLOCK even in the presence of highly cross-reactive species. Thus, this novel SLOCK biosensor can be successfully used to track IL-31 in a sensitive and noninvasive manner and could be used to identify chronic pathophysiologies present in the body.","Upasham, Sayali; Prasad, Shalini",ACS Omega,381,24

In addition to Ca(2+) signaling, STIM1 is also involved in regulation of a cytosolic nucleic acid sensing pathway. Using ORAI1 and STIM1 knockout cells, we examined their contribution to the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. STIM1 knockout cells showed strong resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to enhanced type I interferon response. On the contrary, ORAI1 knockout cells showed high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection as judged by increased expression of viral proteins and a high viral load. Mechanistically, ORAI1 knockout cells showed reduced homeostatic cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration and severe impairment in tonic interferon signaling. Transcriptome analysis showed downregulation of multiple cellular defense mechanisms, including antiviral signaling pathways in ORAI1 knockout cells, which are likely due to reduced expression of the Ca(2+)-dependent transcription factors of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family and MEF2C. Our results identify a novel role of ORAI1-mediated Ca(2+) signaling in regulating the baseline type I interferon level, which is a determinant of host resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wu, Beibei; Ramaiah, Arunachalam; Garcia, Gustavo; Gwack, Yousang; Arumugaswami, Vaithilingaraja; Srikanth, Sonal",bioRxiv,381,20

Rapid diagnostics is required for clinical decision making regarding isolation of patients and appropriate therapy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of the Panther Fusion® respiratory panel using published laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays (LDT). STUDY DESIGN: Analytical sensitivity of Panther Fusion® Flu A/B/RSV was assessed by testing dilutions of cell culture isolates. Clinical performance assessment included the complete Panther Fusion® respiratory panel (Flu-A/B/RSV, PIV 1-4 and AdV/hMPV/RV) and consisted of a retrospective and a prospective study-arm. The retrospective evaluation included 201, stored (−80 °C) samples collected between February 2006 and January 2017. Prospective evaluation was performed on 1045 unselected pretreated respiratory tract samples from patients presented to our hospital between November 2017 and May 2018. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity was generally slightly lower for the Panther Fusion® assays. Clinical specificity and sensitivity was between 96 %–100 % and 71.9 %–100 %, respectively. Discrepant results were found in 146 samples of which 88 samples tested LDT positive / Panther Fusion® negative and 58 samples were LDT negative / Panther Fusion® positive. A total of ten discrepant samples with Ct-values <30 were sequenced to confirm the presence of 7 RV-C not-detected by LDT and 1 RV-A and 2 ADV-2 not detected by Panther Fusion®. CONCLUSIONS: The Panther Fusion® provides a random-access system with continuous loading and much shorter sample-to-answer times compared to LDT, albeit with a slightly less clinical sensitivity compared to the LDT.","Voermans, Jolanda J.C.; Mulders, Daphne G.J.C.; Pas, Suzan D.; Koopmans, Marion P.G.; van der Eijk, Annemiek A.; Molenkamp, Richard",J Clin Virol,381,1

A subset of patients suffer serious consequences that require hospitalization and ventilator support. Current tests for SARS-CoV-2 generate qualitative results and are vital to make a diagnosis of the infection. However, they are not helpful to follow changes in viral loads after diagnosis. The ability to quantitatively assess viral levels is necessary to determine the effectiveness of therapy with anti-viral or immune agents. Viral load analysis is also necessary to determine the replicative potential of strains with different mutations, emergence of resistance to anti-viral agents and the stability of viral nucleic acid and degree of RT-PCR inhibition in different types of collection media. Quantitative viral load analysis in body fluids, plasma and tissue may be helpful to determine the effects of the infection in various organ systems. To address these needs, we developed two assays to quantitate SARS-CoV-2. The assays target either the S or E genes in the virus, produce comparable viral load results, are highly sensitive and specific and have a wide range of quantitation. We believe that these assays will be helpful to manage the clinical course of infected patients and may also help to better understand the biology of infection with SARS-CoV-2.","Bland, Joshua; Kavanaugh, Ashley; Hong, Lenny K.; Kadkol, Shrihari S.",J Virol Methods,381,16

Mobile apps are gaining popularity particularly in educational and interventional settings owing to their perceived advantages including support for and engagement of individuals with reading difficulties. In the context of COVID-19, the need for technology-based tools has increased. For practitioners and educators who wish to use apps in their practice or recommend apps to individuals with reading difficulties, it is challenging to identify high-quality apps in app stores. OBJECTIVE: This protocol describes a systematic search, selection, and appraisal process for tablet apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness skills. This protocol aimed to (1) provide a systematic method for identifying tablet apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness skills in the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store and (2) describe an evidence-based approach for quality appraisal of these apps by using structured tools. METHODS: This protocol describes an evidence-based method guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework to systematically search, select, and appraise apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness skills, present in Google Play and the App Store. We intend to perform a systematic and comprehensive search and a 2-step process for screening: (1) broad screening (app titles) and (2) narrow screening (marketing descriptions). Quality appraisal of the included apps will involve two structured appraisal tools: (1) the Mobile Application Rating Scale and (2) the Appraising Apps for Reading Checklist. RESULTS: This method will help determine the number of apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness, present on the Android and iOS platforms. The content, quality, and usability of these apps will be determined using structured appraisal tools. We have planned to conduct searches on Google Play and the App Store in January-March 2021; broad and focused screening, from April 2021; and data extraction and quality appraisal in October 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol provides a basis for locating and evaluating apps targeting phonics knowledge and phonological awareness skills.

On May 10, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration expanded the Emergency Use Authorization for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to include persons aged 12-15 years, and CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended it for this age group on May 12, 2021.* Before that time, COVID-19 vaccines had been available only to persons aged ≥16 years. Understanding and describing the epidemiology of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in adolescents and comparing it with adolescent hospitalizations associated with other vaccine-preventable respiratory viruses, such as influenza, offers evidence of the benefits of expanding the recommended age range for vaccination and provides a baseline and context from which to assess vaccination impact. Using the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), CDC examined COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among adolescents aged 12-17 years, including demographic and clinical characteristics of adolescents admitted during January 1-March 31, 2021, and hospitalization rates (hospitalizations per 100,000 persons) among adolescents during March 1, 2020-April 24, 2021. Among 204 adolescents who were likely hospitalized primarily for COVID-19 during January 1-March 31, 2021, 31.4% were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 4.9% required invasive mechanical ventilation; there were no associated deaths. During March 1, 2020-April 24, 2021, weekly adolescent hospitalization rates peaked at 2.1 per 100,000 in early January 2021, declined to 0.6 in mid-March, and then rose to 1.3 in April. Cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates during October 1, 2020-April 24, 2021, were 2.5-3.0 times higher than were influenza-associated hospitalization rates from three recent influenza seasons (2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20) obtained from the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET). Recent increased COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates in March and April 2021 and the potential for severe disease in adolescents reinforce the importance of continued COVID-19 prevention measures, including vaccination and correct and consistent wearing of masks by persons not yet fully vaccinated or when required by laws, rules, or regulations.†.","Havers, Fiona P.; Whitaker, Michael; Self, Julie L.; Chai, Shua J.; Kirley, Pam Daily; Alden, Nisha B.; Kawasaki, Breanna; Meek, James; Yousey-Hindes, Kimberly; Anderson, Evan J.; Openo, Kyle P.; Weigel, Andrew; Teno, Kenzie; Monroe, Maya L.; Ryan, Patricia A.; Reeg, Libby; Kohrman, Alexander; Lynfield, Ruth; Como-Sabetti, Kathryn; Poblete, Mayvilynne; McMullen, Chelsea; Muse, Alison; Spina, Nancy; Bennett, Nancy M.; Gaitán, Maria; Billing, Laurie M.; Shiltz, Jess; Sutton, Melissa; Abdullah, Nasreen; Schaffner, William; Talbot, H.

We implemented an OFTT targeted at the current pandemic, adapted the content and goals and assessed its effects. The OFTT was implemented on 2 March 2020 and modified regularly based on the revised testing criteria issued by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. After testing criteria liberalised, a chatbot tool was set up on 9 April 2020 to assess urgency of testing, referral to available testing sites and need for emergency care. In the first 40 days of the OFTT, there were more than 17 300 visitors and 69.8% indicated they would have contacted the healthcare system if the online test had not been available. During the initial week of operation, using the conservative testing strategy, 9.1% of visitors received recommendations to be tested, which increased to 36.0% of visitors after a change in testing criteria on 9 March 2020. Overall, since the implementation of the tool, 26.27% of all users of the site have been directed to obtain testing. The Chatbot tool has had approximately 50 consults/day. Setting up an OFTT should be considered as part of local strategies to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. It may ease the burden on the healthcare system, reassure patients and inform authorities. To account for the dynamic development of the pandemic, frequent adaptation of the tool is of great importance.

In this report, we describe a patient who presented with acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis and became a MERS-CoV superspreader, igniting a recent multihospital outbreak in Riyadh. MATERIAL AND RESULTS: Between May 31 and June 15, 2017, 44 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported from 3 simultaneous clusters from 3 health care facilities in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, including 11 fatal cases. Out of the total reported cases, 29 cases were reported from King Saud Medical City. The cluster at King Saud Medical City was ignited by a single superspreader patient who presented with acute renal failure. After 14 hours in the open area of the emergency department and 2 hemodialysis sessions he was diagnosed with MERS-CoV. One hundred twenty contacts who had direct unprotected exposure were screened. Among those contacts, 9 out of 107 health care workers (5 nurses, 3 physicians, and 1 paramedic) and 7 out of 13 patients tested positive for MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: This hospital outbreak demonstrated the difficulties in diagnosing pneumonia in patients with renal and cardiac failure, which leads to delayed suspicion of MERS-CoV and hence delay in applying the proper infection control procedures. In MERS-CoV endemic countries there is an urgent need for developing rapid point-of-care testing that would assist emergency department staff in triaging suspected cases of MERS-CoV to ensure timely isolation and management of their primary illness and prevent major MERS-CoV outbreaks.","Amer, Hala; Alqahtani, Abdulrahman S.; Alzoman, Hind; Aljerian, Nawfal; Memish, Ziad A.",Am J Infect Control,381,20

In summary, hesperidin is a potential TMPRSS2 inhibitor for the reduction of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cheng, Fang-Ju; Huynh, Thanh-Kieu; Yang, Chia-Shin; Hu, Dai-Wei; Shen, Yi-Cheng; Tu, Chih-Yen; Wu, Yang-Chang; Tang, Chih-Hsin; Huang, Wei-Chien; Chen, Yeh; Ho, Chien-Yi",Nutrients,381,24

This is particularly evident in the case of pig farming as shown by the recent episodes of African swine fever or porcine epidemic diarrhoea. Moreover, a better biosecurity may help to improve productivity and may contribute to reducing the use of antibiotics. Biosecurity can be defined as the application of measures aimed to reduce the probability of the introduction (external biosecurity) and further spread of pathogens within the farm (internal biosecurity). Thus, the key idea is to avoid transmission, either between farms or within the farm. This implies knowledge of the epidemiology of the diseases to be avoided that is not always available, but since ways of transmission of pathogens are limited to a few, it is possible to implement effective actions even with some gaps in our knowledge on a given disease. For the effective design of a biosecurity program, veterinarians must know how diseases are transmitted, the risks and their importance, which mitigation measures are thought to be more effective and how to evaluate the biosecurity and its improvements. This review provides a source of information on external and internal biosecurity measures that reduce risks in swine production and the relationship between these measures and the epidemiology of the main diseases, as well as a description of some systems available for risk analysis and the assessment of biosecurity. Also, it reviews the factors affecting the successful application of a biosecurity plan in a pig farm.","Alarcón, Laura Valeria; Alberto, Alberto Allepuz; Mateu, Enric",Porcine Health Manag,381,29

The major roles of the protein include virulence, infectivity, ion channel activity, morphogenesis and virus release. The coronavirus, SARS-CoV2 is continuously evolving naturally and thereby the encoded proteins are also mutating rapidly. Therefore, critical study of mutations in ORF3a is certainty important from the pathogenetic perspective. Here, a sum of 175 various non-synonymous mutations in the ORF3a protein of SARS-CoV2 are identified and their corresponding effects in structural stability and functions of the protein ORF3a are studied. Broadly three different classes of mutations, such as neutral, disease and mixed (neutral and disease) type mutations were observed. Consecutive mutations in some ORF3a proteins are established based on timeline of detection of mutations. Considering the amino acid compositions over the ORF3a primary protein sequences, twenty clusters are detected based on K-means clustering method. Our findings on 175 novel mutations of ORF3a proteins will extend our knowledge of ORF3a, a vital accessory protein in SARS-CoV2, which would assist to enlighten on the pathogenicity of this life-threatening COVID-19.","Hassan, Sk.

Study Design We estimated the number of clinical visits and clinical contacts (any worker a patient may come into physical contact with during their visit) under the current policy landscape, compared to the number of visits and contacts if the following regulations were repealed: 1) State mandatory in-person counseling visit laws that necessitate two visits for abortion, 2) State mandatory-ultrasound laws, 3) State mandates requiring the prescribing clinician be present during mifepristone administration, 4) Federal Food and Drug Administration Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for mifepristone. If these laws were repealed, “no-test” telemedicine abortion would be possible for some patients. We modeled the number of visits averted if a minimum of 15 percent or a maximum of 70 percent of medication abortion patients had a “no-test” telemedicine abortion. RESULTS: We estimate that 12,742 in-person clinic visits (50,978 clinical contacts) would be averted each month if counseling visit laws alone were repealed, and 31,132 visits (142,910 clinical contacts) would be averted if all four policies were repealed and 70 percent of medication abortion patients received no-test telemedicine abortions. Over 2 million clinical contacts could be averted over the projected 18-month COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Medically unnecessary abortion regulations result in a large number of excess clinical visits and contacts. Policy Implications Repeal of medically unnecessary state and federal abortion restrictions in the United States would allow for evidence-based telemedicine abortion care, thereby lowering risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Fulcher, Isabel R.; Neill, Sara; Bharadwa, Sonya; Goldberg, Alisa B.; Janiak, Elizabeth",Contraception,381,28

Understanding adaptive capacity has been a focus of RHC studies. Previous studies clearly show why adaptations are necessary and document the successful adaptive actions taken by clinicians. To our knowledge, however, no studies have thus far compared RHC across different teams and countries. There are gaps in the research knowledge related to the multilevel nature of resilience across healthcare systems and the team-based nature of adaptive capacity. This cross-country comparative study therefore aims to add knowledge of how resilience is enabled in diverse healthcare systems by examining adaptive capacity in hospital teams in six countries. The study will identify how team, organisational and national healthcare system factors support or hinder the ability of teams to adapt to variability and change. Findings from this study are anticipated to provide insights to inform the design of RHC systems by considering how macro-level and meso-level structures support adaptive capacity at the micro-level, and to develop guidance for organisations and policymakers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will employ a multiple comparative case study design of teams nested within hospitals, in turn embedded within six countries: Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and the UK. The design will be based on the Adaptive Teams Framework placing adaptive teams at the centre of the healthcare system with layers of environmental, organisational and system level factors shaping adaptive capacity. In each of the six countries, a focused mapping of the macro-level features of the healthcare system will be undertaken by using documentary sources and interviews with key informants operating at the macro-level. A sampling framework will be developed to select two hospitals in each country to ensure variability based on size, location and teaching status. Four teams will be selected in each hospital—one each of a structural, hybrid, responsive and coordinating team. A total of eight teams will be studied in each country, creating a total sample of 48 teams. Data collection methods will be observations, interviews and document analysis. Within-case analysis will be conducted according to a standardised template using a combination of deductive and inductive qualitative coding, and cross-case analysis will be conducted drawing on the Qualitative Comparative Analysis framework. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The overall Resilience in Healthcare research programme of which this study is a part has been granted ethical approval by the Norwegian Centre for Research Data (Ref. No. 8643334 and Ref. No. 478838). Ethical approval will also be sought in each country involved in the study according to their respective regulatory procedures. Country-specific reports of study outcomes will be produced for dissemination online. A collection of case study summaries will be made freely available, translated into multiple languages. Brief policy communications will be produced to inform policymakers and regulators about the study results and to facilitate translation into practice. Academic dissemination will occur through publication in journals specialising in health services research. Findings will be presented at academic, policy and practitioner conferences, including the annual RHC Network meeting and other healthcare quality and safety conferences. Presentations at practitioner and academic conferences will include workshops to translate the findings into practice and influence quality and safety programmes internationally.","Anderson, Janet E; Aase, Karina; Bal, Roland; Bourrier, Mathilde; Braithwaite, Jeffrey; Nakajima, Kazue; Wiig, Siri; Guise, Veslemøy",BMJ Open,381,3

The comparison of normal versus disease states can identify an overexpression or a suppression of critical proteins where illness has directly altered a patient's cellular homeostasis. In particular, the analysis of HIV-1 infected serum is an attractive medium with which to identify altered protein expression due to the ease and non-invasive methods of collecting samples as well as the corresponding insight into the in vivo interaction of the virus with infected cells/tissue. The utilization of proteomic techniques to globally identify differentially expressed serum proteins in response to HIV-1 infection is a significant undertaking that is complicated due to the innate protein profile of human serum. RESULTS: Here, the depletion of 12 of the most abundant serum proteins, followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with identification of these proteins using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, has allowed for the identification of differentially expressed, low abundant serum proteins. We have analyzed and compared serum samples from HIV-1 infected subjects who are being treated using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to those who are latently infected but have not progressed to AIDS despite the absence of treatment, i.e. long term non-progressors (LTNPs). Here we have identified unique serum proteins that are differentially expressed in LTNP HIV-1 patients and may contribute to the ability of these patients to combat HIV-1 infection in the absence of HAART. We focused on the cdk4/6 cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4A )and found that the treatment of HIV-1 latently infected cell lines with p16(INK4A )decreases viral production despite it not being expressed endogenously in these cells. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of these unique proteins may serve as an indication of altered viral states in response to infection as well as a natural phenotypic variability in response to HIV-1 infection in a given population.","Van Duyne, Rachel; Guendel, Irene; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Easley, Rebecca; Klase, Zachary; Liu, Chenglong; Young, Mary; Kashanchi, Fatah",AIDS Res Ther,381,16

This action was implemented to cut down all unnecessary human activities, including industry, agriculture and transportation. Reducing these activities to a very low level during these hard times meant that some unprecedented naturally occurring measures of controlling emissions were executed. Ironically, however, after these measures were implemented, ozone levels increased by 43.9%. Also worthy of note, PM(2.5) decreased 31.7%, which was found by comparing the observation data in Wuhan during the epidemic from 8th Feb. to 8th Apr. in 2020 with the same periods in 2019. Utilizing CMAQ (The Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system), this article investigated the reason for these phenomena based on four sets of numerical simulations with different schemes of emission reduction. Comparing the four sets of simulations with observation, it was deduced that the emissions should decrease to approximately 20% from the typical industrial output, and 10% from agriculture and transportation sources, attributed to the COVID-19 lockdown in Wuhan. More importantly, through the CMAQ process analysis, this study quantitatively analyzed differences of the physical and chemical processes that were affected by the COVID-19 lockdown. It then examined the differences of the COVID-19 lockdown impact and determined the physical and chemical processes between when the pollution increased and decreased, determining the most affected period of the day. As a result, this paper found that (1) PM(2.5) decreased mainly due to the reduction of emission and the contrary contribution of aerosol processes. The North-East wind was also in favor of the decreasing of PM(2.5). (2) O(3) increased mainly due to the slowing down of chemical consumption processes, which made the concentration change of O(3) pollution higher at about 4 p.m.–7 p.m. of the day, while increasing the concentration of O(3) at night during the COVID-19 lockdown in Wuhan. The higher O(3) concentration in the North-East of the main urban area also contributed to the increasing of O(3) with unfavorable wind direction.","Huang, Congwu; Wang, Tijian; Niu, Tao; Li, Mengmeng; Liu, Hongli; Ma, Chaoqun",Atmos Environ (1994),381,29

Our recent study demonstrated that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) infection of monkey kidney Vero E6 cells induces phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of signaling pathways, resulting in apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the phosphorylation status of p90RSK, which is a well-known substrate of these signaling pathways, in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Vero E6 mainly expressed p90RSK1 and showed weak expression of p90RSK2. In the absence of viral infection, Ser221 in the N-terminal kinase domain was phosphorylated constitutively, whereas both Thr573 in the C-terminal kinase domain and Ser380 between the two kinase domains were not phosphorylated in confluent cells. Ser380, which has been reported to be involved in autophosphorylation by activation of the C-terminal kinase domain, was phosphorylated in confluent SARS-CoV-infected cells, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by SB203580, which is an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Phosphorylation of Thr573 was not upregulated in SARS-CoV-infected cells. Thus, in virus-infected cells, phosphorylation of Thr573 was not necessary to induce phosphorylation of Ser380. On the other hand, Both Thr573 and Ser380 were phosphorylated by treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the absence of p38 MAPK activation. Ser220 was constitutively phosphorylated despite infection. These results indicated that phosphorylation status of p90RSK by SARS-CoV infection is different from that by stimulation of EGF. This is the first detailed report regarding regulation of p90RSK phosphorylation by virus infection.","Mizutani, Tetsuya; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Saijo, Masayuki; Kurane, Ichiro; Morikawa, Shigeru",FEBS Lett,381,10

This study investigates the efficacy of wearing disposable N95s continuously during clinical work. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of ED staff required to wear N95s continuously throughout their shifts. Subjects were doctors, nurses, and technicians who were previously fitted for their assigned N95 by employee health. Subjects were fit tested periodically throughout their shifts. Investigators filled out a questionnaire for each subject noting the hours of continuous N95 wear. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen N95s were evaluated, with 23 failures at first testing. These were not retested. Twenty-seven N95s passed at the start of a shift and did not have repeat testing during the course of the shift. These were excluded from further analysis. Seventeen N95s passed testing after several hours of continuous wear, but only had a single fit test done partway or at the end of a shift. These were assumed to have passed if tested at shift start, and were assigned as “passes” for continuous use. Forty-six N95s had an initial pass and were evaluated for continuous use, of which 6 subsequently failed later in the shift, giving a fail rate with continuous use of 9.5%. CONCLUSION: Continuous use of disposable N95s throughout an ED shift is reasonable during a PPE shortage if wearers are assured of fit at the start of their shift.","Jeanmonod, Rebecca; Rivard, Leah; Pester, Jonathan; McMahon, Kathleen; Check, Ronald; Kelly, Brian; Balakrishnan, Vamsi; Jeanmonod, Donald",Am J Emerg Med,381,5

In particular, the data from Nepal, a developing country having an open border provision with highly COVID-19 affected country India, has shown a biphasic pattern of epidemic, a controlled phase (until July 21, 2020) followed by an outgrown phase (after July 21, 2020). To uncover the effective strategies implemented during the controlled phase, we develop a mathematical model that is able to describe the data from both phases of COVID-19 dynamics in Nepal. Using our best parameter estimates with 95% confidence interval, we found that during the controlled phase most of the recorded cases were imported from outside the country with a small number generated from the local transmission, consistent with the data. Our model predicts that these successful strategies were able to maintain the reproduction number at around 0.21 during the controlled phase, preventing 442,640 cases of COVID-19 and saving more than 1,200 lives in Nepal. However, during the outgrown phase, when the strategies such as border screening and quarantine, lockdown, and detection and isolation, were altered, the reproduction number raised to 1.8, resulting in exponentially growing cases of COVID-19. We further used our model to predict the long-term dynamics of COVID-19 in Nepal and found that without any interventions the current trend may result in about 18.76 million cases (10.70 million detected and 8.06 million undetected) and 89 thousand deaths in Nepal by the end of 2021. Finally, using our predictive model, we evaluated the effects of various control strategies on the long-term outcome of this epidemics and identified ideal strategies to curb the epidemic in Nepal.","Adhikari, Khagendra; Gautam, Ramesh; Pokharel, Anjana; Uprety, Kedar Nath; Vaidya, Naveen K.",J Theor Biol,381,30

However, the pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 are barely understood. METHODS: In this study, we performed proteomic analyses of airway mucus obtained by bronchoscopy from severe COVID-19 patients. In total, 2351 and 2073 proteins were identified and quantified in COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, respectively. RESULTS: Among them, 92 differentiated expressed proteins (DEPs) (46 up-regulated and 46 down-regulated) were found with a fold change >1.5 or <0.67 and a p-value <0.05, and 375 proteins were uniquely present in airway mucus from COVID-19 patients. Pathway and network enrichment analyses revealed that the 92 DEPs were mostly associated with metabolic, complement and coagulation cascades, lysosome, and cholesterol metabolism pathways, and the 375 COVID-19 only proteins were mainly enriched in amino acid degradation (Valine, Leucine and Isoleucine degradation), amino acid metabolism (beta-Alanine, Tryptophan, Cysteine and Methionine metabolism), oxidative phosphorylation, phagosome, and cholesterol metabolism pathways.

We present a phylogenetic study to explore viral introduction and evolution during the exponential early phase of the local COVID-19 outbreak from February 26(th) until March 23(rd). We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 naso-oropharyngeal swabs from 746 positive tests that were performed at the University Hospital Basel during the study period. We successfully generated 468 high quality genomes from unique patients and called variants with our COVID-19 Pipeline (COVGAP), and analysed viral genetic diversity using PANGOLIN taxonomic lineages. To identify introduction and dissemination events we incorporated global SARS-CoV-2 genomes and inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny. Epidemiological data from patient questionnaires was used to facilitate the interpretation of phylogenetic observations. The early outbreak in Basel was dominated by lineage B.1 (83·6%), detected first on March 2(nd), although the first sample identified belonged to B.1.1. Within B.1, 68·2% of our samples fall within a clade defined by the SNP C15324T (‘Basel cluster’), including 157 identical sequences at the root of the ‘Basel cluster’, some of which we can specifically trace to regional spreading events. We infer the origin of B.1-C15324T to mid-February in our tri-national region. The other genomes map broadly over the global phylogenetic tree, showing several introduction events from and/or dissemination to other regions of the world via travellers. Family transmissions can also be traced in our data. A single lineage variant dominated the outbreak in the Basel area while other lineages, such as the first (B.1.1), did not propagate. A mass gathering event was the predominant initial source of cases, with travel returners and family transmissions to a lesser extent. We highlight the importance of adding specific questions to epidemiological questionnaires, to obtain data on attendance of large gatherings and their locations, as well as travel history, to effectively identify routes of transmissions in up-coming outbreaks. This phylogenetic analysis in concert with epidemiological and contact tracing data, allows connection and interpretation of events, and can inform public health interventions.

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in four English databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library) and four Chinese databases (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chongqing VIP Chinese Science (VIP), Wanfang Database and China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM)) to collect the related studies. Quality evaluation was carried out for papers meeting the inclusion criteria using six items from the Downs and Black assessment checklist. The STATA statistical software version 15.1 was hired to perform meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine records with a total of 24,952 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. The results of this meta-analysis revealed that the pooled effect value of COVID-19 vaccination willingness among HCWs using a random-effects model was 51% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.62). Male, aged 30 years or older, having a history of prior influenza vaccination were facilitators for HCWs’ intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) 1.82, 95% CI 1.37-2.41, P=0.000, I(2)=59.4%; OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.16-1.51, P=0.000, I(2)=31.7%; OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.82-4.84, P=0.000, I(2)=88.1%). The impact of occupation on HCWs’ intention to get vaccinated could not yet be definitively confirmed (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69-1.06, P=0.160, I(2)=85.5%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccination acceptance of HCWs was at moderate level. Strengthening awareness of COVID-19 vaccine among HCWs, particularly female HCWs under 30 years who have no history of prior influenza vaccination, is crucial to eliminate concerns about vaccination and promote the application of COVID-19 vaccine in this population.","Luo, Chuxuan; Yang, Yuan; Liu, Yueming; Zheng, Danna; Shao, Lina; Jin, Juan; He, Qiang",Am J Infect Control,381,19

A powerful experimental method to gain insights on the physical chemical nature of conformational epitopes is the selection of linear peptides that bind with high affinities to a monoclonal antibody of interest by phage display technology. However, the structural characterization of conformational epitopes from these mimotopes is not straightforward, and in the past the interpretation of peptide sequences from phage display experiments focused on linear sequence analysis to find a consensus sequence or common sequence motifs. RESULTS: We present a fully automated search method, EpiSearch that predicts the possible location of conformational epitopes on the surface of an antigen. The algorithm uses peptide sequences from phage display experiments as input, and ranks all surface exposed patches according to the frequency distribution of similar residues in the peptides and in the patch. We have tested the performance of the EpiSearch algorithm for six experimental data sets of phage display experiments, the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2/neu), the antibody mAb Bo2C11 targeting the C(2) domain of FVIII, antibodies mAb 17b and mAb b12 of the HIV envelope protein gp120, mAb 13b5 targeting HIV-1 capsid protein and 80R of the SARS coronavirus spike protein. In all these examples the conformational epitopes as determined by the X-ray crystal structures of the antibody-antigen complexes, were found within the highest scoring patches of EpiSearch, covering in most cases more than 50% residues of experimental observed conformational epitopes. Input options of the program include mapping of a single peptide or a set of peptides on the antigen structure, and the results of the calculation can be visualized on our interactive web server.

Of those infected, 25%–40% aged ≤1 year develop severe lower RTIs leading to pneumonia and bronchiolitis, with ~10% requiring hospitalisation. Evidence also suggests that HRSV infection early in life is a major cause of adult asthma. There is no HRSV vaccine, and the only clinically approved treatment is immunoprophylaxis that is expensive and only moderately effective. New anti-HRSV therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently required. METHODS: It is now established that viruses require cellular ion channel functionality to infect cells. Here, we infected human lung epithelial cell lines and ex vivo human lung slices with HRSV in the presence of a defined panel of chloride (Cl(−)) channel modulators to investigate their role during the HRSV life-cycle. RESULTS: We demonstrate the requirement for TMEM16A, a calcium-activated Cl(−) channel, for HRSV infection. Time-of-addition assays revealed that the TMEM16A blockers inhibit HRSV at a postentry stage of the virus life-cycle, showing activity as a postexposure prophylaxis. Another important negative-sense RNA respiratory pathogen influenza virus was also inhibited by the TMEM16A-specific inhibitor T16Ainh-A01. DISCUSSION: These findings reveal TMEM16A as an exciting target for future host-directed antiviral therapeutics.","Pearson, Hayley; Todd, Eleanor J A A; Ahrends, Mareike; Hover, Samantha E; Whitehouse, Adrian; Stacey, Martin; Lippiat, Jonathan D; Wilkens, Ludwig; Fieguth, Hans-Gerd; Danov, Olga; Hesse, Christina; Barr, John N; Mankouri, Jamel",Thorax,381,16

The ratio of cumulative discharges on a given day to the sum of cumulative discharges on a given day and cumulative deaths before j days is used to estimate the cure rate. Moreover, the case fatality ratio can also be estimated. After simulation calculations, j is statistically appropriate when it is 8-10, and it is also clinically appropriate. When j is 9, based on the available data, it is inferred that the cure rate of this epidemic is about 93% and the case fatality rate is about 7%. This method of estimating the cure rate can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in different medical schemes and different regions, and has great value and significance for decision-making in the epidemic.","Diao, Ying; Liu, Xiaoyun; Wang, Tao; Zeng, Xiaofei; Dong, Chen; Zhou, Changlong; Zhang, Yuanming; She, Xuan; Liu, Dingfu; Hu, Zhongli",,381,20

Moreover, the conserved region encoded by the S gene can be considered a target for establishing a new diagnostic method and is a new candidate for vaccine design. In this study, use of anchorin pgsA' allowed the fusion protein of S-DCpep to express on the surface of recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum (NC8-pSIP409-pgsA'-S-DCpep) NC8 strain.

In many hospitals and health care facilities, services and health care workers have been reorganized and restructured to meet the demands of the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on hospital‐based clinical pharmacists and their ability to deliver pharmaceutical care is currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on hospital‐based clinical pharmacists working in Malaysia and the implications on how clinical pharmacy is perceived as a health care service. METHODS: A qualitative study was designed to meet the research objectives. Nineteen hospital‐based clinical pharmacists consented and participated in one‐on‐one, semi‐structured interviews. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using an iterative thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: The experiences and views of the participants were reported. Three main themes were developed: ‘Reassignment and other changes in clinical pharmacist roles’, ‘Adapting clinical pharmacy services to COVID‐19’, and ‘The need for clinical pharmacists in the ward’. The findings indicate that in many cases, clinical pharmacy services were fully or partially withdrawn from the ward to reduce the risk of infection and to conserve the usage of personal protective equipment. Despite this, clinical pharmacists continued to support patient care in hospitals through the use of technology. The withdrawal of clinical pharmacy services, however, raises concern that the role of clinical pharmacists is still poorly recognized. CONCLUSION: Clinical pharmacists in hospitals continue to support patient care despite the disruption caused by the COVID‐19 pandemic. Greater support and recognition of their role is required in order to empower and enhance their ability to deliver pharmaceutical care. This article is protected by copyright.

Therefore, this study was conducted to assess prevalence of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety comorbidity, and associated factors during the COVID-19 lock-down in Nepal. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted among the general population of Nepal. Data was collected from April 9 to April 16, 2020 using an e-questionnaire which was shared through different popular social media. A total of 349 participants were included. Self-reported depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety tools respectively. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with depression, anxiety and depression and anxiety co-morbidity. Results The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity were found to be 34.0%, 31.0% and 23.2% respectively. The multi-variate analysis showed that females, those living alone, health professionals and those who spent more time in accessing information about COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity. Conclusions High rates of depression and anxiety and co-morbidity were found to be prevailing among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic lock-down in Nepal.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the levels of depression and mental distress due to COVID-19, and the associations between cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial factors, and depression and mental distress due to COVID-19 among university students in China. METHODS: A large-scale online cross-sectional study (16 cities in 13 provinces) was conducted among university students from February 1 to 10, 2020, in China; 23,863 valid questionnaires were returned. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess depression. Structural equation modeling was performed to test mediation and suppression effects. RESULTS: Of the 23,863 participants, 47.1% (n=11,235) reported high or very high levels of one or more types of mental distress due to COVID-19; 39.1% (n=9326) showed mild to severe depression. Mental distress due to COVID-19 was positively associated with depression.

Its specific impact on education is extensive and quite evident in the adaptation from Face-to-Face (F2F) teaching to online methodologies throughout the first wave of the pandemic and the strict rules on lockdown. As lesson formats changed radically, the relevance of evaluating student on-line learning processes in university degrees throughout this period became clear. For this purpose, the perceptions of engineering students towards five specific course units forming part of engineering degree courses at the University of Burgos, Spain, were evaluated to assess the quality of the online teaching they received. Comparisons were also drawn with their perceptions of the F2F teaching of the course units prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. According to the students’ perceptions, the teachers possessed the technical knowledge, the social skills, and the personal capabilities (empathy and understanding of the at times troubled situation of each student) for a very abrupt adaptation of their courses to an online methodology. The shortcomings of the online teaching were related to its particularities and each teacher’s personality traits. Overall, engineering teachers appeared well prepared for a situation of these characteristics and, if similar online teaching scenarios were ever repeated, the quality of engineering teaching appears to be guaranteed.","Revilla-Cuesta, Víctor; Skaf, Marta; Varona, Juan Manuel; Ortega-López, Vanesa",Int J Environ Res Public Health,381,20

Obesity is associated with chronic activation of the innate immune system and consequent local and systemic inflammation which contribute to pathologic conditions such as type-2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, psoriasis, atherosclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Individuals with obesity have increased susceptibility to contract viral, bacterial, and fungal infections and respond sub-optimally to vaccination. In this review, we summarize research findings on the effects of obesity on immune responses to respiratory tract infections (RTI), focusing on Streptococcus pneumoniae (“pneumococcus”) infection, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the US, causing community-acquired infections such as pneumonia, otitis media and meningitis. We show that the risk of infection is higher in elderly individuals and also in individuals of certain ethnic groups, although in a few reports obesity has been associated with better survival of individuals admitted to hospital with pneumococcus infection, a phenomenon known as “obesity paradox.” We discuss factors that are associated with increased risk of pneumococcal infection, such as recent infection with RTI, chronic medical conditions, and immunosuppressive medications.","Frasca, Daniela; McElhaney, Janet",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),381,28

Because of the public health emergency, chest CT has been widely used for sensitive detection and diagnosis, monitoring the changes of lesions and also for treatment evaluation. The purpose of this study was to investigate radiation dose and image quality of chest CT scans received by COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the oncogenic risk of multiple chest CT examinations. METHODS: A retrospective review of 33 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection was performed from January 31, 2020 to February 19, 2020. The date of each CT exam and respective radiation dose for each exam was recorded for all patients. Multiple pulmonary CT scans were obtained during diagnosis and treatment procedure. Scan frequency, total scan times, radiation dose, and image quality were determined. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (15 males and 18 females, age 21–82 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia underwent a total of 143 chest CT scans. The number of CT scans per patient was 4 ± 1, with a range of 2–6. The time interval between two consecutive chest CT scans was 3 ± 1 days. The average effective dose from a single chest CT scan was 1.21 ± 0.10 mSv, with a range of 1.02–1.44 mSv. The average cumulative effective dose per patient was 5.25 ± 1.52 mSv, with a range of 2.24–7.48 mSv. The maximum cumulative effective dose was 7.48 mSv for six CT examinations during COVID-19 treatment. Based on subjective image quality analysis, the visual scoring of CT findings was 11.23 ± 1.35 points out of 15 points. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency, total number and image quality of chest CT scans should be reviewed carefully to guarantee minimally required CT scans during the COVID-19 management.","Bai, Lu; Zhou, Jie; Shen, Cong; Cai, Shubo; Guo, Youmin; Huang, Xunan; Jia, Guang; Niu, Gang",Chin J Acad Radiol,381,12

This study establishes a protocol for deriving gastric epithelial organoids from paediatric gastric biopsies, providing a platform for modelling disease and developing translational therapies. METHODS: Full-thickness surgical samples and endoscopic mucosal biopsies were obtained from six patients. Gastric glands were isolated by a chemical chelation protocol and then plated in 3D culture in Matrigel(®) droplets in chemically defined medium. After formation, organoids were passaged by single cell dissociation or manual disaggregation. Cell composition and epithelial polarity of organoids were assessed by bright field microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis, comparing them to native paediatric gastric tissue. RESULTS: Gastric glands were successfully isolated from all six patients who were aged 4 months to 16 years. Gastric glands from all patients sealed to form spherical gastric organoids. These organoids could be passaged by manual disaggregation or single cell dissociation, remaining proliferative up to 1 year in culture. Organoids retained normal epithelial cell polarity, with the apical surface orientated towards the central lumen. Organoids expressed markers of mature gastric epithelial cell types, except for parietal cells. CONCLUSION: Gastric organoids can be reliably generated from paediatric biopsies and are a representative in vitro model for studying gastric epithelium.","Jones, Brendan C.; Calà, Giuseppe; De Coppi, Paolo; Giobbe, Giovanni Giuseppe",Pediatr Surg Int,381,1

Our aim was to investigate these relations in more detail in a large test cohort and an independent validation cohort. METHODS: We retrospectively included 2792 COVID-19 suspected patients that presented to the emergency department (ED) of two hospitals. Plasma calcium and ionized plasma calcium levels were compared between COVID-19 positive and negative patients, and between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients using univariate and multivariate analyses in the first hospital (N = 1363). Severe COVID-19 was defined as intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death within 28 d after admission. The results were validated by repeating the same analyses in the second hospital (N = 1429). RESULTS: A total of 693 (24.8%) of the enrolled patients were COVID-19 positive, of whom 238 (34.3%) had severe COVID-19. In both hospitals, COVID-19 positive patients had lower plasma calcium levels than COVID-19 negative patients, regardless of correction for albumin, in univariate and multivariate analysis (Δ0.06–0.13 mmol/L, p < .001). Ionized plasma calcium concentrations, with and without correction for pH, were also lower in COVID-19 positive patients in multivariate analyses (Δ0.02–0.05 mmol/L, N = 567, p < .001). However, we did not find a significant association between COVID-19 disease severity and plasma calcium in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma calcium concentrations were lower in COVID-19 positive than COVID-19 negative patients but we found no association with disease severity in multivariate analyses. Further understanding of plasma calcium perturbation may facilitate the development of new preventive and therapeutic modalities for the current pandemic.","Deodatus, Jan Arne; Kooistra, Simone Anna; Kurstjens, Steef; Mossink, Joram Cornèl Leon; van Dijk, Joris David; Groeneveld, Paul Hendrik Pieter; van der Kolk, Brigitta (Britt) Yarine Maxime",Infect Dis (Lond),381,1

In our previous work, poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL)/fibrin vascular grafts were fabricated by electrospinning. It was proved that the PCL/fibrin vascular graft was a suitable small diameter tissue engineering vascular scaffold with good biomechanical properties and cell compatibility. Here we mainly examined the performance of PCL/fibrin vascular graft in vivo. The graft showed randomly arranged nanofiber structure, excellent mechanical strength, higher compliance and degradation properties. At 9 months after implantation in the rat abdominal aorta, the graft induced the regeneration of neoarteries, and promoted ECM deposition and rapid endothelialization. More importantly, the PCL/fibrin vascular graft showed more microvessels density and fewer calcification areas at 3 months, which was beneficial to improve cell infiltration and proliferation. Moreover, the ratio of M2/M1macrophage in PCL/fibrin graft had a higher expression level and the secretion amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines started to increase, and then decreased to similar to the native artery. Thus, the electrospun PCL/fibrin tubular vascular graft had great potential to become a new type of artificial blood vessel scaffold that can be implanted in vivo for long term.","Zhao, Liang; Li, Xiafei; Yang, Lei; Sun, Lulu; Mu, Songfeng; Zong, Haibin; Li, Qiong; Wang, Fengyao; Song, Shuang; Yang, Chengqiang; Zhao, Changhong; Chen, Hongli; Zhang, Rui; Wang, Shicheng; Dong, Yuzhen; Zhang, Qiqing",Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl,381,1

An individual's cellular response appears to play a critical role in recovery from infections, given that individuals with impaired cellular immunity, congenital or acquired, have more severe diseases and secrete the virus for longer periods. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to immunohistochemically evaluate the expression of the cell surface antigens CD4, CD8, CD25, CD14 and CD74, in pneumonic infiltrates in the alveolar septa using paraffin-embedded lung samples from autopsies of immunocompetent children who died of lethal, non-pandemic, severe acute respiratory infections. STUDY DESIGN: From 794 cases of pediatric autopsies of patients with severe respiratory disease (between 1960 and 2004), 193 cases were selected for this study. To identify subpopulations of inflammatory cells in the alveolar septa, cell surface antigen expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using the following primary antibodies: anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD14, anti-CD25 and anti-CD74. RESULTS: The TCD8+ lymphocyte count was higher in the virus-positive group (p = 0.04) and was also much higher among cases that were positive for more than three viral types (p = 0.016). There were fewer CD14+ cells in cases of AdV (adenovirus) infection (p = 0.002), and there was a predominance of CD74+ cells in the histopathological pattern defined as interstitial pneumonitis (p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that TCD8+ lymphocytes present in the alveolar septa participate to a greater extent in the response toward viral pneumonia, while CD14+ cell numbers are often reduced in cases of AdV.","de Souza Costa, Victor Horácio; Baurakiades, Emanuele; Viola Azevedo, Marina Louise; Traiano, Gabriela; Kowal Rosales, Jeana; Kunze Larsen, Kelly Susana; Raboni, Sonia Maria; de Noronha, Lucia",J Clin Virol,381,14

Yet, longitudinal immunological correlates of disease outcome remain unclear. Here, we serially analysed immune responses in 113 COVID-19 patients with moderate (non-ICU) and severe (ICU) disease. Immune profiling revealed an overall increase in innate cell lineages with a concomitant reduction in T cell number. We identify an association between early, elevated cytokines and worse disease outcomes. Following an early increase in cytokines, COVID-19 patients with moderate disease displayed a progressive reduction in type-1 (antiviral) and type-3 (antifungal) responses. In contrast, patients with severe disease maintained these elevated responses throughout the course of disease. Moreover, severe disease was accompanied by an increase in multiple type 2 (anti-helminths) effectors including, IL-5, IL-13, IgE and eosinophils. Unsupervised clustering analysis of plasma and peripheral blood leukocyte data identified 4 immune signatures, representing (A) growth factors, (B) type-2/3 cytokines, (C) mixed type-1/2/3 cytokines, and (D) chemokines that correlated with three distinct disease trajectories of patients. The immune profile of patients who recovered with moderate disease was enriched in tissue reparative growth factor signature (A), while the profile for those with worsened disease trajectory had elevated levels of all four signatures. Thus, we identified development of a maladapted immune response profile associated with severe COVID-19 outcome and early immune signatures that correlate with divergent disease trajectories.","Lucas, C.; Wong, P.; Klein, J.; Castro, T.; Silva, J.; Sundaram, M.; Ellingson, M.; Mao, T.; Oh, J.; Israelow, B.; Tokuyama, M.; Lu, P.; Venkataraman, A.; Park, A.; Mohanty, S.; Wang, H.; Wyllie, A.

Diagnosis currently relies on non-specific chest CT, culture of the fungus from invasive lung biopsy, and detection of the cell wall carbohydrate galactomannan (GM) in serum or in BAL fluids recovered during invasive bronchoscopy. Urine provides an ideal bodily fluid for the non-invasive detection of pathogen biomarkers, with current urine-based immunodiagnostics for IPA focused on GM. Surrogate protein biomarkers might serve to improve disease detection. Here, we report the development of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), PD7, which is specific to A. fumigatus and related species in the section Fumigati, and which binds to its 18 kDa ribotoxin Asp f I. Using PD7, we show that the protein is secreted during hyphal development, and so represents an ideal candidate for detecting invasive growth. We have developed a lateral-flow device (Afu-LFD(®)) incorporating the mAb which has a limit of detection of ~15 ng Asp f I/mL urine. Preliminary evidence of the test’s diagnostic potential is demonstrated with urine from a patient with acute lymphoid leukaemia with probable IPA. The Afu-LFD(®) therefore provides a potential novel opportunity for non-invasive urine-based detection of IPA caused by A. fumigatus.","Davies, Genna; Singh, Oski; Prattes, Juergen; Hoenigl, Martin; Sheppard, Paul W.; Thornton, Christopher R.",J Fungi (Basel),381,1

In patients with type-II diabetes, fat distribution is characterized by visceral and ectopic adipose tissues expansion, resulting in systemic inflammation, which may play a role in driving the COVID-19 cytokine storm. Our aim was to determine if cardiac adipose tissue, combined to interleukin-6 levels, could predict adverse short-term outcomes, death and ICU requirement, in COVID-19 diabetic patients during the 21 days after admission. METHODS: Eighty one consecutive patients with type-II diabetes admitted for COVID-19 were included. Interleukin-6 measurement and chest computed tomography with total cardiac adipose tissue index (CATi) measurement were performed at admission. The primary outcome was death during the 21 days following admission while intensive care requirement with or without early death (ICU-R) defined the secondary endpoint. Associations of CATi and IL-6 and threshold values to predict the primary and secondary endpoints were determined. RESULTS: Of the enrolled patients (median age 66 years [IQR: 59–74]), 73% male, median body mass index (BMI) 27 kg/m(2) [IQR: 24–31]) 20 patients had died from COVID-19, 20 required intensive care and 41 were in conventional care at day 21 after admission. Increased CATi and IL-6 levels were both significantly related to increased early mortality (respectively OR = 6.15, p = 0.002; OR = 18.2, p < 0.0001) and ICU-R (respectively OR = 3.27, p = 0.01; OR = 4.86, p = 0.002). These associations remained significant independently of age, sex, BMI as well as troponin-T level and pulmonary lesion extension in CT. We combined CATi and IL-6 levels as a multiplicative interaction score (CATi*IL-6). The cut-point for this score was ≥ 6386 with a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.87 (AUC = 0.88) and an OR of 59.6 for early mortality (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac adipose tissue index and IL-6 determination at admission could help physicians to better identify diabetic patients with a potentially severe and lethal short term course irrespective of obesity. Diabetic patients with high CATi at admission, a fortiori associated with high IL-6 levels could be a relevant target population to promptly initiate anti-inflammatory therapies.

We identified the Internet references and grouped them into 11 categories according to the results of entering the uniform resource locator (URL) into the Internet browser. RESULTS: We identified 15,745 references published in Annals of Emergency Medicine. The proportion of Internet references increased from 1% of the total references in 2000 to 5.4% in 2005. Internet references were not readily accessible for 40 of 51 Internet references in 2000 (78%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 65% to 88%), 161 of 286 Internet references in 2003 (56%; 95% CI 50% to 62%), and 111 of 249 Internet references in 2005 (45%; 95% CI 39% to 51%).

Pediatric risk assesment; insights from echocardiography and electrocardiography,17.584576,6.756719,2021-06-28,"Patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who remain comatose after initial resuscitation are at high risk of morbidity and mortality attributable to the ensuing post–cardiac arrest syndrome. Systemic inflammation constitutes a major component of post–cardiac arrest syndrome, and IL-6 (interleukin-6) levels are associated with post–cardiac arrest syndrome severity. The IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab could potentially dampen inflammation in post–cardiac arrest syndrome. The objective of the present trial was to determine the efficacy of tocilizumab to reduce systemic inflammation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of a presumed cardiac cause and thereby potentially mitigate organ injury. METHODS: Eighty comatose patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomly assigned 1:1 in a double-blinded placebo-controlled trial to a single infusion of tocilizumab or placebo in addition to standard of care including targeted temperature management. Blood samples were sequentially drawn during the initial 72 hours. The primary end point was the reduction in C-reactive protein response from baseline until 72 hours in patients treated with tocilizumab evaluated by mixed-model analysis for a treatment-by-time interaction. Secondary end points (main) were the marker of inflammation: leukocytes; the markers of myocardial injury: creatine kinase myocardial band, troponin T, and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide; and the marker of brain injury: neuron-specific enolase. These secondary end points were analyzed by mixed-model analysis. RESULTS: The primary end point of reducing the C-reactive protein response by tocilizumab was achieved since there was a significant treatment-by-time interaction, P<0.0001, and a profound effect on C-reactive protein levels. Systemic inflammation was reduced by treatment with tocilizumab because both C-reactive protein and leukocyte levels were markedly reduced, tocilizumab versus placebo at 24 hours: –84% [–90%; –76%] and –34% [–46%; –19%], respectively, both P<0.001. Myocardial injury was also reduced, documented by reductions in creatine kinase myocardial band and troponin T; tocilizumab versus placebo at 12 hours: –36% [–54%; –11%] and –38% [–53%; –19%], respectively, both P<0.01. N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide was similarly reduced by active treatment; tocilizumab versus placebo at 48 hours: –65% [–80%; –41%], P<0.001. There were no differences in survival or neurological outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with tocilizumab resulted in a significant reduction in systemic inflammation and myocardial injury in comatose patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

GVD meta-analyses show highly personalized viromes, reveal that inter-study variability from technical artifacts is larger than any “disease” effect at the population level, and document how viral diversity changes from human infancy into senescence. Together, this compact foundational resource, these standardization guidelines, and these meta-analysis findings provide a systematic toolkit to help maximize our understanding of viral roles in health and disease.","Gregory, Ann C.; Zablocki, Olivier; Zayed, Ahmed A.; Howell, Allison; Bolduc, Benjamin; Sullivan, Matthew B.",Cell Host Microbe,381,16

Approaches to this task have been varied, relying on differing sequencing methods and computational analyses. We used a novel computation workflow based on amplicon sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 spike domains in order to track viral populations in wastewater. As part of this workflow, we developed a program, SAM Refiner, that has a variety of outputs, including novel variant reporting as well as functions designed to remove polymerase chain reaction (PCR) generated chimeric sequences. With these methods, we were able to track viral population dynamics over time.

The global impact of SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated how outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging infections can lead to pandemics of significant public health and socio-economic burden. Vaccination is one of the most effective approaches to protect against infectious diseases, and to date, multiple vaccines have been successfully used to protect against and eradicate both viral and bacterial pathogens. The main criterion of vaccine efficacy is the induction of specific humoral and cellular immune responses, and it is well established that immunogenicity depends on the type of vaccine as well as the route of delivery. In addition, antigen delivery to immune organs and the site of injection can potentiate efficacy of the vaccine. In light of this, microvesicles have been suggested as potential vehicles for antigen delivery as they can carry various immunogenic molecules including proteins, nucleic acids and polysaccharides directly to target cells. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of microvesicle biogenesis and the role of microvesicles in infectious diseases. Further, we discuss the application of microvesicles as a novel and effective vaccine delivery system.","Shkair, Layaly; Garanina, Ekaterina E.; Stott, Robert J.; Foster, Toshana L.; Rizvanov, Albert A.; Khaiboullina, Svetlana F.",Int J Mol Sci,381,16

Although young adults with multiple sclerosis (yawMS) might be at greater risk of developing psychological distress linked to the pandemic, they might also be able to adapt to stress and find meaning in adverse life events. The aim of the present study was to explore benefit finding in response to the pandemic in a sample of yawMS. As part of a larger project, data were collected using a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Benefit finding was analysed using a qualitative thematic approach; descriptive and inferential statistics were performed to describe the sample and compare sub-groups. Out of 247 respondents with mostly relapsing-remitting MS, 199 (31.9 ± 6.97 years) reported at least one benefit. Qualitative analysis showed that during the pandemic yawMS found benefits related to three themes: personal growth, relational growth, and existential growth. No differences in benefit finding were found between age sub-groups (18–30 vs. 31–45). Participants reported a wide range of benefits, some of which seem to be specific to MS or the pandemic. Results have been transformed into tips to be introduced in clinical practice to promote resilience in yawMS through meaning making.","Poli, Silvia; Rimondini, Michela; Gajofatto, Alberto; Mazzi, Maria Angela; Busch, Isolde Martina; Gobbin, Francesca; Schena, Federico; Del Piccolo, Lidia; Donisi, Valeria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,381,1

While olfactory alterations may be observed in patients with rhinovirus, influenza virus, or parainfluenza virus infection, they are typically explained by nasal obstruction with mucus or direct epithelial damage; in the case of SARS-CoV-2, olfactory alterations may present without nasal congestion with mucus. We performed a study of patients presenting olfactory/gustatory alterations in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon. Material and Methods: We performed a descriptive, cross-sectional, observational study of the clinical characteristics of olfactory/gustatory alterations using a self-administered, anonymous online questionnaire. Results: A total of 909 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and olfactory/gustatory alterations responded to the questionnaire in the 4-day data collection period; 824 cases (90.65%) reported simultaneous olfactory and gustatory involvement. Patients' responses to the questionnaire revealed ageusia (581, 64.1% of respondents), hypogeusia (256, 28.2%), dysgeusia (22, 2.4%), anosmia (752 82.8%), hyposmia (142, 15.6%), and dysosmia (8, 0.9%). Fifty-four percent (489) did not report concomitant nasal congestion or mucus.

Empirical studies often have people rate the evolved nature of outgroups and prior work suggests immigrants are common victims of less-than-human treatment. Despite existing work that suggests who dehumanizes particular outgroups and who is often dehumanized, the extant literature knows less about why people dehumanize outgroups such as immigrants. The current work takes up this opportunity by examining why people dehumanize immigrants said to be illegal and how measurement format affects dehumanization ratings. Participants (N = 672) dehumanized such immigrants more if their ratings were made on a slider versus clicking images of hominids, an effect most pronounced for Republicans. Dehumanization was negatively associated with warmth toward illegal immigrants and the perceived unhappiness felt by illegal immigrants from U.S. immigration policies. Finally, most dehumanization is not entirely blatant but instead, captured by virtuous violence and affect as well, suggesting the many ways that dehumanization can manifest as predicted by theory. This work offers a mechanistic account for why people dehumanize immigrants and addresses how survey measurement artifacts (e.g., clicking on images of hominids vs. using a slider) affect dehumanization rates. We discuss how these data extend dehumanization theory and inform empirical research.","Markowitz, David M.; Slovic, Paul",PLoS One,381,1

To determine the progression of disease and determinants of hospitalization, we conducted a prospective cohort study. METHODS: Outpatient adults with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were recruited by phone between April 21 and July 23, 2020, after receiving outpatient or emergency department testing within a large health network in Maryland, United States. Symptoms were collected by participants on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28, and portable pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SaO(2)), heart rate, and temperature were collected for 15 consecutive days. Baseline demographics, comorbid conditions, and vital signs were evaluated for risk of subsequent hospitalization using negative binomial and logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 118 SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients, the median age (interquartile range [IQR]) was 56.0 (50.0–63.0) years, and 50 (42.4%) were male. Among individuals in the first week of illness (n = 61), the most common symptoms included weakness/fatigue (65.7%), cough (58.8%), headache (45.6%), chills (38.2%), and anosmia (27.9%). Participants returned to their usual health a median (IQR) of 20 (13–38) days from symptom onset, and 66.0% of respondents were at their usual health during the fourth week of illness.

Many countries have now adopted a structured approach to trauma management in which ultrasound is used as a primary evaluation tool. While its use has direct therapeutic benefits, many artifacts and pitfalls are inherent to the technique. Knowledge of the most frequently encountered pitfalls in practice could thus help reduce the risk of error and lead to more accurate trauma assessments. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates a potential pitfall caused by seminal vesicles during focused assessment with sonography for trauma examinations of the male pelvis performed by an emergency physician with experience in point-of-care ultrasound. METHODS: We took five static and five dynamic (3-s loops) transverse ultrasound images of the pelvis in five healthy males. The images and videos were then incorporated into an online survey and emailed through the World Interactive Network Focused On Critical UltraSound (WINFOCUS) in France and the Ultrasound and Emergency Medicine (UEM) Organization in Belgium. A questionnaire asked anonymous participants to assess the presence of free fluid in the static and dynamic images and to share information about their training and experience in point-of-care ultrasound. To validate the static and dynamic images, the survey was sent to three external radiologists for independent verification. RESULTS: A total of 191 individuals responded fully or partially to the survey, 114 of whom completed it. Among the 114 participants who completed the survey, the misinterpretation rate was 0.55 (95CI 0.51–0.60) for all static and dynamic ultrasound transverse pelvic views. The misinterpretation rate was 0.61 (95CI 0.55–0.66) and 0.50 (95CI 0.45–0.55) for static and dynamic ultrasound transverse pelvic views, respectively. The three external radiologists answered the questionnaire correctly without misinterpreting the survey ultrasound views.

The aim of this study is to assess whether two different approaches of administering a test to assess traits of eating disorders (EDs), orthorexia nervosa (ON) and muscle dysmorphia (MD) by email recruitment and online completion (web-based survey—WBS) and by in person recruitment and paper-and-pencil completion (paper-based survey—PBS), gives different results. METHODS: During 2 consecutive academic years, a self-reported questionnaire consisting of questions about personal characteristics and three tests for the evaluation of ON (ORTO-15), MD (MDDI-ITA), and EDs (EAT-26) were administered to two groups of undergraduates, respectively, as a WBS and a PBS. RESULTS: The WBS response rate was 6.7% (N = 137), and the PBS response rate was 86.5% (N = 372). The WBS group showed a statistically significant higher prevalence of students with eating disordered behaviours (21.2% vs 5.4%) and registered a higher mean score on the EAT-26 test (13.5 ± 11.1 vs 6.0 ± 8.0); no differences between the two groups emerged for ON and MD prevalence and test scores. Moreover, in the WBS group, the number of students with one or more tests with test scores above the cut-off values was significantly higher (46.0% vs 32.3%).

The mutual information method, entropy hierarchical clustering and other methods were improved through Excel and the TCM inheritance auxiliary platform V2.5 to mine the rules and characteristics of medication. Results The selected 157 prescriptions contained a total of 130 TCMs. The top five TCMs with the highest use frequency were Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma (86), Astragali Radix (80), Lonicerea Japonicae Flos (70), Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (62), Saposhnikoviae Radix (60). In accordance with TCM efficacy classification, most of them were medicines for qi-tonifying (279), followed by medicines for clearing heat and drying dampness (163), dispelling pathogenic wind-cold (126), resolving dampness (111), as well as dispelling pathogenic wind-heat (99). The characteristics of four-natures of the selected medicines are as follows: most of them were cold (59), followed by warm (38) and mild (21). In terms of five-taste, most of them were sweet (26) and acrid-and-bitter (24), followed by sweet-and-bitter (20), bitter (20) and acrid (15). For the meridian attribution, the five-zang organs and six-fu organs were all involved, most of them attributed to lung meridian (80), followed by stomach meridian (57) and spleen meridian (40). Based on association rule analysis, 12 commonly used medicine combinations with two or three TCMs were found. The commonly used medicinal pairs included Astragali Radix and Saposhnikoviae Radix (51), Astragali Radix and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (46), Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma and Saposhnikoviae Radix (43), Astragali Radix and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma and Saposhnikoviae Radix (38), Forsythiae Fructus and Astragali Radix (37), and so on. In addition, 14 core combinations of medicines were obtained by complex system entropy cluster analysis, on this basis, six new prescriptions were screened out based on unsupervised entropy hierarchical clustering analysis. According to The Catalogue of Edible TraditionalChineseMedicinalMaterials, TraditionalChineseMedicinalMaterials for Health Food, and New Resources of Food published by National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, there are 35 species belonging to the group of edible traditionalChinesemedicinalmaterials, 20 species belonging to the group of new resources of food, 31 species belonging to the group of traditionalChinesemedicinalmaterials for health food, 19.11% of the preventive oral prescriptions for COVID-19 were composed of the medicines belonging to the above three groups. Besides, there are 11 toxic species, and 24.84% of the preventive oral prescriptions for COVID-19 contained toxic traditional Chinese medicines. Conclusion We found that invigorating qi and resolving dampness were the main treatment used to prevent for COVID-19, combined with the methods for strengthening vital energy and eliminating pathogenic factors. Most of the preventive oral prescriptions for COVID-19 were treated in lung, spleen and stomach meridians. In the process of selecting prescriptions and using TCMs to prevent for COVID-19, the safety of preventive medicines was also emphasized. And the theory of “Preventive Treatment of Disease” was embodied in these preventive oral prescriptions for COVID-19.

Despite being an issue of global impact, the public policy strategies in fighting this pandemic depend on each country. This scenario demands studies to describe and explore these policies' institutionality. In this context, a question raises on how the biggest economies of the Portuguese language, Brazil and Portugal, have conducted the public policy agenda against the pandemic. METHODS: A comparative, qualitative, and descriptive study of the public policy agenda setting in Brazil and Portugal to fight against the pandemic was conducted through bibliographic and document research. The theoretical axis adopted was the Institutional Economy and the elaborations and management of public policy, mainly Douglas North, Geoffrey M. Hodgson, and Amatya Sen’s studies. RESULTS: The combat against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was translated in a search for urgency analytical theories, elaboration, implementation, and evaluation of public policies in Brazil and Portugal. In both countries, social restriction strategies were adopted such as closing public places, stores, and schools. Also, some economic actions were established to mitigate these restrictions’ impacts, more limited in Brazil as a neoliberal picture of the current government. CONCLUSIONS: The results pointed to differences and similarities in Portuguese and Brazilian agendas, especially with the virus transmission mitigating strategies and the social and economic assistance, being Brazil suffering from the negationism culture that promoted contagion and mortality acceleration.","Ximenes, Ana Carênina Albuquerque; Macedo, Ana Angélica Mathias; Joaquim, João José; Pinto, Marta Vasconcelos; Mendes, Fernando",Eur J Public Health,381,16

These factors lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) which is common among CKD patients. Supplementation with high amylose maize resistant starch type 2 (RS-2) can change the composition of the gut microbiota, and reduce markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with end-stage renal disease. However, the impact of RS-2 supplementation has not been extensively studied in CKD patients not on dialysis. Aerobic exercise training lowers certain markers of inflammation in CKD patients. Whether combining aerobic training along with RS-2 supplementation has an additive effect on the aforementioned biomarkers in predialysis CKD patients has not been previously investigated. METHODS: The study is being conducted as a 16-week, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel arm, randomized controlled trial. Sixty stage 3–4 CKD patients (ages of 30–75 years) are being randomized to one of four groups: RS-2 & usual care, RS-2 & aerobic exercise, placebo (cornstarch) & usual care and placebo & exercise. Patients attend four testing sessions: Two baseline (BL) sessions with follow up visits 8 (wk8) and 16 weeks (wk16) later. Fasting blood samples, resting brachial and central blood pressures, and arterial stiffness are collected at BL, wk8 and wk16.

Blood samples will be assayed for p-cresyl sulphate and indoxyl sulphate, c-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 6, interleukin 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, malondialdehyde, 8-isoprostanes F2a, endothelin-1 and nitrate/nitrite. Following BL, subjects are randomized to their group. Individuals randomized to conditions involving exercise will attend three supervised moderate intensity (55–65% peak oxygen uptake) aerobic training sessions (treadmills, bikes or elliptical machine) per week for 16 weeks. DISCUSSION: This study has the potential to yield information about the effect of RS-2 supplementation on key biomarkers believed to impact upon the development of CVD in patients with CKD. We are examining whether there is an additive effect of exercise training and RS-2 supplementation on these key variables.

The SARS CoV‐2 pandemic, and the complete lockdown required during the first wave in most countries are stressors for pregnant women and can lead to anxiety and depression during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to explore depression and anxiety symptoms, and social support in pregnant women during the SARS CoV‐2 lockdown, as well as to explore demographic risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed at Hospital Universitari Vall d’Hebron, Barcelona, including pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic during the SARS‐CoV2 lockdown period. Three questionnaires were administered to study depression (EPDS), anxiety (STAI) and Social Support (MOS‐SSS). STAI state (STAIs) described the actual state of anxiety and the STAI trait (STAIt) described the trait of anxiety. A cut‐off of 10 for EPDS and 40 for STAI was considered to be clinically relevant. The main outcome measures were depression and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 217 women were invited to participate, and 204 accepted (94%). From these, 164 filled in the EPDS, 109 STAI and 159 MOS‐SSS questionnaires: 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.5%‐45.7%) (62/164) of women showed an EPDS result ≥10, 59.6% (95% CI 49.8%‐68.8%) (65/109) a STAI state (STAIs) ≥40, and 58.7% (95% CI 48.9%‐67.9%) (64/109) a STAI trait (STAIt) ≥40. Regression analysis showed that mental health disorder, Latin American origin and lack of social support were independent risk factors for anxiety symptoms in the STAIs (P = .032, P = .040 and P = .029, respectively). Regarding depressive symptoms, maternal body mass index, mental health disorders and social support were independent factors (P = .013, P = .015 and P = .000, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A lockdown scenario during the first wave of the SARS‐CoV 2 pandemic increased the symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant women, particularly affecting those with less social support.","Brik, Maia; Sandonis, Miguel Angel; Fernández, Sara; Suy, Anna; Parramon‐Puig, Gemma; Maiz, Nerea; Dip, Maria Emilia; Ramos‐Quiroga, Josep Antoni; Carreras, Elena",Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,381,21

An important goal was to provide information about the diffusion of a communicable disease without being dependent on centralised storage of information about individual patients or revealing patient-identifiable information. METHODS: The method applied is rooted in the engineering paradigm involving phases of analysis, system specification, design, implementation, and testing. The requirements were established from earlier projects’ conclusions and analysis of disease outbreaks. The requirements were validated by a literature study of syndromic and disease surveillance systems. The system was tested on simulated EHR databases generated from microbiology laboratory data. RESULTS: A requirements list that a syndromic and disease surveillance system should meet, and an open source system, “The Snow Agent system”, has been developed. The Snow Agent system is a distributed system for monitoring the status of a population's health by distributing processes to, and extracting epidemiological data directly from, the electronic health records (EHR) system in a geographic area. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic and disease surveillance tools should be able to operate at all levels in the health systems and across national borders. Such systems should avoid transferring patient identifiable data, support two-way communications and be able to define and incorporate new and unknown diseases and syndrome definitions that should be reported by the system. The initial tests of the Snow Agent system shows that it will easily scale to national level in Norway.","Bellika, Johan Gustav; Hasvold, Toralf; Hartvigsen, Gunnar",Int J Med Inform,381,32

Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated in 276 patients with plasma cell neoplasms after vaccination with either the BNT162b2 or the AZD1222 vaccine, on days 1 (before the first vaccine shot), 22, and 50. Patients with MM (n = 213), SMM (n = 38), and MGUS (n = 25) and 226 healthy controls were enrolled in the study (NCT04743388). Vaccination with either two doses of the BNT162b2 or one dose of the AZD1222 vaccine leads to lower production of NAbs in patients with MM compared with controls both on day 22 and on day 50 (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Furthermore, MM patients showed an inferior NAb response compared with MGUS on day 22 (p = 0.009) and on day 50 (p = 0.003). Importantly, active treatment with either anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) or belantamab mafodotin and lymphopenia at the time of vaccination were independent prognostic factors for suboptimal antibody response following vaccination. In conclusion, MM patients have low humoral response following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, especially under treatment with anti-CD38 or belamaf. This underlines the need for timely vaccination, possibly during a treatment-free period, and for continuous vigilance on infection control measures in non-responders.","Terpos, Evangelos; Gavriatopoulou, Maria; Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Ioannis; Briasoulis, Alexandros; Gumeni, Sentiljana; Malandrakis, Panagiotis; Fotiou, Despina; Papanagnou, Eleni-Dimitra; Migkou, Magdalini; Theodorakakou, Foteini; Roussou, Maria; Eleutherakis-Papaiakovou, Evangelos; Kanellias, Nikolaos; Trougakos, Ioannis P.; Kastritis, Efstathios; Dimopoulos, Meletios A.",Blood Cancer J,381,20

In recent years, however, this paradigm has shifted: Cells of the innate immune system appear to be able to gain memory characteristics after transient stimulation, resulting in an enhanced response upon secondary challenge. This phenomenon has been called trained immunity. Trained immunity is characterized by nonspecific increased responsiveness, mediated via extensive metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming. Trained immunity explains the heterologous effects of vaccines, which result in increased protection against secondary infections. However, in chronic inflammatory conditions, trained immunity can induce maladaptive effects and contribute to hyperinflammation and progression of cardiovascular disease, autoinflammatory syndromes, and neuroinflammation. In this review we summarize the current state of the field of trained immunity, its mechanisms, and its roles in both health and disease.","Bekkering, Siroon; Domínguez-Andrés, Jorge; Joosten, Leo A B; Riksen, Niels P; Netea, Mihai G",Annu Rev Immunol,381,16

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data of teleconsultations provided in the department of Strabismus, Paediatric and Neuro-ophthalmology was done. Patients with optic nerve related disorders were excluded. Study period was one month. Statistical analysis of collected data was done using Microsoft excel. RESULTS: A total of 198 patients were provided teleconsultations (an average of seven teleconsultations/day). The final analysis included 161 patients after excluding optic nerve related disorders. The median age was seven years. We had a near equal gender distribution (53% males and 47% females) of whom a third were new cases. Video calling was used in 14%, review of clinical photos shared was used in 53%. Rest of the 33% were given telephonic advice.

The critical feature of this model is that the community is modelled as a small-world network of interconnected nodes. Each node is linked to a fixed number of immediate neighbors and a random number of geographically remote nodes. Transmission can only propagate between linked nodes. This model exhibits two features typical of SARS transmission: geographically localized outbreaks and “super-spreaders”. Neither of these features are evident in standard susceptible-infected-removed models of disease transmission. Our analysis indicates that “super-spreaders” may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant. Moreover, we find that nosocomial transmission in Hong Kong directly contributed to the severity of the outbreak and that by limiting individual exposure time to 3–5 days the extent of the SARS epidemic would have been minimal.","Small, Michael; Tse, C.K.",Physica A,381,16

To track the emergence as well as the persistence of mutations during the early stage of the pandemic, a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 whole proteome sequences has been performed by considering manually curated 31,389 whole genome sequences from 84 countries. Among the 7 highly recurring (percentage frequency≥10%) mutations (Nsp2:T85I, Nsp6:L37F, Nsp12:P323L, Spike:D614G, ORF3a:Q57H, N protein:R203K and N protein:G204R), N protein:R203K and N protein: G204R are co-occurring (dependent) mutations. Nsp12:P323L and Spike:D614G often appear simultaneously. The highly recurring Spike:D614G, Nsp12:P323L and Nsp6:L37F as well as moderately recurring (percentage frequency between ≥1 and <10%) ORF3a:G251V and ORF8:L84S mutations have led to4 major clades in addition to a clade that lacks high recurring mutations. Further, the occurrence of ORF3a:Q57H&Nsp2:T85I, ORF3a:Q57H and N protein:R203K&G204R along with Nsp12:P323L&Spike:D614G has led to 3 additional sub-clades. Similarly, occurrence of Nsp6:L37F and ORF3a:G251V together has led to the emergence of a sub-clade. Nonetheless, ORF8:L84S does not occur along with ORF3a:G251V or Nsp6:L37F. Intriguingly, ORF3a:G251V and ORF8:L84S are found to occur independent of Nsp12:P323L and Spike:D614G mutations. These clades have evolved during the early stage of the pandemic and have disseminated across several countries. Further, Nsp10 is found to be highly resistant to mutations, thus, it can be exploited for drug/vaccine development and the corresponding gene sequence can be used for the diagnosis. Concisely, the study reports the SARS-CoV-2 antigens diversity across the globe during the early stage of the pandemic and facilitates the understanding of viral evolution.","Patro, L Ponoop Prasad; Sathyaseelan, Chakkarai; Uttamrao, Patil Pranita; Rathinavelan, Thenmalarchelvi",Infect Genet Evol,381,16

India was a major participant in this process. A pandemic has both direct and indirect effects. Human reactions to mass illness both mitigate and enhance these effects. The networks of transmission are paralleled by networks of private and public information. But aggregated information only becomes available as governmental information systems take shape. This article explains the use of quarantine as emerging from both. It then explains why it was introduced to India only after 1800. It then looks at three great pandemics: cholera, bubonic plague and lethal influenza and governmental and societal responses to each of these. The article analyses the subsidence of pandemics into chronic presences (‘background’) that nonetheless contributed significantly ill-health, poverty and early death for hundreds of millions. But there is a paradox after Independence. Successful state action in independent India was nevertheless accompanied by the effective collapse of government information systems.

Long hours of UER can lead to excessive stress on the body, resulting in musculoskeletal injuries (MSKI). UER is not a uniform sport and events can differ considerably in distance (over 42.195 km), time (e.g., events over 6 h) and multi-day or multi-stage events on various surfaces (e.g., track, on-road, off-road). The aims of this scoping review were therefore: (1) to examine the current evidence of MSKI, providing a synthesis of the most common MSKI by anatomical region and specific diagnosis; (2) categorize MSKI by type of UER activity (competition: time-limited; multi-stage; continuous UER events and training); (3) describe knowledge gaps in the literature and provide advice on potential further research. Our electronic literature search (PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science) identified a total of 13 studies (9 in competition, and 4 in training). Anatomical site, diagnosis and rate of injuries differ between competition and training as well as between different UER types. MSKI are observed in 18% of multi-stage events (0.7–1.8 injuries/runner and 7.2 injuries/1000 h). Most MSKI involve the lower leg (35.0%), ankle (16.8%), knee (13.1%) and foot (12.6%), with main diagnosis of medial tibial stress syndrome (30.1%) and patella femoral pain syndrome (PFPS; 7.2%). Single, continuous UER events differ between a 1005 km road race with almost all of the injuries due to overuse, with the main anatomical site of the knee (31%), ankle (28%) and lower leg (14%) and main diagnosis of PFPS (15.6%), compared to a 65 km trail race, with 32.8% of MSKI, mainly on the foot [plantar fasciitis (28.6%)], ankle [sprain (28.6%)] and knee. Timed-UER events (injury rate of 2.1 injuries/athlete) observed most injuries on the ankle (36%) and knee (19%), with the main diagnosis of tendinitis of the foot dorsiflexors (30%). Injuries during training most commonly affect, the back (42%), and knee (40%) and bone stress injuries (22%). Main diagnoses include ankle sprain (18%), iliotibial band injury (16%) and Achilles tendinopathy (11%). Future considerations include examining MSKI in different UER events, environments and surfaces, and on larger study populations. Establishing risk factors, examining sex differences and using a standard reporting system of MSKI in UER are also important.","Scheer, Volker; Krabak, Brian J.",Front Physiol,381,29

Many studies have shown that transient delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) or adenovirus-mediated RNA interfere (RNAi) could potentially inhibit porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication in vivo and in vitro. Here, we applied RNAi to produce transgenic (TG) pigs that constitutively expressed PRRSV-specific siRNA derived from small hairpin RNA (shRNA). First, we evaluated siRNA expression in the founding and F1 generation pigs and confirmed stable transmission. Then, we detected the expression of IFN-β and protein kinase R (PKR) and found no difference among TG, non-transgenic (NTG), and wild-type pigs. Lastly, the F1 generation pigs, including TG and NTG piglets, were challenged with 3 × 10(4.5) TCID(50) of JXA1, a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV). Our results showed that the in vivo siRNA expression substantially reduced the serum HP-PRRSV titers and increased survival time by 3 days when TG pigs were compared with the NTG controls. These data suggested that RNAi-based genetic modification might be used to breed viral-resistant livestock with stable siRNA expression with no complications of siRNA toxicity.","Li, Li; Li, Qiuyan; Bao, Yonghua; Li, Jinxiu; Chen, Zhisheng; Yu, Xiuling; Zhao, Yaofeng; Tian, Kegong; Li, Ning",J Biotechnol,381,15

In the context that “a crisis is a terrible thing to waste,” as disruptive as the pandemic has been to traditional practices – both clinically and educationally – opportunities have also presented. Clinical benefits have included the propulsion of clinical innovation, including development of novel vaccines; accelerated understanding of multiplex ventilation, etc. Approaches to educating students and other learners have also changed radically, with suspension of live teaching in most instances and a precipitous transition to virtual instruction. This perspective considers a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) associated with the coronavirus pandemic in healthcare, focusing on the implications for education. While the obvious disadvantages (weaknesses) regard the loss of face-to-face interaction with all of its consequences, e.g., isolation, risks to camaraderie, loss of hands-on training opportunities, and loss of in-person celebratory events like graduations and end-of-training celebrations, there are clearly offsetting strengths. These include growing experience with virtual teaching and virtual learning strategies; the invitation to codify best virtual teaching practices; a tightening of alignment between undergraduate and graduate medical education, e.g., around virtual interview strategies; and opportunities both for self-reflection and a commitment to act virtuously. On balance, the pandemic has created the opportunity – indeed the necessity – to innovate in practice and in education, making the landscape ripe for creative practice, new mastery, and the concomitant benefits to learners and to educators.","Stoller, James K.",Chest,381,20

The novelty of SARS-CoV-2 produced significant gaps in harmonization of definitions, data collection, and outcome reporting to identify patients who would benefit from potential interventions. METHODS: We describe a multicenter collaboration to develop a comprehensive data collection tool for the evaluation and management of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. The proposed tool was developed by a multidisciplinary working group of infectious disease physicians, intensivists, and infectious diseases/ Antimicrobial Stewardship Pharmacists. The working group regularly reviewed literature to select important patient characteristics, diagnostics, and outcomes for inclusion. The data collection tool consisted of spreadsheets developed to collect data from the electronic medical record and track the clinical course following treatments. RESULTS: Data collection focused on demographics and exposure epidemiology, prior medical history and medications, signs and symptoms, diagnostic test results, interventions, clinical outcomes and complications. During the pilot validation phase, there was <10% missing data for most domains and components. Team members noted improved efficiency and decision making by using the tool during interdisciplinary rounds. CONCLUSIONS: We present the development of a COVID-19 data collection tool and propose its use to effectively assemble harmonized data of hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. This tool can be used by clinicians, researchers, and quality improvement healthcare teams. It has the potential to facilitate interdisciplinary rounds, provide comparisons across different hospitalized populations, and adapt to emerging challenges posed by the pandemic.","Morris, Stephen R; Natori, Yoichiro; Salguero, Douglas; Mantero, Alejandro; Ma, Ruixuan; de Lima Corvino, Daniela F; Fernandez, Anmary; Lazo, Alex; Vu, Christine A; Bjork, Lauren; Serota, David; Quevedo, Jennifer; Vega, Ana; Maxam, Meshell; DeRonde, Kailynn; Barreiro, Pablo; Raccamarich, Patricia; Romero Alvarez, Maria; Skiada, Dimitra; Balan, Shuba; Ramanathan, Maya; Holt, Gregory; Gonzales-Zamora, Jose; Baracco, Gio J; Doblecki-Lewis, Susanne; Abbo, Lilian M; Lichtenberger, Paola N; Alcaide, Maria L",Open Forum Infect Dis,381,20

This study was aimed at describing clinical characteristics and outcomes of admitted patients with mild COVID-19 illness in the initial phase of pandemic in India. Design - Retrospective (observational ) study. Setting - COVID facilities under AIIMS, New Delhi, where, isolation facilities were designed to manage patients with mild illness and dedicated COVID ICUs was created to cater patients with moderate to severe illness. Participants - Patients aged 18 years or more, with confirmed illness were eligible for enrolment. Patients who were either asymptomatic or mildly ill at presentation were included. Patients with moderate to severe illness at admission, or incomplete clinical symptomatology records were excluded. Methods - Data regarding demographic profile, comorbidities, clinical features, hospital course, treatment, details of results of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 done at baseline and at day 14, chest radiographs (wherever available) as well as laboratory parameters was obtained retrospectively from the hospital records. Main outcome measures - Final outcome was noted in terms of course of the disease, patients discharged, still admitted (at time of conclusion of study) or death. Results -Out of 231 cases included, majority were males(78.3%) with a mean age of 39.8 years. Comorbidities were present in 21.2% of patients, diabetes mellitus and hypertension being most common. The most common symptoms were dry cough(81, 35%), fever(64, 27.7%), sore throat(36, 15.6%), and dyspnoea(24, 10.4%); asymptomatic infection was noted in 108(46.8%) patients.

The method uses fluorescent sensors (i.e. molecular beacons) designed to detect COVID-19 RNA or any RNA of interest, concurrent with an internal control without the need for amplification. The molecular beacons are stem-loop structures in which a ~10 nucleotide loop region has the complementary sequence of a region of the target RNA, and a fluorophore and quencher are placed on the 5' and 3' ends of the stem. The energy of hybridization of the loop with its target is designed to be greater than the hybridization energy of the energy of the stem so that when the beacon encounters its target RNA, the structure opens resulting in dequenching of the fluorophore. Here, we designed a COVID-19 beacon that is completely quenched in its native form and undergoes a 50-fold increase in fluorescence when exposed to nanomolar amounts of synthetic viral oligonucleotide. No changes in intensity are seen when control RNA is added. A control beacon to a human GAPDH RNA, chosen for its high levels in saliva, behaved similar to the COVID-19 beacon. This increase in fluorescence with beacon opening can be completely reversed upon addition of single stranded DNA complementary to COVID-19 beacon loop region. Beacons can be attached to an insert matrix allowing their use in concentrated form and can be made from morphilino oligonucleotides that are resistant to RNases. We present an analysis of the parameters that will allow the development of test strips to detect virus in aerosol, body fluids and community waste.","Scarlata, S.; Yerramilli, V. S.",,381,1

In 2015, updated guidelines were released to ensure that: (1) revisions reflect the public’s values and (2) the triage protocol is substantiated by evidence-based clinical data. We summarize the development and content of the 2015 Guidelines compared with the 2007 version, emphasizing new/revised aspects of the ethical considerations and clinical protocol. METHODS: We compared the 2007 and 2015 guidelines, with particular emphasis on the ethical issues and clinical protocols.

We aimed to test our hypothesis that discontinuation of chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19. METHODS: ACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany. Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days. Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score. Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUC(SOFA)), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and death. Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04353596. FINDINGS: Between April 20, 2020, and Jan 20, 2021, 204 patients (median age 75 years [IQR 66–80], 37% females) were randomly assigned to discontinue (n=104) or continue (n=100) RAS inhibition. Within 30 days, eight (8%) of 104 died in the discontinuation group and 12 (12%) of 100 patients died in the continuation group (p=0·42). There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the discontinuation and continuation group (median [IQR] maximum SOFA score 0·00 (0·00–2·00) vs 1·00 (0·00–3·00); p=0·12). Discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower AUC(SOFA) (0·00 [0·00–9·25] vs 3·50 [0·00–23·50]; p=0·040), mean SOFA score (0·00 [0·00–0·31] vs 0·12 [0·00–0·78]; p=0·040), and 30-day SOFA score (0·00 [10–90th percentile, 0·00–1·20] vs 0·00 [0·00–24·00]; p=0·023). At 30 days, 11 (11%) in the discontinuation group and 23 (23%) in the continuation group had signs of organ dysfunction (SOFA score ≥1) or were dead (p=0·017). There were no significant differences for mechanical ventilation (10 (10%) vs 8 (8%), p=0·87) and admission to intensive care unit (20 [19%] vs 18 [18%], p=0·96) between the discontinuation and continuation group. INTERPRETATION: Discontinuation of RAS-inhibition in COVID-19 had no significant effect on the maximum severity of COVID-19 but may lead to a faster and better recovery. The decision to continue or discontinue should be made on an individual basis, considering the risk profile, the indication for RAS inhibition, and the availability of alternative therapies and outpatient monitoring options.

This has led to many clinical trials being launched in order to try to find ways to combat the disease. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic has been reflected in the methods used in some of these trials. Placebo-controlled randomized trials are considered the gold-standard, however, there are inherent challenges in the use of placebo, especially during COVID-19. We herein review the pros, cons, challenges and limitations of using placebo in clinical trials investigating treatments for COVID-19. We also discuss the importance of viewing research critically, examining the potential impact of placebo use or lack thereof, on blinding and possible biases. This becomes important as we assess the responses to the pandemic in preparation for a future pandemic. Although placebo-controlled clinical trials are the gold standard for clinical research, they may not be practically or ethically feasible during a pandemic. Choices accomplished to design many COVID-19 trials might reflect the unprecedently trying environment in which they were made. However, critical evaluation of the methodology and practice of scientific research remains a crucial part of the scientific process. Even when conducted as randomized double-blinded studies, residual biases may exist and interfere with the study conduct and interpretation of the data. A critical review of all data, remains essential to thoroughly assess the impact of a research study.","Moeller, William J; Potere, Nicola; Bonaventura, Aldo; Vecchiè, Alessandra; Sedhai, Yub R; Caricchio, Roberto; Abbate, Antonio",Minerva med,381,1

As of 19 May 2021, John Hopkins University’s COVID-19 tracking platform reported 3.3 million deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, the World Health Organization has granted emergency use listing (EUL) to six COVID-19 vaccine candidates. However, much of the pathogenesis observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. To gain insight into the contribution of individual accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we used our recently described reverse-genetics system approach to successfully engineer recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rSARS-CoV-2) constructs; we removed individual viral ORF3a, −6, −7a, −7b, and −8 proteins from them, and we characterized the resulting recombinant viruses in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate differences in plaque morphology, with ORF-deficient (ΔORF) viruses producing smaller plaques than those of the wild type (rSARS-CoV-2/WT). However, growth kinetics of ΔORF viruses were like those of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. Interestingly, infection of K18 human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mice with the ΔORF rSARS-CoV-2s identified ORF3a and ORF6 as the major contributors of viral pathogenesis, while ΔORF7a, ΔORF7b, and ΔORF8 rSARS-CoV-2s induced pathology comparable to that of rSARS-CoV-2/WT. This study demonstrates the robustness of our reverse-genetics system to generate rSARS-CoV-2 constructs and the major role for ORF3a and ORF6 in viral pathogenesis, providing important information for the generation of attenuated forms of SARS-CoV-2 for their implementation as live attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Despite great efforts put forward worldwide to combat the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a human health and socioeconomic threat. Insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the contribution of viral proteins to disease outcome remain elusive. Our study aims (i) to determine the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 accessory open reading frame (ORF) proteins to viral pathogenesis and disease outcome and (ii) to develop a synergistic platform combining our robust reverse-genetics system to generate recombinant SARS-CoV-2 constructs with a validated rodent model of infection and disease. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and ORF6 contribute to lung pathology and ultimately disease outcome in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice, while ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 have little impact on disease outcome. Moreover, our combinatory platform serves as a foundation for generating attenuated forms of the virus to develop live attenuated vaccines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","Silvas, Jesus A.; Vasquez, Desarey Morales; Park, Jun-Gyu; Chiem, Kevin; Allué-Guardia, Anna; Garcia-Vilanova, Andreu; Platt, Roy Neal; Miorin, Lisa; Kehrer, Thomas; Cupic, Anastasija; Gonzalez-Reiche, Ana S.; van Bakel, Harm; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Anderson, Tim; Torrelles, Jordi B.; Ye, Chengjin; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis",J Virol,381,16

In particular, this latter feature is capable of capturing the trend fluctuations in the sentiment curve. While the proposed model is extremely general and may be also employed in other contexts, it has been tested on several Twitter data sets and demonstrated greater performances compared to the standard Pólya urn model.

The successful resolution of infection and avoidance of autoimmunity necessitates efficient and timely communication between autophagy and pathways that sense the immune environment. In this article, progress in elucidating mechanisms of crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory signaling cascades will be reviewed. The recent literature indicates that a variety of immune mediators induce or repress autophagy. It is also becoming increasing clear that immune signaling cascades are subject to regulation by autophagy, and that a return to homeostasis following a robust immune response is critically dependent on this pathway. Importantly, examples of non-canonical forms of autophagy in mediating immunity are pervasive. Improved mechanistic understanding of the autophagy machinery offers hope for treating infectious and inflammatory diseases.","Cadwell, Ken",Nature Reviews Immunology,381,16

We lack research testing protective factors across both clinic and care environments. DESIGN: A prospective cohort of adolescents living with HIV (sample n = 969, 55% girls, baseline mean age 13.6) in the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa were interviewed at baseline and 18-month follow-up (2014–2015, 2015–2016). We traced all adolescents ever initiated on treatment in 52 government health facilities (90% uptake, 93% 18-month retention, 1.2% mortality). METHODS: Clinical records were collected; standardized questionnaires were administered by trained data collectors in adolescents’ language of choice. Probit within-between regressions and average adjusted probability calculations were used to examine associations of caregiving and clinic factors with adherence, controlling for household structure, socioeconomic and HIV factors. RESULTS: Past-week ART adherence was 66% (baseline), 65% (follow-up), validated against viral load in subsample. Within-individual changes in three factors were associated with improved adherence: no physical and emotional violence (12.1 percentage points increase in adjusted probability of adherence, P < 0.001), improvement in perceived healthcare confidentiality (7.1 percentage points, P < 0.04) and shorter travel time to the clinic (13.7 percentage points, P < 0.02). In combination, improvement in violence prevention, travel time and confidentiality were associated with 81% probability of ART adherence, compared with 47% with a worsening in all three. CONCLUSION: Adolescents living with HIV need to be safe at home and feel safe from stigma in an accessible clinic. This will require active collaboration between health and child protection systems, and utilization of effective violence prevention interventions.","Cluver, Lucie; Shenderovich, Yulia; Toska, Elona; Rudgard, William E.; Zhou, Siyanai; Orkin, Mark; Haghighat, Roxanna; Chetty, Angelique N.; Kuo, Caroline; Armstrong, Alice; Sherr, Lorraine",AIDS,381,22

Currently, infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of death of over 2.5 million people globally, and there is still no effective curative treatment. Clinically, the severe symptoms caused by COVID-19, in addition to pneumonia, are associated with the development of hyperinflammatory syndrome and thrombosis. It is urgent to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19.

CX3CL1 is abundantly expressed by activated endothelium and is an important regulator of many aspects of endothelial function and dysfunction, including thrombosis. The generation of hypotheses about molecules that could be relevant in well-defined aspects of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 encourages the development of basic and clinical studies, that could help find effective and much needed treatments.","Rivas-Fuentes, Selma; Valdés, Víctor Julián; Espinosa, Blanca; Gorocica-Rosete, Patricia; Salgado-Aguayo, Alfonso",Med Hypotheses,381,1

The SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD147, which are expressed on host cells. Several studies suggest that some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ACE2 might be a risk factor of COVID-19 infection. Genotypes affect ACE2 structure, its serum concentration, and levels of circulating angiotensin (1-7). Moreover, there is evidence that ACE genotype affects the outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treatment, the most severe consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

There is a lack of diversity in the current landscape of academic medicine and strategies are needed to effect change. This module introduced undergraduate and graduate medical trainees to leadership skills and opportunities in curriculum innovation and reform by learning about and interacting with the office of medical education (OME) at their institutions. METHODS: We implemented a workshop using small-group case discussions and didactics to help medical students and residents learn how to: (1) describe the structure and functions of an OME, (2) describe leadership competencies associated with various roles within the OME, and (3) identify opportunities for trainees to engage with the OME on curricular innovation and reform, especially advancing diversity and inclusion. RESULTS: Across three sites, 45 learners completed partial or full workshop evaluations. Of learners, 22 (49%) were not knowledgeable and 13 (29%) were somewhat knowledgeable in identifying leadership opportunities for trainees to become engaged through the OME. There was a statistically significant increase in confidence after the workshop in “discussing an interdisciplinary approach to the creation of a medical education innovation,” and, “assessing the need for curricula change.” Over 90% of attendees agreed learning objectives were met.

Recent studies, however, reported that cardiac injury, as assessed by troponin levels, is associated with a worse outcome in these patients. No study hitherto assessed whether the simple standard electrocardiogram (ECG) may be helpful for risk stratification in these patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 324 consecutive patients admitted to our Emergency Department with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Standard 12-lead ECG recorded on admission was assessed for cardiac rhythm and rate, atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction, abnormal Q/QS wave, ST segment and T wave changes, corrected QT interval, and tachyarrhythmias. At a mean follow-up of 31 ± 11 days, 44 deaths occurred (13.6%). Most ECG variables were significantly associated with mortality, including atrial fibrillation (P = 0.002), increasing heart rate (P = 0.002), presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB; P < 0.001), QRS duration (P <0 .001), a QRS duration of ≥110 ms (P < 0.001), ST segment depression (P < 0.001), abnormal Q/QS wave (P = 0.034), premature ventricular complexes (PVCs; P = 0.051), and presence of any ECG abnormality [hazard ratio (HR) 4.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.40–8.76; P < 0.001]. At multivariable analysis, QRS duration (P = 0.002), QRS duration ≥110 ms (P = 0.03), LBBB (P = 0.014) and presence of any ECG abnormality (P = 0.04) maintained a significant independent association with mortality.

Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), the two major constituents of cannabinoids, and their metabolites are contaminants of emerging concern due to the limited information on their environmental impacts. As well, their releases to the water systems and environment are expected to increase due to recent legalization. Solid-phase extraction is the most common technique for the extraction and pre-concentration of cannabinoids in water samples as well as a clean-up step after the extraction of cannabinoids from solid samples. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is the most common technique used for the analysis of cannabinoids. THC and its metabolites have been detected in wastewater, surface water, and drinking water. In particular, 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) has been detected at concentrations up to 2590 and 169 ng L(-1) in untreated and treated wastewater, respectively, 79.9 ng L(-1) in surface water, and 1 ng L(-1) in drinking water. High removal of cannabinoids has been observed in wastewater treatment plants; this is likely a result of adsorption due to the low aqueous solubility of cannabinoids. Based on the estrogenicity and cytotoxicity studies and modelling, it has been predicted that THC and THC-COOH pose moderate risk for adverse impact on the environment. While chlorination and photo-oxidation have been shown to be effective in the removal of THC-COOH, they also produce by-products that are potentially more toxic than regulated disinfection by-products. The potential of indirect exposure to cannabinoids and their metabolites through recreational water is of great interest. As cannabinoids and especially their by-products may have adverse impacts on the environment and public health, more studies on their occurrence in various types of water and environmental systems, as well as on their environmental toxicity, would be required to accurately assess their impact on the environment and public health.","How, Zuo Tong; El-Din, Mohamed Gamal",Environ Pollut,381,16

Prior research suggests that individuals’ perceived severity of COVID-19 is related to a range of negative emotional and behavioral reactions among the Chinese public. However, scant research has examined the underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon the risk-resilience model, this study proposes that self-control, as a resilient factor, would potentially moderate the association between perceived severity of COVID-19 and mental health problems. Data from a national survey was used to examine this idea. Participants were 4607 citizens from 31 regions in China (M(age) = 23.71 years, 72.5% female) who completed a national survey at the beginning of February 2020. Results of hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for a number of demographic variables, perceived severity of COVID-19 and self-control were positively and negatively related to mental health problems, respectively. More importantly, self-control moderated the “perceived severity of COVID-19–mental health problems” association, with this link attenuating as the levels of self-control increased. These findings suggest that compared to those with high self-control, individuals with low self-control are more vulnerable and are more in need of psychological aids to maintain mental health in the encounter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Practically, enhancing individuals’ self-control ability might be a promising way to improve individuals’ mental health during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Li, Jian-Bin; Yang, An; Dou, Kai; Cheung, Rebecca Y.

It is crucial that circulating DENV strains are identified and monitored, and that their transmission efficiency and association with disease severity is understood. In this study, we analyzed DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 serotypes in 1235 serum samples collected in Myanmar between 2017 and 2019. Whole-genome sequencing of DENV-1-4 demonstrated that most DENV-1-4 strains had been circulating in Myanmar for several years. We also identified the emergence of DENV-3 genotype-I in 2017 samples, which persisted through 2018 and 2019. The emergence of the strain coincided with a period of increased DENV-3 cases and marked changes in the serotype dynamics. Nevertheless, we detected no significant differences between serum viral loads, disease severity, and infection status of individuals infected with different DENV serotypes during the 3-year study. Our results not only identify the spread of a new DENV-3 genotype into Yangon, Myanmar, but also support the importance of DENV evolution in changing the epidemic dynamics in endemic regions.","Soe, Aung Min; Ngwe Tun, Mya Myat; Nabeshima, Takeshi; Myat, Theingi Win; Htun, Moh Moh; Lin, Htin; Hom, Nang Sarm; Inoue, Shingo; Nwe, Khine Mya; Aye, Lynn Pa Pa; Fukuta, Mizuki; Thant, Kyaw Zin; Hasebe, Futoshi; Morita, Kouichi; Shresta, Sujan; Thu, Hlaing Myat; Moi, Meng Ling",Viruses,381,20

The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Zilucoplan in improving oxygenation and short- and long-term outcome of COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a phase 2 academic, prospective, 2:1 randomized, open-label, multi-center interventional study. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients (≥18y old) will be recruited at specialized COVID-19 units and ICUs at 9 Belgian hospitals. The main eligibility criteria are as follows: 1) Inclusion criteria: a. Recent (≥6 days and ≤16 days) SARS-CoV-2 infection. b. Chest CT scan showing bilateral infiltrates within the last 2 days prior to randomisation. c. Acute hypoxia (defined as PaO(2)/FiO(2) below 350 mmHg or SpO2 below 93% on minimal 2 L/min supplemental oxygen). d. Signs of cytokine release syndrome characterized by either high serum ferritin, or high D-dimers, or high LDH or deep lymphopenia or a combination of those. 2) Exclusion criteria: e. Mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours prior to randomisation. f. Active bacterial or fungal infection. g. History of meningococcal disease (due to the known high predisposition to invasive, often recurrent meningococcal infections of individuals deficient in components of the alternative and terminal complement pathways). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients in the experimental arm will receive daily 32,4 mg Zilucoplan subcutaneously and a daily IV infusion of 2g of the antibiotic ceftriaxone for 14 days (or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first) in addition to standard of care. These patients will receive additional prophylactic antibiotics until 14 days after the last Zilucoplan dose: hospitalized patients will receive a daily IV infusion of 2g of ceftriaxone, discharged patients will switch to daily 500 mg of oral ciprofloxacin. The control group will receive standard of care and a daily IV infusion of 2g of ceftriaxone for 1 week (or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first), to control for the effects of antibiotics on the clinical course of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the improvement of oxygenation as measured by mean and/or median change from pre-treatment (day 1) to post-treatment (day 6 and 15 or at discharge, whichever comes first) in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, P(A-a)O(2) gradient and a/A PO(2) ratio. (PAO(2)= Partial alveolar pressure of oxygen, PaO(2)=partial arterial pressure of oxygen, FiO(2)=Fraction of inspired oxygen). RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (Zilucoplan: control). Randomization will be done using an Interactive Web Response System (REDCap). BLINDING (MASKING): In this open-label trial neither participants, caregivers, nor those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 81 patients will be enrolled: 54 patients will be randomized to the experimental arm and 27 patients to the control arm. TRIAL STATUS: ZILU-COV protocol Version 4.0 (June 10 2020). Participant recruitment started on June 23 2020 and is ongoing.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the coronavirus strain causing the respiratory pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To understand the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2, one needs to unravel the intricacies of host immune response to the virus, the viral pathogen’s mode of transmission, and alterations in specific biological pathways in the host allowing viral survival. This review critically analyzes recent research using high-throughput “omics” technologies (including proteomics and metabolomics) on various biospecimens that allow an increased understanding of the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The altered biomolecule profile facilitates an understanding of altered biological pathways. Further, we have performed a meta-analysis of significantly altered biomolecular profiles in COVID-19 patients using bioinformatics tools. Our analysis deciphered alterations in the immune response, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism and other pathways that cumulatively result in COVID-19 disease, including symptoms such as hyperglycemic and hypoxic sequelae.","Aggarwal, Shalini; Acharjee, Arup; Mukherjee, Amrita; Baker, Mark S.; Srivastava, Sanjeeva",J Proteome Res,381,16

We systematically searched for studies of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, as well as neutralization data for variants, and used a previously published statistical model to predict vaccine efficacy against variants. Overall, we estimate the efficacy of mRNA-1273 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against infection caused by the Delta variant to be 25–50% lower than that of prototype strains. The predicted efficacy against symptomatic illness of the mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are 95.1% (UI: 88.4–98.1%) and 80.8% (60.7–92.3%), respectively, which are higher than that of adenovirus-vector vaccines Ad26.COV2.S (44.8%, UI: 29.8–60.1%) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (41.1%, 19.8–62.8%). Taken together, these results suggest that the development of more effective vaccine strategies against the Delta variant may be needed. Finally, the use of neutralizing antibody titers to predict efficacy against variants provides an additional tool for public health decision making, as new variants continue to emerge.","Chen, Xinhua; Azman, Andrew S.; Lu, Wanying; Sun, Ruijia; Zheng, Nan; Ge, Shijia; Deng, Xiaowei; Yang, Juan; Leung, Daniel T.; Yu, Hongjie",medRxiv,381,28

The clinical presentation of MERS varied from asymptomatic to severe bilateral pneumonia, depending on the case definition and surveillance strategies. There are few studies examining the mortality predictors in this disease. In this study, we examined clinical predictors of mortality of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of symptomatic admitted patients to a large tertiary MERS-CoV center in Saudi Arabia over the period from April 2014 to March 2018. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analysis was done using a binary regression model. RESULTS: A total of 314 symptomatic MERS-CoV patients were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 48 (±17.3) years. Of these cases, 78 (24.8%) died. The following parameters were associated with increased mortality, age, WBC, neutrophil count, serum albumin level, use of a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and corticosteroid use. The odd ratio for mortality was highest for CRRT and corticosteroid use (4.95 and 3.85, respectively). The use of interferon-ribavirin was not associated with mortality in this cohort. CONCLUSION: Several factors contributed to increased mortality in this cohort of MERS-CoV patients. Of these factors, the use of corticosteroid and CRRT were the most significant. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these factors were a mark of severe disease or actual contributors to higher mortality.","Alfaraj, Sarah H.; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Assiri, Ayed Y.; Alzahrani, Nojoom A.; Alanazi, Amal A.; Memish, Ziad A.",Travel Med Infect Dis,381,26

Currently, measles is a re-emerging disease in developed countries. MV is usually quantified in infectious units as determined by limiting dilution and counting of plaque forming unit either directly (PFU method) or indirectly from random distribution in microwells (TCID50 method). Both methods are time-consuming (up to several days), cumbersome and, in the case of the PFU assay, possibly operator dependent. METHODS/FINDINGS: A rapid, optimized, accurate, and reliable technique for titration of measles virus was developed based on the detection of virus infected cells by flow cytometry, single round of infection and titer calculation according to the Poisson's law. The kinetics follow up of the number of infected cells after infection with serial dilutions of a virus allowed estimation of the duration of the replication cycle, and consequently, the optimal infection time. The assay was set up to quantify measles virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using antibody labeling of viral glycoprotein, virus encoded fluorescent reporter protein and an inducible fluorescent-reporter cell line, respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, performing the assay takes only 24–30 hours for MV strains, 12 hours for VSV, and 52 hours for HIV-1. The step-by-step procedure we have set up can be, in principle, applicable to accurately quantify any virus including lentiviral vectors, provided that a virus encoded gene product can be detected by flow cytometry.","Grigorov, Boyan; Rabilloud, Jessica; Lawrence, Philip; Gerlier, Denis",PLoS One,381,20

Methods Clinical data of 48 severe and critical patients have been retrieved from medical records and reviewed. The primary outcome is the survival rate. Secondary outcome is the rate of patients requiring intubation. Results In total, 25 patients were finally included in the study.The mean respiratory rate of all 25 patients decreased from 28.4 breaths/min to 21.3 breaths/min. CT results showed increase in lung recruitment. All patients tolerated PP and LP well. No deterioration or severe adverse events associated with PP and LP occurred. All patients recovered and survived without intubation. Follow-up to date showed that all patients have been discharged except one with mild symptoms and positive RNA test. Conclusion: Clinical outcomes of early application of PP and LP in combination with OT and NIV in severe and critical patients with COVID-19 indicated well tolerance of the therapy and resulted in improving patients' oxygenation in a safe and effective manner. Therefore, this strategy can be explored as an early intervention in managing patients in early stage of disease development under the context of pandemic and limited medical resources.","Dong, W.; Gong, Y.; Feng, J.; Bai, L.; Qing, H.; Zhou, P.; Du, Y.; Zhu, J.; Xu, S.",,381,1

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was initiated after approval from Institutional Ethics Committee. A follow-up cohort of 114 children (aged ≥ 2 y) diagnosed and treated for WS at the authors' center were assessed in-person for epilepsy and neurodevelopmental outcomes using Vineland Social Maturity Scale - Malin’s adaptation for Indian children. Subsequently, age at onset, lead-time-to-treatment, etiology, and response to any of the standard therapies were analyzed as possible predictors of these outcomes. RESULTS: Of 114 children (mean age: 55 ± 32 mo, 91 boys), structural etiology was the predominant underlying etiology (79.8%) for WS. At 2 y of age, 64% had ongoing seizures. At the last follow-up, 76% had social quotient < 55, and 39% had cerebral palsy (spastic quadriparesis in 21%). An underlying structural etiology was associated with ongoing seizures [OR (95% CI) 3.5 (1.4–9); p = 0.008] at 2 y of age and poor developmental outcomes [OR (95% CI): 3.3 (1.3–8.9); p = 0.016].

The purpose of this study was to examine the predictive effects of both demographic and psychosocial factors originating with the Health Belief Model on reported intent to adhere to COVID-19 preventive behaviors (e.g., social distancing, hand washing, and not attending large gatherings). METHOD A Qualtrics survey of 500 U.S. adults was conducted to explore the relationships of demographics and psychosocial factors with the intent to adhere to COVID-19 preventive measures. RESULTS Gender was a predictor of taking preventive action, with women more likely to take action. Health Belief Model constructs predicted uptake of most COVID-19 preventive actions, but the constructs often appeared to work independent of the model. Race/ethnicity was an infrequent predictor, but when it did, minorities were less likely to report intent to adhere to COVID-19 preventive behaviors.

The Argentinean case introduces the story of the Ludar in the Greater Buenos Aires Region, a Romanian-speaking sub-group of the Roma, who likely arrived here between 1880 and 1900. Throughout Argentina, most of the Ludar are involved in street vending. The second case concerns the Roma communities of the Rudari from Vâlcea County in Romania, who travel to Sweden primarily to beg. Although the cases seem unrelated, they demonstrate how close engagement with Roma and their socioeconomic mobility allows experimental comparisons of informality and urban development in various parts of world. While their mobile earning strategies are contested by authorities, they enable many to secure a feeling of belonging in a post-crisis context, characterised by rampant racism, greatly restricted welfare provision and increasingly constrained mobility. The newly emerging homes are understood as spaces of hope and dignity and the coping strategies as processes meant to unmake precarity. In this way, the article contributes to an emerging scholarship of Roma resistance, while informing broader contestations of urban marginality.","Teodorescu, Dominic",Geoforum,381,1

Because rats vector a number of pathogens transmissible to people, changes in their behavior has consequences for human health risks. To determine the extent of how stay-at-home measures influenced patterns of rat sightings we: 1) examined the number of rat-related public service requests before and during the period of lockdown in New York City (NYC) and Tokyo, Japan; 2) examined reports made in proximity to closed food service establishments in NYC; and 3) surveyed pest control companies in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Poland. During the month following lockdown, the overall number of reports decreased by 30% in NYC, while increasing 24% in Tokyo. However, new hotspots of 311 calls were observed in proximity of closed food service establishments in NYC; and there was a consistent positive association between kernel density estimates of food service establishments and location of 311 calls (r = 0.33 to 0.45). Similarly, more reports were observed in the restaurant-dense eastern side of Tokyo. Changes in clientele for pest control companies varied geographically, with 37% of pest-management companies surveyed in North America reporting 50-100% of their post-lockdown rat-related requests coming from new clients. In Warsaw, where there are no clusters of restaurants in densely-populated areas, there were no changes. In Tokyo, there were no changes in clients. We conclude that changes in public service calls are region-specific and localized, with increases in rat sightings more likely near restaurant-dense regions. Pest control companies surveyed in North America either lost much of their business or shifted clientele from old to new locations. We discuss possible mitigation measures including ramping up pest control during re-opening of food-related establishments and the need for citywide rodent surveillance and disease monitoring.","Parsons, Michael H; Kiyokawa, Yasushi; Richardson, Jonathan L; Stryjek, Rafal; Byers, Kaylee A.; Himsworth, Chelsea G; Corrigan, Robert M; Deutsch, Michael A; Ootaki, Masato; Tanikawa, Tsutomu; Parsons, Faith E; Munch-South, Jason",,381,23

Among 598 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from ten COVID-19 patients, we identified 40 strongly neutralizing mAbs. The most potent mAb CV07-209 neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 of 3.1 ng/ml. Crystal structures of two mAbs in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain at 2.55 and 2.70 Å revealed a direct block of ACE2 attachment. Interestingly, some of the near-germline SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs reacted with mammalian self-antigens.

We explored the predictive role of the PNI on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. Methods: A total of 101 patients with COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study from January 2020 to March 2020. They were divided into two groups according to COVID-19 severity: non-critical (n = 56) and critical (n = 45). The PNI was calculated upon hospital admission: 10 × serum albumin (g/dL) + 0.005 × total lymphocyte count (/mm(3)). Critical COVID-19 was defined as having one of the following features: respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation; shock; organ dysfunction necessitating admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The correlation between the PNI with COVID-19 severity was analyzed. Results: The PNI was significantly lower in critically ill than that in non-critically ill patients (P < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the PNI was a good discrimination factor for identifying COVID-19 severity (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the PNI to be an independent risk factor for critical illness due to COVID-19 (P = 0.002).

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered a pandemic because of its high contagiousness before COVID-19 associated symptoms actually appear. In response to the rapid and continuous spread of the virus around the globe governments have mobilized their forces to restrict contact and thus avoid further infection and invested significant resources in treatment and prevention strategies to tackle COVID-19. As a result, US FDA and EMA have granted emergency use authorization for two mRNA-based vaccines, namely the vaccines developed by BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, for use in the USA and Europe. Due to the existing critical situation, the stages of vaccine development and testing have probably never been gone through so fast as at present.

This study aimed to determine the epidemiological, demographic and clinical characteristics that distinguished cases of MERS contracted during outbreaks from those contracted sporadically (ie, non-outbreak) between 2012 and 2015 in Saudi Arabia. DESIGN: Data from the Saudi Ministry of Health of confirmed outbreak and non-outbreak cases of MERS coronavirus (CoV) infections from September 2012 through October 2015 were abstracted and analysed. Univariate and descriptive statistical analyses were conducted, and the time between disease onset and confirmation, onset and notification and onset and death were examined. RESULTS: A total of 1250 patients (aged 0–109 years; mean, 50.825 years) were reported infected with MERS-CoV. Approximately two-thirds of all MERS cases were diagnosed in men for outbreak and non-outbreak cases. Healthcare workers comprised 22% of all MERS cases for outbreak and non-outbreak cases. Nosocomial infections comprised one-third of all Saudi MERS cases; however, nosocomial infections occurred more frequently in outbreak than non-outbreak cases (p<0.001). Patients contracting MERS during an outbreak were significantly more likely to die of MERS (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: To date, nosocomial infections have fuelled MERS outbreaks. Given that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a worldwide religious travel destination, localised outbreaks may have massive global implications and effective outbreak preventive measures are needed.","Alhamlan, F S; Majumder, M S; Brownstein, J S; Hawkins, J; Al-Abdely, H M; Alzahrani, A; Obaid, D A; Al-Ahdal, M N; BinSaeed, A",BMJ Open,381,27

This results in pulmonary edema and severe hypoxemia and is a common cause of death after both viral (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) and bacterial pneumonia. The involvement of the lung in ARDS is notoriously heterogeneous, with consolidated and edematous lung abutting aerated, less injured regions. This makes treatment difficult, as most therapeutic approaches preferentially affect the normal lung regions or are distributed indiscriminately to other organs. In this review, we describe the use of thoracic ultrasound and microbubbles (USMB) to deliver therapeutic cargo (drugs, genes) preferentially to severely injured areas of the lung and in particular to the lung endothelium. While USMB has been explored in other organs, it has been under-appreciated in the treatment of lung injury since ultrasound energy is scattered by air. However, this limitation can be harnessed to direct therapy specifically to severely injured lungs. We explore the cellular mechanisms governing USMB and describe various permutations of cargo administration. Lastly, we discuss both the challenges and potential opportunities presented by USMB in the lung as a tool for both therapy and research.","Sanwal, Rajiv; Joshi, Kushal; Ditmans, Mihails; Tsai, Scott S.

OBJECTIVES: This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the experience of students at faculties of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing and Applied Medical Sciences at (Educational Institute) regarding remote E-exams preferences and academic dishonesty during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey composed of 16 questions, prepared using Google forms and distributed through students' E-learning platforms. The survey explored factors affecting students' preference for remote E-exams, methods for course assessment/evaluation, factors related to students’ exam dishonesty/misconduct during remote E-exams and measures that can be considered to reduce this behavior. Data were analyzed using descriptive, cross tabulation and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: Among 730 students, approximately only one third preferred remote E-exams. This was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with academic major, efforts/time for remote E-exam preparation, questions appropriateness with study material, and academic achievements (students Grade Point Average (GPA), curriculum objectives). Combining both exams and quizzes was the most preferred method of assessment (30%), while submission of reports or short written assignments was the least preferred ones. Exam dishonesty/misconduct appears as one of the major challenges with remote E-exams. The main measures considered by students to reduce exam dishonesty included substituting the exam with other forms of assessment, using different exam forms, the use of online proctoring solutions and considering compulsory pass/fail grades. CONCLUSION: Results suggested less preference of remote E-exams among students at medical faculties. Findings from this study are highly valuable to plan for academic strategies to overcome difficulties and challenges of remote E-exams. These might include improvement for the distance teaching methodologies, rearrangement of assessment options, modification of the academic curriculum to fit the current situation, and adopting certain measures to prevent exam dishonesty and maintain academic integrity.","Elsalem, Lina; Al-Azzam, Nosayba; Jum'ah, Ahmad A.; Obeidat, Nail",Ann Med Surg (Lond),381,24

This situation causes various major challenges for gastroenterology. In the context of IBD, several key questions arise. For instance, it is an important question to understand whether patients with IBD (eg, due to intestinal ACE2 expression) might be particularly susceptible to covid-19 and the cytokine release syndrome associated with lung injury and fatal outcomes. Another highly relevant question is how to deal with immunosuppression and immunomodulation during the current pandemic in patients with IBD and whether immunosuppression affects the progress of covid-19.

However, optimizing adherence to CPAP therapy of individuals remains very challenging for clinicians because of the role played by the psychological components. In this study, we verified the changes in cognitions and beliefs of individuals after a four-week multidisciplinary residential rehabilitation program targeting the adaptation to CPAP therapy for OSA syndrome. We assessed the components of perceived risks, confidence toward the treatment, and self-efficacy through the self-report questionnaire, namely the Self-Efficacy Measure for Sleep Apnea (SEMSA) questionnaire. We also explored the role played by the temperamental traits on the changes registered in these components after the treatment. Forty-five participants completed the rehabilitation program, showing a higher level of adherence to the treatment. Significant changes were observed in terms of confidence toward the treatment, although no change was reported in terms of perceived risks and self-efficacy. Moreover, those individuals with a higher persistent temperamental trait reported a significant improvement in perceived risks, in the absence of other significant results. After the rehabilitation treatment, our participants were more prone to consider the effect of CPAP treatment on health outcomes. This was in line with the educational aim of the rehabilitation treatment. The temperament seemed to play only a marginal role in the global changes reported by our participants.

Vaccination (using an inactivated rabies vaccine), combined with administration of rabies immune globulin, is the only approved, effective method for post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies in humans. In the search for novel rabies control and treatment strategies, live-attenuated viruses have recently emerged as a practical and promising approach for immunizing and controlling rabies. Unlike the conventional, inactivated rabies vaccine, live-attenuated viruses are genetically modified viruses that are able to replicate in an inoculated recipient without causing adverse effects, while still eliciting robust and effective immune responses against rabies virus infection. A number of viruses with an intrinsic capacity that could be used as putative candidates for live-attenuated rabies vaccine have been intensively evaluated for therapeutic purposes. Additional novel strategies, such as a monoclonal antibody-based approach, nucleic acid-based vaccines, or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) interfering with virus replication, could further add to the arena of strategies to combat rabies. In this review, we highlight current advances in rabies therapy and discuss the role that they might have in the future of rabies treatment. Given the pronounced and complex impact of rabies on a patient, a combination of these novel modalities has the potential to achieve maximal anti-rabies efficacy, or may even have promising curative effects in the future.

We find that country pairs characterized by large differentials in productivity and in the makeup of the labour force differ in export variety patterns. This result holds after controlling for other endowments and for trade costs. Further, productivity plays a significant role in the reduction of export variety dissimilarities between countries belonging to different income groups.

DESIGN: Qualitative study (interviews, focus groups, workshops) using soft-systems methodology to map usual care across trauma networks and explore service gaps. Publicly available documents were consulted. CATWOE (Customers, Actors, Transformation, Worldview, Owners, Environment) was used as an analytic framework to explore the relationship between stakeholders in the pathway. SETTING: Five major trauma networks across the UK. SUBJECTS: 106 key rehabilitation stakeholders (service providers, trauma survivors) were recruited to interviews (n = 46), focus groups (n = 4 groups, 17 participants) and workshops (n = 5 workshops, 43 participants). INTERVENTIONS: None. RESULTS: Mapping of rehabilitation pathways identified several issues: (1) lack of vocational/psychological support particularly for musculoskeletal injuries; (2) inconsistent service provision in areas located further from major trauma centres; (3) lack of communication between acute and community care; (4) long waiting lists (up to 12 months) for community rehabilitation; (5) most well-established pathways were neurologically focused. CONCLUSIONS: The trauma rehabilitation pathway is complex and varies across the UK with few, if any patients following the recommended pathway. Services have developed piecemeal to address specific issues, but rarely meet the needs of individuals with multiple impairments post-trauma, with a lack of vocational rehabilitation and psychological support for this population.","Kettlewell, Jade; Timmons, Stephen; Bridger, Kay; Kendrick, Denise; Kellezi, Blerina; Holmes, Jain; Patel, Priya; Radford, Kate",Clin Rehabil,381,16

In light of COVID-19, it is predicted that as many as 75,000 more people will die from alcohol and other substance use and suicide as a result of isolation, new mental health concerns, and various other stressors related to the pandemic. Public awareness campaigns that aim to destigmatize substance use and help individuals have meaningful conversations with friends, coworkers, or family members to address substance use concerns are a timely and cost-effective means of augmenting existing behavioral health efforts related to substance use. These types of interventions can supplement the work being done by existing public health initiatives. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examines the impact of the One Degree: Shift the Influence role play simulation, designed to teach family, friends, and coworkers to effectively manage problem-solving conversations with individuals that they are concerned about regarding substance use. METHODS: Participants recruited for this mixed methods study completed a presurvey, the simulation, and a postsurvey, and were sent a 6-week follow-up survey. The simulation involves practicing a role play conversation with a virtual human coded with emotions, a memory, and a personality. A virtual coach provides feedback in using evidence-based communication strategies such as motivational interviewing. RESULTS: A matched sample analysis of variance revealed significant increases at follow-up in composite attitudinal constructs of preparedness (P<.001) and self-efficacy (P=.01), including starting a conversation with someone regarding substance use, avoiding upsetting someone while bringing up concerns, focusing on observable facts, and problem solving. Qualitative data provided further evidence of the simulation’s positive impact on the ability to have meaningful conversations about substance use. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that conversation-based simulations like One Degree: Shift the Influence that use role play practice can teach individuals to use evidence-based communication strategies and can cost-effectively reach geographically dispersed populations to support public health initiatives for primary prevention.","Albright, Glenn; Khalid, Nikita; Shockley, Kristen; Robinson, Kelsey; Hughes, Kevin; Pace-Danley, Bethany",JMIR Form Res,381,1

The surface spike protein, which plays a central role in virus infection, is currently the target for vaccines and neutralizing treatments. The emergence of novel variants with multiple mutations in the spike protein may reduce the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies by altering the binding activity of the protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). To understand the impact of spike protein mutations on the binding interactions required for virus infection and the effectiveness of neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies, the binding activities of the original spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) sequence and the reported spike protein variants were investigated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In addition, the interactions of the ACE2 receptor, an anti-spike monoclonal antibody (mAb1), a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb2), the original spike RBD sequence, and mutants D614G, N501Y, N439K, Y453F, and E484K were assessed. Compared to the original RBD, the Y453F and N501Y mutants displayed a significant increase in ACE2 binding affinity, whereas D614G had a substantial reduction in binding affinity. All mAb-RBD mutant proteins displayed a reduction in binding affinities relative to the original RBD, except for the E484K-mAb1 interaction. The potential neutralizing capability of mAb1 and mAb2 was investigated. Accordingly, mAb1 failed to inhibit the ACE2-RBD interaction and mAb2 inhibited the ACE2-RBD interactions for all RBD mutants, except mutant E484K, which only displayed partial blocking.","Raghu, Deepa; Hamill, Pamela; Banaji, Arpitha; McLaren, Amy; Hsu, Yu-Ting",J Pharm Anal,381,20

Immediate needs of parents to bond with their babies through direct early physical contact have often been overlooked; many weeks can pass before parents get to hold their babies for the first time. Recognition of the importance of early contact is growing. We aimed to review the safety and value of routinely practising delivery room cuddles for extremely preterm babies. METHODS: We reviewed delivery room cuddles in babies born <27 weeks’ gestation in our centre between 2006 and 2017 via case‐control. We also conducted a questionnaire survey of mothers who experienced a delivery room cuddle to gain their feedback and perspectives. RESULTS: We found no difference in age or temperatures on neonatal unit admission. There was no case of inadvertent extubation associated with cuddles. Parental feedback was very positive. CONCLUSION: With appropriate safeguards, delivery room cuddles are feasible and achievable for extremely preterm babies irrespective of birth gestation. Facilitation of the cuddle is an early and very important family‐centred care practice which seems much appreciated by parents and which may improve bonding, lactation, and maternal mental health.","Clarke, Paul; Allen, Emma; Atuona, Sheila; Cawley, Paul",Acta Paediatr,381,1

This new virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS.","Su, Zhaoqian; Wu, Yinghao",bioRxiv,381,20

The lack of COVID-19 testing capacity threatens the ability of both the United States (US) and low middle income countries (LMIC) to respond to this growing threat, The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness through participant self-assessment of a rapid response team (RRT) mobile laboratory curriculum METHODS: We conducted a pre and post survey for the purpose of a process improvement assessment in Angola, involving 32 individuals. The survey was performed before and after a 14-day training workshop held in Luanda, Angola, in December 2019. A paired t-test was used to identify any significant change on six 7-point Likert scale questions with α< 0.05 (95% confidence interval). RESULTS: All six of the questions – 1) “I feel confident managing a real laboratory sample test for Ebola or other highly contagious sample;” 2) “I feel safe working in the lab environment during a real scenario;” 3) “I feel as if I can appropriately manage a potentially highly contagious laboratory sample;” 4)“I feel that I can interpret a positive or negative sample during a suspected contagious outbreak;” 5) “I understand basic Biobubble/mobile laboratory concepts and procedures;” and 6) “I understand polymerase chain reaction (PCR) principles” – showed statistical significant change pre and post training. Additionally, the final two questions – “I can more effectively perform my role/position because of the training I received during this course;” and “This training was valuable” – received high scores on the Likert scale. CONCLUSION: This Angolan RRT mobile laboratory training curriculum provides the nation of Angola with the confidence to rapidly respond and test at the national level a highly infectious contagion in the region and perform on-scene diagnostics. This mobile RRT laboratory provides a mobile and rapid diagnostic resource when epidemic/pandemic resource allocation may need to be prioritized based on confirmed disease prevalence.","Owens, Michael D.; Lloyd, Michael L.; Brady, Tyler M.; Gross, Robin",West J Emerg Med,381,16

Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and high-performance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.

In this study we attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the inhibition of BX-795 on Herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication. HEC-1-A or Vero cells were treated with BX-795 and infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2 for different periods. BX-795 (3.125-25 μmol/L) dose-dependently suppressed HSV-2 replication, and displayed a low cytotoxicity to the host cells. BX-795 treatment dose-dependently suppressed the expression of two HSV immediate-early (IE) genes (ICP0 and ICP27) and the late gene (gD) at 12 h postinfection. HSV-2 infection resulted in the activation of PI3K and Akt in the host cells, and BX-795 treatment inhibited HSV-2-induced Akt phosphorylation and activation. However, the blockage of PI3K/Akt/mTOR with LY294002 and rapamycin did not affect HSV-2 replication. HSV-2 infection increased the phosphorylation of JNK and p38, and reduced ERK phosphorylation at 8 h postinfection in the host cells; BX-795 treatment inhibited HSV-2-induced activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinase as well as the phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2, the downstream targets of JNK and p38 MAP kinase. Furthermore, SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor) or SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) dose-dependently inhibited the viral replication in the host cells, whereas PD98059 (an ERK inhibitor) was not effective. Moreover, BX-795 blocked PMA-stimulated c-Jun activation as well as HSV-2-mediated c-Jun nuclear translocation. BX-795 dose-dependently inhibited HSV-2, PMA, TNF-α-stimulated AP-1 activation, but not HSV-induced NF-κB activation. Overexpression of p38/JNK attenuated the inhibitory effect of BX-795 on HSV replication. BX-795 completely blocked HSV-2-induced MKK4 phosphorylation, suggesting that BX-795 acting upstream of JNK and p38 MAP kinase. In conclusion, this study identifies the anti-HSV activity of BX-795 and its targeting of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathways in host cells.","Su, Ai-rong; Qiu, Min; Li, Yan-lei; Xu, Wen-tao; Song, Si-wei; Wang, Xiao-hui; Song, Hong-yong; Zheng, Nan; Wu, Zhi-wei",Acta Pharmacologica Sinica,381,24

The aim was to describe the characteristics and clinical outcomes of HT recipients with coronavirus-19 disease(COVID-19). Methods We prospectively included all adult HT recipients who received the diagnosis of COVID-19 in our institution. Inclusion criteria were one or more clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the previous seven days and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal samples. The enrollment was carried out from April to June, 2020. Demographic features, clinical characteristics, modes of transmission, laboratory data and other known prognosis markers at admission and through follow up were recorded. Patients were categorized according to the ordinal scale developed by WHO Committee. Outcomes and follow up were recorded until Aug/2020. Results Twenty-one HT recipients were included, most of them were men (57%); with median age of 48 years old and median HT time of 12 mo. The majority needed hospitalization. Immunosuppressive therapy was reduced or withdrawn in the majority of patients, except from steroids. Ten patients were classified as having severe disease according to WHO Committee scale. Lymphopenia was an independent predictor of severe disease and absolute lymphocyte count <416/mm3 had 82% of sensitivity and 90% of specificity to define severe disease. Thirty-day mortality was 14%, similar to previously reported in other solid-organ transplant (SOT) cohorts. However, a longer follow up revealed increased 60-day mortality (33%) due to nosocomial infection. Conclusion In this case series of HT recipients with COVID-19, the 30-day mortality rate was similar to that previously reported in SOT recipient's cohorts, but a longer follow up revealed increased later mortality related to long in-hospital stay. Further, lymphopenia was associated with severe disease and worse prognosis. These findings suggest the need for strict long-term follow up of these patients.","Marcondes-Braga, F. G.; Murad, C.

Here, we report a case of two episodes of acute dyspnea that were induced by COVID-19 in a peritoneal dialysis (PD) patient. The first episode of acute dyspnea was an exacerbation of heart failure caused by COVID-19 when the patient had a volume overload status due to a peritoneal dialysis catheter malfunction. Heart failure induced by a catheter malfunction was due to omental wrapping, and it was treated with ultrafiltration by hemodialysis and mini-laparotomy. The patient’s acute dyspnea was immediately resolved. The second episode of acute dyspnea was caused by COVID-19 pneumonia, which occurred 1 week after the first episode.

AIM: To understand the pandemic’s impact on recently-arrived migrants and their access to primary health care, and implications for vaccine roll-out. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with primary care professionals (PCPs) and migrants in urban, suburban, and rural settings across England. METHOD: Sixty-four PCPs and administrative staff, and 17 recently-arrived migrants were recruited using purposive, convenience, and snowball sampling. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone. Data were analysed iteratively, informed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: PCPs and migrants concurred that digitalisation and virtual consultations have amplified existing inequalities in access to health care for many migrants, due to a lack of digital literacy and access to technology, compounded by language barriers. PCPs were concerned that virtual consultations resulted in difficulties building trust and risked missing safeguarding cues. Both PCPs and migrants highlighted challenges around registering and accessing health care due to physical closure of surgeries, as well as indirect discrimination, language and communication barriers, and a lack of access to targeted and tailored COVID-19 information or interventions. Migrants reported a range of specific beliefs, from acceptance to mistrust, around COVID-19 and potential COVID-19 vaccines, often influenced by misinformation. Innovative opportunities were suggested, including translated digital health advice using text templates and YouTube; these merit further exploration. CONCLUSION: Pandemic-related changes to primary care delivery may become permanent; some migrant groups are at risk of digital exclusion and may need targeted additional support to access services. Solutions are needed to address vaccine hesitancy in marginalised groups to ensure equitable COVID-19 vaccine uptake.","Knights, Felicity; Carter, Jessica; Deal, Anna; Crawshaw, Alison F; Hayward, Sally E; Jones, Lucinda; Hargreaves, Sally",British Journal of General Practice,381,16

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and is believed to originate from bat, quickly spread into a global pandemic. This RNA virus has a special affinity for porphyrins. It invades the cell at the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and binds to hemoproteins, resulting in a severe systemic inflammatory response, particularly in high ACE-2 organs like the lungs, heart, and kidney, resulting in systemic disease. The inflammatory response manifested by increased cytokine levels and reactive oxygen species results in inhibition of heme oxygenase (HO-1), with a subsequent loss of cytoprotection. This has been seen in other viral illness like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, and SARS/MERS. There are a number of medications that have been tried with some showing early clinical promise. This illness disproportionately affects patients with obesity, a chronic inflammatory disease with a baseline excess of cytokines. The majority of the medications used in the treatment of COVID-19 are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, primarily CYP2D6. This is further complicated by genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6, HO-1, ACE, and ACE-2. There is a potential role for HO-1 upregulation to treat/prevent cytokine storm.

Because induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells maintain the genetic information of the donor, they can be used to model individual differences in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in vitro. Notably, undifferentiated human iPS cells themselves cannot be infected bySARS-CoV-2. Using adenovirus vectors, here we found that human iPS cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (ACE2-iPS cells) can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In infected ACE2-iPS cells, the expression of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, the budding of viral particles, the production of progeny virus, double membrane spherules, and double-membrane vesicles were confirmed. We also evaluated COVID-19 therapeutic drugs in ACE2-iPS cells and confirmed the strong antiviral effects of Remdesivir, EIDD-2801, and interferon-beta. In addition, we performed SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments on ACE2-iPS/ES cells from 8 individuals. Male iPS/ES cells were more capable of producing the virus as compared with female iPS/ES cells. These findings suggest that ACE2-iPS cells can not only reproduce individual differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, but they are also a useful resource to clarify the causes of individual differences in COVID-19 due to genetic differences.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. DESIGN: We conduced retrospective analyses on two cohorts comprising 7699 pregnant women in Beijing, China, and compared pregnancy outcomes between the pre-COVID-2019 cohort (women who delivered from 20 May 2019 to 30 November 2019) and the COVID-2019 cohort (women who delivered from 20 January 2020 to 31 July 2020). The secondary impacts of the COVID-2019 pandemic on pregnancy outcomes were assessed by using multivariate log-binomial regression models, and we used interrupted time-series (ITS) regression analysis to further control the effects of time-trends. SETTING: One tertiary-level centre in Beijing, China PARTICIPANTS: 7699 pregnant women. RESULTS: Compared with women in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic group, pregnant women during the COVID-2019 pandemic were more likely to be of advanced age, exhibit insufficient or excessive gestational weight gain and show a family history of chronic disease (all p<0.05). After controlling for other confounding factors, the risk of premature rupture of membranes and foetal distress was increased by 11% (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.18; p<0.01) and 14% (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.29; p<0.05), respectively, during the COVID-2019 pandemic. The association still remained in the ITS analysis after additionally controlling for time-trends (all p<0.01). We uncovered no other associations between the COVID-19 pandemic and other pregnancy outcomes (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, more women manifested either insufficient or excessive gestational weight gain; and the risk of premature rupture of membranes and foetal distress was also higher during the pandemic.","Du, Min; Yang, Jie; Han, Na; Liu, Min; Liu, Jue",BMJ Open,381,1

STUDY DESIGN: The study used qualitative, semistructured interviews. METHODS: The study involved thirty semistructured telephone interviews with parents of children between 4 and 18 years. Thirty semistructured telephone interviews with parents of children between 4 and 18 years. RESULTS: We found four themes relating to symptom attribution (‘normalising symptoms’, ‘err on the side of caution’, ‘experience of temperature’, ‘symptoms not normal for us’). In general, parents were more likely to attribute symptoms to COVID-19 if a temperature was present or the symptoms were perceived as ‘unusual’ for their family. Four themes relating to self-isolation (‘difficult to prevent contact with children’, ‘isolation would be no different to lockdown life’, ‘ability to get food and supplies’, ‘limited space’). Parents believed they would find isolation within the household difficult or impossible if they had dependent children, had limited space or could not shop for groceries. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight complexities in symptom perception, attribution and household isolation. We suggest that they can be overcome by (a) providing better guidance on what symptoms require action, (b) providing guidance as to how to prevent infection within the household and (c) by supporting families with grocery shopping through a potential second or third wave.","Hodson, A.; Woodland, L.; Smith, L.E.; Rubin, G.J.",Public Health,381,1

Over the last few decades, the Greater Athens area and Attica Prefecture in Greece have experienced several natural disasters. These events have highlighted problems and weaknesses in emergency planning for school communities at both local and regional level, and have shown the need for new precautionary measures and effective risk management for modern society and school communities. The present study reports an investigation of the perception of the risk posed by biological hazards to teacher safety. The investigation utilized a questionnaire survey of teachers working in the secondary education directorate in Western Attica, which was carried out between May and December 2019. The teachers’ perceptions of the extent to which their safety was affected by biohazards (i.e., infectious diseases and weather-related diseases) were investigated using a 5-point scale ranging from affected a lot (− 2) to not affected at all (+ 2). A multivariate statistical technique—principal component analysis—was used to explore the results of the survey. The results showed that the teachers’ feelings of safety were affected a lot (− 2) or affected enough (− 1) by biohazards. 61.5% (n = 72) of the participants reported that their feelings of safety were affected a lot or enough by infectious diseases, and 55.6% (n = 65) of the participants noted that their feelings of safety were affected a lot or enough by weather-related diseases. Compared to other natural, technological, or social hazards, biological hazards seem to have a greater impact on teachers’ feelings of safety. These results could have implications for the design of risk management plans for school communities.","Papavasileiou, Christina; Mavrakis, Anastasios; Kourou, Asimina; Salvati, Luca",EuroMediterr J Environ Integr,381,6

This vector contains an MHV intergenic sequence to promote the expression of foreign genes. In this study, we used this vector to introduce a hemagglutininesterase (HE) protein, an optional MHV structural protein, into the MHV-infected cells. The engineered HE protein could be efficiently incorporated into the virion which did not synthesize its own HE protein, thus generating a pseudorecombinant virus that expresses an exogenous HE protein. The engineered HE protein could be made distinguishable from the native protein by attaching an 8-amino-acid peptide tag at the carboxyl-terminus. Both the engineered and native HE proteins from the HE-producing virus train could be incorporated into the virion, thus generating phenotypically mixed virus parficles. We also showed that the HE-expressing DI RNA could be incorporated into viruses, and the engineered HE protein expressed in the infected cells for at least three serial virus passages. Furthermore, we have made two mutants, in which parts of the external domain of the HE protein have been deleted, to study the sequence requirements for the stable expression of HE and its incorporation into MHV virions. Although both of the mutant HE proteins could be expressed in the MHV-infected cells, they failed to be incorporated into virions, suggesting the importance of the extracellular domain of HE protein for its incorporation into virus particles. This vector system enabled the first successful incorporation of a selected coronaviral protein into virions and demonstrates its utility as an expression vector for studying the molecular biology of coronaviruses.","Liao, Ching-Len; Zhang, Xuming; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,381,16

Statistical analysis included two‐tailed t‐tests and chi‐square tests. RESULTS: In the post‐declaration, the number of tweets about facial rejuvenation increased significantly, and the search volume in Google Trends decreased. Negative public emotions increased, but positive emotions still dominate. The words frequency of “discounts” and “purchase” decreased. The dominant words in word cloud were “Botox”, “facelift”, “hyaluronic” and “skin”. CONCLUSION: The public has a positive attitude toward facial rejuvenation during the pandemic. In particular, minimally invasive procedures dominate the mainstream, such as “Botox”, “Hyaluronic acid” and “PRP”. The practitioners could understand the change of the public interest in facial rejuvenation in time and decide what to focus on.","Pang, Ran; Wei, Zhiru; Liu, Wenhui; Chen, Zong; Cheng, Xu; Zhang, Han; Li, Guangshuai; Liu, Linbo",J Cosmet Dermatol,381,8

This situation also provided much-needed evidence about teleworking that will indicate whether it could become a mainstream and institutionalised practice in certain professions. In Barcelona, the experience of a less polluted, quieter and more liveable city has inspired both the municipal government and the citizens to rethink the use of public spaces and look for ways to reduce car dependency.

Antiviral activity was analyzed by plaque reduction assays and mode of antiviral action was determined by addition of the drugs to uninfected cells, to the virus prior to infection or to herpesvirus-infected cells. Star anise oil reduced viral infectivity by >99%, phenylpropanoids inhibited HSV infectivity by about 60–80% and sesquiterpenes suppressed herpes virus infection by 40–98%. Both, star anise essential oil and all isolated compounds exhibited anti-HSV-1 activity by direct inactivation of free virus particles in viral suspension assays.

We investigated the putative interplay existing between allergen-specific immunotherapy and COVID-19 infection in Hymenoptera venom–allergic population. We evaluated the frequency and severity of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of 211 subjects referring to our Center for the regular administration of venom immunotherapy (VIT). Our result showed that the median age of our cohort is similar to the one that in our region has been associated with a high incidence of COVID-19 infection, increased hospitalization and mortality rates.

We performed immune profiling of the T helper (Th) CD4+ and T CD8+ cell compartments in peripheral blood of 144 COVID-19 patients using multiparametric flow cytometry analysis. On the one hand, there was a consistent lymphopenia with an overrepresentation of non-functional T cells, with an increased percentage of naive Th cells (CD45RA+, CXCR3-, CCR4-, CCR6-, CCR10-) and persistently low frequency of markers associated with Th1, Th17, and Th1/Th17 memory-effector T cells compared to healthy donors. On the other hand, the most profound alteration affected the Th1 subset, which may explain the poor T cells responses and the persistent blood virus load. Finally, the decrease in Th1 cells may also explain the low frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that express the HLA-DR and CD38 activation markers observed in numerous patients who showed minimal or no lymphocyte activation response.

Patient-reported anosmia and the presence of bilateral B-lines on lung ultrasound had the highest LR+ for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (7.58; 95% CI 2.36–24.36 and 7.09; 95% CI 2.77–18.12 respectively). The absence of a high clinical probability determined by the emergency physician and the absence of bilateral B-lines on lung ultrasound had the lowest LR- for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (0.33; 95% CI 0.25–0.43 and 0.26; 95% CI 0.15–0.45 respectively). Conclusions Anosmia, emergency physician estimate of high clinical probability and bilateral B-lines on lung ultrasound increased the likelihood of identifying COVID-19 in patients presenting to the ED.","Peyrony, Olivier; Marbeuf-Gueye, Carole; Truong, Vy; Giroud, Marion; Rivière, Clémentine; Khenissi, Khalil; Legay, Léa; Simonetta, Marie; Elezi, Arben; Principe, Alessandra; Taboulet, Pierre; Ogereau, Carl; Tourdjman, Mathieu; Ellouze, Sami; Fontaine, Jean-Paul",Ann Emerg Med,381,16

A 2-year-old, 5.4 kg, neutered male Russian Blue cat was diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy and started on phenobarbital treatment. Eight days after initiation of phenobarbital treatment, the cat showed tachypnea and hyperthermia. CBC and serum biochemistry were unremarkable. However, the patient showed high serum amyloid A (SAA). On abdominal ultrasonography, generalized enlargement of abdominal lymph nodes and splenic multiple hypo-echoic nodules, which were consistent with reactive lymphadenopathy were found. The cat was diagnosed with AHS, and phenobarbital was discontinued. After 10 days of cessation, the patient had normal SAA, and clinical signs were resolved.","SOHN, Sang-June; JEUNG, So-Young; CHAE, Hyung-Kyu; CHO, Hee-Seon; AN, Ju-Hyun; LI, Qiang; SONG, Woo-Jin; YOUN, Hwa-Young",J Vet Med Sci,381,20

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To test a dose‐tapering regimen and assess efficacy and clinical safety for up to 18 weeks. ANIMALS: Eighty‐eight client‐owned cats with feline hypersensitivity dermatitis. METHODS: Cats that received either a placebo or ciclosporin at 2.5 mg/kg or 7 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks were given 7 mg/kg ciclosporin daily for 4 weeks. Depending on the clinical response, the dose was tapered from daily to every other day over the next 4 weeks and further to twice a week for an additional 4 weeks. RESULTS: After all cats received 7 mg/kg for 4 weeks, the dose could be tapered to every other day for the next 4 weeks in 70% of cats remaining in the study. During the next 4 weeks, 57, 15 and 22% of cats remaining in the study could be treated at twice a week, every other day or daily, respectively. After the first 4 weeks, the mean lesion score and owner‐assessed pruritus improved over baseline by 69 and 61%, respectively, and remained stable during the following 8 weeks. Approximately 65% of the cats in the study were reported to have an adverse event (AE), very often mild and resolving spontaneously. The most frequent AEs were gastrointestinal and included primarily vomiting and diarrhoea. Eighty per cent of AEs occurred when cats were on daily treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Results suggest that the induction dose of 7 mg/kg ciclosporin can be tapered as soon as 4 weeks without deterioration of the clinical response. Establishment of the lowest effective dosing regimen of ciclosporin reduced the frequency of AEs.","Steffan, Jean; Roberts, Elizabeth; Cannon, Andrea; Prélaud, Pascal; Forsythe, Peter; Fontaine, Jacques; King, Stephen; Seewald, Wolfgang",Vet Dermatol,381,21

Suspected cases were immediately reported to the Institut de Veille Sanitaire. Probable case-patients were isolated, their contacts quarantined at home, and were followed for 10 days after exposure. Five probable cases occurred from March through April 2003; four were confirmed as SARS coronavirus by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, serologic testing, or both. The index case-patient (patient A), who had worked in the French hospital of Hanoi, Vietnam, was the most probable source of transmission for the three other confirmed cases; two had been exposed to patient A while on the Hanoi-Paris flight of March 22–23. Timely detection, isolation of probable cases, and quarantine of their contacts appear to have been effective in preventing the secondary spread of SARS in France.","Desenclos, Jean-Claude; van der Werf, Sylvie; Bonmarin, Isabelle; Levy-Bruhl, Daniel; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Hoen, Bruno; Emmanuelli, Julien; Lesens, Olivier; Dupon, Michel; Natali, François; Michelet, Christian; Reynes, Jacques; Guery, Benoit; Larsen, Christine; Semaille, Caroline; Mouton, Yves; Christmann, Daniel; André, Michel; Escriou, Nicolas; Burguière, Anna; Manuguerra, Jean-Claude; Coignard, Bruno; Lepoutre, Agnés; Meffre, Christine; Bitar, Dounia; Decludt, Bénédicte; Capek, Isabelle; Antona, Denise; Che, Didier; Herida, Magid; Infuso, Andréa; Saura, Christine; Brücker, Gilles; Hubert, Bruno; LeGoff, Dominique; Scheidegger, Suzanne",Emerg Infect Dis,381,16

The goal of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and precision of platelet counting using a new microvolume (8 μL), absolute counting, 1.5 kg cytometry-based blood analyzer, the rHEALTH ONE (rHEALTH) in comparison with the International Society of Laboratory Hematology (ISLH) platelet method, which uses a cytometer and an impedance analyzer. METHODS: Inclusion eligibility were healthy adults (M/F) ages 18–80 for donation of fingerprick and venous blood samples. Samples were from a random N = 31 volunteers from a single U.S. site. Samples were serially diluted to test thrombocytopenic ranges. Interfering substances and conditions were tested, including RBC fragments, platelet fragments, cholesterol, triglycerides, lipids, anti-platelet antibodies, and temperature. RESULTS: The concordance between the rHEALTH and ISLH methods had a slope = 1.030 and R(2) = 0.9684. The rHEALTH method showed a correlation between capillary and venous blood samples (slope = 0.9514 and R(2) = 0.9684). Certain interferents changed platelet recovery: RBC fragments and anti-platelet antibodies with the ISLH method; platelet fragments and anti-platelet antibodies on the rHEALTH; and RBC fragments, platelets fragments, triglycerides and LDL on the clinical impedance analyzer. The rHEALTH’s precision ranged from 3.1–8.0%, and the ISLH from 1.0–10.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The rHEALTH method provides similar results with the reference method and good correlation between adult capillary and venous blood samples. This demonstrates the ability of the rHEALTH to provide point-of-care assessment of normal and thrombocytopenic platelet counts from fingerprick blood with high precision and limited interferences.","Dickerson, William M.; Yu, Rebecca; Westergren, Helena U.; Paraskos, Jonathan; Schatz, Philipp; Tigerstrom, Anna; Ekman, Anna; Sánchez, José; Cheng, Jamie; Li, Lillian; Chan, Eugene Y.",PLoS One,381,18

To better assess the role of apoptosis in MHV infection, we used three different biologic phenotypes of MHV to examine their differential effect on the induction of apoptosis. MHV-A59 produces acute hepatitis, meningoencephalitis, and chronic demyelination. MHV-2 causes only acute hepatitis and meningitis, whereas Penn98-1 produces acute hepatitis and meningoencephalitis without demyelination. We detected TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining in the livers and meninges of MHV-A59-, MHV-2-, and Penn98-1-infected mice. TUNEL staining in brain parenchyma was only detected in MHV-A59- and Penn98-1-infected mice. We detected apoptosis by electron-microscopy in olfactory neurons during acute infection with MHV-A59. The kinetics and distribution of TUNEL staining correlated with the pathologic damage and colocalized with viral antigen in some cells. At 1 month, TUNEL staining was found exclusively in areas of demyelination in the spinal cord of MHV-A59-infected mice; however, it was not found in nondemyelinated mice infected with MHV-2 or Penn98-1, or in mock-infected mice. TUNEL-positive cells were identified as macrophage/microglial cells, some astrocytes, and some oligodendrocytes, by colabeling with cell-specific markers. The presence of TUNEL staining in oligodendrocytes suggests that apoptosis may play an important role in MHV-induced demyelination.","Schwartz, Talya; Fu, Li; Lavi, Ehud",J Neurovirol,381,1

Importantly, much of the disease burden and health care utilisation in COPD is associated with the management of its comorbidities (e.g. skeletal muscle wasting, ischemic heart disease, cognitive dysfunction) and infective viral and bacterial acute exacerbations (AECOPD). Current pharmacological treatments for COPD are relatively ineffective and the development of effective therapies has been severely hampered by the lack of understanding of the mechanisms and mediators underlying COPD. Since comorbidities have a tremendous impact on the prognosis and severity of COPD, the 2015 American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) Research Statement on COPD urgently called for studies to elucidate the pathobiological mechanisms linking COPD to its comorbidities. It is now emerging that up to 50% of COPD patients have metabolic syndrome (MetS) as a comorbidity. It is currently not clear whether metabolic syndrome is an independent co-existing condition or a direct consequence of the progressive lung pathology in COPD patients. As MetS has important clinical implications on COPD outcomes, identification of disease mechanisms linking COPD to MetS is the key to effective therapy. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the potential mechanisms linking MetS to COPD and hence plausible therapeutic strategies to treat this debilitating comorbidity of COPD.","Chan, Stanley M.H.; Selemidis, Stavros; Bozinovski, Steven; Vlahos, Ross",Pharmacol Ther,381,24

Genomic sequence analysis will provide the molecular epidemiology and help to develop vaccines. METHODS: We developed a rapid method to amplify and sequence the whole SARS-CoV genome from clinical specimens. The technique employed one-step multiplex RT-PCR to amplify the whole SARS-CoV genome, and then nested PCR was performed to amplify a 2-kb region separately. The PCR products were sequenced. RESULTS: We sequenced the genomes of SARS-CoV from 3 clinical specimens obtained in Taiwan. The sequences were similar to those reported by other groups, except that 17 single nucleotide variations and two 2-nucleotide deletions, and a 1-nucleotide deletion were found. All the variations in the clinical specimens did not alter the amino acid sequence. Of these 17 sequenced variants, two loci (positions 26203 and 27812) were segregated together as a specific genotype-T:T or C:C. Phylogenetic analysis showed two major clusters of SARS patients in Taiwan. CONCLUSION: We developed a very economical and rapid method to sequence the whole genome of SARS-CoV, which can avoid cultural influence. From our results, SARS patients in Taiwan may be infected from two different origins.","Shih, Mu-Chin; Peck, Konan; Chan, Wen-Ling; Chu, Yen-Ping; Chen, Jui-Chang; Tsai, Chang-Hai; Chang, Jan-Gowth",Intervirology,381,12

The ExCHANGE Collaboration aims to bring together researchers and people working, living in and visiting care homes to build capacity, share and mobilise knowledge, and identify key areas for future research. This paper describes an embedded, formative, realist and theory-driven evaluation which aims to gather information about how successful the ExCHANGE Collaboration is perceived to be in achieving its aims. An existing realist programme theory from the literature – Closer Collaboration – will be supplemented by two substantive theories: Co-production and Knowledge Brokering. This will result in an initial programme theory which will be tested by this formative evaluation to refine understanding of how the ExCHANGE Collaboration works. METHODS: The evaluation will employ mixed qualitative methods, including: analysis of documents such as feedback forms, Knowledge Broker journal/diary, event attendance records, risk and issues logs and other relevant paperwork gathered as part of project delivery; observations of events/activities; and interviews with care home providers and staff, care home residents, residents’ family members, and researchers who are involved in the project (both project design/delivery, and also attendance or involvement in project activities/events). Framework Analysis will be used to interpret the data collected; analysis will be strategic, by focusing on particular key areas of importance in the developing theory of how the ExCHANGE Collaboration might achieve change. RESULTS: The results of this study are expected to be published in 2022. DISCUSSION: This evaluation will investigate how successful the ExCHANGE Collaboration is perceived to be in achieving its aims, in what way, in which contexts, and how this may differ for those involved. It will do this by testing an initial programme theory about how the collaboration works, for whom, under which circumstances, and in what way. Findings will be shared through written publication, an end of project learning event for those involved/interested in the project, and a lay summary to be made publically available.","Wilkinson, K.; Day, J.; Thompson-Coon, J.; Goodwin, V.; Liabo, K.; Coxon, G.; Cox, G.; Marriott, C.; Lang, I.
