664,Respiratory support by neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) in severe RSV-related bronchiolitis: a case series report,2011-10-20,"BACKGROUND: Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a new mode of mechanical ventilation controlled by diaphragmatic electrical signals. The electrical signals allow synchronization of ventilation to spontaneous breathing efforts of a child, as well as permitting pressure assistance proportional to the electrical signal. NAVA provides equally fine synchronization of respiratory support and pressure assistance varying with the needs of the child. NAVA has mainly been studied in children who underwent cardiac surgery during the period of weaning from a respirator. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here a series of 3 children (1 month, 3 years, and 28 days old) with severe respiratory distress due to RSV-related bronchiolitis requiring invasive mechanical ventilation with a high level of oxygen (FiO(2 )≥50%) for whom NAVA facilitated respiratory support. One of these children had diagnosis criteria for acute lung injury, another for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Establishment of NAVA provided synchronization of mechanical ventilatory support with the breathing efforts of the children. Respiratory rate and inspiratory pressure became extremely variable, varying at each cycle, while children were breathing easily and smoothly. All three children demonstrated less oxygen requirements after introducing NAVA (57 ± 6% to 42 ± 18%). This improvement was observed while peak airway pressure decreased (28 ± 3 to 15 ± 5 cm H(2)O). In one child, NAVA facilitated the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome with extensive subcutaneous emphysema. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the feasibility and benefit of NAVA in children with severe RSV-related bronchiolitis. NAVA provides a less aggressive ventilation requiring lower inspiratory pressures with good results for oxygenation and more comfort for the children.","Liet, Jean-Michel; Dejode, Jean-Marc; Joram, Nicolas; Roux, Bénédicte Gaillard-Le; Bétrémieux, Pierre; Rozé, Jean-Christophe",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3207882/,224
683,Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure in children: a concise review,2011-05-26,"Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) refers to the delivery of mechanical respiratory support without the use of endotracheal intubation (ETI). The present review focused on the effectiveness of NPPV in children > 1 month of age with acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to different conditions. ARF is the most common cause of cardiac arrest in children. Therefore, prompt recognition and treatment of pediatric patients with pending respiratory failure can be lifesaving. Mechanical respiratory support is a critical intervention in many cases of ARF. In recent years, NPPV has been proposed as a valuable alternative to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in this acute setting. Recent physiological studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of NPPV in children with ARF. Several pediatric clinical studies, the majority of which were noncontrolled or case series and of small size, have suggested the effectiveness of NPPV in the treatment of ARF due to acute airway (upper or lower) obstruction or certain primary parenchymal lung disease, and in specific circumstances, such as postoperative or postextubation ARF, immunocompromised patients with ARF, or as a means to facilitate extubation. NPPV was well tolerated with rare major complications and was associated with improved gas exchange, decreased work of breathing, and ETI avoidance in 22-100% of patients. High FiO(2 )needs or high PaCO(2 )level on admission or within the first hours after starting NPPV appeared to be the best independent predictive factors for the NPPV failure in children with ARF. However, many important issues, such as the identification of the patient, the right time for NPPV application, and the appropriate setting, are still lacking. Further randomized, controlled trials that address these issues in children with ARF are recommended.","Najaf-Zadeh, Abolfazl; Leclerc, Francis",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3224494/,224
883,Lung Function and Organ Dysfunctions in 178 Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation During The 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Pandemic,2011-08-17,"INTRODUCTION: Most cases of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection are self-limited, but occasionally the disease evolves to a severe condition needing hospitalization. Here we describe the evolution of the respiratory compromise, ventilatory management and laboratory variables of patients with diffuse viral pneumonitis caused by pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) admitted to the ICU. METHOD: This was a multicenter, prospective inception cohort study including adult patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) admitted to 20 ICUs in Argentina between June and September of 2009 during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. In a standard case-report form, we collected epidemiological characteristics, results of real-time reverse-transcriptase--polymerase-chain-reaction viral diagnostic tests, oxygenation variables, acid-base status, respiratory mechanics, ventilation management and laboratory tests. Variables were recorded on ICU admission and at days 3, 7 and 10. RESULTS: During the study period 178 patients with diffuse viral pneumonitis requiring MV were admitted. They were 44 ± 15 years of age, with Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores of 18 ± 7, and most frequent comorbidities were obesity (26%), previous respiratory disease (24%) and immunosuppression (16%). Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was applied in 49 (28%) patients on admission, but 94% were later intubated. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was present throughout the entire ICU stay in the whole group (mean PaO(2)/FIO(2 )170 ± 25). Tidal-volumes used were 7.8 to 8.1 ml/kg (ideal body weight), plateau pressures always remained < 30 cmH(2)O, without differences between survivors and non-survivors; and mean positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels used were between 8 to 12 cm H(2)O. Rescue therapies, like recruitment maneuvers (8 to 35%), prone positioning (12 to 24%) and tracheal gas insufflation (3%) were frequently applied. At all time points, pH, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase assay (LDH) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) differed significantly between survivors and non-survivors. Lack of recovery of platelet count and persistence of leukocytosis were characteristic of non-survivors. Mortality was high (46%); and length of MV was 10 (6 to 17) days. CONCLUSIONS: These patients had severe, hypoxemic respiratory failure compatible with ARDS that persisted over time, frequently requiring rescue therapies to support oxygenation. NIV use is not warranted, given its high failure rate. Death and evolution to prolonged mechanical ventilation were common outcomes. Persistence of thrombocytopenia, acidosis and leukocytosis, and high LDH levels found in non-survivors during the course of the disease might be novel prognostic findings.","Ríos, Fernando G; Estenssoro, Elisa; Villarejo, Fernando; Valentini, Ricardo; Aguilar, Liliana; Pezzola, Daniel; Valdez, Pascual; Blasco, Miguel; Orlandi, Cristina; Alvarez, Javier; Saldarini, Fernando; Gómez, Alejandro; Gómez, Pablo E; Deheza, Martin; Zazu, Alan; Quinteros, Mónica; Chena, Ariel; Osatnik, Javier; Violi, Damian; Gonzalez, Maria Eugenia; Chiappero, Guillermo",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3387643/,224
1500,Inhibition of pulmonary nuclear factor kappa-B decreases the severity of acute Escherichia coli pneumonia but worsens prolonged pneumonia,2013-04-27,"INTRODUCTION: Nuclear factor (NF)-κB is central to the pathogenesis of inflammation in acute lung injury, but also to inflammation resolution and repair. We wished to determine whether overexpression of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα could modulate the severity of acute and prolonged pneumonia-induced lung injury in a series of prospective randomized animal studies. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to undergo intratracheal instillation of (a) 5 × 10(9 )adenoassociated virus (AAV) vectors encoding the IκBα transgene (5 × 10(9 )AAV-IκBα); (b) 1 × 10(10 )AAV-IκBα; (c) 5 × 10(10 )AAV-IκBα; or (d) vehicle alone. After intratracheal inoculation with Escherichia coli, the severity of the lung injury was measured in one series over a 4-hour period (acute pneumonia), and in a second series after 72 hours (prolonged pneumonia). Additional experiments examined the effects of IκBα and null-gene overexpression on E. coli-induced and sham pneumonia. RESULTS: In acute pneumonia, IκBα dose-dependently decreased lung injury, improving arterial oxygenation and lung static compliance, reducing alveolar protein leak and histologic injury, and decreasing alveolar IL-1β concentrations. Benefit was maximal at the intermediate (1 × 10(10)) IκBα vector dose; however, efficacy was diminished at the higher (5 × 10(10)) IκBα vector dose. In contrast, IκBα worsened prolonged pneumonia-induced lung injury, increased lung bacterial load, decreased lung compliance, and delayed resolution of the acute inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of pulmonary NF-κB activity reduces early pneumonia-induced injury, but worsens injury and bacterial load during prolonged pneumonia.","Devaney, James; Curley, Gerard F; Hayes, Mairead; Masterson, Claire; Ansari, Bilal; O'Brien, Timothy; O'Toole, Daniel; Laffey, John G",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4056114/,224
4403,Neuromuscular blockade in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,2020-01-28,"BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) has been proposed by medical guidelines for early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) because of its survival benefits. However, new studies have provided evidence contradicting these results. METHOD: A search was performed of the Pubmed, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Virtual Health Library databases for randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating 28-day mortality in ARDS patients treated with NMBA within 48 h. An English language restriction was applied. Relevant data were extracted and pooled into risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effect model. Sensitivity and meta-regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: From 2675 studies, we included five RCTs in the analysis, for a total of 1461 patients with a mean PaO(2)/FIO(2) of 104 ± 35 mmHg. The cisatracurium group had the same risk of death at 28 days (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78–1.03; I(2) = 50%, p = 0.12) and 90 days (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62–1.06; I(2) = 56%, p = 0.06) as the control group (no cisatracurium). The secondary outcomes of mechanical ventilation duration and ventilator-free days were not different between the two groups. Cisatracurium had a significantly lower risk of barotrauma than the control group with no difference in intensive care unit (ICU)–induced weakness. The PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was higher in the cisatracurium group but not until 48 h. Meta-regression analysis of the baseline PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) revealed no heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis excluding the trial using high PEEP and light sedation strategy yielded an improvement in all mortality outcomes. CONCLUSION: NMBA improves oxygenation only after 48 h in moderate, severe ARDS patients and has a lower barotrauma risk without affecting ICU weakness. However, NMBA does not reduce ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation or, most importantly, the mortality risk regardless of the severity of ARDS.","Ho, An Thi Nhat; Patolia, Setu; Guervilly, Christophe",J Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6986163/,224

5749,Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in children: case mix and the utility of respiratory severity indices,2013-12-27,"Objective: To identify factors associated with mortality and prolonged ventilatory requirements in patients admitted to our paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with tracheobronchial malacia and stenosis diagnosed by dynamic contrast bronchograms. Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Tertiary paediatric intensive care unit. Patients: Forty-eight cases admitted to our PICU over a 5-year period in whom a diagnosis of tracheobronchial malacia or stenosis was made by dynamic contrast bronchography (1994–1999). Interventions: Conservative management, tracheostomy and long-term ventilation, surgical correction, internal or external airway stenting. Measurements and results: Recording of clinical details, length of invasive ventilation and appearance at contrast bronchography. Five groups of patients were defined: isolated primary airway pathology (n=7), ex-premature infants (n=11), vascular rings (n=9), complex cardiac and/or syndromic pathology (n=17) and tracheo-oesophageal fistulae (n=4). The overall mortality was 29%. Median length of invasive ventilation in survivors was 38 days and in patients who died 45. Mortality was highest in the patients with complex cardiac and/or syndromic pathology (p=0.039 Cox regression analysis) but was not related to any other factor. Patients with stenosis required a significantly longer period of ventilatory support (median length of ventilation 59 days) than patients with malacia (39 days). Conclusions: Length of ventilation and bronchographic diagnosis did not predict survival. The only factor found to contribute significantly to mortality was the presence of complex cardiac and/or syndromic pathology. However, patients with stenosis required longer ventilatory support than patients with malacia.","Inwald, David P.; Roebuck, Derek; Elliott, Martin J.; Mok, Quen",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094939/,224

6613,High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation in Pediatric Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Disease-Specific Morbidity Survival Analysis,2012-10-05,"Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a major diagnostic tool in lung diseases, including viral respiratory infections. We aimed to better define the situations where viral tests should be performed on BAL fluid (BALF). We retrospectively studied all cases where viral tests [immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry, viral culture, and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)] were performed on BALF during a period of 1 year (2008) in our institution. We compared the characteristics of patients with virus-positive versus virus-negative BALF. Of the 636 BALF samples sent to the microbiology laboratory, 232 underwent viral tests. Of these, 70 (30 %) were positive and identified 85 viruses: herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 (n = 27), cytomegalovirus (CMV, n = 23), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV, n = 18), human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 (n = 12), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, n = 3), rhinovirus (n = 1), and adenovirus (n = 1). The variables associated with positive viral tests on univariate analysis were immunosuppression [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), corticosteroids >10 mg/day for ≥3 weeks, or other immunosuppressive therapy], ground-glass attenuations on computed tomography (CT) scanning, late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and durations of (i) hospital stay, (ii) intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and (iii) mechanical ventilation before BAL (p < 0.01 for each comparison). On multivariate analysis, only immunosuppression [odds ratio (OR) 6.4, 95 % confidence interval (CI) [2.8–14.3], p < 0.0001] and ground-glass attenuations (OR 3.7, 95 % CI [1.8–7.7], p = 0.0004) remained associated with virus-positive BAL. None of the viral tests performed on BALF for the initial assessment of diffuse infiltrative lung disease (n = 15) was positive. PCR improved the diagnostic yield of viral tests on BALF by 50 %. Testing for viruses on BALF should be mostly restricted to immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory diseases and/or patients with unexplained ground-glass attenuations on CT scanning.","Jouneau, S.; Poineuf, J.-S.; Minjolle, S.; Tattevin, P.; Uhel, F.; Kerjouan, M.; Le Hô, H.; Desrues, B.",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101843/,224

Although this syndrome affects the lung heterogeneously, mechanical ventilation is not guided by regional indicators of potential lung injury. We used electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to estimate the extent of regional lung overdistension and atelectasis during mechanical ventilation. Techniques for tidal breath detection, lung identification, and regional compliance estimation were combined with the Graz consensus on EIT lung imaging (GREIT) algorithm. Nine ALI/ARDS patients were monitored during stepwise increases and decreases in airway pressure. Our method detected individual breaths with 96.0% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity. The duration and volume of tidal breaths erred on average by 0.2 s and 5%, respectively. Respiratory system compliance from EIT and ventilator measurements had a correlation coefficient of 0.80. Stepwise increases in pressure could reverse atelectasis in 17% of the lung. At the highest pressures, 73% of the lung became overdistended. During stepwise decreases in pressure, previously-atelectatic regions remained open at sub-baseline pressures. We recommend that the proposed approach be used in collaborative research of EIT-guided ventilation strategies for ALI/ARDS.","Gómez-Laberge, Camille; Arnold, John H.; Wolf, Gerhard K.",IEEE Trans Med Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176466/,224
10845,Phenotypic heterogeneity by site of infection in surgical sepsis: a prospective longitudinal study,2020-05-07,"PURPOSE: To describe ICU stay, selected management aspects, and outcome of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Europe, and to quantify variation across centers. METHODS: This is a prospective observational multicenter study conducted across 18 countries in Europe and Israel. Admission characteristics, clinical data, and outcome were described at patient- and center levels. Between-center variation in the total ICU population was quantified with the median odds ratio (MOR), with correction for case-mix and random variation between centers. RESULTS: A total of 2138 patients were admitted to the ICU, with median age of 49 years; 36% of which were mild TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale; GCS 13–15). Within, 72 h 636 (30%) were discharged and 128 (6%) died. Early deaths and long-stay patients (> 72 h) had more severe injuries based on the GCS and neuroimaging characteristics, compared with short-stay patients. Long-stay patients received more monitoring and were treated at higher intensity, and experienced worse 6-month outcome compared to short-stay patients. Between-center variations were prominent in the proportion of short-stay patients (MOR = 2.3, p < 0.001), use of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring (MOR = 2.5, p < 0.001) and aggressive treatments (MOR = 2.9, p < 0.001); and smaller in 6-month outcome (MOR = 1.2, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Half of contemporary TBI patients at the ICU have mild to moderate head injury. Substantial between-center variations exist in ICU stay and treatment policies, and less so in outcome. It remains unclear whether admission of short-stay patients represents appropriate prudence or inappropriate use of clinical resources.

Material and Methods: A systematic literature search was performed, including clinical studies on adults (aged at least 18 years) with a verified diagnosis of rheumatic disease. Results: 26 out of 41 clinical studies including rheumatoid arthritis (RA, seven studies), systemic sclerosis (SSc, five), Sjögren syndrome (SS, eight), Behcet disease (BD, four), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, one) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS, one) were found. In 15 studies, a healthy control group was recruited. The short form of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP 14) was most frequently applied. The majority of studies (14/15) reported worse OHRQoL in patients with rheumatic disease compared to healthy individuals. In particular, patients with SS (salivary flow and composition) or BD (oral ulcers) showed a relation between OHRQoL and disease-specific oral manifestations. Most studies investigating subscales of OHRQoL (5/6) found the subscale physical disability to be predominantly affected in patients with rheumatic diseases. About half of the studies reported impaired psychosocial aspects. Conclusion: Patients with rheumatic diseases exhibit reduced OHRQoL, especially in diseases with oral manifestations like SS and BD. Physical affections due to oral diseases and psychosocial impairments caused by disease-related parameters must be recognized within patient-centered dental care.","Schmalz, Gerhard; Patschan, Susann; Patschan, Daniel; Ziebolz, Dirk",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7231140/,224

METHODS: We obtained a list of accredited 104 Pain Medicine Fellowship Program websites from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and the Electronic Residency Application Service. Individual Pain Medicine Fellowship Program websites were then evaluated on 14 different criteria. We grouped fellowship programs based on census region and Electronic Residency Application Service participation status, and analyzed the differences using nonparametric statistics. RESULTS: A total of 104 accredited Pain Medicine Fellowship Program websites were evaluated for a total of 14 different criteria. Of the 14 different criteria, an average of 3.94 were described in each website. Number of Fellowship positions per year (71.8%), clinical rotations during the program (65.1%), and faculty background (62.2%) were the most frequently described features on the websites. Night call responsibilities (3.9%), meal allowance (7.8%) and parking availability (10.7%) were the least described features in the websites. There were no significant differences between program websites when grouped by census regions or the participation status in the Electronic Residency Applications Service. CONCLUSION: The content of Pain Medicine Fellowship Program websites is extremely variable across the United States of America. This study indicates that there is room for improvement and enhancement of the comprehensiveness of website content for the majority of the programs analyzed.

C. albicans strongly adheres to the surface of epithelial cells so that subsequent colonization and biofilm formation can take place. Divalent galactoside glycomimetic 1 was found to be a potent inhibitor of the adhesion of C. albicans to buccal epithelial cells. In this work, we explore the effect of multivalent presentations of glycomimetic 1 on its ability to inhibit yeast adhesion and biofilm formation. Tetra-, hexa-, and hexadecavalent displays of compound 1 were built on RAFT cyclopeptide- and polylysine-based scaffolds with a highly efficient and modular synthesis. Biological evaluation revealed that the scaffold choice significantly influences the activity of the lower valency conjugates, with compound 16, constructed on a tetravalent polylysine scaffold, found to inhibit the adhesion of C. albicans to human buccal epithelial cells more effectively than the glycomimetic 1; however, the latter performed better in the biofilm reduction assays. Interestingly, the higher valency glycoconjugates did not outperform the anti-adhesion activity of the original compound 1, and no significant effect of the core scaffold could be appreciated. SEM images of C. albicans cells treated with compounds 1, 14, and 16 revealed significant differences in the aggregation patterns of the yeast cells.","Martin, Harlei; Goyard, David; Margalit, Anatte; Doherty, Kyle; Renaudet, Olivier; Kavanagh, Kevin; Velasco-Torrijos, Trinidad",Bioconjug Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8154258/,224

20373,Efficacy of High-Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy in Patients with Mild Hypercapnia,2021-08-27,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Tranexamic acid can be an effective and safe way to reduce perioperative bleeding following an endoprosthetic reconstruction of a lower limb after a bone tumor resection. Tranexamic acid does not result in a complete shutdown of the fibrinolysis, supporting its safe use without increasing the risk of thromboembolic complications. ABSTRACT: Background: An endoprosthetic reconstruction in musculoskeletal oncology patients is associated with significant blood loss. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid (TXA) for these patients and to assess any changes in their hemostatic profile using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Methods: A retrospective observational study was performed including 61 patients with primary or metastatic bone tumors who underwent surgery. Group A (n = 30) received both intravenous and local TXA whereas Group B (n = 31) was the control group. The primary outcomes were perioperative blood loss and blood unit transfusions and the secondary outcomes included the incidence of thromboembolic complications and a change in blood coagulability as reflected by ROTEM parameters. Results: The median difference in blood loss between the two groups was 548.5 mL, indicating a 29.2% reduction in the 72 h blood loss following TXA administration (p < 0.001). TXA also led to a reduced transfusion of 1 red blood cell (RBC) unit per patient (p < 0.001). The two groups had similar rates of thromboembolic complications (p = 0.99). The antifibrinolytic properties of TXA were confirmed by the significantly higher INTEM, FIBTEM and EXTEM LI60 (p < 0.001, p = 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively) values in the TXA group. Conclusion: Tranexamic acid was associated with a significant reduction in perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements without a complete shutdown of the fibrinolysis. Larger studies are warranted to assess the frequency of these outcomes in musculoskeletal oncology patients.","Tsantes, Andreas G.; Trikoupis, Ioannis G.; Papadopoulos, Dimitrios V.; Goumenos, Stavros; Piovani, Daniele; Nikolopoulos, Georgios K.; Gialeraki, Argyri; Bonovas, Stefanos; Papagelopoulos, Panayiotis J.; Kontogeorgakos, Vasilios A.; Tsantes, Argirios E.",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8392365/,224

These inhibitors are commonly used to alter the cell surface glycosylation. However, structural analysis of the released glycans has been limited. In this research, the cell membranes were enriched and the glycans were released to obtain the N-glycans of the glycocalyx. Glycomic analysis using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) with a PGC chip column was used to profile the structures in the cell membrane. Glycans of untreated cells were compared to glycans of cells treated with inhibitors, including kifunensine, which inhibits the formation of complex- and hybrid-type structures, 2,4,7,8,9-Penta-O-acetyl-N-acetyl-3-fluoro-b-d-neuraminic acid methyl ester for sialylated glycans, 2-deoxy-2-fluorofucose, and 6-alkynyl fucose for fucosylated glycans. Kifunensine was the most effective, converting nearly 95% of glycans to high mannose types. The compound 6-alkynyl fucose inhibited some fucosylation but also incorporated into the glycan structure. Proteomic analysis of the enriched membrane for the four inhibitors showed only small changes in the proteome accompanied by large changes in the N-glycome for Caco-2. Future works may use these inhibitors to study the cellular behavior associated with the alteration of glycosylation in various biological systems, e.g., viral and bacterial infection, drug binding, and cell–cell interactions.","Zhou, Qingwen; Xie, Yixuan; Lam, Matthew; Lebrilla, Carlito B.",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8465854/,224

Initial studies focused on the use of the chemokine ligands, or altered derivatives, of CXCR4 and CCR5 to prevent the entrance of HIV-1 into immune cells (Schols 2006). While these studies showed some initial promise, there was evidence of significant caveats to their use, including selection of alternative coreceptor utilizing strains (Marechal et al. 1999; Mosier et al. 1999) and the potential to cause inflammatory side effects. These data prompted the development and study of small molecule inhibitors of CXCR4 and CCR5, which have also been used to examine the roles of these molecules in a variety of inflammatory and infectious diseases.","Klein, Robyn S.; McCandless, Erin E.",Chemokine Receptors and NeuroAIDS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120588/,224

If such a game has deterministic winning strategies, one may ask how simple such strategies can get. The answer may help with actual implementation, or to win despite imperfect information, or to conceal sensitive information especially if the game is repeated. Given a concurrent two-player win/lose game of infinite duration, this article considers equivalence relations over histories of played actions. A classical restriction used here is that equivalent histories have equal length, hence time awareness. A sufficient condition is given such that if a player has winning strategies, she has one that prescribes the same action at equivalent histories, hence uniformization. The proof is fairly constructive and preserves finiteness of strategy memory, and counterexamples show relative tightness of the result. Several corollaries follow for games with states and colors.","Le Roux, Stéphane",Beyond the Horizon of Computability,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309480/,224

In fact, ellipses can describe many objects in real images like manufactured objects, cells, ball, or traffic signs. Furthermore, an ellipse is defined by five parameters: the center coordinates, the semi major axe, the semi minor axe and the orientation, which require more computational power to estimate them. Some non-ideal ellipses cause also difficulties for detection such as occlusion, appearance of multiple ellipses at same time and non-parallel ellipse. In this paper, we are interested in detecting elliptical traffic signs. We present a method for detecting different cases of ellipses: simple, partially occluded, non-parallel, multiple ellipses in images. The method selects three lines to find the ellipse center, and then it calculates the value of the semi minor and major axes of the ellipse. Experiments show that the proposed method performs well on real images in the presence or not of noises.","El Baz, Manal; Zaki, Taher; Douzi, Hassan",Image and Signal Processing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340956/,224

As the number of displaced persons seeking refuge has reached unprecedented numbers, states have resorted to measures to circumvent their obligations under the Convention. These range from bilateral agreements condemning refugees to their vessels at sea to the excision of certain territories from national jurisdiction. While socio-economic developments and the rise of the worldwide web have led to deterritorialization of vast domains of the economy and the media which enable them to escape from state control, territorial presence, whether on terra firma or on vessels at sea which are functional surrogates for territorial sovereignty, continues to be the basis for the entitlement to human and citizens’ rights. We are facing a dual movement of deterritorialization and territorialization at once, both of which threaten the end of the 1951 Convention. This article is an exercise in non-ideal theory which, nonetheless, has implications for a seminal question in ideal democratic theory as to how to define and justify the boundaries of the demos. If the demos refers to the constitutional subject of a self-determining entity in whose name sovereignty is exercised, regimes of sovereignty, including those which govern the movement of peoples across borders, define the prerogatives as well as obligations of such sovereign entities under international law. The period ushered in by the 1951 Convention was such a sovereignty regime which today may be nearing its end.","Benhabib, Seyla",Jus Cogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7385328/,224

Based on 2002 and 2012 input-output tables and a large data set of production and foreign trade, we estimate the production and imported input use for 20 sectors, mainly from the manufacturing industry. We calculate import requirement ratios, comprising both direct and indirect effects, for each sector using the Leontief inverse matrix. Our findings indicate that import dependency increases for exports, but stays relatively stable for production over time. In general, the import content of production is lower than that of exports. This difference is mainly attributable to the services sector, which has low import dependency, yet a large share in production. Sectors with the highest import requirements are those with higher capital and technology intensity, such as petroleum products, basic metals, and motor vehicles. Agriculture, forestry and fishery; services and mining sectors have the lowest import requirements.","Erduman, Yasemin; Eren, Okan; Gül, Selçuk",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7434370/,224

Their key features are introduced, and the main challenges and opportunities associated with the technologies are analysed. In all cases, a crucial change is underway: reality (or, at least, the perception thereof) is seen as increasingly less stable, and potential for manipulation is on the rise. In fact, it transpires that personalisation of (perceived) reality is the likely outcome, with increasing societal fragmentation as a result. Mediatisation is used as a broad-ranging metatheory that explains the permeation by media of everyday affairs to explain the degree of impact that synthetic media have on the society. In this context, it is suggested that we search for new and alternative criteria for reality that would be capable of accounting for the changing nature of agency and impact in today’s world.","Kalpokas, Ignas",SN Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649059/,224

In the analysis, we identified (1) how participants assessed their situations; (2) their thoughts, feelings and actions in relation to their situations; and (3) their grounds for these thoughts, feelings and actions. The societal dimension of subjective experience is articulated by identifying the prevalent societal discourses featured in participants’ descriptions. The analysis showed that participants described themselves as vulnerable prior to the intervention and motivated after the intervention. Participants experienced tailored support as being significant in fostering the change. Individual descriptions of how the learning and training conditions were experienced constitute valuable knowledge about the possible ways of acting and experiencing in relation to common structures.

56541,Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with heart failure admitted to the intensive care unit with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19): a multicenter cohort study,2021-07-29,"Background. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with its high mortality, has become an urgent clinical problem. It is well established that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells after binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and utilizes a spike protein (S) for attachment and entry into the cells, leading to their lysis or damage. This infection damages several organs, including lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and intestines and may lead to a fatal complication known as a “cytokine storm”, which is the result of uncontrolled hyperactivation of the innate immunity-initiated response and the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. An important potential aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection is damage to the stem cell compartment, which may lead to severe complications from the infection. The ACE2 receptor has been described as being expressed on the surfaces of certain types of stem cells, including specified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). These cells could be potentially damaged and lysed after virus entry or could undergo pyroptosis due to hyperactivation of Nlrp3 inflammasomes. Supporting this possibility, we recently reported that all Nlrp3 inflammasome components are expressed in HSCs (Adamiak, M et al. Nlrp3 Inflammasome Signaling Regulates the Homing and Engraftment of Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSPCs) by Enhancing Incorporation of CXCR4 Receptor into Membrane Lipid Rafts. Stem Cell Rev and Rep (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s12015-020-10005-w). Hypothesis. We hypothesized that one of the triggers of a cytokine storm could be interaction of the ACE2 receptor with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, leading to hyperactivation of Nlrp3 inflammsomes in target cells including population of stem cells.Materials and Methods. Experiments were performed on human stem cells at different levels of specification, including very small CD34(+)CD133(+)lin(-)CD45(-) cells, which may become specified into HSCs and EPCs, as well as human CD34(+)Lin(-)CD45(+) HSCs and CD34(+) CD133(+) KDR(+) CD31(+) EPCs. These cells were phenotyped for expression of ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 entry-facilitating transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 at the mRNA level and by FACS at the protein level. Next, we exposed these cells to the NCP-CoV (2019-nCoV) spike protein (S1+S2 ECD, expressed with a His-tag; Sino Biological) at a concentration of 10 nM. After 16 h of incubation, the cells were lysed, and total RNA was isolated for qRT-PCR analysis of Nlrp3 and essential Nlrp3 inflammasome components, including ASC, caspase 1, IL1b, and IL18. In some experiments, UCB-derived HSCs were plated into 96-well plates and stimulated with NCP-CoV (2019-nCoV) spike protein, as described above, alone or together with angiotensin 1-7 or the anti-inflammatory heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) activator CoPP. Results. First, we observed that the ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 entry-facilitating transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 are expressed by all types of stem cells evaluated in our studies. Moreover, we detected activation of Nlrp3 inflammasomes in response to viral spike protein. This activation was inhibited by exposure of the stimulated cells to angiotensin 1-7 or CoPP. Conclusions. We envision that, in addition to directly infecting target cells, virus can hyperactivate the Nlrp3 inflammasome in stem cells, which may trigger their pyroptosis. Therefore, since we still do not have an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in hand, the results presented in our current work suggest that inhibition of the Nlrp3 inflammasome by the small-molecule inhibitor MCC950 or application of Nlrp3 inflammasome inhibitors, such as Ang (1-7) or heme oxygenase 1 activators, could find potential clinical application to prevent the onset of a cytokine storm and cell pyroptosis.

The impact on binding with the neutralizing antibodies was also assessed with an ELISA assay. Pseudotyped virus carrying a L452R-E484Q variant showed a comparable infectivity compared with D614G. However, there was a significant reduction in the neutralization activity of the immune sera from non-human primates vaccinated with a recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) protein, convalescent patients, and healthy vaccinees vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine. In addition, there was a reduction in binding of L452R-E484Q-D614G protein to the antibodies of the immune sera from vaccinated non-human primates.

Here we describe the post-COVID symptoms of 675 patients followed up using a virtual review pathway, stratified by severity of acute COVID infection. METHODS COVID-19 survivors completed an online/telephone questionnaire of symptoms after 12+ weeks and a chest radiograph. Dependent on findings at virtual review, patients were provided information leaflets, attended for investigations and/or were reviewed face-to-face. Outcomes were compared between patients following high-risk and low-risk admissions for COVID pneumonia, and community referrals. RESULTS Patients reviewed after hospitalisation for COVID pneumonia had a median of two ongoing physical health symptoms post-COVID. The most common was fatigue (50.3% of high-risk patients). Symptom burden did not vary significantly by severity of hospitalised COVID pneumonia but was highest in community referrals. Symptoms suggestive of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder were common (depression occurred in 24.9% of high-risk patients). Asynchronous virtual review facilitated triage of patients at highest need of face-to-face review. CONCLUSION Many patients continue to have a significant burden of post-COVID symptoms irrespective of severity of initial pneumonia. How best to assess and manage long COVID will be of major importance over the next few years.","Taylor, Rebecca R; Trivedi, Bhavi; Patel, Neena; Singh, Richa; Ricketts, William M; Elliott, Katharine; Yarwood, Marcus; White, Veronica; Hylton, Hannah; Allen, Ruth; Thomas, Gavin; Kapil, Vikas; McGuckin, Rachel; Pfeffer, Paul E",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2021-0037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34103378/,224

Areas covered: Of the over 180,000 participants in clinical trials and large registries of statin users, only a few studies have included a standard manual muscle test (MMT), dynamometry or a focused questionnaire to assess for proximal weakness and related disability in daily and recreational activities. Formal strength testing suggests, however, that weakness can be demonstrated in at least 10% of users. Expert opinion: Reporting inaccuracies about SAMS, confirmation bias among experts and physicians, absence of a standard questionnaire regarding the potential consequences of weakness on physical capacity, and the failure to routinely perform an objective assessment of strength may have led to under-diagnosis of statin-induced myopathy. A brief MMT before cholesterol lowering agents are started and at follow-up visits, a 12-week withdrawal of the statin in the presence of new paresis without an alternative cause, and the exam finding that strength recovers off the statin are necessary to assess the incidence of drug-induced proximal weakness and inform alternative therapeutic strategies.","Dobkin, Bruce H",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737175.2021.1866988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33339465/,224

Data were combined using the general variance-based method on the effect estimate for each study. Separate meta-analyses according to type of COVID-19 patients (hospitalized or intensive care unit [ICU] patients), anticoagulants (mainly heparin), and regimens (therapeutic or prophylactic) were conducted. A total of 29 articles were selected, but 23 retrospective studies were eligible for quantitative meta-analyses. No clinical trial was retrieved. The majority of studies were of good quality; however, 34% did not distinguish heparin from other anticoagulants. Meta-analysis on 25,719 hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed that anticoagulant use was associated with 50% reduced in-hospital mortality risk (pooled risk ratio [RR]: 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40-0.62; I 2: 87%). Both anticoagulant regimens (therapeutic and prophylactic) reduced in-hospital all-cause mortality, compared with no anticoagulation. Particularly in ICU patients, the anticoagulant therapeutic regimen was associated with a reduced in-hospital mortality risk (RR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.15-0.60; I 2: 58%) compared with the prophylactic one. However, the former was also associated with a higher risk of bleeding (RR: 2.53, 95% CI: 1.60-4.00; I 2: 65%). Anticoagulant use, mainly heparin, reduced all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients during hospitalization. Due to the higher risk of bleeding at therapeutic doses, the use of prophylactic dosages of anticoagulant is probably to be preferred in noncritically ill COVID-19 patients.","Parisi, Roberta; Costanzo, Simona; Di Castelnuovo, Augusto; de Gaetano, Giovanni; Donati, Maria Benedetta; Iacoviello, Licia",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1726034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851386/,224

A retrospective study was conducted from January 2014 to February 2019. A total of 44 patients and 52 nodules (mean tumor size, 17.2±4.9 mm) were treated with MWA, and 55 patients and 70 nodules (mean tumor size, 17.7±6.4 mm) were treated with RFA. After 4 days of treatment, the direct effects of ablation were assessed using dynamic CT, and after discharge, a follow-up dynamic CT scan was performed every 3-4 months. Treatment efficacy, complications and local recurrence were recorded. For MWA and RFA, the average number of CT sessions were 1.05±0.23 and 1.28±0.54, respectively, and the mean ablation times were 5.0±2.0 and 8.1±4.8 min. Following MWA and RFA, the ablation ranges that were evaluated with the axial images were 31.9±5.5 and 33.3±9.0 mm, respectively, in the long-axis diameter and 27.6±5.3 and 23.4±6.8 mm, respectively, in the short-axis diameter. The flatness ratios of the ablation regions were 0.13±0.09 and 0.29±0.14 (axial image) and 0.11±0.07 and 0.28±0.14 (coronal image), respectively. The rates of complete tumor necrosis were comparable. The complication rates were 13.6% (MWA) and 14.5% (RFA), which were not significantly different. The cumulative local recurrence rates were not significantly different between the two methods (one-year recurrence rate, MWA: 6.91%, RFA: 5.17%). MWA was therefore indicated to be an effective treatment for HCC in respect to session number, treatment time and spherical ablation.","Suwa, Kanehiko; Seki, Toshihito; Tsuda, Rinako; Yamashina, Masao; Murata, Miki; Yamaguchi, Takashi; Nishio, Akiyoshi; Okazaki, Kazuichi",Molecular and clinical oncology,https://doi.org/10.3892/mco.2020.1983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32064099/,224

RECENT FINDINGS Advanced molecular diagnostics have identified HRVs as pathogens frequently causing wheezing illnesses in infants and young children. Wheezing during HRV infection in early life identifies children at particularly high-risk of asthma development. Plausible mechanisms by which HRV could cause airway damage, promote airway remodeling, and lead to asthma development have recently been identified. SUMMARY HRV is a significant source of morbidity in infants and young children. The present review identifies mechanisms by which HRV lower respiratory tract infection, particularly in a susceptible host, could promote the development of childhood asthma. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the link between HRV wheezing in early childhood and subsequent asthma development, with the critical goal of identifying novel therapeutic and prevention strategies for both early childhood wheezing and asthma.","Jackson, Daniel J",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aci.0b013e3283352f7c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19996738/,224

Associating liver partition with portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy assisted with radiofrequency (RALPPS) was introduced as an alternative method. A randomized controlled trial comparing PVE with RALPPS for the pre-operative manipulation of liver volume in patients with a future liver remnant volume (FLRV) ≤25% (or ≤35% if receiving preoperative chemotherapy) was conducted. The primary endpoint was increase in size of the FLRV. The secondary endpoints were length of time taken for the volume gain, morbidity, operation length and post-operative liver function. Between July 2015 and October 2017, 57 patients were randomised to RALPPS (n = 29) and PVE (n = 28). The mean percentage of increase in the FLRV was 80.7 ± 13.7% after a median 20 days following RALPPS compared to 18.4 ± 9.8% after 35 days (p < 0.001) following PVE. Twenty-four patients after RALPPS and 21 after PVE underwent stage-2 operation. Final resection was achieved in 92.3% and 66.6% patients in RALPPS and PVE, respectively (p = 0.007). There was no difference in morbidity, and one 30-day mortality after RALPPS (p = 0.991) was reported. RALPPS is more effective than PVE in increasing FLRV and the number of patients for surgical resection.","Jiao, Long R; Fajardo Puerta, Ana B; Gall, Tamara M H; Sodergren, Mikael H; Frampton, Adam E; Pencavel, Tim; Nagendran, Myura; Habib, Nagy A; Darzi, Ara; Pai, Madhava; Thomas, Rob; Tait, Paul",Cancers,https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers11030302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30836678/,224

The primary goal of LEEs should be to facilitate the improvement of endoscopic patient care through the acquisition of best endoscopic practice. Patients should not expect additional benefit from being treated during a LEE compared to a routine setting. There is limited available evidence on LEE safety but to date there is no indication that patients are at increased risk from participation. Pre-recorded cases with live facilitation can also be used to fulfill learning outcomes. Establishing an endoscopic curriculum with clear learning outcomes is important to structure attendees' learning, assess course outcomes, and allow appropriate targeting of courses to learner experience. Increasingly, LEEs are streamed online and therefore the necessary measures should be taken to ensure that patients have given appropriate consent and that their anonymity has been safeguarded. ESGE recommends that an endoscopist who is not participating in the live demonstrations is named as patient advocate, and that patient safety should must be prioritized throughout. In all ESGE-organized LEEs the intended learning outcomes, procedural indications and descriptions, attendee feedback, and adverse events should be recorded and submitted in a post-event report to ESGE.","Webster, George J; El Menabawey, Tareq; Arvanitakis, Marianna; Hassan, Cesare; van Hooft, Jeanin E; Messmann, Helmut; Dinis-Ribeiro, Mário",Endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1511-1657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34111899/,224

Lithium niobate, for example, has traditionally been widely used to fabricate high-speed optical modulators due to its large Pockels effect. Another material, barium titanate, nominally has a 50 times stronger r-parameter and would ordinarily be a more attractive material choice for such modulators or other applications. In practice, barium titanate thin films for optical waveguide devices are usually grown on magnesium oxide due to its low refractive index, allowing vertical mode confinement. However, the crystal quality is normally degraded. Here, a group of scandate-based substrates with small lattice mismatch and low refractive index compared to that of barium titanate is identified, thus concurrently satisfying high crystal quality and vertical optical mode confinement. This work provides a platform for nonlinear on-chip optoelectronics and can be promising for waveguide-based optical devices such as Mach-Zehnder modulators, wavelength division multiplexing, and quantum optics-on-chip.","Cao, Yu; Tan, Siew Li; Cheung, Eric Jun Hao; Siew, Shawn Yohanes; Li, Changjian; Liu, Yan; Tang, Chi Sin; Lal, Manohar; Chen, Guanyu; Dogheche, Karim; Yang, Ping; Pennycook, Steven; Wee, Andrew Thye Shen; Chua, Soojin; Dogheche, Elhadj; Venkatesan, Thirumalai; Danner, Aaron",Advanced materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202101128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323320/,224
72163,Immunodeficiency and inborn disorders of vitamin B12 and folate metabolism.,2020-05-13,"BACKGROUND Intraabdominal pressure often is blamed as the cause of mesh-fascia junction failure after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. Stretching of the mesh during a cough or defecation may lead to recurrence. Little is known about the movements of mesh in the abdominal cavity after this operation. This study investigated the front abdominal wall to describe its elasticity in vivo and searched for elongations that possibly stretched an implanted mesh, thereby causing fixation failure and subsequent recurrence. METHODS To measure front abdominal wall elongations, a model of fascia movements was created. Eight healthy volunteers were measured during exercise to determine the extent of elongations in their front abdominal wall. Videos were analyzed in three positions to create a mathematical shell structure. A computerized model based on the net movement of nodes was calculated to determine the axes and values for maximum elongations. RESULTS The largest average elongations were measured for the upper midline (32.08%) and the transverse line in the low lateral area (34.06%). The maximum values for these lines were larger than 100% for the middle line (133.78%) and exceeded 50% for the entire middle line. The values for the horizontal lines did not reach 10% at any level. According to these data, areas of both high and low elasticity were defined. CONCLUSIONS The presented experiment adds new parameters to the understanding of in vivo mesh behavior. Elongation of the front abdominal wall may stretch implanted mesh and could be a cause of recurrence in cases of insufficient fixation.","Smietański, Maciej; Bury, Kamil; Tomaszewska, Agnieszka; Lubowiecka, Izabela; Szymczak, Czesław",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2056-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22170318/,224

A peptide such as 15-IgBP can be selectively crosslinked to the fragment crystallizable region of human IgG in an affinity-dependent manner via the ε-amino group of Lys8. Previously, we found that the peptide 15-Lys8Leu has a high affinity (Kd = 8.19 nM) due to the presence of the γ-dimethyl group in Leu8. The primary amino group required for the crosslinking to the antibodies has however been lost. We report the design and synthesis of a novel unnatural amino acid, 4-(2-aminoethylcarbamoyl)leucine (Aecl), which possesses both the γ-dimethyl fragment and a primary amino group. A peptide containing Aecl8 (15-Lys8Aecl) was synthesized and showed a binding affinity 10-fold higher (Kd = 24.3 nM) than that of 15-IgBP (Kd = 267 nM). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled 15-Lys8Aecl with an N-hydroxy succinimide ester at the side chain of Aecl8 (FITC-15-Lys8Aecl(OSu)) successfully labeled an antibody (Trastuzumab, Herceptin®) with the fluorophore.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA This systematic review and meta-analysis included method-comparison studies, which compared TA temperature measurements with invasive thermometry ones, were published between 2000 and 2018, and were conducted on patients aged <18 years. SAMPLE Thirty articles were selected for inclusion in the final analysis after screening those identified by searches in CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Scopus. RESULTS Quantitative synthesis indicated that pooled mean TA temperature was lower than core temperature by 0.01 °C (95% limits of agreement, -0.06 °C to 0.03 °C). Average summary sensitivity and specificity for fever detection were 0.72 (95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.79) and 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.93) respectively. Subgroup analysis indicated a trend toward larger temperature underestimation in febrile patients and in ages ≤4 years. CONCLUSIONS Despite its satisfactory accuracy, precision and specificity, TA thermometry has low sensitivity when used in pediatric patients, which does not allow satisfactory fever detection. IMPLICATIONS TA thermometry cannot be recommended for replacing rectal temperature measurement methods in children, due to its high proportion of false negative readings during screening for fever.","Kiekkas, Panagiotis; Aretha, Diamanto; Almpani, Eleni; Stefanopoulos, Nikolaos",Journal of pediatric nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2019.03.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30865876/,224

As surgeons get more experienced in robotic surgery, modifications to existing techniques are tried to reduce surgical costs. Vaginal cuff closure using prograsp forceps in lieu of needle holder can be safe and cost-effective in patients undergoing robotic-assisted hysterectomy. The objective of this study is to compare the safety, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of using prograsp forceps in lieu of needle holder for suturing the vaginal cuff after robotic-assisted hysterectomy. This was a single-institution retrospective review of patients who underwent robotic-assisted hysterectomy for benign and malignant conditions from October 2015 to August 2018. Patients were stratified based on whether prograsp forceps or needle holder was used for suturing vaginal cuff. Data obtained included demographic, surgical data, and postoperative outcomes. Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square test were used to compare qualitative and quantitative data, respectively. 367 patients underwent robotic-assisted hysterectomies during this period. 75 patients belonged to the needle holder cohort; 292 patients had vaginal cuff closure using prograsp forceps. Vault closure time was comparable between the groups (6.4 vs. 6.6 p = 0.33). There were no significant differences in the postoperative vault-related complications between groups. There was no instrument damage in either group. Using prograsp saved 220 USD in instrument-related charges.

In this work, a carbon foam microwave plasma process is developed, utilizing plasma discharge to generate surface temperatures exceeding ∼3000 K in a N2 atmosphere, to convert unsorted white wastes into gases (H2, CO, C2H4, C3H6, CH4, etc.) and small amounts of inorganic minerals and solid carbon, which can be buried as artificial ""coal"". This process is self-perpetuating, as the new solid carbon asperities grafted onto the foam's surface actually increase the plasma discharge efficiency over time. This process has been characterized by in situ optical probes and infrared sensors and optimized to handle most of the forms of white waste without the need for pre-sorting or washing.

COVID-19 has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the widespread closure of schools, colleges and universities. The COVID-19 pandemic is also having a dramatic impact on societies and economies around the world. With various measures of lockdowns and social distancing in place, it becomes important to understand emotional intelligence of faculty members working in institutions of higher learning on a large scale in this pandemic. AIM The purpose of this article is to examine the perception of faculty members toward their emotional intelligence during COVID-19 and to study the impact of demographic variables on their emotional intelligence. METHOD The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The data for the study were collected through both the primary and secondary sources. Online questionnaires were used to gather the primary data. The measuring items used for the study were sourced from existing validated scales and literature. Descriptive statistics was employed to know the descriptive information across various demographic variables on a total sample of 683. The various demographic variables, which were considered for the study, were gender and designation. RESULTS The results revealed that the faculty members perceived their emotional intelligence at an above-average level in the present pandemic, that is, COVID-19. The results also revealed that the perception of the respondent faculty members toward their emotional intelligence from different universities and states is more or less the same and also the demographic variable gender has a significant impact on emotional intelligence during the present pandemic. CONCLUSION Besides having theoretical implications that open pathways for conducting further research, the findings of the study may serve as a reference for service practitioners in designing strategies that will ensure superior performance of faculty members in higher educational institutions during the pandemic.","Baba, Mubashir Majid",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020934519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32583710/,224

The traditional standard treatment has been surgical resection of the nidus. Recently, computed tomography (CT)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has gained favor as a more precise alternative due to potentially less bone destruction. However, CT-guided RFA is limited in treatment for osteoid osteoma involving complex anatomic structures such as cervical spine, pelvis, or scapula because of difficulty in approach and proximity to neurovascular structures. To solve this problem, we investigated RFA using a new real-time three-dimensional fluoroscopic navigation system. We report its technical procedure and use in a rare case of osteoid osteoma of the scapula.","Okada, Kiyoshi; Myoui, Akira; Hashimoto, Nobuyuki; Takenaka, Satoshi; Moritomo, Hisao; Murase, Tsuyoshi; Yoshikawa, Hideki",European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00590-013-1180-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23412321/,224

Individual Rab GTPases are distributed to specific organelles and thus serve as markers for discrete types of endocytic vesicles. Mammalian reovirus binds to cell surface glycans and junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and enters cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis in a process dependent on β1 integrin. Within organelles of the endocytic compartment, reovirus undergoes stepwise disassembly catalyzed by cathepsin proteases, which allows the disassembly intermediate to penetrate endosomal membranes and release the transcriptionally active viral core into the cytoplasm. The pathway used by reovirus to traverse the endocytic compartment is largely unknown. In this study, we found that reovirus particles traffic through early, late, and recycling endosomes during cell entry. After attachment to the cell surface, reovirus particles and JAM-A codistribute into each of these compartments. Transfection of cells with constitutively active and dominant-negative Rab GTPases that affect early and late endosome biogenesis and maturation influenced reovirus infectivity. In contrast, reovirus infectivity was not altered in cells expressing mutant Rab GTPases that affect recycling endosomes. Thus, reovirus virions localize to early, late, and recycling endosomes during entry into host cells, but only those that traverse early and late endosomes yield a productive infection.","Mainou, Bernardo A; Dermody, Terence S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00100-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22674975/,224

91242,"High-Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen in Patients Having Anesthesia for Advanced Esophagogastroduodenoscopy: HIFLOW-ENDO, a Randomized Clinical Trial.",2020-05-07,"INTRODUCTION To mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent overwhelming the healthcare system, social-distancing policies such as school closure, stay-at-home orders, and indoor dining closure have been utilized worldwide. These policies function by reducing the rate of close contact within populations and result in decreased human mobility. Adherence to social distancing can substantially reduce disease spread. Thus, quantifying human mobility and social-distancing compliance, especially at high temporal resolution, can provide great insight into the impact of social distancing policies. METHODS We used the movement of individuals around New York City (NYC), measured via traffic levels, as a proxy for human mobility and the impact of social-distancing policies (i.e., work from home policies, school closure, indoor dining closure etc.). By data mining Google traffic in real-time, and applying image processing, we derived high resolution time series of traffic in NYC. We used time series decomposition and generalized additive models to quantify changes in rush hour/non-rush hour, and weekday/weekend traffic, pre-pandemic and following the roll-out of multiple social distancing interventions. RESULTS Mobility decreased sharply on March 14, 2020 following declaration of the pandemic. However, levels began rebounding by approximately April 13, almost 2 months before stay-at-home orders were lifted, indicating premature increase in mobility, which we term social-distancing fatigue. We also observed large impacts on diurnal traffic congestion, such that the pre-pandemic bi-modal weekday congestion representing morning and evening rush hour was dramatically altered. By September, traffic congestion rebounded to approximately 75% of pre-pandemic levels. CONCLUSION Using crowd-sourced traffic congestion data, we described changes in mobility in Manhattan, NYC, during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data can be used to inform human mobility changes during the current pandemic, in planning for responses to future pandemics, and in understanding the potential impact of large-scale traffic interventions such as congestion pricing policies.","Shearston, Jenni A; Martinez, Micaela E; Nunez, Yanelli; Hilpert, Markus",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34153749/,224

DESIGN Prospective, observational study. SETTING Obstetric critical care unit in a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS Twenty severe preeclamptic parturients presenting with neurologic signs before any administration of MgSO4, and 20 control parturients. INTERVENTION Infusion of MgSO4 in severe preeclamptic patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We measured rcSO2 using near-infrared spectroscopy, blood flow velocities of the middle cerebral artery, and cardiac output at baseline, 5 minutes, 1 hour, and 6 hours after the MgSO4 bolus (4 g), followed by continuous MgSO4 infusion (1 g/h). These measurements were also obtained in 20 control parturients at baseline and 6 hours. Baseline rcSO2 was significantly lower in the severe preeclamptic group: 61% (56-69) vs 66% (63-71) (p = 0.037). At inclusion, blood pressures were significantly higher in the severe preeclamptic group compared with the control group, whereas cardiac output and transcranial Doppler readings were similar. Five minutes after the MgSO4 bolus infusion, a median increase of 8.6% (3.2-18.1) in rcSO2 was observed (p = 0.007), reaching values of the control group that were maintained up to 6 hours. Blood pressures and systolic velocities of the middle cerebral artery significantly decreased (p < 0.01) after the MgSO4 bolus, whereas cardiac output did not change. The percentage increase in rcSO2 was negatively correlated to the mean blood pressure (r = 0.60, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Cerebral oxygenation impairment can be detected by near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring in severe preeclamptic parturients. These results suggested the presence of disorders in cerebral microcirculation and/or changes in cerebral oxygenation. MgSO4 infusion in patients with severe preeclampsia restored rcSO2 to control levels with no systemic side effects. Further studies are needed to confirm the usefulness of near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring in patients with preeclampsia and to assess the action of other antihypertensive therapies on rcSO2.","Guerci, Philippe; Vial, Florence; Feugeas, Jérôme; Pop, Marius; Baka, Nour-Eddine; Bouaziz, Hervé; Losser, Marie-Reine",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000000519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25072763/,224

The latter is a specific nontoxic Ras inhibitor with a mild hydrophobic nature, which can also be used for local cancer treatment and stent applications. The fibers were composed of a dense polyglyconate core and a porous drug-loaded poly(D,L-lactic-glycolic acid) shell, prepared using freeze drying of inverted emulsions. Our study focused on the release profile of the antiproliferative drugs from the fibers, the shell morphology and its degradation and erosion. The postfabrication antiproliferative effect of the drugs was tested in a cell culture. The process parameters were found to affect the drug-release profile via two routes: (1) direct, through water uptake and swelling of the structure leading to FTS release, or through degradation of the host polymer leading to paclitaxel release at a later stage; (2) indirect effect of the microstructure on the release profile. The fabrication process did not reduce the pharmacological activity of either paclitaxel or FTS. FTS-eluting composite fibers proved to effectively induce growth inhibition or cell death by a gradient effect and dose-dependent manner. The combined effect of the targeted mechanism of FTS as a Ras inhibitor together with the localized and controlled release characteristics of the fiber is an advantageous antiproliferative quality. It is therefore suggested that our drug-eluting fibers may be used in biomedical applications that require short release (restenosis) or prolonged release (cancer therapy).","Kraitzer, Amir; Kloog, Yoel; Haklai, Roni; Zilberman, Meital",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.22238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20623695/,224

Outcomes included dietary behaviour (purchasing, intakes and diet quality) and diet-related health outcomes (weight-related outcomes, non-communicable diseases and holistic health or definitions of health as defined by Indigenous populations involved in the study). RECENT FINDINGS Of fifty included articles (1996-2019), the largest proportions described Indigenous communities in Canada (20 studies, 40%), the USA (16, 32%) and Australia (9, 18%). Among articles that specified the Indigenous population of focus (42 studies, 84%), the largest proportion (11 studies, 26%) took place in Inuit communities, followed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities (8 studies, 19%). The included literature encompassed four main study designs: type A, dietary intakes of store foods (14 studies, 28%), and type B, store food environments (16, 32%), comprised the greatest proportion of articles; the remainder were type C, store food environments and diet (7, 14%), and type D, store food environment interventions (13, 26%). Of the studies that assessed diet or health outcomes (36, 72%), 22 (61%) assessed dietary intakes; 16 (44%) sales/purchasing; and 8 (22%) weight-related outcomes. Store foods tended to contribute the greatest amount of dietary energy to the diets of Indigenous peoples and increased non-communicable disease risk as compared to traditional foods. Multi-pronged interventions appeared to have positive impacts on dietary behaviours, food purchasing and nutrition knowledge; promotion and nutrition education alone had more mixed effects. Of the nine studies which were found to have strong engagement with Indigenous populations, eight had moderate or high methodological quality. Eighteen studies (36%) did not mention any engagement with Indigenous populations. The literature confirmed the importance of store foods to the total energy intake of the contemporary diets of Indigenous people, the gaps in accessing both retail food environments and traditional foods and the potential for both new dietary assessment research and retail food environment intervention strategies to better align with and privilege Indigenous Ways of Knowing.","Luongo, Gabriella; Skinner, Kelly; Phillipps, Breanna; Yu, Ziwa; Martin, Debbie; Mah, Catherine L",Current obesity reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-020-00399-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32780322/,224

The growing occurrence of drug-resistant strains of Leishmania and severe side effects of available treatments represent an important challenge for the leishmaniases treatment. We have previously reported the leishmanicidal activity of phylloseptin-1 (PSN-1), a peptide found in the skin secretion of Phyllomedusa azurea (=Pithecopus azureus), against Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes. However, its impact on the amastigote form of L. amazonensis and its impact on infected macrophages are unknown. In this work, we evaluated the effects of PSN-1 on amastigotes of L. amazonensis inside macrophages infected in vitro. We assessed the production of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, as well as the levels of inflammatory and immunomodulatory markers (TGF-β, TNF-α and IL-12), in infected and non-infected macrophages treated with PSN-1. Treatment with PSN-1 decreased the number of infected cells and the number of ingested amastigotes per cell when compared with the untreated cells. At 32 µM (64 µg/mL), PSN-1 reduced hydrogen peroxide levels in both infected and uninfected macrophages, whereas it had little effect on NO production or TGF-β release. The effect of PSN-1 on IL-12 and TNF-α secretion depended on its concentration, but, in general, their levels tended to increase as PSN-1 concentration increased. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of action of PSN-1 and its interaction with the immune system aiming to develop pharmacological applications.","Kückelhaus, Selma A S; Aquino, Daniela Sant'Ana de; Borges, Tatiana K; Moreira, Daniel C; Leite, Luciana de Magalhães; Muniz-Junqueira, Maria Imaculada; Kückelhaus, Carlos S; Romero, Gustavo A Sierra; Prates, Maura V; Bloch, Carlos; Leite, José Roberto S A",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32640562/,224

99677,Influence of Noninvasive Ventilation Protocol on Intubation Rates in Subjects With De Novo Respiratory Failure.,2019-11-26,"PURPOSE For patients with comorbid cataract and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), guidance is lacking as to whether cataract extraction and traditional filtering surgery should be performed as a staged or combined procedure. Achieving this guidance requires an evidence-based understanding of the effects of phacoemulsification alone on intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with POAG. For this reason, a systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to synthesize evidence quantifying the effect of phacoemulsification on IOP and the required number of topical glaucoma medications in patients with cataract and POAG. MATERIALS AND METHODS Database searches were last run on August 15, 2016 to identify potentially relevant studies. Identified articles were screened for relevance and meta-analysis was used to compute postoperative mean and percentage reduction in IOP (IOPR%) as well as mean difference in topical glaucoma medications. RESULTS The search strategy identified 1613 records. Thirty-two studies (1826 subjects) were included in quantitative synthesis. A 12%, 14%, 15%, and 9% reduction in IOP from baseline occurred 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after phacoemulsification. A mean reduction of 0.57, 0.47, 0.38, and 0.16 medications per patient of glaucoma medication occurred 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after phacoemulsification. CONCLUSIONS Phacoemulsification as a solo procedure does lower IOP in patients with POAG, and reduces dependency on topical glaucoma medications. These effects appear to last at least 36 months with gradual loss of the initial effect noted after 2 years. Certain populations appear to experience much greater reductions in IOP than others and future work to identify these high responding patients is needed.","Armstrong, James J; Wasiuta, Tomas; Kiatos, Efstathia; Malvankar-Mehta, Monali; Hutnik, Cindy M L",Journal of glaucoma,https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000000643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28333892/,224

The aim of this study is to provide an atlas of matched anatomical cross-sections and contrast-enhanced CT images of the coelomic cavity in three highly diffused psittacine species. RESULTS Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic studies of the coelomic cavity were performed in 5 blue-and-gold macaws, 4 African grey parrots and 6 monk parakeets by means of a 4-multidetector-row CT scanner. Both pre- and post-contrast scans were acquired. Anatomical reference cross-sections were obtained from 5 blue-and-gold macaw, 7 African grey parrot, and 9 monk parakeet cadavers. The specimens were stored in a -20 °C freezer until completely frozen and then sliced at 5-mm intervals by means of a band saw. All the slices were photographed on both sides. Individual anatomical structures were identified by means of the available literature. Pre- and post-contrast attenuation reference values for the main coelomic organs are reported in Hounsfield units (HU).

METHODS The authors performed an ecologic analysis for April through July 2009 using data from 23 EDs in the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), an administrative database of widely distributed U.S. children's hospitals. All ED visits during the study period were included, and data from the 5 prior years were used for establishing expected values. Primary outcome measures included observed-to-expected ratios for ED visits for all reasons and for influenza-related illness (IRI). RESULTS Overall, 390,983 visits, and 88,885 visits for IRI, were included for Calendar Weeks 16 through 29, when 2009 H1N1 influenza was circulating. The subset of 106,330 visits and 31,703 IRI visits made to the 14 hospitals experiencing the authors' definition of ED surge during Weeks 16 to 29 was also studied. During surge weeks, the 14 EDs experienced 29% more total visits and 51% more IRI visits than expected (p < 0.01 for both comparisons). Of ED IRI visits during surge weeks, only 4.8% were admitted to non-intensive care beds (70% of expected, p < 0.01), 0.19% were admitted to intensive care units (44% of expected, p < 0.01), and 0.01% received mechanical ventilation (5.0% of expected, p < 0.01). Factors associated with more-than-expected visits included ages 2-17 years, payer type, and asthma. No factors were associated with more-than-expected hospitalizations from the ED. CONCLUSIONS During the spring 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, pediatric EDs nationwide experienced a marked increase in visits, with far fewer than expected requiring nonintensive or intensive care hospitalization. The data in this study can be used for future pandemic planning.","Sills, Marion R; Hall, Matthew; Simon, Harold K; Fieldston, Evan S; Walter, Nicholas; Levin, James E; Brogan, Thomas V; Hain, Paul D; Goodman, Denise M; Fritch-Levens, D D; Fagbuyi, Daniel B; Mundorff, Michael B; Libby, Anne M; Anderson, Heather O; Padula, William V; Shah, Samir S",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2010.00992.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21314775/,224

People with Parkinson's Disease (PWP) are no exception. Social isolation is a risk factor for worsened health outcomes and increased mortality. Symptoms such as depression and sleep dysfunction are adversely affected by loneliness. There is a paucity of research on social isolation in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is all the more critical now in the setting of social distancing due to COVID-19. The goal of this study was to survey individuals with PD to evaluate whether social isolation is associated with PD symptom severity and quality of life. Only individuals reporting a diagnosis of idiopathic PD were included in this analysis. The primary outcome measures were the Patient-Reported Outcomes in PD (PRO-PD) and questions from PROMIS Global related to social health. PRO-PD scores increased as social performance and social satisfaction scores diminished. Individuals who reported being lonely experienced a 55% greater symptom severity than those who were not lonely (P < 0.01). Individuals who documented having a lot of friends had 21% fewer symptoms than those with few or no friends (P < 0.01). Social isolation was associated with greater patient-reported PD severity and lower quality of life, although it is unclear whether this is the cause and/or a consequence of the disease. In essence, the Parkinson pandemic and the pandemic of social isolation have been further compounded by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The results emphasize the need to keep PWP socially connected and prevent loneliness in this time of social distancing.

RECENT FINDINGS Corticosteroids have been prescribed with the objective to attenuate the marked and persistent activation of the immune system. However, some causes of community-acquired pneumonia, namely viral, are associated with unexpected low levels of cytokines and depressed cellular immunity. As a result, several recent randomized controlled trials and large prospective observational studies repeatedly showed that corticosteroids had no impact on survival, and in some types of pneumonia like influenza, its use was associated with potential harmful effects like invasive aspergillosis. Apart from this, adverse effects, namely hyperglycemia, superinfections and increased length-of-stay, were frequent findings in the corticosteroid-treated patients. SUMMARY According to the current evidence, corticosteroids are recommended in Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-infected patients and recommendations are against its use in influenza. In all other forms of severe community-acquired pneumonia, with the exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the strength of the evidence does not support the safe and widespread use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy. Further studies are needed to identify subgroups of severe community-acquired pneumonia that can benefit or not from corticosteroids.","Póvoa, Pedro; Coelho, Luís; Salluh, Jorge",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394726/,224

METHODS Clinical characteristics of the patient was reviewed. Genomic DNA of the child was subjected to whole exome sequencing. RESULTS Genetic testing has confirmed the diagnosis of congenital IAD by identification of compound heterozygous variants of the TBX19 gene, which included a pathogenic nonsense c.535C>T (p.R179X) variant inherited from his father and a novel missense c.298C>T (p.R100C) variant inherited from his mother. CONCLUSION Congenital IAD due to variants of the TBX19 gene is a rare autosomal recessive disease. It is characterized by low plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels but normal levels of other pituitary hormones. Delayed diagnosis may lead to severe early-onset adrenal failure and wrong treatment which may result in neonatal mortality. Hydrocortisone replacement is effective. Detection of pathogenic variant of TBX19 gene is the key to diagnosis.","Wu, Shengnan; Chen, Qiong; Shen, Linghua; Wei, Haiyan; Chen, Yongxing",Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20191107-00563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423260/,224
108307,ACP provided 2 conditional recommendations on use of high-flow nasal oxygen in acute respiratory failure.,2021-09-07,"Introduction Excimer laser energy is often required to extract chronically indwelling pacemaker and defibrillator leads from the vasculature and myocardium. This technique can be associated with vascular and right ventricular (RV) injuries. We sought to develop a safer, more effective method by applying site-specific delivery of electrosurgical energy (EE). Methods Utilizing a polyacrylamide gel model to simulate soft tissue density, active and passive fixation defibrillator and pacemaker leads were implanted and manually extracted with and without EE delivered to the cathode. The amount of force required for complete removal was measured using a force transducer. The procedure was then repeated in an acute pig model to demonstrate proof of safety. Post mortem gross and histologic specimens were collected from the implantation site. Results In the gel model, the force required for extraction, using manual traction in the active (83.7 g) and passive (74.6 g) fixation ICD leads, was reduced by 37.8% and 33.5%, respectively with EE (both p < 0.01). The force required for extraction, using manual traction in the active (85.2 g) and passive (71.9 g) fixation pacemaker leads, was reduced by 64.4% and 42.6%, respectively with EE (both p < 0.01). In an acute implantation pig model using an active fixation lead, delivery of EE to the cathode (n = 6) reduced the force required to manually extract the lead (140 g +/- 32.5 versus 82 g +/- 14.7, p = 0.03). Post mortem analysis of the RV displayed formation of an epicardial hemorrhagic lesion that was also present after manual traction and EE. There was absence of pericardial effusion, perforation, and ventricular arrhythmia. Conclusions Site-specific delivery of EE to areas of exposed metal along the lead decreased the force necessary for lead extraction in an in vitro and in vivo model. Further studies are needed to evaluate its application in clinical care.","Catanzaro, John N; Zviman, Menekham; Kolandaivelu, Aravindan; Nazarian, Saman; Halperin, Henry; Berger, Ronald D; Brinker, Jeffrey A; Cheng, Alan",International journal of cardiology.

111620,Prevalence of Passive Suicidal Ideation in the Early Stage of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic and Lockdown in a Large Spanish Sample.,2020-10-06,"BACKGROUND Paediatric burns are highly painful and traumatising injuries that are overrepresented among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Paediatric burn patients' pain remains poorly managed by pharmacological interventions, leading to increased anxiety, distress, and trauma in patients and their caregivers. Non-pharmacological psychosocial interventions have been suggested as effective in reducing pain and psychological morbidities among paediatric burn patients and their caregivers; however, their degree of effectiveness and appropriateness for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is unclear. METHODS A non-date restricted systematic review was conducted through four databases. Studies published in English assessing psychosocial interventions on paediatric burn patients' physical pain along with theirs and/or their caregiver's anxiety, distress, or trauma symptoms were identified and included in this review. Included studies were assessed for their ability to reduce one of the outcomes of interests and for their reflection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' perspectives of health. RESULTS Of the 3178 identified references, 17 were eligible. These include distraction based techniques (n = 8), hypnosis/familiar imagery (n = 2), therapeutic approaches (n = 4), and patient preparation/procedural control (n = 3). Distraction techniques incorporating procedural preparation reduced pain, while discharge preparation and increased 'patient control' reduced patient and caregiver anxiety; and internet based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy reduced short-term but not long-term post-traumatic stress symptoms. No interventions reflected Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' perspectives of health; and few targeted caregivers or focused on reducing their symptoms. CONCLUSIONS The development and assessment of psychosocial interventions to appropriately meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander paediatric burn patients is required.","Williams, H M; Hunter, K; Clapham, K; Ryder, C; Kimble, R; Griffin, B",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-8366-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32131784/,224

Whereas some regions still record tens of thousands of new infections daily, other regions have contained the virus. What explains these striking regional differences? We advance a cultural psychological perspective on mask usage, a precautionary measure vital for curbing the pandemic. Four large-scale studies provide evidence that collectivism (versus individualism) positively predicts mask usage-both within the United States and across the world. Analyzing a dataset of all 3,141 counties of the 50 US states (based on 248,941 individuals), Study 1a revealed that mask usage was higher in more collectivistic US states. Study 1b replicated this finding in another dataset of 16,737 individuals in the 50 US states. Analyzing a dataset of 367,109 individuals in 29 countries, Study 2 revealed that mask usage was higher in more collectivistic countries. Study 3 replicated this finding in a dataset of 277,219 Facebook users in 67 countries. The link between collectivism and mask usage was robust to a host of control variables, including cultural tightness-looseness, political affiliation, demographics, population density, socioeconomic indicators, universal health coverage, government response stringency, and time. Our research suggests that culture fundamentally shapes how people respond to crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding cultural differences not only provides insight into the current pandemic, but also helps the world prepare for future crises.","Lu, Jackson G; Jin, Peter; English, Alexander S",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2021793118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016707/,224

We describe the planning process undertaken by public health officials in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, along with community and academic partners, to explore the issues surrounding altered standards of care in the event of pandemic influenza. Throughout 2006, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Harvard School of Public Health Center for Public Health Preparedness jointly convened a working group comprising ethicists, lawyers, clinicians, and local and state public health officials to consider issues such as allocation of antiviral medications, prioritization of critical care, and state seizure of private assets. Community stakeholders were also engaged in the process through facilitated discussion of case scenarios focused on these and other issues. The objective of this initiative was to establish a framework and some fundamental principles that would subsequently guide the process of establishing specific altered standards of care protocols. The group collectively identified 4 goals and 7 principles to guide the equitable allocation of limited resources and establishment of altered standards of care protocols. Reviewing and analyzing this process to date may serve as a resource for other states.","Levin, Donna; Cadigan, Rebecca Orfaly; Biddinger, Paul D; Condon, Suzanne; Koh, Howard K",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1097/dmp.0b013e3181ac3dd2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19755912/,224

METHODS 375 participants were recruited for this study, of which 125 were medical students (preclinical studies, 59; clinical studies, 66), 125 were health personnel (COVID-19 frontline personnel, 59; personnel not related with COVID-19, 66), and 125 belonged to the general population. The PHQ-9, GAD-7, and CPDI scales were used to assess the emotional impact. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to measure differences between groups, considering potential confounding factors. RESULTS Regarding CPDI values, all other groups showed reduced values compared to COVID-19 frontline personnel. However, the general population, preclinical and clinical medical students showed increased PHQ-9 values compared to COVID-19 frontline personnel. Finally, confounding factors, gender and age correlated negatively with higher CPDI and PHQ-9 scores. CONCLUSIONS Being frontline personnel is associated with increased COVID-19-related stress. Depression is associated, however, with other groups not directly involved with the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Female gender and younger age correlated with COVID-19-related depression and stress.","Pedraz-Petrozzi, Bruno; Krüger-Malpartida, Hever; Arevalo-Flores, Martin; Salmavides-Cuba, Frine; Anculle-Arauco, Victor; Dancuart-Mendoza, Mauricio",Revista colombiana de psiquiatria,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.04.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34176620/,224

BACKGROUND Angio-Seal is the most commonly used vascular closure device following percutaneous coronary and peripheral catheterizations worldwide. A rare complication of Angio-Seal deployment is an occlusion of the femoral artery leading to limb ischemia requiring revascularization. Given its unique ability to cut both atherosclerotic plaque and the Angio-Seal anchor with a collagen plug at operator-directed planes, TurboHawk/HawkOne atherectomy device can be a fast and effective approach to treat Angio-Seal-associated femoral artery occlusions. METHODS We studied 13 consecutive patients who developed Angio-Seal-associated femoral artery occlusions that occurred from 3 hours to several weeks after catheterization. These patients were successfully treated with TurboHawk/HawkOne directional atherectomy followed by balloon angioplasty with no complications. During a mean follow-up period of 20.4 ± 17.3 months, 12 patients remained claudication free with no evidence of obstructive arterial disease of the treated segment on imaging studies. One patient developed restenosis that was treated with repeat atherectomy and balloon angioplasty following which he was asymptomatic at follow-up. CONCLUSION The use of directional atherectomy followed by balloon angioplasty is a quick, safe, and effective endovascular approach to treating Angio-Seal-associated femoral artery occlusions. It is associated with an excellent success rate, no complications, and good midterm outcomes.","Babaev, Anvar; Gokhale, Rohit; Zavlunova, Susanna; Attubato, Michael",Vascular and endovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1538574416679520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27852881/,224
118188,Is immunosuppression status a risk factor for noninvasive ventilation failure in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure? A post hoc matched analysis.,2019,"The implantation of biomedical devices, including collagen-based implants, evokes an inflammatory response. Despite inflammation playing an important role in the early stages of wound healing, excessive and non-resolving inflammation may lead to the poor performance of biomaterial implants in some patients. Therefore, steps should be taken to control the level and duration of an inflammatory response. In this study, oxygen and nitrogen gas plasmas were employed to modify the surface of collagen film, with a view to modifying the surface properties of a substrate in order to induce changes to the inflammatory response, whilst maintaining the mechanical integrity of the underlying collagen film. The effects of cold plasma treatment and resultant changes to surface properties on the non-specific inflammatory response of the immune system was investigated in vitro in direct contact cell culture by the measurement of protein expression and cytokine production after one and four days of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) culture. The results indicated that compared to oxygen plasma, nitrogen plasma treatment produced an anti-inflammatory effect on the collagen film by reducing the initial activation of monocytes and macrophages, which led to a lower production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNFα, and higher production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. This was attributed to the combination of the amino chemical group and the significant reduction in roughness associated with the introduction of the nitrogen plasma treatment, which had an effect on the levels of activation of the adherent cell population.","Chen, Rui; Curran, Jude; Pu, Fanrong; Zhuola, Zhuola; Bayon, Yves; Hunt, John A",Polymers,https://doi.org/10.3390/polym9070254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30970932/,224

DESIGN Multicenter, noninferiority, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING University hospitals. PATIENT(S) A total of 100 subjects with symptomatic uterine myomas were randomly assigned to either LESS-M or conventional LM. Surgical outcomes were comparatively assessed between the groups on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle. INTERVENTION(S) Laparoscopic myomectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) The time required for uterine defect suturing. RESULT(S) There were no differences in baseline demographics (age, body mass index, surgical indication, number of myomas, and size and location of the largest myoma) between the two groups. The suturing time (mean ± SD) was 21.9 ± 10.7 minutes (95% confidence interval 18.8-24.9 min) for the LESS-M group and 23.3 ± 12.4 minutes (95% confidence interval 19.8-26.9 min) for the conventional LM group, with no significant difference between the two groups. The other surgical outcomes, such as total operative time, operative blood loss, postoperative hemoglobin change, degree of surgical difficulty, postoperative pain scores, operative complication, and length of hospital stay, were similar between the two groups. Three subjects (6%) assigned to the LESS-M group underwent conventional LM because of difficulty in myoma enucleation and suturing, whereas no failure to intended procedure occurred in the conventional LM group (6% vs. 0).

122091,Characteristics and Quality of US Nursing Homes Reporting Cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).,2020-07-01,"Enterobacterales represent the largest group of bacterial pathogens in humans and are responsible for severe, deep-seated infections, often resulting in sepsis or death. They are also a prominent cause of multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections, and some species are recognized as biothreat pathogens. Tools for noninvasive, whole-body analysis that can localize a pathogen with specificity are needed, but no such technology currently exists. We previously demonstrated that positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-sorbitol (18F-FDS) can selectively detect Enterobacterales infections in murine models. Here, we demonstrate that uptake of 18F-FDS by bacteria occurs via a metabolically conserved sorbitol-specific pathway with rapid in vitro 18F-FDS uptake noted in clinical strains, including MDR isolates. Whole-body 18F-FDS PET/computerized tomography (CT) in 26 prospectively enrolled patients with either microbiologically confirmed Enterobacterales infection or other pathologies demonstrated that 18F-FDS PET/CT was safe, could rapidly detect and localize Enterobacterales infections due to drug-susceptible or MDR strains, and differentiated them from sterile inflammation or cancerous lesions. Repeat imaging in the same patients monitored antibiotic efficacy with decreases in PET signal correlating with clinical improvement. To facilitate the use of 18F-FDS, we developed a self-contained, solid-phase cartridge to rapidly (<10 min) formulate ready-to-use 18F-FDS from commercially available 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose (18F-FDG) at room temperature. In a hamster model, 18F-FDS PET/CT also differentiated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia from secondary Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia-a leading cause of complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. These data support 18F-FDS as an innovative and readily available, pathogen-specific PET technology with clinical applications.","Ordonez, Alvaro A; Wintaco, Luz M; Mota, Filipa; Restrepo, Andres F; Ruiz-Bedoya, Camilo A; Reyes, Carlos F; Uribe, Luis G; Abhishek, Sudhanshu; D'Alessio, Franco R; Holt, Daniel P; Dannals, Robert F; Rowe, Steven P; Castillo, Victor R; Pomper, Martin G; Granados, Ulises; Jain, Sanjay K",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abe9805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853931/,224

MATERIALS AND METHODS А prospective randomized study included 134 patients who were treated in the epidemic season of influenza and ARVI in 20182019. All patients were examined for the presence of influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses in nasopharyngeal swabs by PCR. Patients of the main group received enisamium iodide along with symptomatic therapy, the control group received only symptomatic therapy. The primary parameter of the effectiveness of therapy was evaluated on the scale of the general severity of the manifestations of ARVI (Total Symptom Score TSS) from the 2nd to the 4th day and by the secondary criteria of effectiveness: assessment of the duration of ARVI, the severity of fever, the proportion of patients with normal body temperature, the duration of the main clinical symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections, the proportion of patients in whom complications requiring antibiotics were noted, the dynamics of interferon status on the 6th day. To conduct a statistical analysis, depending on the efficiency parameter, the ANCOVA method with a fixed group factor and an initial score on the TSS severity scale was used as covariates, a criterion for comparing quantitative indicators in two independent groups. RESULTS According to the results of the analysis of the primary efficacy parameter, the median (interquartile range) of the average score on the scale of the general severity of ARVI manifestations in the main group was 4.33 (3.675.83), in the comparison group 6.00 (4.677.25; p0.001). The duration of systemic and local manifestations of acute respiratory viral infections was statistically significantly less in the main group (p=0.002 and p=0.019, respectively). Prescription of additional therapy was required in 2 (2.9%) patients of the main group (patients taking enisamium iodide), compared with 8 (11.9%) patients in the control group. Serum levels of interferon  and interferon  on the last day of treatment were statistically significantly higher in patients of the main group compared with the control group (p0.001). Treatment (excellent) was evaluated by 42 (62.7%) patients, while in the control group only 17 (25.8%) patients gave similar ratings. Both patients (p0.001) and doctors (p0.002) rated therapy tolerance better in the study group. CONCLUSION The results confirmed the safety and effectiveness of enisamium iodide as a treatment for ARVI and influenza. The antiviral, interferonogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of the drug are involved in the formation of an antiviral response and reduce the risk of complications, which makes it possible to reduce the number of symptomatic agents used.","Lioznov, D A; Karnaukhova, E J; Zubkova, T G; Shakhlanskaya, E V",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,https://doi.org/10.26442/00403660.2020.03.000572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32598793/,224

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome assessing efficacy was a composite of circumferential radial margin greater than 1 mm, distal margin without tumor, and completeness of total mesorectal excision. A 6% noninferiority margin was chosen according to clinical relevance estimation. RESULTS Two hundred forty patients with laparoscopic resection and 222 with open resection were evaluable for analysis of the 486 enrolled. Successful resection occurred in 81.7% of laparoscopic resection cases (95% CI, 76.8%-86.6%) and 86.9% of open resection cases (95% CI, 82.5%-91.4%) and did not support noninferiority (difference, -5.3%; 1-sided 95% CI, -10.8% to ∞; P for noninferiority = .41). Patients underwent low anterior resection (76.7%) or abdominoperineal resection (23.3%). Conversion to open resection occurred in 11.3% of patients. Operative time was significantly longer for laparoscopic resection (mean, 266.2 vs 220.6 minutes; mean difference, 45.5 minutes; 95% CI, 27.7-63.4; P < .001). Length of stay (7.3 vs 7.0 days; mean difference, 0.3 days; 95% CI, -0.6 to 1.1), readmission within 30 days (3.3% vs 4.1%; difference, -0.7%; 95% CI, -4.2% to 2.7%), and severe complications (22.5% vs 22.1%; difference, 0.4%; 95% CI, -4.2% to 2.7%) did not differ significantly. Quality of the total mesorectal excision specimen in 462 operated and analyzed surgeries was complete (77%) and nearly complete (16.5%) in 93.5% of the cases. Negative circumferential radial margin was observed in 90% of the overall group (87.9% laparoscopic resection and 92.3% open resection; P = .11). Distal margin result was negative in more than 98% of patients irrespective of type of surgery (P = .91). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with stage II or III rectal cancer, the use of laparoscopic resection compared with open resection failed to meet the criterion for noninferiority for pathologic outcomes. Pending clinical oncologic outcomes, the findings do not support the use of laparoscopic resection in these patients.

Using the same peptide motif however does not guarantee more effective interactions with the host. Motif-mediated interactions require a flexible or disordered environment, with structural and dynamic features that should differ between the competing host and viral proteins. Using the eukaryotic linear motif (ELM) database we analyzed the protein regions which contained the eukaryotic and viral motifs, including human and human virus ELMs with common target sites. We found that although the eukaryotic motifs are associated with a lack of structure, they are more stable than their flanking regions and can serve as molecular recognition elements. In contrast, eukaryotic viral motifs are often located in more ordered regions, but have increased local flexibility or disorder compared to their embedding environment. Most viral ELMs are devoid of stable binding elements and remain fuzzy after binding. Fuzziness reduces the entropic cost of binding and imparts versatile interaction modes to increase binding promiscuity and to compete with multiple host peptides. Fuzzy interactions confer further functional benefits such as the combinatorial usage of motifs, and a fine-tuning affinity via post-translational modifications.","Duro, Norbert; Miskei, Marton; Fuxreiter, Monika",Molecular bioSystems,https://doi.org/10.1039/c5mb00301f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26289637/,224

The potential of D2B IgG, and F(ab')2 and Fab fragments of this antibody for targeting prostate cancer was determined in mice bearing subcutaneous prostate cancer xenografts. The optimal time point for imaging was determined in biodistribution and microSPECT imaging studies with (111)In-D2B IgG, (111)In-capromab pendetide, (111)In-D2B F(ab')2 and (111)In-D2B Fab fragments in mice with PSMA-expressing LNCaP and PSMA-negative PC3 tumors at several time points after injection. All (111)In-labeled antibody formats specifically accumulated in the LNCaP tumors, with highest uptake of (111)In-D2B IgG and (111)In-capromab pendetide at 168 h p.i. (94.8 ± 19.2% injected dose per gram (ID/g) and 16.7 ± 2.2% ID/g, respectively), whereas uptake of (111)In-D2B F(ab')2 and (111)In-D2B Fab fragments peaked at 24 h p.i.

The current study evaluated the technical outcomes of the long-segment supercharged jejunal (SPJ) interposition. METHODS A database was developed to capture patient characteristics, operative technique, and outcomes for patients with an SPJ interposition at 2 institutions from 2000 to 2010. A multivariable analysis was performed to determine predictors of leak and graft loss. A selective prospective manometric analysis was performed to describe peristalsis of the SPJ. RESULTS Of the 60 patients undergoing SPJ reconstruction, 44 (73%) were men, and the median age was 57 years (range, 28 to 76 years). The operation in 23 patients (38%) was performed to reverse esophageal discontinuity, and 57 (95%) patients underwent reconstruction for cancer. Early complications included 18 instances (30%) of pneumonia, 19 anastomotic leaks (32%), and 5 instances of graft loss with diversion (8%). Three patients (5%) died in the hospital or within 30 days. After jejunal reconstruction, 50 patients (83%) were able to return to a regular diet. The 90-day mortality rate was 10% (n=6). Characteristic postoperative manometric findings included segmental peristalsis, as is typical for in situ jejunum. Median survival was 28 months and the 5-year survival rate was 30%. CONCLUSIONS An SPJ conduit can reestablish or maintain gastrointestinal continuity in high-risk patients when the stomach is unavailable. This is our preferred conduit for reconstruction of the esophagus over the colon.","Blackmon, Shanda H; Correa, Arlene M; Skoracki, Roman; Chevray, Pierre M; Kim, Min P; Mehran, Reza J; Rice, David C; Roth, Jack A; Swisher, Stephen G; Vaporciyan, Ara A; Yu, Peirong; Walsh, Garrett L; Hofstetter, Wayne L",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2012.05.123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22939245/,224

DESIGN Experimental study. ANIMALS Purpose-bred male hound-mix research dogs (n = 8). METHODS Dogs were randomized to groups of left-sided or right-sided VATS approaches. One lung ventilation was used and TBLN dissection was achieved using a vessel-sealing device. RESULTS TBLNs ipsilateral to the approach were successfully identified and removed thoracoscopically in 7 dogs. A 3-port technique was used in 6 dogs and 4 ports were used in 2 dogs. Observed complications included mild-moderate hemorrhage from the perinodal tissue controlled thoracoscopically (n = 2), inability to locate any TBLN (1), and difficulty achieving or maintaining one-lung ventilation (4). No other major complications occurred and all dogs recovered uneventfully. Median percentage surface area of the bisected lymph nodes affected by crush artifact was 20% (range, 0-40%). Areas of crush artifact were present in central (7/11) and peripheral (9/11) locations. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Thoracoscopic TBLN extirpation is a feasible technique in dogs with normal TBLN and may be useful for obtaining more detailed staging on microscopic disease status in oncologic patients with normal-sized TBLNs. Further study is warranted to determine the feasibility and limitations of this technique in clinical patients with overt lymphadenopathy.","Steffey, Michele A; Daniel, Leticia; Mayhew, Philipp D; Affolter, Verena K; Soares, Joao H N; Smith, Andrea",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950x.2014.12204.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24889791/,224

AREAS COVERED We used the generic names of 8 antiviral drugs as keywords to search and analyze the COVID-19-related clinical trials registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov. Then we used the keywords to obtain and summarize their clinical research results related to COVID-19 in CNKI, WANFANG, CQVIP and PubMed database. EXPERT OPINION The registration system of clinical trials and the level of clinical trial design need to be further improved. At present, no specific drug has been found for the treatment of COVID-19, the efficacy of antiviral drugs mostly comes from small sample studies or retrospective studies, and the level of clinical evidence is low. Besides, multi-drug combination therapy may become a more effective treatment choice, but the drug interactions and adverse drug reactions also need to be closely monitored. In summary, the safety and efficacy of various antiviral drugs need to be confirmed by large samples and high-quality RCT studies.","Pang, Wenyuan; Wang, Qiaoyu; Zhao, Zhigang",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17512433.2020.1803740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32729363/,224
135032,Effects of pleural drainage on oxygenation in critically ill patients.,2020,"Many studies into surface contamination of hospital environments have demonstrated that occupational exposure to cytotoxics through the dermal route remains a possible risk. In this study, we assess the actual dermal exposure of the hands of pharmacy technicians and cleaning personnel in a panel of hospitals performing tasks that pose a risk of exposure. We compare the dermal exposure to a tentative limit value for cyclophosphamide. Pharmacy technicians and cleaning personnel were asked for hand rinsing after performance of nine tasks previously identified as posing a risk of occupational exposure. All samples were analyzed for the presence and quantity of eight antineoplastic drugs. By using data on both the frequency of the performance of the tasks and the measured dermal contamination during these tasks, weekly exposure to the marker drug (cyclophosphamide) was calculated. In five Dutch hospitals, 70 hand rinse samples and 8 blanks were collected. These were analyzed and results were used to calculate weekly exposure. The tentative limit value used was 0.74 µg of cyclophosphamide. For cleaning personnel, all results remained below this threshold value. For pharmacy technicians, the compounding itself also remained well below the limit; however, the task involving preparatory work, as well as the checking of compounded drugs, had a 13% chance of exceeding the limit. All of the highest values were found when employees were not wearing gloves on these tasks. Cleaning personnel and pharmacy technicians compounding cytotoxic drugs in our study were sufficiently protected from occupational exposure. In contrast, pharmacy technicians who perform preparatory and finishing tasks (before and after the actual compounding) are not protected enough when they do not wear gloves.","Crul, Mirjam; Hilhorst, Simone; Breukels, Oscar; Bouman-d'Onofrio, Johanna R C; Stubbs, Percival; van Rooij, Joost G",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2020.1776299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633703/,224

However, how MAT changes the 3D morphology of the AT during repeated loading remains unclear. This study compared the AT longitudinal, transverse and volume strains during repeated loading of the tendinopathic AT with those of the contralateral tendon in people with unilateral MAT. Ten adults with unilateral MAT performed 10 successive 25 s submaximal (50%) voluntary isometric plantarflexion contractions with both legs. Freehand 3D ultrasound scans were recorded and used to measure whole AT, free AT and proximal AT longitudinal strains and free AT cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume strains. The free AT experienced higher longitudinal and CSA strain and reached steady state following a greater number of contractions (five contractions) in the tendinopathic AT compared with the contralateral tendon (three contractions). Further, free tendon CSA and volume strain were greater in the tendinopathic AT than in the contralateral tendon from the first contraction, whereas free AT longitudinal strain was not greater than that of the contralateral tendon until the fourth contraction. Volume loss from the tendon core therefore preceded the greater longitudinal strain in the tendinopathic AT. Overall, these findings suggest that the tendinopathic free AT experiences an exaggerated longitudinal and transverse strain response under repeated loading that is underpinned by an altered interaction between solid and fluid tendon matrix components. These alterations are indicative of accentuated poroelasticity and an altered local stress-strain environment within the tendinopathic free tendon matrix, which could affect tendon remodelling via mechanobiological pathways.","Nuri, Leila; Obst, Steven J; Newsham-West, Richard; Barrett, Rod S",The Journal of experimental biology,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.159764; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28620014/,224

138056,Effect of Face Mask Design and Flow-by on Rebreathing During Noninvasive Ventilation.,2019,"BACKGROUND Systematic review guidance recommends the use of programme theory to inform considerations of if and how healthcare interventions may work differently across socio-economic status (SES) groups. This study aimed to address the lack of detail on how reviewers operationalise this in practice. METHODS A methodological systematic review was undertaken to assess if, how and the extent to which systematic reviewers operationalise the guidance on the use of programme theory in considerations of socio-economic inequalities in health. Multiple databases were searched from January 2013 to May 2016. Studies were included if they were systematic reviews assessing the effectiveness of an intervention and included data on SES. Two reviewers independently screened all studies, undertook quality assessment and extracted data. A narrative approach to synthesis was adopted. RESULTS A total of 37 systematic reviews were included, 10 of which were explicit in the use of terminology for 'programme theory'. Twenty-nine studies used programme theory to inform both their a priori assumptions and explain their review findings. Of these, 22 incorporated considerations of both what and how interventions do/do not work in SES groups to both predict and explain their review findings. Thirteen studies acknowledged 24 unique theoretical references to support their assumptions of what or how interventions may have different effects in SES groups. Most reviewers used supplementary evidence to support their considerations of differential effectiveness. The majority of authors outlined a programme theory in the ""Introduction"" and ""Discussion"" sections of the review to inform their assumptions or provide explanations of what or how interventions may result in differential effects within or across SES groups. About a third of reviews used programme theory to inform the review analysis and/or synthesis. Few authors used programme theory to inform their inclusion criteria, data extraction or quality assessment. Twenty-one studies tested their a priori programme theory. CONCLUSIONS The use of programme theory to inform considerations of if, what and how interventions lead to differential effects on health in different SES groups in the systematic review process is not yet widely adopted, is used implicitly, is often fragmented and is not implemented in a systematic way.","Maden, Michelle; Cunliffe, Alex; McMahon, Naoimh; Booth, Andrew; Carey, Gina Michelle; Paisley, Suzy; Dickson, Rumona; Gabbay, Mark",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-017-0638-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29284538/,224
139277,Trends in US Heart Transplant Waitlist Activity and Volume During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic.,2020-09-01,"INTRODUCTION Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assess patients' perspectives on their health status, providing opportunities to improve the quality of care. While PROMs are increasingly used in high-income settings, limited data are available on PROMs use for diabetes and hypertension in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). This scoping review aimed to determine how PROMs are employed for diabetes and hypertension care in LMICs. METHODS We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov for English-language studies published between August 2009 and August 2019 that measured at least one PROM related to diabetes or hypertension in LMICs. Full texts of included studies were examined to assess study characteristics, target population, outcome focus, PROMs used, and methods for data collection and reporting. RESULTS Sixty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria and reported on PROMs for people diagnosed with hypertension and/or diabetes and receiving care in health facilities. Thirty-nine (57%) reported on upper-middle-income countries, 19 (28%) reported on lower-middle-income countries, 4 (6%) reported on low-income countries, and 6 (9%) were multi-country. Most focused on diabetes (60/68, 88%), while 4 studies focused on hypertension and 4 focused on diabetes/hypertension comorbidity. Outcomes of interest varied; most common were glycemic or blood pressure control (38), health literacy and treatment adherence (27), and acute complications (22). Collectively the studies deployed 55 unique tools to measure patient outcomes. Most common were the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (7) and EuroQoL-5D-3L (7). CONCLUSION PROMs are deployed in LMICs around the world, with greatest reported use in LMICs with an upper-middle-income classification. Diabetes PROMs were more widely deployed in LMICs than hypertension PROMs, suggesting an opportunity to adapt PROMs for hypertension. Future research focusing on standardization and simplification could improve future comparability and adaptability across LMIC contexts. Incorporation into national health information systems would best establish PROMs as a means to reveal the effectiveness of person-centered diabetes and hypertension care.","Masyuko, Sarah; Ngongo, Carrie J; Smith, Carole; Nugent, Rachel",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33449968/,224

142642,Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Patients With COVID-19 in Severe Respiratory Failure.,2020-08-11,"Antigenically evolving pathogens such as influenza viruses are difficult to control owing to their ability to evade host immunity by producing immune escape variants. Experimental studies have repeatedly demonstrated that viral immune escape variants emerge more often from immunized hosts than from naive hosts. This empirical relationship between host immune status and within-host immune escape is not fully understood theoretically, nor has its impact on antigenic evolution at the population level been evaluated. Here, we show that this relationship can be understood as a trade-off between the probability that a new antigenic variant is produced and the level of viraemia it reaches within a host. Scaling up this intra-host level trade-off to a simple population level model, we obtain a distribution for variant persistence times that is consistent with influenza A/H3N2 antigenic variant data. At the within-host level, our results show that target cell limitation, or a functional equivalent, provides a parsimonious explanation for how host immune status drives the generation of immune escape mutants. At the population level, our analysis also offers an alternative explanation for the observed tempo of antigenic evolution, namely that the production rate of immune escape variants is driven by the accumulation of herd immunity. Overall, our results suggest that disease control strategies should be further assessed by considering the impact that increased immunity--through vaccination--has on the production of new antigenic variants.","Luo, Shishi; Reed, Michael; Mattingly, Jonathan C; Koelle, Katia","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2012.0180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22572027/,224

One hundred ninety-two 7-day-old chickens were randomly distributed into four groups having four replicates with 12 birds in each replicate. Basal diets were prepared for starter (days 8 to 21) and finisher (days 22 to 42). Basal diets were offered to the control group only, whereas other treatments received basal diets fortified with 0.5, 1, and 2% blueberry extract (BB0.5, BB1, and BB2 groups, respectively). The duration of experiment was 35 days (days 8 to 42). During finisher and overall growth phases, broilers in the BB2 group had greater body weight gain than those in the BB0.5 and control groups, whereas the BB1 group had higher body weight gain than the control group (P < 0.001). Body weight gain remained unaffected during the starter phase. Feed intake was greater in the BB2 group than in the control group at days 8 to 21, 22 to 42, and 8 to 42 (P = 0.002, P = 0.035, and P = 0.001, respectively). The control group had poor FCR than the BB2 group in the starter phase (P = 0.034). At days 22 to 42, feeding blueberry extract (BB0.5, BB1, and BB2) improved the FCR of broilers compared with the control group, whereas the BB2 group had better FCR than the BB0.5 group (P < 0.001). At 8 to 42 days, broilers in the control group had poor FCR compared with the BB1 and BB2 groups, whereas the BB0.5 group had poor FCR than the BB2 group (P < 0.001). Slaughter weight was lower in the control group than in the blueberry extract groups, whereas the BB2 group had greater slaughter weight than the BB0.5 group (P < 0.001). Dressing percentage of broilers in the control and BB0.5 groups was lower than that in other groups (P < 0.001). Gizzard yield was higher in the BB0.5 and BB2 groups than in the control group (P = 0.021). In addition, feeding 2% blueberry extract increased the concentration of different fatty acids in breast and thigh meat of broiler chickens.

Objective To carry out a narrative review of the information available on infection by SARS-CoV-2 in immunosuppressed patients, especially patients with cancer, transplanted, neurological diseases, primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. Results Patients with cancer and recent cancer treatment (chemotherapy or surgery) and SARS-CoV-2 infection have a higher risk of worse outcomes. In transplant patients (renal, cardiac and hepatic), with neurological pathologies (multiple sclerosis [MS], neuromyelitis optica [NMODS], myasthenia gravis [MG]), primary immunodeficiencies and infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in association with immunosuppressants, studies have shown no tendency for worse outcomes.

The infectious disease caused by the virus that affected the entire world was named as the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The knowledge regarding the wide clinico-biological aspects of the COVID-19 continues to evolve very rapidly, given the growing data from all over the World. During this complicated process, healthcare professionals have benefited from each other?s experiences in combatting against the COVID-19 syndrome. COVID-19 related studies have been performed by a wide variety of research groups in Turkey as well as the rest of the World. The aim of this paper is to outline Turkish COVID-19 research indexed in LitCovid system. LitCovid is a curated literature hub for tracking up-to-date scientific data about the SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19?s first case was detected in Turkey, on March 11th, 2020. Six months after the first case was observed, the total number of COVID-19 patients was reported to be as 286.455, and the total number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 was 6895. The genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus showed significant identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the Cochrane Handbook and preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, SciELO, and LILACS were searched until June 23, 2020. Observational studies that evaluated the frequency of epilepsy in children diagnosed with CZS according to international criteria were included in the study. RESULTS Fourteen studies evaluating 903 patients diagnosed with CZS were pooled in a meta-analysis. All studies were conducted in Brazil, with reports published between 2016 and 2020, and included children diagnosed with CSZ from 0 to 40 months of age. The overall rate of epilepsy in children diagnosed with CZS was estimated at 60% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.68). The studies included in this review show that the frequency of epilepsy in patients with CSZ varies with age, with higher rates in older children. Epileptic spasms was the primary type of seizure observed in this group, followed by focal and generalized crisis. The response rate to anti-epileptic drugs was considerably low, ranging from 20% of seizure control in the first year and 30% in the second year. SIGNIFICANCE Children with CZS presented a high cumulative incidence of epilepsy episodes with increased severity and a low response to anti-epileptic therapy, which is associated with the extensive damage caused by the Zika virus on the cortical structures of patients.","Maia, César Quadros; Lima, William Gustavo; Nizer, Waleska Stephanie da Cruz; Ferreira, Jaqueline Maria Siqueira",Epilepsia,https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33778951/,224

The impetus for this article comes from a recent review conducted by the authors. That review, a qualitative media analysis of news and academic articles published during the first few months of the outbreak, identified ethical care as a key theme warranting further investigation within the context of the crisis. To explore ethical care further, a set of salient ethical values for delivering care to care home residents living with dementia during the pandemic was derived from a synthesis of relevant ethical standards, codes and philosophical approaches. The ethical values identified were caring, non-maleficence, beneficence, procedural justice, dignity in death and dying, well-being, safety, and personhood. Using these ethical values as a framework, alongside examples from contemporaneous media and academic sources, this article discusses the delivery of ethical care to care home residents with dementia within the context of COVID-19. The analysis identifies positive examples of ethical values displayed by care home staff, care sector organisations, healthcare professionals and third sector advocacy organisations. However, concerns relating to the death rates, dignity, safety, well-being and personhood - of residents and staff - are also evident. These shortcomings are attributable to negligent government strategy, which resulted in delayed guidance, lack of resources and Personal Protective Equipment, unclear data, and inconsistent testing. Consequently, this review demonstrates the ways in which care homes are underfunded, under resourced and undervalued.","Cousins, Emily; de Vries, Kay; Dening, Karen Harrison",Nursing ethics,https://doi.org/10.1177/0969733020976194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33325324/,224
155804,Mental health and its psychosocial predictors during national quarantine in Italy against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).,2020-12-22,"Research has highlighted the importance of health and social care professionals' collaboration with family caregivers. In the field of mental healthcare, involvement of family members is perceived as beneficial to the recovery process of the care recipient. Furthermore, family care-giving is an essential part of elderly care. It is well documented that family members need support to prevent negative consequences of care-giving. Nevertheless, involvement of and support for family caregivers have not developed into a common practice, and research has identified professional barriers to collaboration with family caregivers in several areas. The aim of this study was to explore professionals' experiences of collaboration with family caregivers of older persons with mental health problems, and how they understood their responsibility towards families. We conducted three focus group interviews with 18 health and social care professionals working in community-based services, in three rural municipalities in Western Norway. The thematic analysis by Braun and Clarke guided the analysis. The findings in relation to the professionals' role and responsibility towards family caregivers are presented in three themes: family caregivers - a resource that needs support; a responsibility with unclear boundaries; and balancing different needs. Professionals recognised family caregivers' need for support and acknowledged the importance of family relationships. However, they experienced dilemmas in performing their dual responsibility of caring for the older care recipient as well as the family member, which they described as having unclear guidelines. They also experienced that they had insufficient knowledge to take on this responsibility. We argue that the exercising of discretion is essential for the professionals' responsibility, and that clarification of their responsibility is needed. We recommend a stronger focus in education on developing competence in the family perspective. Furthermore, the apportionment of professionals' responsibility needs to be formalised, especially when several services are involved in providing care.","Sunde, Olivia Sissil; Vatne, Solfrid; Ytrehus, Siri",Health & social care in the community,https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323333/,224
157919,Optimize the management of urological tube-related emergencies during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Randomized controlled trials showed that sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) protect the heart and kidney in an array of populations with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and increased cardiorenal risk. However, the extent of these benefits also in lower kidney-risk T2D populations needs further investigation. METHODS Members of Maccabi Healthcare Systems listed in their T2D registry who initiated new glucose lowering agents (GLA), were divided into SGLT2i initiators and other GLAs (oGLAs). Groups were propensity score-matched by baseline demographic and medical characteristics. Two composite cardiovascular outcomes were defined: all-cause mortality (ACM) or hospitalization for heart failure (hHF); and ACM, myocardial infraction (MI) or stroke. The cardiorenal outcome was: ACM, new end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or ≥ 40% reduction from baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Renal-specific outcome was new ESKD or ≥ 40% eGFR reduction. Single components of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes were also assessed. Three subgroup definitions of low baseline kidney-risk were used: eGFR > 90 ml/min/1.73 m2; urinary albumin below detectable levels; and low risk according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification. Analyses were performed utilizing an unadjusted model, and a model adjusted to baseline eGFR and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. RESULTS Between April 1, 2015 and June 30, 2018; 68,187 patients initiated new GLAs - 11,321 SGLT2i initiators and 42,077 oGLAs initiators were eligible. Propensity score-matching yielded two comparable cohorts; each included 9219 participants. Median follow-up was 1.7 years. Compared to oGLAs, SGLT2i initiators had lower incidence of ACM or hHF [HR95%CI = 0.62(0.51-0.75)]; ACM, MI or stroke [0.67(0.57-0.80)]; the cardiorenal outcome [0.65(0.56-0.76)]; and the renal-specific outcome [0.70(0.57-0.85)]. SGLT2i initiators also had lower risk for ACM, hHF and ≥ 30%, ≥ 40%, ≥ 50%, ≥ 57% eGFR reduction. No difference between groups was observed for MI or stroke. In the low baseline kidney-risk subgroups, SGLT2i initiation was generally associated with lower risk of the cardiovascular and cardiorenal outcomes, driven mainly by lower ACM incidence. CONCLUSIONS Our findings in the general population of patients with T2D demonstrates lower risk of cardiorenal outcomes associated with initiation of SGLT2i compared with oGLAs, including specifically in patients with low baseline kidney-risk.","Schechter, Meir; Melzer-Cohen, Cheli; Rozenberg, Aliza; Yanuv, Ilan; Chodick, Gabriel; Karasik, Avraham; Kosiborod, Mikhail; Mosenzon, Ofri",Cardiovascular diabetology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12933-021-01362-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407822/,224

We compare the scale and nature of spillovers during the 2008-09 global financial crisis (GFC), the 2013 ""taper tantrum""(TT), and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (C-19). Based on the direct and indirect spillovers, the intensity of the spillover effect was largest during C-19 due to its global and multidimensional nature, and the United States was a net transmitter of spillovers particularly in bonds and equity markets. TT was an important episode for EA as it marked the beginning of the region's financial volatility and increased spillovers especially in bonds market. The impulse responses reveal that most spillovers were transmitted rapidly, in a matter of days. In times of recession whereby financial stability is in danger of being affected by spillovers, a concrete financial cooperation remains absent in EA although formal institutions designed to deal with the contagion have been put in place.","Azis, I.

This review provides new information on the hematopoietic origin of MCs from early erythromyeloid progenitors (EMPs), late EMPs, and definitive hematopoietic stem cells. As well as information on the maturation of MSs and heparin synthesis already in the embryonic period. Many physiological functions of MCs are determined by the properties of heparin, which forms the basis of the matrix of granules, since the heparin molecule is a strong polyanion, capable to forming complexes with many biologically active substances and regulating their properties. In a new hypothesis about the participation of MCs in pathological processes, it is assumed that this is due to the depletion of the heparin pool. In such cases, injections of exogenous heparin can help replenish MCs heparin stores. As a result of the restoration of the physiological functions of MCs and the action of exogenous heparin, the pathological process will be converted into an adaptive one. In clinical practice, unfractionated heparin (UFH) obtained from natural sources and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) obtained by the biochemical route are used. Most often, UFH and LMWH are used in the clinic only as anticoagulants. The worldwide spread of a disease named COVID-19 in 2020 showed that UFH and LMWH are multifunctional drugs that have saved many people. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has been an unprecedented social and health emergency worldwide. Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported in populations of many countries. This review provides new information on experimental studies on the successful treatment of pathology with low doses of UFH in modeling PTSD in animals. Consequently, heparin can be considered as a promising multifunctional drug for effective pharmacological correction of comorbid diseases under the influence of extreme factors.","Kondashevskaya, M.

No specific remedy exists at present, but some drugs, such as Dexamethasone, have shown clinical benefits against the causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Objective: To analyze the binding affinity between drugs and an SARS-CoV-2 protein through geometrical methods and to study the theoretical effectiveness of Dexamethasone as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Methods: The binding affinity of Dexamethasone to the target SARS-CoV-2 protein was compared with those of different inhibitors. Drug molecules were docked to the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and the system was simulated by molecular dynamics, allowing alpha shape analysis to extract geometrical features, such as the matching rates of atoms, solid angles, and the distances between atoms at interfaces. Binding affinities between drugs and the main protease were assessed by these geometrical data and the free energy of binding. Results: The behaviour of Dexamethasone was similar to other inhibitors. The efficacy of Dexamethasone as a treatment may be due to it being a glucocorticoid and its properties as a potent inhibitor. Conclusion: This study revealed the mechanism of action of Dexamethasone and provided a geometrical method to distinguish among potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.","Zhu, M.

Methods: We screened the components in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) via Drug-like properties (DL) and Oral bioavailability (OB);PharmMapper and GeneCards databases were used to collect components and COVID-19 related targets;KEGG pathway annotation and GO bioinformatics analysis were based on KOBAS3.0 database;“herb-components-targets-pathways” (H-C-T-P) network and protein-protein interaction network (PPI) were constructed by Cytoscape 3.6.1 software and STRING 10.5 database;we utilized virtual molecular docking to predict the binding ability of the active components and key proteins. Results: A total of 87 components and 40 targets were screened in AGNH. The molecular docking results showed that the docking scores of the top 3 active components and the targets were all greater than 90. Conclusion: Through network pharmacology research, we found that moslosooflavone, oroxylin A, and salvigenin in AGNH can combine with ACE2 and 3CL, and then are involved in the MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling pathways.

The purpose of the article is to study the current state of e-commerce in Ukraine and identify possible ways of modifying the state budget and tax policy for e-commerce in the situation of deepening corona crisis. The article is based on general scientific methods of cognition: abstract-logical, dialectical and system analysis, induction and deduction, analogy and extrapolation, as well as logical generalization. E-commerce is a promising activity that has been showing steady growth for many years. The ability to do business online allows many businesses to adapt to new business conditions, including quarantine restrictions imposed by the spread of corona virus COVID-19. E-commerce is a type of economic activity, which is developing, and at the same time it is a reliable source of budget, despite the crisis. However, since businesses in this area faced the problem of the economic crisis, they need state support. The potential of e-commerce is significant. It allows its subjects to reorient its activity depending on the needs of the business environment. This feature should be taken into account when developing measures to support this area and providing conditions for its sustainable growth. The proposed measures will increase the number of online stores, the turnover from operations in this area, the sales of goods via the Internet, the number of taxpayers and tax revenues to the state budget.

Air quality improvements with regard to restrictions of daily movement among Bangkok people have been reported. This study explores the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and long-range pollution on air quality in Bangkok Metropolitan, Thailand by using ground-based and satellite measurements such as MODIS and TROPOMI data. Moreover, the results project some possible future trends of air quality in Bangkok Metropolitan. The 24-hr average concentrations of PM2.5, O-3, NO2, CO and SO2 were compared between the periods of Normal, Lockdown and New Normal. PM2.5 concentrations increased by 20.56% during the Normal period and decreased by -15.79% and -23.34% during the Lockdown and New Normal periods, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017-2019. There were also significant decreasing trends in O-3: -7.13% and 4.72%;and CO: -8.01% and 23.59% during the Lockdown and New Normal periods, respectively, while NO2 and SO2 concentrations showed increasing trends during the three periods. The MODIS and TROPOMI data analyses indicate the COVID-19 outbreak has had significant positive impact on surface pollution, but no impact on upper atmospheric pollution due to added pollution from long-range transport. The results also demonstrate that surface air pollution had a combination effect from biomass burning, traffic, industrial and household sources during the Lockdown period, except for SO2 concentrations, which were attributed to long-range transport pollution loading. In some cases, a negative impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on air pollution can be observed due to certain activities increasing within Bangkok Metropolitan. Additionally, the results also show that changing the lifestyle into a ""new normal"" for people in Bangkok after the Lockdown period has had a positive effect on air pollution.","Wetchayont, P.; Hayasaka, T.; Khatri, P.",Aerosol and Air Quality Research,https://doi.org/10.4209/aaqr.200662,224

188027,The pathogenesis of ventilator-associated pneumonia: its relevance to developing effective strategies for prevention.,2005,"Vinegar folklore is as colorful as it is practical. Legend states that a courtier in Babylonia (c. 5000 BC) ""discovered"" wine, formed from unattended grape juice, leading to the eventual discovery of vinegar and its use as a food preservative. Hippocrates (c. 420 BC) used vinegar medicinally to manage wounds. Hannibal of Carthage (c. 200 BC), the great military leader and strategist, used vinegar to dissolve boulders that blocked his army's path. Cleopatra (c. 50 BC) dissolved precious pearls in vinegar and offered her love potion to Anthony. Sung Tse, the 10th century creator of forensic medicine, advocated hand washing with sulfur and vinegar to avoid infection during autopsies. Based on the writings of US medical practitioners dating to the late 18th century, many ailments, from dropsy to poison ivy, croup, and stomachache, were treated with vinegar, and, before the production and marketing of hypoglycemic agents, vinegar ""teas"" were commonly consumed by diabetics to help manage their chronic aliment. This review examines the scientific evidence for medicinal uses of vinegar, focusing particularly on the recent investigations supporting vinegar's role as an antiglycemic agent. Epidemiologic studies and clinical trials were identified by a MEDLINE title/abstract search with the following search terms: vinegar, glucose; vinegar, cancer; or vinegar, infection. All relevant randomized or case-control trials were included in this review.","Johnston, Carol S; Gaas, Cindy A",MedGenMed : Medscape general medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16926800/,224

The patients' social capital scores were around 50% in the trust, social cohesion, collective action and cooperation and political empowerment domains. The groups and networks membership domain scored the lowest (27.1%). In regression analysis, employment status was significantly associated with groups and networks membership; age, marital status and financial status were associated with collective action and cooperation; period of disease awareness and marital status affected social cohesion and inclusion; and having risky behaviour affected empowerment and political action. Efforts are needed to enhance the social capital of those patients living with AIDS who are younger, unemployed, divorced/widowed, with risky behaviours and shorter disease awareness.","Ansari, S K; Nedjat, S; Jabbari, H; Saiepour, N; Heris, M J",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26750165/,224

Here we describe the identification and characterization of a not previously recognized coronavirus obtained from an 8-mo-old boy suffering from pneumonia. This coronavirus replicated efficiently in tertiary monkey kidney cells and Vero cells, in contrast to human coronaviruses (HCoV) 229E and OC43. The entire cDNA genome sequence of the previously undescribed coronavirus was determined, revealing that it is most closely related to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and HCoV 229E. The maximum amino acid sequence identity between ORFs of the newly discovered coronavirus and related group 1 coronaviruses ranged from 43% to 67%. Real-time RT-PCR assays were designed to test for the prevalence of the previously undescribed coronavirus in humans. Using these tests, the virus was detected in four of 139 individuals (3%) who were suffering from respiratory illness with unknown etiology. All four patients suffered from fever, runny nose, and dry cough, and all four had underlying or additional morbidity. Our data will enable the development of diagnostic tests to study the prevalence and clinical impact of this virus in humans in more detail. Moreover, it will be important to discriminate this previously undescribed coronavirus from HCoV 229E and OC43 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.","Fouchier, Ron A M; Hartwig, Nico G; Bestebroer, Theo M; Niemeyer, Berend; de Jong, Jan C; Simon, James H; Osterhaus, Albert D M E",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15073334/,224
190193,Epidemiology of acute lung injury.,2005,"Five types of Escherichia coli are responsible for as much as 25% of all diarrheal diseases in developing countries. They tend to be transmitted via contaminated foods, particularly weaning foods, and water. They include enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, enteroadherent, enteroinvasive, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli. Shigella species are responsible for 10-15% of acute diarrheas in children less than 5 years old and the most common etiologic agents of childhood dysentery. Shigellosis is common in the warm season. An outbreak of shigella dysentery in West Bengal, India, had a high attack rate in children less than 5 years old and was resistant to many drugs. Nontyphoid Salmonella species cause watery diarrhea with nausea, cramps, and fever. Worldwide, various Salmonella strains exhibit resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole. Campylobacter jejuni produces watery diarrhea which, in 33% of cases and 1-2 days after onset, contains blood and mucus. Many normal healthy children in developing countries are carriers of C. jejuni. Vibrio cholerae O1 is endemic in parts of Africa and Asia (e.g., 5-10% of hospitalized diarrhea patients). The ElTor cholera biotype is responsible for the 7th pandemic. Other bacterial enteropathogens are Aeromonas species, Bacteroides fragilis, and Providencia alcalifaciens. Rotavirus is a major cause of sporadic and epidemic diarrhea among 6-23 month olds. Its incidence peaks in cold or dry seasons. Other viral enteropathogens are Norwalk virus, adenoviruses, astroviruses, and coronaviruses. In India, the prevalence of Entamoeba histolytica varies from 3.6% to 47.4%. It occurs equally in high and low socioeconomic classes. Giardia lamblia usually infects 1-5 year old children. Its transmission routes are food, water, and the fecal-oral route. Cryptosporidia produce acute watery diarrhea, especially in children less than 2 years old. Cryptosporidia diarrhea is common among AIDS patients. Oral rehydration therapy and proper feeding during and after diarrhea reduces deaths from diarrhea.","Niyogi, S K; Saha, M R; De, S P",Indian journal of public health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7835992/,224
190616,Documentation issues for mechanical ventilation in pressure-control modes.,2010,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is under-utilized in Asia because of the misconception that its incidence is lower in Asians as compared to the Caucasians. The available data on VTE in Asia is limited due to the lack of well-designed multicenter randomized controlled trials as well as non-standardized research designs, making data comparison difficult. Emerging data indicates that the VTE incidence is not low in Asia, and is comparable to that reported in the Western literature in some instances. There is also a trend towards increasing incidence of VTE, as demonstrated by a number of hospital-based studies in Asia. This could be attributed to lifestyle changes, ageing population, increasing awareness of VTE and wider availability of Duplex ultrasound. The risk of VTE in hospitalized patients remain the same in Asians and Caucasians, even though there may be factors that are inherent to patients in Asia that influence the slight variation in incidence. The utilization rate of VTE prophylaxis remains suboptimal in Asia. The Asian Venous Thrombosis Forum (AVTF) comprises participants from various countries such as China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and experts from Australia and Europe. The forum evaluated the available data on VTE from the Asian region and formulated guidelines tailored to meet the needs of the region. We recommend that serious considerations are given to VTE prophylaxis especially in the at-risk group and a formal hospital policy be established to facilitate the implementation. On admission to the hospital, we recommend assessing the patients for both VTE and bleeding risk. We recommend mechanical prophylaxis for patients at increased risk of bleeding and utilizing it as an adjunctive measure in combination with pharmacological prophylaxis in patients with high risk of VTE. For patients undergoing general or gynecological surgery and with moderate risk for VTE, we recommend prophylaxis with one of the following: low dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC). For the same group of patients at high risk of VTE, we recommend pharmacological or combination of pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis. For patients undergoing major orthopedic surgeries like total hip replacement, total knee replacement and proximal hip fracture surgery, we recommend using one of the following: LMWH, fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, warfarin or aspirin with IPC. For patients admitted to the hospital with acute medical illness and has moderate risk of VTE, we recommend prophylaxis with LDUH, LMWH or Fondaparinux. For the same group at high risk of VTE, we recommend combination of pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis.","Liew, N C; Chang, Y H; Choi, G; Chu, P H; Gao, X; Gibbs, H; Ho, C O; Ibrahim, H; Kim, T K; Kritpracha, B; Lee, L H; Lee, L; Lee, W Y; Li, Y J; Nicolaides, A N; Oh, D; Pratama, D; Ramakrishnan, N; Robless, P A; Villarama-Alemany, G; Wong, R",International angiology : a journal of the International Union of Angiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23222928/,224

196901,New endotracheal tubes designed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia: do they make a difference?,2010,"Mechanisms leading to subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis in coronaviruses are poorly understood but are known to involve a heptameric signaling motif, originally called the intergenic sequence. The intergenic sequence is the presumed crossover region (fusion site) for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during discontinuous transcription, a process leading to sgmRNAs that are both 5' and 3' coterminal. In the bovine coronavirus, the major fusion site for synthesis of mRNA 5 (GGUAGAC) does not conform to the canonical motif (UC[U,C]AAAC) at three positions (underlined), yet it lies just 14 nucleotides downstream from such a sequence (UCCAAAC). The infrequently used canonical sequence, by computer prediction, is buried within the stem of a stable hairpin (-17.2 kcal/mol). Here we document the existence of this stem by enzyme probing and examine its influence and that of neighboring sequences on the unusual choice of fusion sites by analyzing transcripts made in vivo from mutated defective interfering RNA constructs. We learned that (i) mutations that were predicted to unfold the stem-loop in various ways did not switch RdRp crossover to the upstream canonical site, (ii) a totally nonconforming downstream motif resulted in no measurable transcription from either site, (iii) the canonical upstream site does not function ectopically to lend competence to the downstream noncanonical site, and (iv) altering flanking sequences downstream of the downstream noncanonical motif in ways that diminish sequence similarity with the virus genome 5' end caused a dramatic switch to the upstream canonical site. These results show that sequence elements downstream of the noncanonical site can dramatically influence the choice of fusion sites for synthesis of mRNA 5 and are interpreted as being most consistent with a mechanism of similarity-assisted RdRp strand switching during minus-strand synthesis.","Ozdarendeli, A; Ku, S; Rochat, S; Williams, G D; Senanayake, S D; Brian, D A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11462008/,224

Therefore, it is important to choose the most suitable test according to its sensitivity and specificity but also to the stage of the disease. Currently, the RT-PCR detection of the viral genome in respiratory samples is the most reliable test to confirm the diagnosis of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. It has to be done in Class II biological safety laboratory. However, it may lack sensitivity, particularly in the advanced phase of infection, and depends closely on the samples' quality. Rapid PCR by cartridge system reduces response times but is not suitable for laboratories with high throughput of requests. Detection of virus antigens on respiratory samples is a quick and easy to use technique; however it has not good specificity and sensitivity and cannot be used for diagnosis and patient management. The detection of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is better used for epidemiological analyses.

To characterize the inflammatory response developed against this virus, lesions from 4 naturally infected ferrets were examined. Lesions were classified into the 4 known types of granulomas (granulomas without necrosis [G], granulomas with necrosis [G-N], granulomas with neutrophils [G-NL], and diffuse granulomatous inflammation [DG]). The cellular composition of the lesions was characterized on the basis of cellular morphology and immunohistochemistry using markers for T and B-lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. The extent and distribution of viral antigen expression was also assessed. In G lesions, macrophages were mainly located in the center of the granuloma, with a moderate number of T-lymphocytes scattered among the macrophages, plasma cells, and B-lymphocytes. G-N lesions exhibited a necrotic center surrounded by abundant macrophages, some T-lymphocytes, plasma cells, and a few B-lymphocytes. In G-NL lesions, there was a central area dominated by neutrophils with low numbers of macrophages, plasma cells, and lymphocytes. DG presented similar cell proportions, but distributed evenly throughout the lesions. FRSCV was expressed in G, G-NL, G-N, and DG, with decreasing numbers of immunoreactive cells. This study reveals the important role of macrophages in the inflammatory response of ferrets against the virus and the variable proportions of leukocytes among different types of lesions, indicating their variable age. The results also confirm the similarities of the disease in ferrets to feline infectious peritonitis.","Doria-Torra, G; Vidaña, B; Ramis, A; Amarilla, S P; Martínez, J",Veterinary pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27106741/,224

Critically, interpersonal distance (IPD) depends on the affective dimension of social interaction, which might be affected by the current Covid-19 context. In the present internet-based experimental study, we analyzed the preferred IPD of 457 French participants when facing human-like characters that were either wearing a face mask or displaying a neutral, happy or angry facial expression. Results showed that IPD was significantly reduced when characters were wearing a face mask, as they were perceived as more trustworthy compared to the other conditions. Importantly, IPD was even more reduced in participants infected with Covid-19 or living in low-risk areas, while it was not affected by the predicted health of the characters. These findings shed further light on the psychological factors that motivate IPD adjustments, in particular when facing a collective threat. They are also of crucial importance for policy makers as they reveal that despite the indisputable value of wearing a face mask in the current pandemic context, their use should be accompanied by an emphasis on social distancing to prevent detrimental health consequences.","Cartaud, Alice; Quesque, François; Coello, Yann",PLoS One,,224

207354,Breastfeeding and Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Study in Evolving Public Health Recommendations,2021,"BACKGROUND: The need for rapid point-of-care (POC) diagnostics is now becoming more evident due to the increasing need for timely results and improvement in healthcare service. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, POC has become critical in managing the spread of disease. Applicable diagnostics should be readily deployable, easy to use, portable, and accurate so that they fit mobile laboratories, pop-up treatment centers, field hospitals, secluded wards within hospitals, or remote regions, and can be operated by staff with minimal training. Complete blood count (CBC), however, has not been available at the POC in a simple-to-use device until recently. The HemoScreen, which was recently cleared by the FDA for POC use, is a miniature, easy-to-use instrument that uses disposable cartridges and may fill this gap. CONTENT: The HemoScreen's analysis method, in contrast to standard laboratory analyzers, is based on machine vision (image-based analysis) and artificial intelligence (AI). We discuss the different methods currently used and compare their results to the vision-based one. The HemoScreen is found to correlate well to laser and impedance-based methods while emphasis is given to mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), and platelets (PLT) that demonstrate better correlation when the vision-based method is compared to itself due to the essential differences between the underlying technologies. SUMMARY: The HemoScreen analyzer demonstrates lab equivalent performance, tested at different clinical settings and sample characteristics, and might outperform standard techniques in the presence of certain interferences. This new approach to hematology testing has great potential to improve quality of care in a variety of settings.","Bransky, Avishay; Larsson, Anders; Aardal, Elisabeth; Ben-Yosef, Yaara; Christenson, Robert H",,,224

210231,Challenges faced by mental health providers and patients during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic due to technological barriers,2020,"Health behaviours and needs of people with COPD during COVID-19 pandemic: a document analysis Abstract. Background: The government's guidelines affected people with COPD on different levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to belonging to a group of particularly vulnerable persons, they had to adapt their health behaviours, in particular physical activity, to recommendations provided in order to prevent negative effects on disease progression. There is little knowledge regarding how this group of patients coped with these challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To describe the health behaviours and needs people with COPD convey during nursing phone consultations and which nursing interventions have been carried out. METHODS: A document analysis of 50 nursing phone consultations was performed. The data were summarised descriptively and analysed thematically. RESULTS: The main topics were the adaptation of physical activity, the implementation of the recommendations to the individual life situation, the detection of a COVID-19 infection and questions concerning the planning of medical appointments. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic poses additional challenges to the disease management of people with COPD. The increased need for care brought on by the pandemic was able to be met by the knowledge provided in the nursing phone consultations. What remains to be established is what role the consultations play in a sustainable change in behaviour and in dealing with negative emotions.","Hübsch, Christine; Clarenbach, Christian F; Petry, Heidi; Baltes-Wieser, Annina; Schmid-Mohler, Gabriela",Pflege,,224

Interprofessional collaboration is an integral component when implementing a robust and comprehensive response to such a crisis. As the needs of our academic medical center evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic, the COVID-19 Mobilizer Team used an interprofessional approach to respond to the diverse and complex needs of the organization. Team members included employees deployed from diverse departments such as Physical and Occupational Therapy, Nursing Education, Hospital Operations, and Advance Practice Providers. The team's function transitioned from ensuring compliance with infection control policy and procedure and use of personal protective equipment to ensuring a two way channel of communication between front line staff and the Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) concerning testing and isolation procedures, supplies, visitor restrictions, and staff wellness issues. The Mobilizer Team members became integral contributors to the HICS and provided members of our staff outside of the COVID-19 care units an opportunity to partner with colleagues from professions they may have never worked with and the chance to contribute to the COVID-19 pandemic response.","Stifter, Janet; Terry, Allison; Phillips, Janice; Heitschmidt, Mary",J Interprof Care,,224

214902,Evidence and Our Daily Risk Trade-offs in the Care of Critically Ill Patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: To assess what factors were associated with reported changes to usual alcohol drinking behaviour during the start of lockdown in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: Online cross-sectional survey of 30,375 adults in the UK from 21st March to 4th April 2020 (sample weighted). Logistic regression models were used to examine sociodemographic, drinking and COVID-19 factors associated with i) drinking less and ii) drinking more (versus same as usual). RESULTS: Of 22,113 drinkers, 48.1 % reported drinking about the same, 25.7 % reported drinking less, and 26.2 % reported drinking more than usual over the past week. Drinking less was independently associated with being younger (OR = 0.88, p < .001), male (OR = 0.76, p < .001), BAME (OR = 0.76, p = .028), low income (OR = 0.74, p < .001), having COVID-19 (OR = 2.04, p < .001), adhering to COVID-19 protective behaviours (OR = 1.58, p = .020), stress about becoming ill from COVID-19 (OR = 1.26, p = .004) and not being a key worker (OR = 0.87, p = .030). Drinking more was independently associated with being younger (OR = 0.73, p < .001), female (OR = 1.36, p < .001), post-16 qualifications (OR = 1.21, p = .012), high income (OR = 1.43, p < .001), stress about catching (OR = 1.22, p = .020) or becoming ill from COVID-19 (OR = 1.28, p < .001), stress about finances (OR = 1.43, p < .001), and having an anxiety disorder (OR = 1.24, p = .011). CONCLUSIONS: In a large, population sample of adults in the UK, around a quarter of drinkers reported drinking more alcohol and a quarter drinking less than usual during the COVID-19 related lockdown. Certain groups, such as those who are younger, female, of high socioeconomic position, have an anxiety disorder, and are stressed about finances or COVID-19 may need targeted alcohol reduction support during lockdown.","Garnett, Claire; Jackson, Sarah; Oldham, Melissa; Brown, Jamie; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",Drug Alcohol Depend,,224

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical information and CT findings of a total of 14 patients with COVID-19 infection (age range, 12-83 years; females 6) were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical information includes the history of exposure, laboratory results, and the symptoms (such as fever, cough, headache, etc.); CT findings of chest include the extension and distribution of lesion, the ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, bronchovascular enlarged, irregular linear appearances, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy. RESULTS: Eight patients had the exposure history for recent travel to Wuhan of Hubei province (8/14, 57%), 6 had the exposure to patients with COVID-19 infection. Significant statistical differences were observed in lymphocyte percentage decreased and C-reactive protein elevated (pâ=â0.015). Seven patients had fever, 7 had cough, 2 had headache, 3 had fatigue, 1 had body soreness, 3 had diarrhea, and 2 had no obvious symptoms. In chest CT examination, 10 patients were positive (10/14, 71.43%). Among these patients, 9 had lesions involving both lungs (9/10, 90%), 8 had lesions involving 4 to 5 lobes (8/10, 80%). Most of lesions were distributed peripherally and the most significant lesions were observed in the right lower lobe in 9 patients (9/10, 90%). Nodules were observed in 5 patients (5/10, 50%); GGO, consolidation, and bronchovascular enlarged were shown in 9 patients (9/10, 90%); irregular linear appearances were revealed in 7 patients (7/10, 70%); and pleural effusions were exhibited in 2 patients (2/10, 20%). Last, no patients showed lymphadenopathy. CONCLUSION: There were some typical CT features for diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The radiologists should know these CT findings and clinical information, which could help for accurate analysis in the patients with 2019 novel coronavirus infection.","Lei, Pinggui; Huang, Zhaoshu; Liu, Guoli; Wang, Pingxian; Song, Wen; Mao, Jujiang; Shen, Guiquan; Zhou, Shi; Qian, Wei; Jiao, Jun",J Xray Sci Technol,,224

Pharmaceutical companies have already begun to patent existing medicines for the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2, affording them exclusive manufacturing rights over vital medicines. Advocates have raised concerns regarding the pricing of COVID-19 drugs, as well as patent monopolies on the manufacture of COVID-19 treatments. The HIV/AIDS pandemic provides a useful lens through which we can analyse existing pathways for challenging pharmaceutical patents in the context of global pandemic. In this article, we review three legal pathways for overriding and seizing patents on medicines by describing cases in which they were employed to make antiretroviral drugs more accessible to people living with HIV.

219818,The Effects of Social Support on Sleep Quality of Medical Staff Treating Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January and February 2020 in China,2020,"BACKGROUND: A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged and affected most of the world in early 2020. To inform effective public health measures we conducted a knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) survey among a Hausa Muslim society in Nigeria in March 2020. METHODS: The study is an analytic cross-sectional survey with questionnaires administered to the general population including Health Care Workers (HCW) in Kano, Nigeria. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling following informed consent. The percentage of KAP scores were categorized as good and poor. Independent predictors of good knowledge of COVID 19 were ascertained using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The questionnaire was administered among urban 32.8%, peri-urban dwellers 32.4%, and to online participants 34.8%. The peri-urban and urban participants were given paper questionnaires. There were 886 study participants with mean age 28.58yrs [SD:10.25] (Interquartile range [IQR]:22yrs-32yrs), males 55.4% with 57.3% having had or were in tertiary education. Most participants were students 40% and civil servants 20%. The overall mean [standard deviation (SD)] for knowledge, attitude and practice scores expressed in percentage was 65.38%[SD15.90], 71.45% [SD14.10], and 65.04% [SD17.02] respectively. Out of the respondents, 270(30.47%) had good knowledge (GK), 158(17.8%) had good attitude (GA), and 230(25.96%) had good practice (GP) using cut-off scores of 75%, 86.5%, and 75% respectively. Over 48% did not agree COVID-19 originated from animals while 60% perceived the pandemic to be due to God's punishment. Also, 36% thought it was a man-made virus. When rating fear, most respondents [63.5%] had marked fear i.e. &#8805; 7 out of 10 and 56% admitted to modifying their habits recently in fear of contracting the virus. As regards attitude to religious norms, 77.77% agreed on cancellation of the lesser pilgrimage as a measure to curb the spread of the disease while 23.64% admitted that greater pilgrimage (Hajj) should proceed despite the persistence of the ongoing pandemic. About 50% of the respondents insisted on attending Friday congregational prayers despite social distancing. One in four people still harbored stigma towards a person who has recovered from the virus. 28% felt some races are more at risk of the disease though 66% mentioned always practicing social distancing from persons coughing or sneezing. Almost 70% of respondents said they were willing to accept a vaccine with 39% saying they would be willing to pay for it if not publicly funded. In univariate analysis increasing age and having been ever married were associated with GK while tertiary education was associated with GA [Odds Ratio; 95% Confidence Interval] 2.66(1.79-3.95). Independent positive predictors of GK were those who were or had ever been married, those who had marked fear of COVID-19, and had modified their habits in the last three months. Those who had non-tertiary education and had the questionnaire administered as paper rather than online version had GK but age was not a predictor. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of transmission and preventive measures should be improved in the general population cognizant of cultural norms and Islamic practices. The study highlights the importance of considering belief systems and perception in developing control measures against COVID-19.","Habib, Maryam Abdulrazaq; Dayyab, Farouq Muhammad; Iliyasu, Garba; Habib, Abdulrazaq G",PLoS One,,224

221136,Anxiety and depression levels of the general population during the rapid progressing stage in the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak: a cross-sectional online investigation in China,2021,"STUDY QUESTION: What are appraisals, coping strategies and emotional reactions of patients to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fertility clinic closures? SUMMARY ANSWER: Clinic closure was appraised as stressful due to uncertainty and threat to the attainability of the parenthood goal but patients were able to cope using strategies that fit the uncertainty of the situation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Psychological research on COVID-19 suggests that people are more anxious than historical norms and moderately to extremely upset about fertility treatment cancellation owing to COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study was of cross-sectional design, comprising a mixed-methods, English language, anonymous, online survey posted from April 9 to 21 to social media. Eligibility criteria were being affected by COVID-19 fertility clinic closure, 18 years of age or older and able to complete the survey in English. In total, 946 people clicked on the survey link, 76 did not consent, 420 started but did not complete the survey and 450 completed (48% completion, 446 women, four men). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Overall 74.7% (n = 336) of respondents were residents in the UK with an average age of 33.6 years (SD = 4.4) and average years trying to conceive, 3.5 years (SD = 2.22). The survey comprised quantitative questions about the intensity of cognitive appraisals and emotions about clinic closure, and ability to cope with clinic closure. Open-text questions covered their understanding of COVID-19 and its effect on reproductive health and fertility plans, concerns and perceived benefits of clinic closure, and knowledge about closure. Sociodemographic information was collected. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used on quantitative data. Thematic qualitative analysis (inductive coding) was performed on the textual data from each question. Deductive coding grouped themes from each question into meta-themes related to cognitive stress and coping theory. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Most patients (81.6%, n = 367) had tests or treatments postponed, with these being self (41.3%, n = 186) or publicly (46.4%, n = 209) funded. Patients appraised fertility clinic closure as having potential for a more negative than positive impact on their lives, and to be very or extremely uncontrollable and stressful (P &#8804; 0.001). Most reported a slight to moderate ability to cope with closure. Data saturation was achieved with all open-text questions, with 33 broad themes identified and four meta-themes linked to components of the cognitive stress and coping theory. First, participants understood clinic closure was precautionary due to unknown effects of COVID-19 but some felt clinic closure was unfair relative to advice about getting pregnant given to the public. Second, closure was appraised as a threat to attainability of the parenthood goal largely due to uncertainty of the situation (e.g. re-opening, effect of delay) and intensification of pre-existing hardships of fertility problems (e.g. long time waiting for treatment, history of failed treatment). Third, closure taxed personal coping resources but most were able to cope using thought-management (e.g. distraction, focusing on positives), getting mentally and physically fit for next treatments, strengthening their social network, and keeping up-to-date. Finally, participants reported more negative than positive emotions (P &#8804; 0.001) and, almost all participants reported stress, worry and frustration at the situation, while some expressed anger and resentment at the unfairness of the situation. Overall, 11.8% were not at all able to cope, with reports of intense feelings of hopelessness and deteriorating well-being and mental health. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The survey captures patient reactions at a specific point in time, during lockdown and before clinics announced re-opening. Participants were self-selected (e.g. UK residents, women, 48% starting but not completing the survey), which may affect generalisability. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Fertility stakeholders (e.g. clinics, patient support groups, regulators, professional societies) need to work together to address the great uncertainty from COVID-19. This goal can be met proactively by setting up transparent processes for COVID-19 eventualities and signposting to information and coping resources. Future psychological research priorities should be on identifying patients at risk of distress with standardised measures and developing digital technologies appropriate for the realities of fertility care under COVID-19.

This pandemic is unprecedented in human history and affects all aspects of life. In this article, we explore the pandemic's impact on child protective services in Estonia and survey a representative sample of child protection workers (n = 81), asking three open-ended questions designed to explore child protection practice. These questions concern the impact on organisational design, the workers' ability to conduct a diagnosis of a child's care context, and what knowledge they could draw upon, as well as the decision itself. The overall findings indicate that the organisational design left practice unprepared; there was a general lack of ability to act upon referrals and also to conduct investigations to evaluate care contexts. Furthermore, there is a general lack of knowledge of how to deal with protective practices and conduct decision-making during crisis situations.","Toros, Karmen; Falch-Eriksen, Asgeir",Child Youth Serv Rev,,224

224942,Behavioural responses and anxiety symptoms during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Japan: A large scale cross-sectional study,2021,"Although rectal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) with an L-cell phenotype and small size are generally less clinically serious, the new 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) classification system has categorized all of these lesions as malignant. Identifying biomarkers of rectal NETs is thus important for stratifying their clinical behavior. Chromogranin A protein expression was assessed in 538 endoscopically or surgically resected rectal NETs and compared with clinicopathologic factors to identify its clinical and prognostic significance. All of the rectal NETs analyzed (100%) were synaptophysin positive, but chromogranin A labeling was only detected in 111 cases (20.6%). Chromogranin A expression in the rectal NETs was more commonly associated with older age (50 y and older; P=0.013), male sex (P=0.002), radical resection (P=0.003), large tumor size (&#8805;1 cm; P=0.038), muscularis propria invasion (P=0.002), lymphovascular (P=0.014) and perineural (P<0.001) invasion, an involved resection margin (P=0.028), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.003). Patients with chromogranin A expression had higher plasma chromogranin A levels (P=0.023) than those without chromogranin A expression during follow-up. The 10-year disease-free survival rate in rectal NET patients with chromogranin A expression (91.5%) was significantly shorter than the negative cases (99.7%) by both univariate (hazard ratio=14.438; 95% confidence interval: 2.911-71.598; P<0.001) and multivariate (hazard ratio=12.099; 95% confidence interval, 2.044-71.608; P=0.006) analyses. In summary, rectal NETs that are positive for chromogranin A are less common than those with synaptophysin expression and show more aggressive clinical behavior. Chromogranin A is therefore a prognostic indicator of higher recurrence risk in patients with endoscopically or surgically resected rectal NETs.","Kim, Jisup; Kim, Joo Young; Oh, Eun Hye; Yoo, Changhoon; Park, In Ja; Yang, Dong-Hoon; Ryoo, Baek-Yeol; Ryu, Jin-Sook; Hong, Seung-Mo",Am. j. surg. pathol,,224

Process followed a rapid recommendation checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. Then a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. RESULTS: The IDSA guideline panel agreed on 7 treatment recommendations and provided narrative summaries of other treatments undergoing evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: The panel expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials, which would provide much needed evidence on the efficacy and safety of various therapies for COVID-19, given that we could not make a determination whether the benefits outweigh harms for most treatments.","Bhimraj, Adarsh; Morgan, Rebecca L; Shumaker, Amy Hirsch; Lavergne, Valery; Baden, Lindsey; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Edwards, Kathryn M; Gandhi, Rajesh; Muller, William J; O039,; Horo, John C; Shoham, Shmuel; Murad, M Hassan; Mustafa, Reem A; Sultan, Shahnaz; Falck-Ytter, Yngve",Clin. infect. dis,,224

To study the kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and to assess the diagnostic performances of eight serological assays, we used 129 serum samples collected on known days post symptom onset (dpso) from 42 patients with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 54 serum samples from healthy blood donors, and children infected with seasonal coronaviruses. The sera were analyzed for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies using indirect immunofluorescence testing (IIFT) based on SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. They were further tested for antibodies against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (IgG, IgA) and against the viral nucleocapsid protein (IgG, IgM) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The assay specificities were 94.4%-100%. The sensitivities varied largely between assays, reflecting their respective purposes. The sensitivities of IgA and IgM assays were the highest between 11 and 20 dpso, whereas the sensitivities of IgG assays peaked between 20 and 60 dpso. IIFT showed the highest sensitivities due to the use of the whole SARS-CoV-2 as substrate and provided information on whether or not the individual has been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays provided further information about both the prevalence and concentration of specific antibodies against selected antigens of SARS-CoV-2.","Emmerich, Petra; von Possel, Ronald; Hemmer, Christoph Josef; Fritzsche, Carlos; Geerdes-Fenge, Hilte; Menge, Babett; Messing, Claudia; Borchardt-Lohölter, Viola; Deschermeier, Christina; Steinhagen, Katja",J. med. virol,,224

In this study, we systematically reviewed the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched from January 1, 2020, to April 16, 2020. Case reports and case series of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were included. Two reviewers screened 366 studies and 14 studies were included. Four reviewers independently extracted the features from the studies. We used a random-effects model to analyse the incidence (P) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 236 pregnant women with COVID-19. The results were as follows: positive CT findings (71%; 95% CI, 0.49-0.93), caesarean section (65%; 95% CI, 0.42-0.87), fever (51%; 95% CI, 0.35-0.67), lymphopenia (49%; 95% CI, 0.29-0.70), coexisting disorders (33%; 95% CI, 0.21-0.44), cough (31%; 95% CI, 0.23-0.39), fetal distress (29%; 95% CI, 0.08-0.49), preterm labor (23%; 95% CI, 0.14-0.32), and severe case or death (12%; 95% CI, 0.03-0.20). The subgroup analysis showed that compared with non-pregnant patients, pregnant women with COVID-19 had significantly lower incidences of fever (pregnant women, 51%; non-pregnant patients, 91%; P < 0.00001) and cough (pregnant women, 31%; non-pregnant patients, 67%; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of fever, cough and positive CT findings in pregnant women with COVID-19 are less than those in the normal population with COVID-19, but the rate of preterm labor is higher among pregnant with COVID-19 than among normal pregnant women. There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through vertical transmission.","Gao, Yi-Jie; Ye, Lei; Zhang, Jia-Shuo; Yin, Yang-Xue; Liu, Min; Yu, Hong-Biao; Zhou, Rong",BMC Infect Dis,,224

For example, the extent to which social media platforms contribute to enhancing public health awareness and prevention during epidemic disease transmission is currently unknown. Doubtlessly, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) represents a great challenge at the global level, aggressively affecting large cities and public gatherings and thereby having substantial impacts on many health care systems worldwide as a result of its rapid spread. Each country has its capacity and reacts according to its perception of threat, economy, health care policy, and the health care system structure. Furthermore, we noted a lack of research focusing on the role of social media campaigns in public health awareness and public protection against the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan as a developing country. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of social media platforms on public health protection against the COVID-19 pandemic via public health awareness and public health behavioral changes as mediating factors in Jordan. METHODS: A quantitative approach and several social media platforms were used to collect data via web questionnaires in Jordan, and a total of 2555 social media users were sampled. This study used structural equation modeling to analyze and verify the study variables. RESULTS: The main findings revealed that the use of social media platforms had a significant positive influence on public health protection against COVID-19 as a pandemic. Public health awareness and public health behavioral changes significantly acted as partial mediators in this relationship. Therefore, a better understanding of the effects of the use of social media interventions on public health protection against COVID-19 while taking public health awareness and behavioral changes into account as mediators should be helpful when developing any health promotion strategy plan. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the use of social media platforms can positively influence awareness of public health behavioral changes and public protection against COVID-19. Public health authorities may use social media platforms as an effective tool to increase public health awareness through dissemination of brief messages to targeted populations. However, more research is needed to validate how social media channels can be used to improve health knowledge and adoption of healthy behaviors in a cross-cultural context.","Al-Dmour, Hani; Masa039,; deh, Ra039; ed,; Salman, Amer; Abuhashesh, Mohammad; Al-Dmour, Rand",J Med Internet Res,,224

We searched for patients with sarcoidosis presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control guidelines) among those included in the SarcoGEAS Registry, a nationwide, multicenter registry of patients fulfilling the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders 1999 classification criteria for sarcoidosis. A 2:1 age-sex-matched subset of patients with sarcoidosis without SARS-CoV-2 infection was selected as control population. Forty-five patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified (28 women, mean age 55 years). Thirty-six patients presented a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and 14 were hospitalized (12 required supplemental oxygen, 2 intensive care unit admission and 1 mechanical ventilation). Four patients died due to progressive respiratory failure. Patients who required hospital admission had an older mean age (64.9 vs. 51.0 years, p = 0.006), a higher frequency of baseline comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (64% vs. 23%, p = 0.016), diabetes mellitus (43% vs. 13%, p = 0.049) and chronic liver/kidney diseases (36% vs. 0%, p = 0.002) and presented more frequently fever (79% vs. 35%, p = 0.011) and dyspnea (50% vs. 3%, p = 0.001) in comparison with patients managed at home. Age- and sex-adjusted multivariate analysis identified the age at diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection as the only independent variable associated with hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio 1.18, 95% conficence interval 1.04-1.35). A baseline moderate/severe pulmonary impairment in function tests was associated with a higher rate of hospitalization but the difference was not statistically significant (50% vs. 23%, p = 0.219). A close monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection in elderly patients with sarcoidosis, especially in those with baseline cardiopulmonary diseases and chronic liver or renal failure, is recommended. The low frequency of severe pulmonary involvement in patients with sarcoidosis from Southern Europe may explain the weak prognostic role of baseline lung impairment in our study, in contrast to studies from other geographical areas.","Brito-Zerón, P; Gracia-Tello, B; Robles, A; Alguacil, A; Bonet, M; De-Escalante, B; Noblejas-Mosso, A; Gómez-de-la-Torre, R; Akasbi, M; Pérez-de-Lis, M; Pérez-Alvarez, R; Ramos-Casals, M",Viruses,,224

centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC por sus siglas en inglés) y guías oficiales utilizadas en otros países como Canadá, Reino Unido y Australia Además, se llevó a cabo una búsqueda bibliográfica sistemática rápida de la literatura con respecto al uso de los respiradores elastoméricos para protección contra la COVID-19 Para ello se ingresó a las principales bases de datos, a través de los motores de búsqueda de PubMed, Cochrane Library y Google Scholar Asimismo, se amplió la búsqueda de manera manual revisando el listado de referencias bibliográficas de guías o estudios previamente identificados Por último, debido a que la COVID-19 es una enfermedad de reciente aparición y la generación de nueva evidencia sucede en tiempo real, se revisó en la base de datos de medRxiv para identificar artículos científicos que estuviesen en proceso de publicación RESULTADOS: Guías de práctica clínica (GPC Otros documentos con respecto al uso de los respiradores elastoméricos en el contexto COVID-19 CONCLUSIÓN: Ante la escasez global de dispositivos de protección respiratoria, entidades de salud internacionales (por ejemplo, OMS, CDC) recomiendan que el uso de respiradores convencionales (N95, FPP2, FPP3, o equivalentes) se reserve para el personal de salud expuesto a los procedimientos generadores de aerosoles (PGA), los cuales representan alto riesgo de transmisión aérea del SARS-Cov-2 Cuando la escasez de este tipo de respiradores convencionales es crítica, varias agencias internacionales han aceptado el uso de respiradores elastoméricos de media cara (REMC), recomendando que su uso se restrinja a las mismas situaciones clínicas donde se indican los respiradores convencionales De hecho, la información expuesta en el presente reporte sugiere que los REMC son de equivalente o superior nivel de eficacia que los respiradores convencionales para proteger al personal de salud que lo usa en el contexto de PGA en pacientes COVID-19 Es menester tener en cuenta que los REMC tienen una válvula inhalatoria con filtro que protege al usuario (personal de salud) de la infección por el ARS-Cov-2;y tiene una válvula exhalatoria sin filtro, lo que representa un potencial riesgo de contagio para las personas, o riesgo de contaminación de las superficies, que se encuentran alrededor, en caso el usuario del REMC esté infectado Por ello, se recomienda que la implementación de los REMC debe realizarse con una adecuada educación y entrenamiento del personal de salud, así como también con un adecuado protocolo de limpieza, desinfección y almacenamiento para evitar el riesgo de contaminación Asimismo, se recomienda que el uso de REMC debe restringirse al personal de salud involucrado en áreas hospitalarias donde se realicen PGA de pacientes confirmados de COVID-19 y donde los otros profesionales de salud presentes estén debidamente protegidos con EPP Si se toma en cuenta estos aspectos, el REMC representa una alternativa razonable en el contexto de escasez crítica de respiradores convencionales","Perú.

253341,Predictors of failure with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure: a multicenter observational study,2021,"We study the problem of fairly allocating a divisible resource, also known as cake cutting, with an additional requirement that the shares that different agents receive should be sufficiently separated from one another. This captures, for example, constraints arising from social distancing guidelines. While it is sometimes impossible to allocate a proportional share to every agent under the separation requirement, we show that the well-known criterion of maximin share fairness can always be attained. We then establish several computational properties of maximin share fairness-for instance, the maximin share of an agent cannot be computed exactly by any finite algorithm, but can be approximated with an arbitrarily small error. In addition, we consider the division of a pie (i.e., a circular cake) and show that an ordinal relaxation of maximin share fairness can be achieved.","Elkind, E.; Segal-Halevi, E.; Suksompong, W.; Assoc Advancement Artificial, Intelligence",35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence / 33rd Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence / 11th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence,,224
253967,Colchicine treatment can improve outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Assess women's perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on their health care and well-being, access to and satisfaction with medical care due to the changes in delivery of care triggered by the pandemic. METHODS: An online survey of women having health care appointments in the outpatient facilities across all divisions of a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at a tertiary care referral center in North Central Florida. Patients had outpatient appointments that were scheduled, canceled or rescheduled, in person or by telemedicine, between 11 March 2020 and 11 May 2020, a time during which a COVID-19 stay-at-home order was enacted across our state. A total of 6,697 visits were planned. Patients with multiple visits were unified, leaving 6,044 unique patients to whom the survey was emailed between 20 July 2020 and 31 July 2020. The survey was closed on 21 August 2020. Analyses were focused on simple descriptive statistics to assess frequency of responses. Analyses of variance and chi-square analyses were conducted to compare outcomes when all cells were &#8805; 10, based on sub-specialty and insurance status; otherwise, frequencies were examined for the entire sample only. Missing data were excluded listwise. RESULTS: A total of 6044 patients were contacted. Completed surveys numbered 1,083 yielding a response rate of 17.9%. The most common sub-specialty visit was gynecology (56.7%) followed by obstetrics (31.5%,), pelvic floor disorders (4.8%), gynecological oncology (2.9%,), and reproductive endocrinology (0.5%). A substantial percentage of women had visits canceled (19.2%), rescheduled (32.8%) or changed (42.1%) to telemedicine. In our patient population, 32.6% were worried about visiting the clinic and 48.1% were worried about visiting the hospital. COVID-19 triggered changes were perceived to have a negative impact by 26.1% of respondents. Refusal of future telemedicine visits was by 17.2%, however, 75.2% would prefer to use both in-person and telemedicine visits. CONCLUSION: During the initial COVID-19 surge with lockdown, the majority of survey respondents were following public health precautions. However, there were significant concerns amongst women related to obstetric and gynecologic medical appointments scheduled during that period. During pandemics, natural disasters and similar extreme circumstances, digital communication and telemedicine have the potential to play a critical role in providing reassurance and care. Nevertheless, given the concerns expressed by survey respondents, communication and messaging tools are needed to increase comfort and ensure equity with the rapidly changing methods of care delivery.","Abu-Rutum, Reem S; Bright, Melissa; Moawad, Nash; Webur-LeBrun, Emily; Roussos-Ross, Kay; Christman, Gregory; Rhoton-Vlasak, Alice; Smulian, John C",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,224
255389,Risk factors for mortality in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Bolivia: An analysis of the first 107 confirmed cases,2020,"BACKGROUND: Early identification of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at high risk of mortality is of vital importance for appropriate clinical decision making and delivering optimal treatment. We aimed to develop and validate a clinical risk score for predicting mortality at the time of admission of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Collaborating with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), we established a prospective consecutive cohort of 5,628 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to 120 hospitals in Korea between January 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020. The cohort was randomly divided using a 7:3 ratio into a development (n = 3,940) and validation (n = 1,688) set. Clinical information and complete blood count (CBC) detected at admission were investigated using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive risk score (COVID-Mortality Score). The discriminative power of the risk model was assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The incidence of mortality was 4.3% in both the development and validation set. A COVID-Mortality Score consisting of age, sex, body mass index, combined comorbidity, clinical symptoms, and CBC was developed. AUCs of the scoring system were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.91) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93) in the development and validation set, respectively. If the model was optimized for > 90% sensitivity, accuracies were 81.0% and 80.2% with sensitivities of 91.7% and 86.1% in the development and validation set, respectively. The optimized scoring system has been applied to the public online risk calculator (https://www.diseaseriskscore.com). CONCLUSION: This clinically developed and validated COVID-Mortality Score, using clinical data available at the time of admission, will aid clinicians in predicting in-hospital mortality.","Her, Ae Young; Bhak, Youngjune; Jun, Eun Jung; Yuan, Song Lin; Garg, Scot; Lee, Semin; Bhak, Jong; Shin, Eun Seok",J Korean Med Sci,,224

258103,Meta-analysis Comparing Outcomes in Patients With and Without Cardiac Injury and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19),2020,"Student's t test is valid for statistical inference under the normality assumption or asymptotically. By contrast, although the bootstrap t test was proposed in 1993, it is seldom adopted in medical research. We aim to demonstrate that the bootstrap t test outperforms Student's t test under normality in data. Using random data samples from normal distributions, we evaluated the testing performance, in terms of true-positive rate (TPR) and false-positive rate and diagnostic abilities, in terms of the area under the curve (AUC), of the bootstrap t test and Student's t test. We explore the AUC of both tests with varying sample size and coefficient of variation. We compare the testing outcomes using the COVID-19 serial interval (SI) data in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, China, for demonstration. With fixed TPR, the bootstrap t test maintained the equivalent accuracy in TPR, but significantly improved the true-negative rate from the Student's t test. With varying TPR, the diagnostic ability of bootstrap t test outperformed or equivalently performed as Student's t test in terms of the AUC. The equivalent performances are possible but rarely occur in practice. We find that the bootstrap t test outperforms by successfully detecting the difference in COVID-19 SI, which is defined as the time interval between consecutive transmission generations, due to sex and non-pharmaceutical interventions against the Student's t test. We demonstrated that the bootstrap t test outperforms Student's t test, and it is recommended to replace Student's t test in medical data analysis regardless of sample size.","Zhao, Shi; Yang, Zuyao; Musa, Salihu S; Ran, Jinjun; Chong, Marc K C; Javanbakht, Mohammad; He, Daihai; Wang, Maggie H",Epidemiol Infect,,224
258636,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed safety measures in every industry, including the construction industry Thus, the construction companies have instituted safety measures at the construction sites to curve the disease's spread among the workforce This paper aims to examine the challenges encountered by construction firms in implementing COVID-19 safety measures at construction sites Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research approach was adopted for this study using open-ended interview questions to solicit data from 19 construction professionals currently working on a construction project in South Africa Content analysis with the assistance of an Excel spreadsheet was used to analyse the data collected Findings The findings indicate that there are numerous challenges such as ignorance of COVID-19, the supply of poor personal protective equipment (PPEs) by contractors, lack of compliance, sanitising construction materials, difficulty in sharing tools and equipment, public transport usage by workers, superstition (COVID-19 is for a particular group of people), complying with social distancing rules, among others in the implementation of the COVID-19 safety measure at the construction site to curb the spread of the disease among the workers These challenges have, therefore, hampered their effort to strictly adhere to the safety measures in accordance with the COVID-19 safety protocol at the project sites currently under construction Research limitations/implications The interviewees were construction professionals working in the South African construction industry during the COVID-19 period Practical implications The implication is that, due to the challenges faced in implementing the COVID-19 safety measures, workers on the construction site are not adequately protected from contracting COVID-19 The workers may thus contract the disease at the project sites and transmit it to their families and vice versa, which may have further implications on the spread of the disease within the communities and society Originality/value The study has identified implementation challenges of the COVID-19 safety measures at construction sites of which the construction stakeholders must institute measures to overcome since COVID-19 has become part of our daily life The study also recommends some preventive measures to the owners of construction companies to help overcome or minimise these COVID-19 safety implementation hurdles to minimise the spread of the disease among the construction site workers","Amoah, Christopher Simpeh Fredrick",Journal of Facilities Management,,224
258686,Diabetic ketoacidosis precipitated by atypical coronavirus disease in a newly diagnosed diabetic girl,2021,"In this paper, we present our system design for conducting recurring daily studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We implement this system to conduct a study into touch dynamics, and present our experiences, challenges and lessons learned from doing so. Study participants installed our application on their Apple iOS phones and completed two tasks daily for 31 days. Each task involves performing a series of scrolling or swiping gestures, from which behavioral information such as movement speed or pressure is extracted. Taking place over a time period of 31 days, our study utilized a self-contained app which workers used to complete daily tasks without requiring extra HITs. This differs somewhat from the typical rapid completion of one-off tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk. This atypical use of the platform prompted us to study aspects related to long-term user retention over the study period: payment schedule (amount and structure over time), regular notifications, payment satisfaction and overall satisfaction. We also investigate the specific concern of reconciling informed consent with workers' desire to complete tasks quickly. We find that using the Mechanical Turk platform in this way leads to data of comparable quality to that of lab based studies, and that our study design choices show a statistically significant effect in keeping workers engaged.","Turner, Henry; Eberz, Simon; Martinovic, Ivan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12675v1.pdf,224
258829,The rapid transformation of cardiac surgery practice in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: insights and clinical strategies from a centre at the epicentre,2020,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis is having a large impact on acute and chronic cardiac care. Due to public health measures and the reorganisation of outpatient cardiac care, traditional centre-based cardiac rehabilitation is currently almost impossible. In addition, public health measures are having a potentially negative impact on lifestyle behaviour and general well-being. Therefore, the Working Group of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation of the Dutch Society of Cardiology has formulated practical recommendations for the provision of cardiac rehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic, by using telerehabilitation programmes without face-to-face contact based on current guidelines supplemented with new insights and experiences.","Kemps, H M C; Brouwers, R W M; Cramer, M J; Jorstad, H T; de Kluiver, E P; Kraaijenhagen, R A; Kuijpers, P M J C; van der Linde, M R; de Melker, E; Rodrigo, S F; Spee, R F; Sunamura, M; Vromen, T; Wittekoek, M E",Neth Heart J,,224
259037,Ventricular arrhythmia burden during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,2021,"Children and adolescents account for ~ 13% of total COVID-19 cases in the United States. However, little is known about the nature of the illness in children. The reopening of schools underlines the importance of understanding the epidemiology of pediatric COVID-19 infections. We sought to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes in pediatric COVID-19 patients. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from healthcare organizations in the United States. The study outcomes (hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, critical care) were assessed using logistic regression. The subgroups of sex and race were compared after propensity score matching. Among 12,306 children with lab-confirmed COVID-19, 16.5% presented with respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), 13.9% had gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), 8.1% had dermatological symptoms (rash), 4.8% had neurological (headache), and 18.8% had other non-specific symptoms (fever, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia and disturbances of smell or taste). In the study cohort, the hospitalization frequency was 5.3%, with 17.6% needing critical care services and 4.1% requiring mechanical ventilation. Following propensity score matching, the risk of all outcomes was similar between males and females. Following propensity score matching, the risk of hospitalization was greater in non-Hispanic Black (RR 1.97 [95% CI 1.49-2.61]) and Hispanic children (RR 1.31 [95% CI 1.03-1.78]) compared with non-Hispanic Whites. In the pediatric population infected with COVID-19, a substantial proportion were hospitalized due to the illness and developed adverse clinical outcomes.","Parcha, Vibhu; Booker, Katherine S; Kalra, Rajat; Kuranz, Seth; Berra, Lorenzo; Arora, Garima; Arora, Pankaj",Sci Rep,,224

259257,Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals Extend ICU Capacity for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Response and Recovery,2020,"The sudden appearance of the enormously threatening COVID19 virus with its subsequent more infectious mutations challenged the very foundations of practically all countries around the world. It also prompted me to broaden the scope of reflecting on the age-old problem of ""life and death"". Amidst our growing knowledge of living entities it soon became clear that the cell is the smallest living entity -- exceeding the largest macromolecule by about 1 000 times. By the end of the 18th century viruses were discovered and they appeared to be entities intermediate between nonliving and living entities. From a philosophical perspective it opened the way to many intriguing questions directed at the boundaries of our knowledge. One question is how do we describe the diversity of things, properties and processes which we experience in our daily lives. Already in Greek culture we encounter theoretical approaches that opted for the exploration of just one mode of explanation. It gave rise to two opposing monistic orientations: panmechanism and panvitalism. Underlying this opposition there lurks a straightforward basic question, namely What is a plant? We argue that without prior knowledge of the difference between material things, plants and animals it would not even be possible to commence studying plants. The hypothetical transition from material configurations to truly living entities over a vast period of time is problematic because the long timespan, in fact, conceals an unsolved problem, namely the abrupt moment of transition -- the change from one moment to the next from nonliving to being alive. Assuming the simultaneous appearance of protein and DNA caused new unsolved problems. Attention is also given to elements of the question concerning what is matter, indicative of the unavoidable foundation of living entities. After some brief reflections on the various realms found in nature, elements of our earlier remarks about mechanistic and organistic approaches are connected to some problematic modern views. Simpson is correct in his criticism of the expression ""molecular biology"" because molecules, as such, are not alive. Von Bertalanffy expands on this issue with his remark that these processes are different in a living, sick or dead dog;but the laws of physics do not differentiate, being indifferent to whether or not dogs are alive or dead. That the physical substrate of living things contains its own distinct problems, steered our analysis into a slightly different direction. Finally, contemplating the multifaceted nature of the process of dying is followed up by looking at some constitutional issues and some implications for human rights.

259863,Low-molecular-weight heparin dosing and anti-xa level monitoring in critically ill COVID-19 adults,2021,"The recent pandemic associated with SARS-CoV-2, a virus of the Coronaviridae family, has resulted in an unprecedented number of infected people. The highly contagious nature of this virus makes it imperative for us to identify promising inhibitors from pre-existing antiviral drugs. Two druggable targets, namely 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) were selected in this study due to their indispensable nature in the viral life cycle. 3CLpro is a cysteine protease responsible for the proteolysis of replicase polyproteins resulting in the formation of various functional proteins, whereas 2'-O-MTase methylates the ribose 2'-O position of the first and second nucleotide of viral mRNA, which sequesters it from the host immune system. The selected drug target proteins were screened against an in-house library of 123 antiviral drugs. Two promising drug molecules were identified for each protein based on their estimated free energy of binding (&#916;G), the orientation of drug molecules in the active site and the interacting residues. The selected protein-drug complexes were then subjected to MD simulation, which consists of various structural parameters to equivalently reflect their physiological state. From the virtual screening results, two drug molecules were selected for each drug target protein [Paritaprevir (&#916;G = -9.8 kcal/mol) & Raltegravir (&#916;G = -7.8 kcal/mol) for 3CLpro and Dolutegravir (&#916;G = -9.4 kcal/mol) and Bictegravir (&#916;G = -8.4 kcal/mol) for 2'-OMTase]. After the extensive computational analysis, we proposed that Raltegravir, Paritaprevir, Bictegravir and Dolutegravir are excellent lead candidates for these crucial proteins and they could become potential therapeutic drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

Testing enables quick identification of cases, which results in effective contact tracing and containment of virus spread. Faced with a lack of surge capacity in the public health laboratory system at the start, health officials implemented changes to testing and laboratory infrastructure to significantly expand testing capacity to include 1) the centralization of resources; and 2) the integration of private and independent labs into the COVID-19 testing program. With these changes, testing capacity has grown from approximately 4,000/day in March to 32,000/day by the end of August, 2020. Eligibility criteria for testing has expanded to increase sensitivity and include testing of asymptomatic individuals. Along with previous outbreaks, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for integration of testing surge capacity in public health systems before outbreaks occur. This paper details the development and implementation of a COVID-19 testing program in Ontario from January 2020 to September 2020 during the first-wave of the pandemic.

261276,Comparing Rapid Scoring Systems in Mortality Prediction of Critically Ill Patients With Novel Coronavirus Disease,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Diabetes is one of the most frequent comorbidities in people with COVID-19 with a prevalence that varies between 7 and 30%. Diabetics infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a higher rate of hospital admission, severe pneumonia, and higher mortality compared to non-diabetic subjects. Chronic hyperglycemia can compromise innate and humoral immunity. Furthermore, diabetes is associated with a low-grade chronic inflammatory state that favors the development of an exaggerated inflammatory response and therefore the appearance of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Recent evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of causing direct damage to the pancreas that could worsen hyperglycemia and even induce the onset of diabetes in previously non-diabetic subjects. Therapeutic strategies should be aimed at facilitating patient access to the healthcare system. Control of blood glucose and comorbidities must be individualized in order to reduce the incidence of complications and decrease the burden on health systems. In this article we will review the pathophysiological mechanisms that explain the bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus, its implication in the prognosis and management of hyperglycemia in this group of patients.","Lima-Martínez, Marcos M; Carrera Boada, Carlos; Madera-Silva, Marialaura D; Marín, Waleskha; Contreras, Miguel",Clin. investig. arterioscler.

Methods: From December 2018 to March 2019, 10 inpatients with mild and 10 inpatients with severe influenza pneumonia admitted to the Department of Infection and Clinical Microbiology of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital were included. Clariom&#8482; D gene chip was used to explore the circRNA expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from the patients. The absolute value of the fold change (FC value)>2 and P<0.05 were used as the criteria to screen the differentially expressed circRNA, and the gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome database (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, KEGG) signal pathway enrichment analysis were also performed. Results: The age of mild patients [M (P25, P75)] was 62.0 (34.5, 69.8) years old, including 4 males; the age of severe patients [M (P25, P75)] was 50.0 (37.0, 60.0) years old, all were males. A total of 137 differentially expressed circRNAs in PBMCs of mild and severe patients were screened. The numbers of up-regulated and down-regulated circRNAs in mild patients were 101 and 36, respectively. Among them, hsa_circ_0091073 (FC value=160.898, P<0.05) was the most significantly up-regulated circRNA and hsa_circ_0092219 (FC value =-17.630, P<0.05) was the most significantly down-regulated circRNA. GO enrichment analysis showed that a total of 111 secondary GO items were significantly associated with related differential expression of circRNA (P<0.05). The GO terms associated with upregulated circRNAs included DNA-templated transcription, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase â ¡ promoter, etc.; The GO terms associated with downregulated circRNAs included neutrophil degranulation, killing of cells of other organism, defense response to fungus, etc. KEGG signaling pathway analysis showed that there were 37 metabolic pathways related to differentially expressed circRNAs (P<0.05). Signaling pathways related to up-regulated circRNAs included nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, etc. Signaling pathways related to down-regulation of circRNAs included cancer transcription disorders, folate carbon pool, and other types of O-glycan biosynthesis. Conclusion: The expression of circRNA in PBMC of mild and severe influenza pneumonia patients is significantly different, and it may play a role in the pathogenic mechanism of influenza pneumonia through multiple signal pathways.","Yin, Y D; Cao, D; Shen, H; Feng, S H; Chen, X; Yang, C X; Gu, L",Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,,224
275494,Psychological Impacts of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the First Nationwide Lockdown in Vietnam: An Internet-based Survey,2020,"Determinants of COVID-19 clinical severity are commonly assessed by transverse or longitudinal studies of the fatality counts. However, the fatality counts depend both on disease clinical severity and transmissibility, as more infected also lead to more deaths. Moreover, fatality counts (and related measures such as Case Fatality Rate) are dynamic quantities, as they appear with a delay to infections, while different geographic regions generally belong to different points on the epidemics curve. Instead, we use epidemiological modeling to propose a disease severity measure, which accounts for the underlying disease dynamics. The measure corresponds to the ratio of population averaged mortality and recovery rates (m/r). It is independent of the disease transmission dynamics (i.e., the basic reproduction number) and has a direct mechanistic interpretation. We use this measure to assess demographic, medical, meteorological and environmental factors associated with the disease severity. For this, we employ an ecological regression study design and analyze different US states during the first disease outbreak. Principal Component Analysis, followed by univariate and multivariate analyses based on machine learning techniques, is used for selecting important predictors. Without using prior knowledge from clinical studies, we recover significant predictors known to influence disease severity, in particular age, chronic diseases, and racial factors. Additionally, we identify long-term pollution exposure and population density as not widely recognized (though for the pollution previously hypothesized) predictors of the disease severity. Overall, the proposed measure is useful for inferring severity determinants of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, and the obtained results may aid a better understanding of COVID-19 risks.","Markovic, Sofija; Rodic, Andjela; Salom, Igor; Milicevic, Ognjen; Djordjevic, Magdalena; Djordjevic, Marko",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00038v1.pdf,224

DesignObservational cross-sectional study assessed by logistic regression and mean prevalence margins. SettingCOVID-19 vaccinations delivered in England from 08 December 2020 - 17 May 2021. Participants30,624,257/ 61,967,781 (49.4%) and 17,360,045/ 61,967,781 (28.1%) individuals in England were recorded as vaccinated in the National Immunisation Management System with a first dose and a second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, respectively. InterventionsVaccination status with COVID-19 vaccinations. Main Outcome MeasuresProportion, adjusted odds ratios and mean prevalence margins for individuals not vaccinated with dose 1 among those aged 50-69 years old and dose 1 and 2 among those aged 70 years old and above. ResultsAmong individuals aged 50 years and above, Black/African/Caribbean ethnic group was the least likely of all ethnic groups to be vaccinated with dose 1 of the COVID-19 vaccine. However, among those aged 70 years and above, the odds of not having dose 2 was 5.53 (95% CI 5.42 to 5.63) and 5.36 (90% CI 5.29 to 5.43) greater among Pakistani and Black/African/Caribbean compared to White British ethnicity, respectively. The odds of not receiving dose 2 was 1.18 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.20) higher among individuals who lived in a care home compared to those who did not. This was the opposite to that observed for dose 1, where the odds of not being vaccinated was significantly higher among those not living in a care home (0.89 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.91)). ConclusionsWe found that there are characteristics associated with low COVID-19 vaccine coverage. Inequalities, such as ethnicity are a major contributor to suboptimal coverage and tailored interventions are required to improve coverage and protect the population from SARS-CoV-2. Article summaryO_ST_ABSStrengths and Limitations of this studyC_ST_ABSO_LIThis is the is the first study assessing characteristics associated with COVID-19 vaccine coverage for all individuals aged 50 years and above in England.

Due to its anti-apoptotic activity, Bcl-xL co-determines the viability of various virally infected cells. Their survival may determine the effectiveness of viral replication and spread, dynamics of systemic infection, and viral pathogenesis. In this paper, we have reviewed the role of Bcl-xL in the context of host infection by eight different RNA and DNA viruses: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus (IAV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1), Maraba virus (MRBV), Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and coronavirus (CoV). We have described an influence of viral infection on the intracellular level of Bcl-xL and discussed the impact of Bcl-xL-dependent cell survival control on infection-accompanying pathogenic events such as tissue damage or oncogenesis. We have also presented anti-viral treatment strategies based on the pharmacological regulation of Bcl-xL expression or activity.","Wyzewski, Zbigniew; Switlik, Weronika; Mielcarska, Matylda Barbara; Gregorczyk-Zboroch, Karolina Paulina",Int. j. mol. sci.

Previously, two critical biological parameters of the pathogen and the host–pathogen interaction—incubation period and broadly protective, relative immunogenicity—were proposed to account for much of the past successes in vaccine development, and to be useful in estimating the “certainty of success” of developing an effective vaccine for viral pathogens for which a vaccine currently does not exist. In considering the “certainty of success” in development of human coronavirus vaccines, particularly SARS-CoV-2, a third, related critical parameter is proposed—infectious inoculum intensity, at an individual-level, and force of infection, at a population-level. Reducing the infectious inoculum intensity (and force of infection, at a population-level) is predicted to lengthen the incubation period, which in turn is predicted to reduce the severity of illness, and increase the opportunity for an anamnestic response upon exposure to the circulating virus. Similarly, successfully implementing individual- and population-based behaviors that reduce the infectious inoculum intensity and force of infection, respectively, while testing and deploying COVID-19 vaccines is predicted to increase the “certainty of success” of demonstrating vaccine efficacy and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease, death, and the pandemic itself.","Kaslow, David C.",npj Vaccines,,224

282084,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and global mental health,2021,"OBJECTIVES: One major goal of the emergency department (ED) is to decide, whether patients need to be hospitalised or can be sent home safely. We aim at providing criteria for these decisions without knowing the SARS-CoV-2 test result in suspected cases. SETTING: Tertiary emergency medicine. PARTICIPANTS: All patients were treated at the ED of the Charité during the pandemic peak and underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. Patients with positive test results were characterised in detail and underwent a 14-day-follow-up. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses were performed to identify predictors (primary endpoint), which confirm safe discharge. The clinical endpoint was all-cause mortality or need for mechanical ventilation during index stay or after readmission. RESULTS: The primary test population of suspected COVID-19 consisted of n=1255 cases, 45.2% were women (n=567). Of these, n=110 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (8.8%). The median age of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases was 45 years (IQR: 33-66 years), whereas the median age of the group tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 was 42 years (IQR: 30-60 years) (p=0.096). 43.6% were directly admitted to hospital care.CART analysis identified the variables oxygen saturation (<95%), dyspnoea and history of cardiovascular (CV) disease to distinguish between high and low-risk groups. If all three variables were negative, most patients were discharged from ED, and the incidence of the clinical endpoint was 0%. The validation cohort confirmed the safety of discharge using these variables and revealed an incidence of the clinical endpoint from 14.3% in patients with CV disease, 9.4% in patients with dyspnoea and 18.2% in patients with O2 satuaration below 95%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on easily available variables like dyspnoea, oxygen saturation, history of CV disease, approximately 25% of patients subsequently confirmed with COVID-19 can be identified for safe discharge.

Person-to-person transmission is accepted but WHO only considers aerosol transmission when procedures or support treatments that produce aerosol are performed. Transmission mechanisms are not fully understood and there is evidence for an airborne route to be considered, as the virus remains viable in aerosols for at least 3 h and that mask usage was the best intervention to prevent infection. Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC) are used as a primary infection disease control measure. However, if not correctly used, they may contribute to the transmission/spreading of airborne diseases as proposed in the past for SARS. The authors believe that airborne transmission is possible and that HVAC systems when not adequately used may contribute to the transmission of the virus, as suggested by descriptions from Japan, Germany, and the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. Previous SARS outbreaks reported at Amoy Gardens, Emergency Rooms and Hotels, also suggested an airborne transmission. Further studies are warranted to confirm our hypotheses but the assumption of such way of transmission would cause a major shift in measures recommended to prevent infection such as the disseminated use of masks and structural changes to hospital and other facilities with HVAC systems.","Correia, G; Rodrigues, L; Gameiro da Silva, M; Gonçalves, T",Med Hypotheses,,224

It remains unclear to what extent the pandemic endangers the safety of kidney transplantation programs. In this study, we evaluated the short-term outcomes of our patients receiving a kidney transplant during the first phase and compared them with patients who received a kidney transplant immediately before the coronavirus pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study includes 34 kidney transplant recipients between October 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020. Nineteen patients from the phase immediately prior to the first coronavirus wave (pre-corona group), and 15 patients from the phase of the first coronavirus wave (corona group) were studied. We retrospectively evaluated demographic data, postoperative short-term outcomes and complications, immunosuppression regime, coronavirus infection status, and behavior during the first phase of the pandemic. RESULTS: There were no differences between the 2 groups regarding short-term outcomes and postoperative complications or in immunosuppressive medication. After the introduction of intensified hygienic conditions and routine swabs prior to transplantation, no nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred. In the outpatient setting, none of the patients developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The majority of patients performed voluntary quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term outcomes after kidney transplantation during the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic were comparable to pre-pandemic patients, and no SARS-CoV-2-associated death or transplant failure occurred in our small cohort. We considered patient compliance with hygiene and self-isolation measures very high. Nevertheless, in further phases of the pandemic, the continuation of the living kidney donation program must be critically evaluated.","Laessle, Claudia; Schneider, Johanna; Pisarski, Przemyslaw; Fichtner-Feigl, Stefan; Jänigen, Bernd",Transplant. proc,,224

Rational use requires: (1) modification of the clozapine package insert worldwide to include lower doses for Asians and to avoid the lethality associated with pneumonia, (2) the use of clozapine levels for personalizing dosing, and (3) the use of slow and personalized titration. This may make clozapine as safe as possible and contribute to increased life expectancy and well-being. In the absence of data on COVID-19 in clozapine patients, clozapine possibly impairs immunological mechanisms and may increase pneumonia risk in infected patients. Psychiatrists should call their clozapine patients and families and explain to them that if the patient develops fever or flu-like symptoms, the psychiatrist should be called and should consider halving the clozapine dose. If the patient is hospitalized with pneumonia, the treating physician needs to assess for symptoms of clozapine intoxication since halving the dose may not be enough for all patients; consider decreasing it to one-third or even stopping it. Once the signs of inflammation and fever have disappeared, the clozapine dose can be slowly increased to the prior dosage level.","de Leon, Jose; Ruan, Can-Jun; Schoretsanitis, Georgios; De Las Cuevas, Carlos",Psychother Psychosom,,224

Whilst COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out for mass vaccination, the modest number of antivirals in use or development for any disease bears testament to the challenges of antiviral development. We recently showed that non-cytotoxic levels of thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ ATPase pump, induces a potent host innate immune antiviral response that blocks influenza A virus replication. Here we show that TG is also highly effective in blocking the replication of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), common cold coronavirus OC43, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in immortalized or primary human cells. TG's antiviral performance was significantly better than remdesivir and ribavirin in their respective inhibition of OC43 and RSV. Notably, TG was just as inhibitory to coronaviruses (OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) and influenza viruses (USSR H1N1 and pdm 2009 H1N1) in separate infections as in co-infections. Post-infection oral gavage of acid-stable TG protected mice against a lethal influenza virus challenge. Together with its ability to inhibit the different viruses before or during active infection, and with an antiviral duration of at least 48 h post-TG exposure, we propose that TG (or its derivatives) is a promising broad-spectrum inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2, OC43, RSV and influenza virus.","Al-Beltagi, Sarah; Preda, Cristian Alexandru; Goulding, Leah V; James, Joe; Pu, Juan; Skinner, Paul; Jiang, Zhimin; Wang, Belinda Lei; Yang, Jiayun; Banyard, Ashley C; Mellits, Kenneth H; Gershkovich, Pavel; Hayes, Christopher J; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan; Brown, Ian H; Liu, Jinhua; Chang, Kin-Chow",Viruses,,224

The implementation of the method inside tourist destinations can bring an important advantage in transforming a destination into a safer one in times of Covid-19 and post-Covid-19. The existing trend of shortening the tourist stay length has been accelerated while the epidemic became a pandemic. Moreover, the wariness for future pandemics has brought into spotlight the issue of overcrowded attractions inside a destination at certain moments. The method presented in this paper proposes a backtracking algorithm, more precisely an adaptation of the travelling salesman problem. The method presented is aimed to facilitate the navigation inside a destination and to revive certain less-visited sightseeing spots inside a destination while facilitating conformation with the social distancing measures imposed for Covid-19 control.","Păcurar, Cristina Maria Albu Ruxandra-Gabriela Păcurar Victor Dan",Sustainability,,224
297580,Coronavirus Disease 2019 in French Residential Care Facilities: A Nationwide Study,2021,"A small proportion (<5%) of overall COVID-19 cases reported in the EU/EEA and the UK are among children (those aged 18 years and under). When diagnosed with COVID-19, children are much less likely to be hospitalised or have fatal outcomes than adults. Children are more likely to have a mild or asymptomatic infection, meaning that the infection may go undetected or undiagnosed. When symptomatic, children shed virus in similar quantities to adults and can infect others in a similar way to adults. It is unknown how infectious asymptomatic children are. While very few significant outbreaks of COVID-19 in schools have been documented, they do occur, and may be difficult to detect due to the relative lack of symptoms in children. In general, the majority of countries report slightly lower seroprevalence in children than in adult groups, however these differences are small and uncertain. More specialised studies need to be performed with the focus on children to better understand infection and antibody dynamics. Investigations of cases identified in school settings suggest that child to child transmission in schools is uncommon and not the primary cause of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children whose onset of infection coincides with the period during which they are attending school, particularly in preschools and primary schools. If appropriate physical distancing and hygiene measures are applied, schools are unlikely to be more effective propagating environments than other occupational or leisure settings with similar densities of people. There is conflicting published evidence on the impact of school closure/re-opening on community transmission levels, although the evidence from contact tracing in schools, and observational data from a number of EU countries suggest that re-opening schools has not been associated with significant increases in community transmission. Available evidence also indicates that closures of childcare and educational institutions are unlikely to be an effective single control measure for community transmission of COVID-19 and such closures would be unlikely to provide significant additional protection of children's health, since most develop a very mild form of COVID-19, if any. Decisions on control measures in schools and school closures/openings should be consistent with decisions on other physical distancing and public health response measures within the community. The aim of this document is to provide an overview of the epidemiology and disease characteristics of COVID-19 in children (0-18 years) in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), and an assessment of the role of childcare (preschools;ages 0-<5 years) and educational (primary and secondary schools;ages 5-18 years) settings in COVID19 transmission.",,COVID-19 in children and the role of school settings in COVID-19 transmission|2020. 31 pp. 103 ref.,,224

Objective: To investigate the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the environmental surfaces of an ophthalmology examination room after visits by patients who were asymptomatic and had passed COVID-19 triage. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a quality improvement study conducted 1 week after the first officially confirmed COVID-19 case in Izmir Tepecik Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey, on March 20, 2020. A triage system was used to determine the risk of COVID-19 from patients who were asymptomatic and presented for examination in an ophthalmology clinic. Real-time polymerase chain reaction testing was used to detect the presence of viral RNA material in samples from the biomicroscope stage, slitlamp breath shield, phoropter, tonometer, and door handles. The first group of samples was taken before the beginning of the examinations, and the second group of the samples was taken after the last patient had left the room. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was the presence of viral material on surfaces in 5 circular zones with a diameter of 1 m each around where the patients sat. Results: Thirty-one persons visited the room, of whom 22 underwent ophthalmic examination and 9 were companions. The mean (SD) examination time was 9 (4) minutes (range, 5-13 minutes). Seven samples were taken before examinations and 7 after examinations. Two samples that were taken after examinations were found to be positive for COVID-19, 1 from the slitlamp breath shield and 1 from the phoropter. Conclusions and Relevance: This study showed the presence of COVID-19 viral material in a circle 1 m in diameter around where the patients sat. However, real-time polymerase chain reaction could only detect viral material, not the infectivity of these virus samples.","Aytogan, Hasan; Ayintap, Emre; Özkalay Yilmaz, Nisel",JAMA Ophthalmol,,224
300678,Diabetes management by either telemedicine or clinic visit improved glycemic control during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic state of emergency in Japan,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is not only common within paediatrics but is associated with critical childhood metabolic morbidity such as obesity, cardiovascular disease and glucose tolerance impairment. Increasing evidence suggests an association between childhood OSA and metabolic syndrome such as markers of cardiovascular disease, systemic hypertension, glucose intoleranceand increased lipid profile. Recent studies have targeted changes in metabolic markers in children using non-invasive ventilation (NIV) but no systematic reviews are available to summarise this emerging evidence. The purpose of this systematic review is to provide systematic synthesis of the evidence on the effect of NIV use on metabolic markers in children with OSA. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic search of electronic databases and grey literature will include paediatric interventional studies (random controlled trials, cohort studies) with and without a comparison group. Two reviewers will independently undertake the two step process of title/abstract and full-text screening. Data will be extracted and assessed, with aggregate data being reported. When the data allow, meta-analysis will be performed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: There are no ethical concerns with this systematic review, as data have previously been published. This review will inform clinicians taking care of children with OSA and obesity/metabolic syndrome about the potential effects of NIV therapies on metabolic markers and has the potential to change the approach to childhood OSA and obesity. Results of this systematic review will be submitted for dissemination in abstract and manuscript form.","Gerdung, Christopher; Rodriguez-Lopez, Sara; Palkowski, Stefan; Keto-Lambert, Diana; Sebastianski, Meghan; Castro Codesal, Maria Luisa",BMJ Open,,224

304643,Risk factors for acute kidney injury in covid-19 patients: A systematic review,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruption to the delivery of both routine and urgent healthcare needs in many institutions across the globe. Vascular access (VA) for haemodalysis (HD) is considered the patient's lifeline and its maintenance is essential for the continuation of a life saving treatment. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the provision of VA for dialysis was already constrained. Throughout the pandemic, inevitably, many patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not received timely intervention for VA care. This could have a detrimental impact on dialysis patient outcomes in the near future and needs to be addressed urgently. Many societies have issued prioritisation to allow rationing based on clinical risk, mainly according to estimated urgency and need for treatment. The recommendations recently proposed by the European and American Vascular Societies in the COVID-19 pandemic era regarding the triage of various vascular operations into urgent, emergent and elective are debatable. VA creation and interventions maintain the lifeline of complex HD patients, and the indication for surgery and other interventions warrants patient-specific clinical judgement and pathways. Keeping the use of central venous catheters at a minimum, with the goal of creating the right access, in the right patient, at the right time, and for the right reasons, is mandatory. These strategies may require local modifications. Risk assessments may need specific ""renal pathways"" to be developed rather than applying standard surgical risk stratification. In conclusion, in order to recover from the second wave of COVID-19 and prepare for further phases, the provision of the best dialysis access, including peritoneal dialysis, will require working closely with the multidisciplinary team involved in the assessment, creation, cannulation, surveillance, maintenance, and salvage of definitive access.","Basile, Carlo; Lomonte, Carlo; Combe, Christian; Covic, Adrian; Kirmizis, Dimitrios; Liakopoulos, Vassilios; Mitra, Sandip",J Nephrol,,224

Patients The study participants consisted of 7 crewmembers of the passenger cruise-liner, Diamond Princess, who were admitted to our hospital after becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 aboard the ship. Methods The data on patient background and biochemical test results were obtained from the patients' medical records. All patients had a chest X-ray, and a throat swab and sputum samples were sent for culture on admission. Results The median age of the 7 patients, of whom 4 were male and 3 were female, was 39 years (range: 23-47 years). On admission, none of them had fever, but 4 (57%) had a cough. None of them showed any signs of organ damage on laboratory testing. Chest X-ray showed pneumonia in one individual, which resolved spontaneously, while the other 6 had normal chest X-ray findings. Culture of throat swabs and sputum samples revealed that 4 patients (57%) had bacterial upper respiratory infections (Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus). The period from a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to negative conversion ranged from 5 to 13 days, with a median of 8 days. Conclusion Healthy young adults without risk factors who acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection may have an asymptomatic infection or may experience mild COVID-19. In addition to obesity, an older age, underlying illness, and being overweight can lead to a risk of exacerbation; thus, hospital management for such individuals may be desirable. Culturing respiratory samples may be useful for diagnosing secondary bacterial pneumonia.","Hoshiyama, Takayuki; Wada, Tatsuhiko; Nihonyanagi, Shin; Kameda, Ryo; Yamaoka-Tojo, Minako; Fukuda, Michinari; Ako, Jyunya; Yamaoka, Kunihiro; Takayama, Yoko",Intern Med,,224

306458,Incidence and mortality risk in coronavirus disease 2019 patients complicated by acute cardiac injury: systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has occupied the world agenda since December 2019 With no effective treatment yet, vaccination seems to be the most effective method of prevention Recently developed vaccines have been approved for emergency use only and are currently applied to large populations Considering both the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatological diseases (AIIRDs) and the immunosuppressive drugs used in treatment, vaccination for COVID-19 deserves special attention in such patients In this article, we aimed to give simple messages to the clinicians for COVID-19 vaccination in patients with AIIRDs based upon the current evidence regarding the use of other vaccines in this patient group For this purpose, we conducted a ""Pubmed search"" using the following keywords: Influenza, Hepatitis B, Pneumococcal, and Shingles vaccines and the frequently used conventional and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) Likewise, an additional search was performed for the COVID-19 immunization in patients with AIIRDs and considering such drugs In summary, patients with AIIRDs should also be vaccinated against COVID-19, preferably when disease activity is under control and when there is no concurrent infection Low-degree immunosuppression does not appear to decrease antibody responses to vaccines Ideally, vaccinations should be done before the initiation of any biological DMARDs Patients receiving rituximab should be vaccinated at least 4 weeks before or 6 months after treatment Since tofacitinib may also reduce antibody responses, especially in combination with methotrexate, it may be appropriate to discontinue this drug before vaccination and to restart after 14 days of immunization Key points * COVID-19 vaccinations should preferably be made during remission in patients with autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatological diseases * Low-degree immunosuppression may not interfere with antibody response to vaccines * Ideally, vaccinations should be made before the initiation of any biological DMARDs * Timing of vaccination is especially important in the case of rituximab","Soy, M.; Keser, G.; Atagunduz, P.; Mutlu, M.

Several antivirals are being investigated for symptomatic COVID-19 but no definitive data support their clinical use. Remdesivir appears to result in favorable outcomes with shortened time to recovery and a modest decrease in mortality for hospitalized patients in compassionate use series and some randomized controlled trials. Currently, remdesivir is available only from the US government via an emergency use authorization process. A randomized controlled trial of lopinavir/ritonavir demonstrated no apparent clinical or virologic benefit and drug-drug interactions and side effects further limit its utility. Antivirals to treat influenza (oseltamivir) have limited activity against SARS-CoV-2, but favipiravir and umifenovir, two influenza antivirals available internationally, may have distinct viral targets and require further investigation. Antivirals with evidence of clinical activity must be studied as treatment and prophylaxis for those at high risk for severe COVID-19.","Srinivas, Pavithra; Sacha, Gretchen L; Koval, Christine",Clevel. clin. j. med,,224

Pregnancy places the women in a unique immune scenario which may allow severe COVID-19 disease. In this regard, the potential unknown effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on mothers and fetuses have attracted considerable attention. There is no clear consistent evidence of the changes in the immune status of pregnant women after recovery from COVID-19. In this study, we use multiparameter flow cytometry and Luminex assay to determine the immune cell subsets and cytokines, respectively, in the peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood from pregnant women recovering from COVID-19 about 3 months (n=5). Our results showed decreased percentages of Tc2, Tfh17, memory B cells, virus-specific NK cells, and increased percentages of naive B cells in the peripheral blood. Serum levels of IL-1ra and MCP-1 showed a decreased tendency in late recovery stage (LRS) patients. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in immune cell subsets in the umbilical cord blood. The placentas from LRS patients showed increased CD68+ macrophages infiltration and mild hypoxic features. The inflammatory damage of the placenta may be related to the antiviral response. Since the receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, utilized by SARS-CoV-2 are not co-expressed in the placenta, so it is extremely rare for SARS-CoV-2 to cause infection through this route and the impact on the fetus is negligible.","Zhao, Sijia; Xie, Ting; Shen, Li; Liu, Hong; Wang, Liling; Ma, Xixiang; Wu, Jianli; Yuan, Shuiqiao; Mor, Gil; Liao, Aihua",Front Immunol,,224
320701,A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol examining the clinical characteristics and epidemiological features of olfactory dysfunction (OD) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2021,"BACKGROUND: The current gold standard in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnostics is the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. Alternatively, nasal swab (NS) or saliva swab (SS) specimens are used, although available data on test accuracy are limited. We examined the diagnostic accuracy of NPS/NS/SS samples for this purpose. METHODS: Ten patients were included after being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in NPS samples according to the National Institute of Infectious Disease guidelines. In comparison with this conventional diagnostic method, NPS/NS/SS samples were tested using the cobas 6800 systems RT-PCR device. To investigate the usefulness of the cobas method and the difference among sample types, the agreement and sensitivity were calculated. Five to six samples were collected over a total period of 5-6 d from each patient. RESULTS: Fifty-seven sets of NPS/NS/SS samples were collected, of which 40 tested positive for COVID-19 by the conventional method. Overall, the concordance rates using the conventional method were 86.0%/70.2%/54.4% for NPS/NS/SS samples (cobas); however, for samples collected up to and including on Day 9 after disease onset (22 negative and one positive specimens), the corresponding rates were 95.7%/87.0%/65.2%. The overall sensitivity estimates were 100.0%/67.5%/37.5% for NPS/NS/SS samples (cobas). For samples up to 9 d after onset, the corresponding values were 100.0%/86.4%/63.6%. CONCLUSIONS: NS samples are more reliable than SS samples and can be an alternative to NPS samples. They can be a useful diagnostic method in the future.","Tsujimoto, Yoshie; Terada, Junko; Kimura, Moto; Moriya, Ataru; Motohashi, Ayano; Izumi, Shinyu; Kawajiri, Kazuki; Hakkaku, Kazuo; Morishita, Momoko; Saito, Susumu; Takumida, Hiroshi; Watanabe, Hiromu; Tsukada, Akinari; Morita, Chie; Yamaguchi, Yoh; Katsuno, Takashi; Kusaba, Yusaku; Sakamoto, Keita; Hashimoto, Masao; Suzuki, Manabu; Takasaki, Jin; Hojo, Masayuki; Miyoshi-Akiyama, Tohru; Sugiyama, Haruhito",Infect Dis (Lond),,224

We aimed to describe the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among children and adult staff in summer schools. METHODS: During July 2020 we prospectively recruited children and adult staff attending summer schools in Barcelona who had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Primary SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified through: (1) surveillance program in 22 summer schools' of 1905 participants, involving weekly saliva sampling for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR during 2-5 weeks; (2)cases identified through the Catalonian Health Surveillance System of children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. All centres followed prevention protocols: bubble groups, hand washing, facemasks and conducting activities mostly outdoors. Contacts of a primary case within the same bubble were evaluated by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. Secondary attack rates and effective reproduction number in summer schools(R*) were calculated. RESULTS: Among the over 2000 repeatedly screened participants, 30children and 9adults were identified as primary cases. A total of 253 close contacts of these primary cases were studied (median 9 (IQR 5-10) for each primary case), among which twelve new cases (4.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The R* was 0.3, whereas the contemporary rate in the general population from the same areas in Barcelona was 1.9. CONCLUSIONS: The transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection among children attending school-like facilities under strict prevention measures was lower than that reported for the general population. This suggests that under preventive measures schools are unlikely amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and supports current recommendations for school opening.","Jordan, Iolanda; de Sevilla, Mariona Fernandez; Fumado, Victoria; Bassat, Quique; Bonet-Carne, Elisenda; Fortuny, Claudia; Garcia-Miquel, Aleix; Jou, Cristina; Adroher, Cristina; Casas, María Melé; Girona-Alarcon, Mònica; Garcia, María Hernández; Tomas, Gemma Pons; Ajanovic, Sara; Arias, Sara; Balanza, Núria; Baro, Bárbara; Millat-Martinez, Pere; Varo, Rosauro; Alonso, Sergio; Álvarez-Lacalle, Enric; López, Daniel; Claverol, Joana; Cubells, Marta; Brotons, Pedro; Codina, Anna; Cuadras, Daniel; Bruijning-Verhagen, Patricia; Faust, Saul; Munro, Alasdair; Muñoz-Almagro, Carmen; Català, Martí; Prats, Clara; Garcia-Garcia, Juan José; Gratacós, Eduard",Clin. infect. dis,,224

328533,"Emerging adults' intersecting experiences of food insecurity, unsafe neighbourhoods and discrimination during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak",2020,"OBJECTIVE: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals have developed visitor restriction policies in order to mitigate spread of infection. We reviewed hospital visitor restriction policies for consistency and to develop recommendations to highlight fair and transparent restrictions, exceptions, and appeals in policy development and implementation. DESIGN: Collection and analysis of public-facing visitor restriction policies during the first 3 months of the pandemic. SETTING: General acute care hospitals representing 23 states across all 4 major regions of the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of the 70 largest hospitals by total bed capacity. MEASUREMENTS: Characteristics of visitor restriction policies including general visitor restriction statement, changes/updates to policies over time, exceptions to policies, and restrictions specific to COVID-19-positive patients. RESULTS: Sixty-five of the 70 hospitals reviewed had public-facing visitor restriction policies. Forty-nine of these 65 policies had general ""no-visitor"" statements, whereas 16 allowed at least 1 visitor to accompany all patients. Sixty-three of 65 hospitals included exceptions to their visitor restriction policies. Setting-specific exceptions included pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, emergency department, behavioral health, inpatient rehabilitation, surgery, and outpatient clinics. Exceptions that applied across settings included patients at end of life and patients with disabilities. CONCLUSION: Visitor restriction policies varied significantly among hospitals in this review. These variances create challenges in that their fair application may be problematic and ethical issues related to allocation may arise. Five recommendations are offered for hospitals revising or creating such policies, including that offering transparent, accessible, public-facing policies can minimize ethical dilemmas. In addition, hospitals would benefit from communicating with each other in the development of visitor policies to ensure uniformity and support patients and family members as they navigate hospital visitation.","Jaswaney, Rohit; Davis, Arlene; Cadigan, R Jean; Waltz, Margaret; Brassfield, Elizabeth R; Forcier, Bex; Joyner, Benny L",J. public health manag. pract.

329164,"A multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of hydroxychloroquine and a retrospective study in adult patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)",2020,"Background: Development of a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials for COVID-19 is urgent because of the pandemic wreaking havoc worldwide and the heterogeneity of outcomes in clinical trials. Methods: A preliminary list of outcomes was developed after a systematic review of protocols of clinical trials for COVID-19. Then, two rounds of the Delphi survey were conducted. Stakeholders were traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) experts, Western medicine (WM) experts, nurses, and the public. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were also invited to participate in a questionnaire written in understandable language. Then different stakeholders participated in a consensus meeting by video conference to vote. Results: Ninety-seven eligible study protocols were identified from 160 clinical trials. Seventy-six outcomes were identified from TCM clinical trials and 126 outcomes were identified from WM clinical trials. Finally, 145 outcomes were included in the first round of the Delphi survey. Then, a COS for clinical trials of TCM and WM was developed. The COS included clinical outcomes (recovery/improvement/progression/death), etiology (SARS-CoV-2 nucleic-acid tests, viral load), inflammatory factor (C-reactive protein), vital signs (temperature, respiration), blood and lymphatic-system parameters (lymphocytes, virus antibody), respiratory outcomes (pulmonary imaging, blood oxygen saturation, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, arterial blood gas analysis, mechanical ventilation, oxygen intake, pneumonia severity index), clinical efficacy (prevalence of preventing patients with mild-to-moderate disease progressing to severe disease), and symptoms (clinical symptom score). Outcomes were recommended according to different types of disease. Outcome measurement instruments/definitions were also recommended. Conclusion: Though there are some limitations for the research, such as insufficient patients and the public involvement, and the unbalanced stakeholders' region, the COS for COVID-19 may improve consistency of outcome reporting in clinical trials. It also should be updated with research progression.","Qiu, Ruijin; Zhao, Chen; Liang, Tengxiao; Hao, Xuezeng; Huang, Ya; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Chen, Zhao; Wei, Xuxu; Zhao, Mengzhu; Zhong, Changming; Hu, Jiayuan; Li, Min; Han, Songjie; He, Tianmai; Sun, Yang; Chen, Jing; Shang, Hongcai",Front.

This paper investigates school operational status data sources during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing self-report data collected nationally on the household level through a Facebook-based survey with data collected at district and county levels throughout the country. The percentage of households reporting in-person instruction within each county is compared to the district and county data at the state and county levels. The results show high levels of consistency between the sources at the state level and for large counties. The consistency levels across sources support the usage of the Facebook-based COVID-19 Symptom Survey as a source to answer questions about the educational experiences, factors, and impacts related to K-12 education across the nation during the pandemic.","Lupton-Smith, Carly; Goicoechea, Elena Badillo; Collins, Megan; Lessler, Justin; Grabowski, M.

Previously, we showed that MST2 overexpression activates Estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in the absence of a ligand. Here, we examined the role of MST2 in the growth of ER-positive MCF-7 cells. Cell cycle, apoptosis, and mammosphere formation assay method were implemented to detect the biological effects of MST2 ablation on the growth of MCF-7 cells in vitro. The effect of MST2-siRNA on MCF-7 cells tumor growth in vivo was studied in tumor-bearing mouse model. Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis was used to determine the effect of MST2 on overall survival in breast cancer patients. MST2 overexpression increased cell viability marginally. The ablation of MST2 using siRNA dramatically suppressed the viability of the MCF-7 cells, but not ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, MST2 knockdown increased caspase-dependent apoptosis and led to decreased mammosphere formation. Treatment of MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice with MST2 siRNA significantly inhibited tumor growth. The tumor weight was reduced further when tamoxifen was added. Patients with ER-positive breast cancer with low MST2 expression had better overall survival than did those with high MST2 expression in Kaplan-Meier survival analyses using public datasets. Our results provide new insight into the role of MST2, a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway, in mediating breast cancer progression.","Park, Joonwoo; Kim, Ga Hee; Lee, Jeonggeun; Phuong, Bui Thi Chau; Kong, Byounguk; Won, Ji Eun; Won, Gun Woo; Lee, Yong Hee; Han, Hee Dong; Lee, YoungJoo",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,,224

331968,"Short-range forecasting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during early onset at county, health district, and state geographic levels: Comparative forecasting approach using seven forecasting methods",2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women bear considerable physical and psychological stress because of their special conditions, which combined with other stress factors such as violence, makes their situation even more critical. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of domestic violence and its relationship with quality of life in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed with the participation of 250 pregnant women in the obstetrics clinic of 29-Bahman Hospital, Tabriz city. Using a three-part questionnaire consisting of the socio-demographic and obstetrics information, the domestic violence questionnaire developed by WHO, and the SF-12 quality of life questionnaire, the required information was collected. A general linear model was then used to determine the relationship between domestic violence and quality of life, while adjusting the socio-demographic and obstetrics information. RESULTS: According to the data, more than one-third of pregnant women (35.2 %) had experienced domestic violence. The most common type of violence experienced was emotional violence (32.8 %), followed by sexual violence (12.4 %), and physical violence (4.8 %). The mean score of the physical health department of quality of life in the group of women exposed to violence (50.21) was lower compared to the unexposed group (53.45), though there was no significant difference between them (P = 0.25). However, the mean score of the mental health department of quality of life in women exposed to violence (46.27) was significantly lower compared to unexposed women (61.17) (P < 0.001). Based on the general linear model, the mean score for quality of life in the mental health dimension was significantly higher among unexposed women compared to those exposed to violence (ß = 9.3, 95 %CI: 3.5 to 15.0, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate a high prevalence of domestic violence and its relationship with a low quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the findings signify the importance of screening pregnant women in terms of domestic violence in respective centers as well as the necessity of conducting proper interventions to address domestic violence to improve the quality of life in women.","Naghizadeh, Somayyeh; Mirghafourvand, Mojgan; Mohammadirad, Roghaye",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,224

Although the pathology is not yet fully understood, hyperinflammatory response and coagulation disorders leading to congestions of microvessels are considered to be key drivers of the still-increasing death toll. Until now, physical changes of blood cells have not been considered to play a role in COVID-19 related vascular occlusion and organ damage. Here, we report an evaluation of multiple physical parameters including the mechanical features of five frequent blood cell types, namely erythrocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils. More than four million blood cells of 17 COVID-19 patients at different levels of severity, 24 volunteers free from infectious or inflammatory diseases, and 14 recovered COVID-19 patients were analyzed. We found significant changes in lymphocyte stiffness, monocyte size, neutrophil size and deformability, and heterogeneity of erythrocyte deformation and size. Although some of these changes recovered to normal values after hospitalization, others persisted for months after hospital discharge, evidencing the long-term imprint of COVID-19 on the body.","Kubánková, Markéta; Hohberger, Bettina; Hoffmanns, Jakob; Fürst, Julia; Herrmann, Martin; Guck, Jochen; Kräter, Martin",Biophys J,,224

339441,A successful case of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment for intractable pneumothorax in a patient with COVID‐19,2020,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has become a public health emergency in China. Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great efforts to control this disease. As surgeons specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice. For the patients with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to rule out NCP. Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for patients with fever (>37.3â), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days. Prevention measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should also be enhanced because false negative is possible. Medical instruments should be properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC). Surgical operation should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special period.Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed. For malignant tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor therapy should be selected with higher priority. Neoadjuvant therapy is highly recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage &#8805; 2/rectal cancer T stage &#8805; 3/unresectable colon cancer). Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to relieve the symptoms. Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply. For colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also creates a better condition for subsequent surgery. Transcatheter arterial embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with bleeding. However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail. All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to the local CDC department. All invasive intervention must be performed in a designated isolation area. Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent respiratory droplet transmission. Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower digestive tract surgery. Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is necessary. Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP. Single-room isolation and related examinations should be performed according to the standard procedures. We believe that with the unprecedentedly joint efforts of doctors and patients, we will eventually win this war against NCP.","Chen, Y H; Peng, J S",Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi,,224

In this work, in order to acquire further SAR insights for this class of compounds and identify more potent derivatives, we designed and synthesized additional series of analogues to investigate the role of the substituents around the TZP core. To this aim, we developed four facile and efficient one-step procedures for the synthesis of 5-phenyl-, 6-phenyl- and 7-phenyl-2-amino-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, and 2-amino-5-phenyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-ol. Two analogues having the ethyl carboxylate moiety at the C-2 position of the TZP were also prepared in good yields. Then, the scaffolds herein synthesized and two previous scaffolds were functionalized and evaluated for their anti-IAV activity, leading to the identification of compound 22 that showed both anti-PA-PB1 (IC50 = 19.5 µM) and anti-IAV activity (EC50 = 16 µM) at non-toxic concentrations, thus resulting among the most active TZP derivatives reported to date by us. A selection of the synthesized compounds, along with a set of in-house available analogues, was also tested against SARS-CoV-2.

360474,A cross-sectional study of screening for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the pediatric emergency department in Vilnius during the first wave of the pandemic,2021,"Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is a widely distributed polymer found from bacteria to animals, including marine species. This polymer exhibits morphogenetic as well as antiviral activity and releases metabolic energy after enzymatic hydrolysis also in human cells. In the pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the platelets are at the frontline of this syndrome. Platelets release a set of molecules, among them polyP. In addition, the production of airway mucus, the first line of body defense, is impaired in those patients. Therefore, in this study, amorphous nanoparticles of the magnesium salt of polyP (Mg-polyP-NP), matching the size of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were prepared and loaded with the secondary plant metabolite quercetin or with dexamethasone to study their effects on the respiratory epithelium using human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells as a model. The results revealed that both compounds embedded into the polyP nanoparticles significantly increased the steady-state-expression of the MUC5AC gene. This mucin species is the major mucus glycoprotein present in the secreted gel-forming mucus. The level of gene expression caused by quercetin or with dexamethasone, if caged into polyP NP, is significantly higher compared to the individual drugs alone. Both quercetin and dexamethasone did not impair the growth-supporting effect of polyP on A549 cells even at concentrations of quercetin which are cytotoxic for the cells. A possible mechanism of the effects of the two drugs together with polyP on mucin expression is proposed based on the scavenging of free oxygen species and the generation of ADP/ATP from the polyP, which is needed for the organization of the protective mucin-based mucus layer.","Neufurth, Meik; Wang, Xiaohong; Wang, Shunfeng; Schröder, Heinz C; Müller, Werner E G",Mar. drugs,,224

Despite the generosity of health workers, we are undergoing a severe humanitarian crisis that is stressing every aspect of daily life. From outside it is very hard to understand, because houses are closed for lockdown and are not destroyed as they would be in an earthquake. An outbreak is not ""only"" a sudden mass lethal incident, like a natural disaster, neither ""only"" a disease, to be treated by doctors, but a social phenomenon too. Historical and social elements are key factors for development (for example, intensive promiscuity between animals and humans) and spread of an epidemic (for example, health workers and ambulance rapidly become vector of the virus). Can medical responsibility change in times of pandemic? My answer, as anaesthetist and intensive care physician from Bergamo, is yes. When the global medical community is called on to face a pandemic of unprecedented scale, with little scientific evidence and ""crazy numbers"" describing the situation, honest and forthcoming advocacy is an ethical duty.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational survey analysis in OAB treated patients was performed. The women showed a greater than 50% improvement during specific therapy for OAB. Population had previously completed bladder diary, OAB-Q symptom, OAB HRQL scale, SF-36 and PGI-I questionnaires. Four weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures, these women were invited to complete the same questionnaires by e-mail for new evaluation during Covid-19 outbreak. Primary endpoint was changes in number of voids/24h, urgent micturitions/24h, urinary incontinence events/24h, nocturia events. Secondary endpoints were the assessment of the change in the OAB-SF, SF-36 questionnaires and PGI-I satisfaction. RESULTS: Six hundred seventy-three patients were considered. The mean age was 63.21 ± 10.24 years. Four weeks after the start of the social distancing measures, the increase in mean number of voids/24h (7.13 ± 1.08 vs 9.76 ± 2.12, p < 0.0001), urgent micturition episodes/24h (2.65 ± 1.11 vs 4.57 ± 1.28, p < 0.0001), nocturia episodes (1.19 ± 1.21 vs 2.83 ± 0.94, p < 0.0001) was observed. The OAB symptom scores (32.67 ± 12.88 vs 51.23 ± 12.11, p < 0.0001), OAB-HRQL (75.45 ± 12.76 vs 48.23 ± 10.34, p < 0.0001), and SF-36 (82.15 ± 11.78 vs 69.39 ± 10.85, p < 0.0001) changed significantly. The satisfaction decreased significantly at the PGI-I during the Covid-19 period 79.8% vs 45% (p < 0.0001).

361857,COVID-19 pneumonia following double-sleeve lobectomy for lung cancer,2020,"CONTEXT: During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, several studies have described a distinctive cutaneous manifestation with a clinical picture resembling chilblains or chilblain lupus in young patients. OBJECTIVE: To report the histopathological description of a series of chilblain-like lesions appearing in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. DESIGN: The study included 13 patients with cutaneous acral lesions resembling chilblains occurring in the setting of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection with available skin biopsy. RESULTS: Two main histopathological patterns were observed: a chilblain-like histopathological pattern (10 cases out of 13, 77%) and a thrombotic vasculopathy pattern (3 cases out of 13, 23% of cases). The chilblain-like histopathological pattern featured a superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes of varying intensity. This infiltrate was sometimes peri-eccrine and alterations of eccrine glands were present in most cases. Vacuolar alteration of the basal layer of the epidermis was found in a majority of patients. Lichenoid interface dermatitis was rarely present. The thrombotic vasculopathy pattern featured an absent or mild inflammatory infiltrate, multiple intraluminal fibrin thrombi and ischemic epidermal necrosis. In both patterns, no true vasculitis was observed. No patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction possibly due to the fact that these lesions may represent late cutaneous manifestations of the disease or are associated with an early effective immune response. CONCLUSION: The relationship of chilblain-like lesions to SARS-CoV-2 requires further investigations. Histopathological features mimic chilblains, chilblain lupus and less frequently a thrombotic vasculopathy. Response to viral infection might trigger diverse mechanisms leading to the two histopathological patterns described.","Sohier, Pierre; Matar, Stéphanie; Meritet, Jean-François; Laurent-Roussel, Sara; Dupin, Nicolas; Aractingi, Selim",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

However, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has received unprecedented attention internationally. Monitoring pathogenic CoVs in environmental compartments has been proposed as a promising strategy in preventing the environmental spread and tracing of infectious diseases, but a lack of reliable and efficient detection techniques is still a significant challenge. Moreover, the lack of information regarding the monitoring methodology may pose a barrier to primary researchers. Here, we provide a systematic introduction focused on the detection of CoVs in various environmental matrices, comprehensively involving methods and techniques of sampling, pretreatment, and analysis. Furthermore, the review addresses the challenges and potential improvements in virus detection techniques for environmental surveillance.","Yao, Linlin; Zhu, Wenting; Shi, Jianbo; Xu, Tailin; Qu, Guangbo; Zhou, Wenhua; Yu, Xue-Feng; Zhang, Xueji; Jiang, Guibin",Chem Soc Rev,,224

A retrospective cohort study,2021,"One of the most notable global transportation trends is the accelerated pace of development in vehicle automation technologies. Uncertainty surrounds the future of automated mobility as there is no clear consensus on potential adoption patterns, ownership versus shared use status and travel impacts. Adding to this uncertainty is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that has triggered profound changes in mobility behaviors as well as accelerated the adoption of new technologies at an unprecedented rate. This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on willingness to adopt the emerging new technology of self-driving vehicles. Using data from a survey disseminated in June 2020 to 700 respondents in contiguous United States, we perform a difference-in-difference regression to analyze the shift in willingness to use autonomous vehicles as part of a shared fleet before and during the pandemic. The results reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic has a positive and highly significant impact on consideration of autonomous vehicles. This shift is present regardless of techsavviness, gender or political views. Individuals who are younger, left-leaning and frequent users of shared modes of travel are expected to become more likely to use autonomous vehicles once offered. Understanding the effects of these attributes on the increase in consideration of AVs is important for policy making, as these effects provide a guide to predicting adoption of autonomous vehicles - once available - and to identify segments of the population likely to be more resistant to adopting AVs.","Said, Maher; Zajdela, Emma R.; Stathopoulos, Amanda",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01615v1.pdf,224

364076,Mental health status of medical staff during the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Post-viral olfactory dysfunction is well established and has been shown to be a key symptom of COVID-19 with more than 66% of European and US patients reporting some degree of loss of smell. Persistent olfactory dysfunction appears to be commonplace and will drive the demand for general practitioner, otolaryngology or neurology consultation in the next few months - evidence regarding recovery will be essential in counselling our patients. METHODS: This was a prospective survey-based data collection and telemedicine follow-up. RESULTS: In total, 751 patients completed the study, of whom 477 were females and 274 males. The mean age of the patients was 41 ± 13 years (range 18-60). There were 621 patients (83%) who subjectively reported a total loss of smell and 130 (17%) a partial loss. After a mean follow-up of 47 ± 7 days (range 30-71) from the first consultation, 277 (37%) patients still reported a persistent subjective loss of smell, 107 (14%) reported partial recovery and 367 (49%) reported complete recovery. The mean duration of the olfactory dysfunction was 10 ± 6 days (range 3-31) in those patients who completely recovered and 12 ± 8 days (range 7-35) in those patients who partially recovered. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, at this relatively early point in the pandemic, subjective patterns of recovery of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients are valuable for our patients, for hypothesis generation and for treatment development.","Chiesa-Estomba, C M; Lechien, J R; Radulesco, T; Michel, J; Sowerby, L J; Hopkins, C; Saussez, S",Eur. j. neurol,,224
364198,Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic and economic impact,2020,"Objective: To explore the value of using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to detect pathogens in burn patients and acute or chronic wound patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. From March 2019 to June 2020, 11 burn patients and acute or chronic wound patients (including 10 males and 1 female, aged 23 to 85 years) in the Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital were conformed to the inclusion criteria. A total of 23 specimens were collected, including 6 whole blood specimens, 1 skin tissue specimen, 1 drained pus specimen, and 15 wound secretion swab specimens. Each specimen was divided into two parts, one for microbial culture identification and the other for mNGS detection. The number and types of pathogens detected by the microbial culture and mNGS were recorded, and the consistency of the two methods were compared. Data were statistically analyzed with paired Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: With the microbial culture method, in all the 23 specimens, pathogens were not detected in 5 specimens, and 35 pathogens were detected in the remaining 18 specimens, belonging to 9 species of bacteria and 2 species of fungi. A single pathogen was detected in 5 specimens, 2 pathogens were detected in 9 specimens, and 3 pathogens were detected in 4 specimens. With the mNGS method, in all the 23 specimens, no pathogen was detected in 1 specimen, 75 pathogens were detected in the remaining 22 specimens, belonging to 28 species of bacteria, 3 species of fungi, and 3 species of viruses. A single pathogen was detected in 8 specimens, 2 pathogens were detected in 5 specimens, 3 pathogens were detected in 2 specimens, 4 pathogens were detected in 3 specimens, 6 pathogens were detected in 2 specimens, and 1 specimen each with 7 and 20 pathogens detected. The number of pathogens detected in each specimen by microbial culture method was 2(1, 2), which was significantly less than 2(1,4) by mNGS method (Z=3.359, P<0.01). In 5 specimens, no bacteria were detected by microbial culture method, while bacteria and virus were detected by mNGS method in each 2 specimens. Among the 14 specimens with two or more types of pathogens detected by mNGS method, the relative abundance of bacteria in the first place ranged from 28.8% to 95.9%. Of all the 23 specimens, 7 (30.4%) of the two methods had completely the same results, 5 (21.7%) of the results were completely inconsistent, and 11 (47.8%) of the results were not completely the same. Conclusions: Compared with the traditional microbial culture method, the mNGS method has higher detection sensitivity and stronger ability to detect pathogens, and can determine the main pathogens of mixed infections. As a supplement to the culture method, the mNGS method is expected to play an important role in the diagnosis of burn and acute or chronic wound infection.","Li, F; Yin, K N; Hu, Q; Zhang, Q X; Chen, Q; Yang, L L; Chen, X; Sun, Y J",Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi,,224

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, an essential factor in viral pathogenesis, is recognized as a prospective therapeutic target in drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2. To tackle this pandemic, Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs are being screened against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro via in silico and in vitro methods to detect the best conceivable drug candidates. However, identification of natural compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro potential have been recommended as rapid and effective alternative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic development. Thereof, a total of 653 natural compounds were identified against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro from NP-lib database at MTi-OpenScreen webserver using virtual screening approach. Subsequently, top four potential compounds, i.e. 2,3-Dihydroamentoflavone (ZINC000043552589), Podocarpusflavon-B (ZINC000003594862), Rutin (ZINC000003947429) and Quercimeritrin 6""-O-L-arabinopyranoside (ZINC000070691536), and co-crystallized N3 inhibitor as reference ligand were considered for stringent molecular docking after geometry optimization by DFT method. Each compound exhibited substantial docking energy >-12 kcal/mol and molecular contacts with essential residues, including catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) and substrate binding residues, in the active pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro against N3 inhibitor. The screened compounds were further scrutinized via absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion - toxicity (ADMET), quantum chemical calculations, combinatorial molecular simulations and hybrid QM/MM approaches. Convincingly, collected results support the potent compounds for druglikeness and strong binding affinity with the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Hence, selected compounds are advocated as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and can be utilized in drug development against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bharadwaj, Shiv; Dubey, Amit; Yadava, Umesh; Mishra, Sarad Kumar; Kang, Sang Gu; Dwivedi, Vivek Dhar",Brief Bioinform,,224
365105,"Temperature, Humidity, and Latitude Analysis to Estimate Potential Spread and Seasonality of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)",2020,"COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized in multiple countries, and more are under rapid development. Careful design of a vaccine prioritization strategy across sociodemographic groups is a crucial public policy challenge given that 1) vaccine supply will be constrained for the first several months of the vaccination campaign, 2) there are stark differences in transmission and severity of impacts from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across groups, and 3) SARS-CoV-2 differs markedly from previous pandemic viruses. We assess the optimal allocation of a limited vaccine supply in the United States across groups differentiated by age and essential worker status, which constrains opportunities for social distancing. We model transmission dynamics using a compartmental model parameterized to capture current understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, including key sources of group heterogeneity (susceptibility, severity, and contact rates). We investigate three alternative policy objectives (minimizing infections, years of life lost, or deaths) and model a dynamic strategy that evolves with the population epidemiological status. We find that this temporal flexibility contributes substantially to public health goals. Older essential workers are typically targeted first. However, depending on the objective, younger essential workers are prioritized to control spread or seniors to directly control mortality. When the objective is minimizing deaths, relative to an untargeted approach, prioritization averts deaths on a range between 20,000 (when nonpharmaceutical interventions are strong) and 300,000 (when these interventions are weak). We illustrate how optimal prioritization is sensitive to several factors, most notably, vaccine effectiveness and supply, rate of transmission, and the magnitude of initial infections.","Buckner, Jack H; Chowell, Gerardo; Springborn, Michael R",Proc.

367983,Key Highlights From the Canadian Thoracic Society Position Statement on the Optimization of Asthma Management During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a more comprehensive description of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a novel syndrome linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, by conducting a systematic analysis of studies from different settings that used various inclusion criteria. STUDY DESIGN: MIS-C studies were identified by searching PubMed and Embase as well as preprint repositories and article references to identify studies of MIS-C cases published from April 25, 2020, through June 29, 2020. MIS-C study metadata were assessed and information on case demographics, clinical symptoms, laboratory measurements, treatments, and outcomes were summarized and contrasted between studies. RESULTS: Eight studies were identified representing a total of 440 MIS-C cases. Inclusion criteria varied by study: 3 studies selected patients diagnosed with Kawasaki disease, 2 required cardiovascular involvement, and 3 had broader multisystem inclusion criteria. Median age of patients by study ranged from 7.3 to 10 years, and 59% of patients were male. Across all studies, the proportion of patients with positive results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests ranged from 13% to 69% and for serology, from 75% to 100%. Patients with MIS-C had high prevalence of gastrointestinal (87%), dermatologic/mucocutaneous (73%), and cardiovascular (71%) symptoms. Prevalence of cardiovascular, neurologic, and respiratory system involvement significantly differed by study inclusion criteria. All studies reported elevated C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and fibrinogen levels for at least 75% of patients in each study. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review of MIS-C studies assists with understanding this newly identified syndrome and may be useful in developing a refined, universal case definition of MIS-C.","Abrams, Joseph Y; Godfred-Cato, Shana E; Oster, Matthew E; Chow, Eric J; Koumans, Emilia H; Bryant, Bobbi; Leung, Jessica W; Belay, Ermias D",J. pediatr.

Investigating the potential association of climate and seasonality with the spread of this infection could aid in preventive and surveillance strategies. Objective: To examine the association of climate with the spread of COVID-19 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study examined climate data from 50 cities worldwide with and without substantial community spread of COVID-19. Eight cities with substantial spread of COVID-19 (Wuhan, China; Tokyo, Japan; Daegu, South Korea; Qom, Iran; Milan, Italy; Paris, France; Seattle, US; and Madrid, Spain) were compared with 42 cities that have not been affected or did not have substantial community spread. Data were collected from January to March 10, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Substantial community transmission was defined as at least 10 reported deaths in a country as of March 10, 2020. Climate data (latitude, mean 2-m temperature, mean specific humidity, and mean relative humidity) were obtained from ERA-5 reanalysis. Results: The 8 cities with substantial community spread as of March 10, 2020, were located on a narrow band, roughly on the 30° N to 50° N corridor. They had consistently similar weather patterns, consisting of mean temperatures of between 5 and 11 °C, combined with low specific humidity (3-6 g/kg) and low absolute humidity (4-7 g/m3). There was a lack of substantial community establishment in expected locations based on proximity. For example, while Wuhan, China (30.8° N) had 3136 deaths and 80â¯757 cases, Moscow, Russia (56.0° N), had 0 deaths and 10 cases and Hanoi, Vietnam (21.2° N), had 0 deaths and 31 cases. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the distribution of substantial community outbreaks of COVID-19 along restricted latitude, temperature, and humidity measurements was consistent with the behavior of a seasonal respiratory virus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 90 women aged 18 - 45 years (mean age - 33.9 ± 0.31) were recruited in the study: 60 women with UF were included in the study group and 30 healthy women were included in the control group. The lymphocyte count was performed with laser-based flow cytofluorimetry. The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interferon IFN-ß (IFN-ß), interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), tumor necrotizing factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF basic) were detected with ELISA test. The diagnosis of UF was confirmed with histological examination of biopsy specimen. RESULTS: Typical clinical features of UF (abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pains, symptoms of adjacent organs compression) were found in 66.67% women in the study group while 18.33% of them had miscarriages and 26.67% had infertility. Women with UF had significantly higher absolute count of lymphocytes: CD3+, CD19+, CD16+CD56+, CD4+, CD8+, CD95+CD3+, proinflammatory mediators: TNF-&#945;, IFN-ß, CRP, FGF basic and decreased levels of IFN-Î³ compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: In women of reproductive age, typical symptoms of UF are associated with reproductive failure with activation of adaptive immunity, angiogenic factors, inflammatory cell reactions, deficit of human antitumor factors, that is why detection of TNF-&#945;, Ð¡Ð Ð, IFN-Î³ in serum is necessary to perform in pregravid preparation of women, including IVF program.","Sevostyanova, Olga; Lisovskaya, Tatiana; Chistyakova, Gusel; Kiseleva, Marina; Sevostyanova, Natalia; Remizova, Irina; Buev, Yuri",Gynecol Endocrinol,,224

The approach, the diagnosis and management can be changed in the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic era. This review has focused on: i) the current understanding of digestive involvement in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected children and adolescents and the clinical implications of COVID-19 for pediatric gastroenterologists, ii) the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical approach to patients with pre-existing or onset diseases, including diagnosis and treatment, and iii) the role and limited access to the instrumental diagnosis such as digestive endoscopy. To date, it is unclear if immunosuppression in patients with IBD and chronic liver disease represents a risk factor for adverse outcomes. Scheduled outpatient follow-up visits may be postponed, especially in patients in remission. Conversely, telemedicine services are strongly recommended. The introduction of new therapeutic regimens should be made on an individual basis, discussing the benefits and risks with each patient. Furthermore, psychological care in all children with chronic disease and their parents should be ensured. All non-urgent and elective endoscopic procedures may be postponed as they must be considered at high risk of viral transmission. Finally, until SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is not available, strict adherence to standard social distancing protocols and the use of personal protective equipment should continue to be recommended.","Dipasquale, Valeria; Passanisi, Stefano; Cucinotta, Ugo; Cascio, Antonio; Romano, Claudio",Ital J Pediatr,,224

Scientists, medical professionals, and other stakeholders are racing against time to find and develop effective medicines for COVID-19. However, no drug with high efficacy to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection has been approved. With the increasing popularity of gene therapy, scientists have explored the utilization of small RNAs such as microRNAs as therapeutics. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with high affinity for the 3'-UTRs of targeted messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Interactions between host cells and viral genomes may induce the upregulation or downregulation of various miRNAs. Therefore, understanding the expression patterns of these miRNAs and their functions will provide insights into potential miRNA-based therapies. This review systematically summarizes the potential targets of miRNA-based therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection and examines the viability of possible transfection methods.","Rizkita, Leonny Dwi; Astuti, Indwiani",,,224

We conducted a systematic review to identify case reports and case series characterizing cutaneous manifestations of confirmed COVID-19. Key demographic and clinical data from each case were extracted and analyzed. The primary outcome measure was risk factor analysis of skin related outcomes for severe COVID-19 disease. Seventy-one case reports and series comprising 144 cases of cutaneous involvement in COVID-19 were included. The most frequently occurring morphologies were: morbilliform (30.6%), varicelliform (18.8%), urticarial (13.2%), chilblains-like (12.5%), and acro-ischemic (9%). The median age of patients was 51 years (mean: 45.9, range: 0 to 91). Patients with chilblains-like eruptions had lower frequencies of extracutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (5/18, 27.8%, P&lt;0.05) and were less likely to have severe COVID-19 disease (2/18, 11%, 95% CI 1.4% to 34.7%, P=0.02). Patients with livedoid and acro-ischemic morphologies had severe COVID-19 more frequently than those with other morphologies (17/21, 81%, 95% CI 58.0% to 94.5%, P&lt;0.0001). The most frequently observed cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 (morbilliform, varicelliform, and urticarial) are well-described patterns of viral exanthems. However, chilblains-like, livedoid, and acro-ischemic morphologies are not traditionally associated with viral infections and were significantly associated with severity of COVID-19 disease.","Lee, David S; Mirmirani, Paradi; McCleskey, Patrick E; Mehrpouya, Majid; Gorouhi, Farzam",Dermatol. online j,,224

The nanoparticles thus obtained presented 93% (TiO2-MW) and 92% (TiO2-US) anatase phase, and TiO2-PP 93% rutile phase. The TiO2-US sample performed best during the Prozac® photodegradation assays because of its lipophilic surface, attributable to the C-H groups therein. Additionally, adsorption rate and photodegradation were optimized by adjusting Prozac® solution to pH ~ 8. Following Prozac® photodegradation, quantitative monitoring of its by-products (PPMA, MAEB, and TFMP) was done using HPLC. This quantitative approach led us to conclude that semiconductor photoactivity cannot be discussed solely in terms of the main compound. Lastly, it was seen that these by-products compete with each other in the degradation mechanisms and are influenced by different materials.

380154,Prevalence of and Risk Factors Associated With Mental Health Symptoms Among the General Population in China During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The goals were twofold: To estimate the depression and anxiety levels among caregivers of patients with eating disorders (ED) in China during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with a control group, and to assess whether an online education program was effective in decreasing the anxiety and depression of the caregivers of patients with ED, and associated factors. METHOD: Caregivers of patients with ED (n = 254) and a comparison group of non-ED caregivers (N = 254) were recruited at baseline. Additionally, caregivers of patients with ED were invited into a free 4-week online education program, with an additional online group as support. Depression and anxiety levels were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. RESULTS: Caregivers of patients with ED showed significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety than the comparison group of non-ED caregivers. The online education program showed no significant effect on decreasing depression and anxiety levels of caregivers of patients with ED overall. Caregivers who had older loved ones and not living with them were more likely to decrease their depression levels. Caregivers of patients with longer illness duration were less likely to decrease their anxiety levels. DISCUSSION: These results showed that caregivers of ED patients suffered more serious psychological distress during the pandemic. A more structured and intensive online intervention with a limited number of participants might be required to address caregivers' distress in post-COVID-19 China.","Guo, Lei; Wu, Mengting; Zhu, Zhuoying; Zhang, Lei; Peng, Sufang; Li, Wei; Chen, Han; Fernández-Aranda, Fernando; Chen, Jue",,,224

The assessment of the impact of lockdown on air quality focused on four European Cities (Athens, Gladsaxe, Lodz and Rome). Available data on pollutant factors were obtained using global satellite observations. The level of the employed prevention measures is employed using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. The second part of the analysis employed a variety of machine learning tools, utilized for estimating the concentration of each pollutant, two days ahead. The results showed that a weak to moderate correlation exists between the corresponding measures and the pollutant factors and that it is possible to create models which can predict the behaviour of the pollutant gases under daily human activities.","Kavouras, Ioannis; Protopapadakis, Eftychios; Kaselimia, Maria; Sardis, Emmanuel; Doulamis, Nikolaos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13750v1.pdf,224

386111,Off-Site Radiology Workflow Changes Due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an international global health emergency and has posed a great challenge to mental well-being and resilience. Little is known about the mental health impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) in sub-Saharan Africa or other low-resource settings. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study between August and November 2020 among HCWs recruited from three major hospitals in Kenya. The survey questionnaire consisted of six components: demographic and work title characteristics; information regarding care of patients with COVID-19; and symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress and burnout, measured using standardised questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health disorders. RESULTS: A total of 433 (65.2% response rate) individuals participated in the survey. Median age was 32.75 years, 58.4% were females and 68.8% were front-line workers. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress and burnout were reported in 53.6%, 44.3%, 41.1%, 31.0% and 45.8% of all participants, respectively. Front-line HCWs, females and doctors were at higher risk of mental health symptoms. Nearly half of participants reported inadequate resources or training to care for patients with COVID-19, and those in the government hospital were more likely to report mental health symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This is among the first studies examining mental health outcomes among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. Similar to other studies from around the world, HCWs directly involved with patients with COVID-19 reported higher rates of mental health symptoms. Mitigating strategies specific to Kenyan HCWs are urgently needed to help them cope with mental health symptoms during the pandemic.","Shah, Jasmit; Monroe-Wise, Aliza; Talib, Zohray; Nabiswa, Alphonse; Said, Mohammed; Abeid, Abdulaziz; Ali Mohamed, Mohamed; Mohamed, Sood; Ali, Sayed K",BMJ Open,,224
387388,Critically Ill Adults With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in New Orleans and Care With an Evidence-Based Protocol,2021,"The month of Ramadan forms one of the five pillars of the Muslim faith. Adult Muslims are obligated to keep daily fasts from dawn to sunset, with exceptions. This year Ramadan is due to begin on 23 April 2020 and the longest fast in the UK will be approximately 18 hours in length. In addition, due to the often high-calorie meals eaten to break the fast, Ramadan should be seen as a cycle of fasting and feasting. Ramadan fasting can impact those with diabetes, increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and dehydration. This year, Ramadan will occur during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Reports show that diabetes appears to be a risk factor for more severe disease with COVID-19. In addition, the UK experience has shown diabetes and COVID-19 is associated with dehydration, starvation ketosis, diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state. This makes fasting in Ramadan particularly challenging for those Muslims with diabetes. Here, we discuss the implications of fasting in Ramadan during the COVID-19 pandemic and make recommendations for those with diabetes who wish to fast.","Hanif, S; Ali, S N; Hassanein, M; Khunti, K; Hanif, W",Diabet Med,,224
387476,Coronavirus disease 2019: emerging lessons from the pandemic,2020,"Background: In the absence of a vaccine, governments have focused on social distancing, self-isolation, and increased hygiene procedures to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Compliance with these measures requires voluntary cooperation from citizens. Yet, compliance is not complete. Existing research on the predictors of compliance is almost exclusively based on cross-sectional data, raising the possibility of reverse causality and confounding. Methods: Using data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a large weekly online panel of UK adults from first three months of lockdown in the UK (n = 51,600), we tested whether within-person changes in confidence in government, mental wellbeing, social experiences and awareness of COVID-19 were longitudinally related to self-reported compliance levels with guidelines from authorities using random intercept cross-lagged panel models. Findings: We found evidence of a small longitudinal association between increased confidence in government to tackle the pandemic and higher self-reported compliance, but little evidence that factors such as mental health and wellbeing, worries about future adversities, and social isolation and loneliness were related to later compliance. We found higher self-reported compliance was longitudinally related to higher depressive symptoms. We found that low compliance was related to lower leisure engagement, providing care, and working outside the home. Interpretation: Our results suggest that to effectively manage the pandemic, governments should ensure that confidence is maintained. Funding: Nuffield Foundation, Wellcome Trust and the MARCH Mental Health Network. MARCH is funded by the Cross-Disciplinary Mental Health Network Plus initiative supported by UK Research and Innovation.","Wright, L.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.",The Lancet Regional Health.

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using Medline/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar and official websites of Government of Pakistan and international organizations to identify empirical literature published in English from 2019 to June 2020. RESULTS: It was not until the end of December 2019 that the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered in Hubei province, China, with Wuhan the epicenter of it, sending the nation into an 11-week lockdown. It was the first of its kind and never seen before; hence, based on its novelty, the Chinese authorities named it novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV). Until January 23, 2020, there were only 17 cases in Wuhan, which surged to around 60,000 on February 16, 2020, with 2000 deaths.

Several guidelines on tracheostomy procedures and care of tracheostomized patients have been introduced. In addition to these guidelines, further details of the procedure and perioperative care would be helpful. The purpose of this study is to describe our experience and tracheostomy protocol for patients with MERS or COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with MERS were admitted to the ICU, 9 (69.2%) of whom underwent surgical tracheostomy. During the COVID-19 outbreak, surgical tracheostomy was performed in one of seven patients with COVID-19. We reviewed related documents and collected information through interviews with healthcare workers who had participated in designing a tracheostomy protocol. RESULTS: Compared with previous guidelines, our protocol consisted of enhanced PPE, simplified procedures (no limitation in the use of electrocautery and wound suction, no stay suture, and delayed cannula change) and a validated screening strategy for healthcare workers. Our protocol allowed for all associated healthcare workers to continue their routine clinical work and daily life. It guaranteed safe return to general patient care without any related complications or nosocomial transmission during the MERS and COVID-19 outbreaks. CONCLUSION: Our protocol and experience with tracheostomies for MERS and COVID-19 may be helpful to other healthcare workers in building an institutional protocol optimized for their own COVID-19 situation.","Choi, Sung Yong; Shin, Joongbo; Park, Woori; Choi, Nayeon; Kim, Jong Sei; Choi, Chan I; Ko, Jae-Hoon; Chung, Chi Ryang; Son, Young-Ik; Jeong, Han-Sin",Oral Oncol,,224

Using a virtual interview, we evaluated comorbidities, mobility, areas and functions where they carry out the activities, protection measures, contact history, and vaccination. According to their activities, healthcare workers were classified into the following areas: medical, nursing, other health-care personnel (researchers, nutritionists, rehabilitation, imaging, and laboratory), administrative, and other services. We compared the variables between the groups of healthcare workers with the X2 test. RESULTS: We included 812 participants. The mean age was 41 ± 11 years, and 33% were overweight or obese, 18% were over 60 years old, and 19% had high blood pressure. Medical and nursing personnel presented a higher proportion in the use of standard protection measures. CONCLUSIONS: Among healthcare workers, there are risk conditions for the development of complications in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most medical and nursing personnel use standard protective measures.","Márquez-González, Horacio; Klünder-Klünder, Miguel; de la Rosa-Zamboni, Daniela; Ortega-Riosvelasco, Fernando; López-Martínez, Briceida; Jean-Tron, Guadalupe; Chapa-Koloffon, Gina; Ávila-Hernández, A Viridiana; Garduño-Espinosa, Juan; Villa-Guillén, Mónica; Nieto-Zermeño, Jaime",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,224

Recently, it has been shown that suchPPE interferes with visual and auditory perception. Our aim was to evaluate if PPE may negatively impact colonoscopyquality. Methods Cross-sectional retrospective study comparing colonoscopy quality indicators between elective outpatient non-therapeutic colonoscopies performed between April and May 2019 and 2020 (lockdown period). We included patients aged &gt; 50 years old and excluded patients with inflammatory bowel disease, history of colon surgery or cancer (CRC). 300colonoscopies were randomly and evenly selected from the two groups. Cecal intubation rate (CIR), adenoma detection rate(ADR), mean number of polyps, adenomas and serrated sessile lesions (SSL) per colonoscopy were assessed andcompared. Results Groups were similar regarding gender, mean age and exam indication. Indications for colonoscopy were classifiedas screening (25 % vs 22 %), diagnosis (41 % vs 48 %) and post-polypectomy surveillance (33 % vs 29 %). There was nosignificant difference in CIR (90 % vs 88 %), adequate bowel preparation (70.5 % vs 70.6 %, p = 0.970) and procedureduration. Polyp, adenoma and SSL detection rates were similar in both groups (66.7 % vs 66.7 %, p = 0.999;57.4 % vs 51.4 %, p = 0.609;5.5 % vs 9.5 %, p 0.173). There was no difference in the mean number of polyps and adenomas. For polyps &lt; 5 mm the mean number was lower in 2020 (1.59 vs 1.09, p = 0,028). There was no difference in high-risk patients (19.3 %vs 21.1 % (p = 0.143) and CRC (4.7 % vs 2 %, p = 0.335). The ADR difference remained non-significant, after adjusting(multivariate analysis) for bowel preparation, intubation detection rate, endoscopist and exam duration. Conclusions In our study, the use of PPE did not influence key performance measures of colonoscopy quality.","Nascimento, C.; Ramos, L.; Frias Gomes, C.; Reves, J.; Morao, B.; Palmela, C.; Ferreira, A.; Gloria, L.",Endoscopy,,224

394396,Just the Facts: Airway management during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,2020,"Although the unprecedented efforts the world has been taking to control the spread of the human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its causative aetiology [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)], the number of confirmed cases has been increasing drastically. Therefore, there is an urgent need for devising more efficient preventive measures, to limit the spread of the infection until an effective treatment or vaccine is available. The preventive measures depend mainly on the understanding of the transmission routes of this virus, its environmental stability, and its persistence on common touch surfaces. Due to the very limited knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, we can speculate its stability in the light of previous studies conducted on other human and animal coronaviruses. In this review, we present the available data on the stability of coronaviruses (CoVs), including SARS-CoV-2, from previous reports to help understand its environmental survival. According to available data, possible airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested. SARS-CoV-2 and other human and animal CoVs have remarkably short persistence on copper, latex and surfaces with low porosity as compared to other surfaces like stainless steel, plastics, glass and highly porous fabrics. It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with diarrhoea and that it is shed in the faeces of COVID-19 patients. Some CoVs show persistence in human excrement, sewage and waters for a few days. These findings suggest a possible risk of faecal-oral, foodborne and waterborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in developing countries that often use sewage-polluted waters in irrigation and have poor water treatment systems. CoVs survive longer in the environment at lower temperatures and lower relative humidity. It has been suggested that large numbers of COVID-19 cases are associated with cold and dry climates in temperate regions of the world and that seasonality of the virus spread is suspected.","Aboubakr, Hamada A; Sharafeldin, Tamer A; Goyal, Sagar M",Transbound. emerg. dis.

We examined antibody responses in 113 COVID-19 patients and found that severe cases resulting in intubation or death exhibited increased inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and high anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody levels. Although anti-RBD immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels generally correlated with neutralization titer, quantitation of neutralization potency revealed that high potency was a predictor of survival. In addition to neutralization of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, patient sera were also able to neutralize the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 mutant D614G, suggesting cross-protection from reinfection by either strain. However, SARS-CoV-2 sera generally lacked cross-neutralization to a highly homologous pre-emergent bat coronavirus, WIV1-CoV, which has not yet crossed the species barrier. These results highlight the importance of neutralizing humoral immunity on disease progression and the need to develop broadly protective interventions to prevent future coronavirus pandemics.","Garcia-Beltran, Wilfredo F; Lam, Evan C; Astudillo, Michael G; Yang, Diane; Miller, Tyler E; Feldman, Jared; Hauser, Blake M; Caradonna, Timothy M; Clayton, Kiera L; Nitido, Adam D; Murali, Mandakolathur R; Alter, Galit; Charles, Richelle C; Dighe, Anand; Branda, John A; Lennerz, Jochen K; Lingwood, Daniel; Schmidt, Aaron G; Iafrate, A John; Balazs, Alejandro B",Cell,,224

Investigating protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between viral and host proteins can provide a better understanding of the mechanisms exploited by the virus and enable the identification of potential drug targets. We therefore performed an in-depth computational analysis of the interactome of SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins in infected HEK 293 cells published by Gordon et al. (Nature 2020, 583, 459-468) to reveal processes that are potentially affected by the virus and putative protein binding sites. Specifically, we performed a set of network-based functional and sequence motif enrichment analyses on SARS-CoV-2-interacting human proteins and on PPI networks generated by supplementing viral-host PPIs with known interactions. Using a novel implementation of our GoNet algorithm, we identified 329 Gene Ontology terms for which the SARS-CoV-2-interacting human proteins are significantly clustered in PPI networks. Furthermore, we present a novel protein sequence motif discovery approach, LESMoN-Pro, that identified 9 amino acid motifs for which the associated proteins are clustered in PPI networks. Together, these results provide insights into the processes and sequence motifs that are putatively implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection and could lead to potential therapeutic targets.","Nadeau, Rachel; Shahryari Fard, Soroush; Scheer, Amit; Hashimoto-Roth, Emily; Nygard, Dallas; Abramchuk, Iryna; Chung, Yun-En; Bennett, Steffany A L; Lavallée-Adam, Mathieu",J Proteome Res,,224

Electrochemical sensors, based on paper substrates with portable electrochemical devices, can prove an excellent alternative in mitigating the economic and public health effects of the disease. Herein, we present an impedance biosensor for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein utilizing the IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody. This label-free platform utilizing screen-printed electrodes works on the principle of redox reaction impedance of a probe and can detect antigen spikes directly in nasopharyngeal fluid as well as virus samples collected in the universal transport medium (UTM). High conductivity graphene/carbon ink is used for this purpose so as to have a small background impedance that leads to a wider dynamic range of detection. Antibody immobilization onto the electrode surface was conducted through a chemical entity or a biological entity to see their effect;where a biological immobilization can enhance the antibody loading and thereby the sensitivity. In both cases, we were able to have a very low limit of quantification (i.e., 0.25 fg/mL), however, the linear range was 3 orders of magnitude wider for the biological entity-based immobilization. The specificity of the sensor was also tested against high concentrations of H1N1 flu antigens with no appreciable response. The most optimized sensors are used to identify negative and positive COVID-19 samples with great accuracy and precision.","Ehsan, Muhammad Ali Khan Safyan Akram Rehman Abdul",Diagnostics,,224

In the present study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells of the human exocrine and endocrine pancreas ex vivo and in vivo. We demonstrate that human ß-cells express viral entry proteins, and SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in cultured human islets. Infection is associated with morphological, transcriptional and functional changes, including reduced numbers of insulin-secretory granules in ß-cells and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In COVID-19 full-body postmortem examinations, we detected SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in pancreatic exocrine cells, and in cells that stain positive for the ß-cell marker NKX6.1 and are in close proximity to the islets of Langerhans in all four patients investigated. Our data identify the human pancreas as a target of SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that ß-cell infection could contribute to the metabolic dysregulation observed in patients with COVID-19.","Müller, Janis A; Groß, Rüdiger; Conzelmann, Carina; Krüger, Jana; Merle, Uta; Steinhart, Johannes; Weil, Tatjana; Koepke, Lennart; Bozzo, Caterina Prelli; Read, Clarissa; Fois, Giorgio; Eiseler, Tim; Gehrmann, Julia; van Vuuren, Joanne; Wessbecher, Isabel M; Frick, Manfred; Costa, Ivan G; Breunig, Markus; Grüner, Beate; Peters, Lynn; Schuster, Michael; Liebau, Stefan; Seufferlein, Thomas; Stenger, Steffen; Stenzinger, Albrecht; MacDonald, Patrick E; Kirchhoff, Frank; Sparrer, Konstantin M J; Walther, Paul; Lickert, Heiko; Barth, Thomas F E; Wagner, Martin; Münch, Jan; Heller, Sandra; Kleger, Alexander",Nat Metab,,224

Fever and cough were the most common symptoms of both diseases, while myalgia and diarrhea were less common in patients with COVID-19. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most severe pulmonary complication that caused high mortality rate. Histologically, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was the most characteristic finding in non-survivors with either SARS or COVID-19. Cases of patients died less than 10-14 days of disease duration demonstrated acute-phase DAD, while cases beyond 10-14 days of disease duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD in SARS. Meanwhile, organization and fibrosis were usually accompanied by exudation. Coronavirus was mostly detected in pneumocytes, but less in macrophages and bronchiolar epithelial cells. Hemorrhagic necrosis and lymphocyte depletion were found in lymph nodes and spleen in both SARS and COVID-19, indicating a pathological basis of lymphocytopenia. Thrombosis was commonly observed in small vessels and microvasculaturr in lungs accompanying DAD. Microthrombosis was also found in extrapulmonary organs in COVID-19, that was less reported in SARS. Damages in multiple extrapulmonary organs were observed, but coronavirus was not detected in some of those organs, indicating an alternative mechanism beyond viral infection, such as hypoxemia, ischemia and cytokine storm induced immunological injury. DAD due to viral infection and immunological injury, as well as multi-organ dysfunction and extensive microthrombus formation, brought huge challenge to the management of patients with severe SARS or COVID-19.","Zhang, T; Sun, L X; Feng, R E",Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,,224

Here, we investigate metabolites present in several common spices as possible inhibitors of COVID-19. Specifically, 32 compounds isolated from 14 cooking seasonings were examined as inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which is required for viral multiplication. Using a drug discovery approach to identify possible antiviral leads, in silico molecular docking studies were performed. Docking calculations revealed a high potency of salvianolic acid A and curcumin as Mpro inhibitors with binding energies of -9.7 and -9.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Binding mode analysis demonstrated the ability of salvianolic acid A and curcumin to form nine and six hydrogen bonds, respectively with amino acids proximal to Mpro's active site. Stabilities and binding affinities of the two identified natural spices were calculated over 40 ns molecular dynamics simulations and compared to an antiviral protease inhibitor (lopinavir). Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area energy calculations revealed greater salvianolic acid A affinity for the enzyme over curcumin and lopinavir with energies of -44.8, -34.2 and -34.8 kcal/mol, respectively. Using a STRING database, protein-protein interactions were identified for salvianolic acid A included the biochemical signaling genes ACE, MAPK14 and ESR1; and for curcumin, EGFR and TNF. This study establishes salvianolic acid A as an in silico natural product inhibitor against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and provides a promising inhibitor lead for in vitro enzyme testing.","Ibrahim, Mahmoud A A; Abdelrahman, Alaa H M; Hussien, Taha A; Badr, Esraa A A; Mohamed, Tarik A; El-Seedi, Hesham R; Pare, Paul W; Efferth, Thomas; Hegazy, Mohamed-Elamir F",Comput Biol Med,,224

413020,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric emergency. Presentation and disposition,2021,"BACKGROUND: The reported high mortality of COVID-19 patients in intensive care has given rise to a debate over whether patients with this disease are being intubated too soon and might instead benefit from more non-invasive ventilation. METHODS: This review is based on articles published up to 12 June 2020 that were retrieved by a selective literature search on the topic of invasive and non-invasive ventilation for respiratory failure in COVID-19. Guideline recommendations and study data on patients with respiratory failure in settings other than COVID-19 are also considered, as are the current figures of the intensive care registry of the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine (Deutsche Interdisziplinäre Vereinigung für Intensiv- und Notfallmedizin). RESULTS: The high mortality figures among patients receiving invasive ventilation that have been reported in studies from abroad cannot be uncritically applied to the current situation in Germany. Study data on ventilation specifically in COVID-19 patients would be needed to do justice to the special pathophysiology of this disease, but such data are lacking. Being intubated too early is evidently associated with risks for the patient, but being intubated too late is as well. A particularly im - portant consideration is the potential harm associated with prolonged spontaneous breathing, with or without non-invasive assistance, as any increase in respiratory work can seriously worsen respiratory failure. On the other hand, it is clearly unacceptable to intubate patients too early merely out of concern that the medical staff might become infected with COVID-19 if they were ventilated non-invasively. CONCLUSION: Nasal high flow, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive ventilation with intubation should be carried out in a stepwise treatment strategy, under appropriate intensive-care monitoring and with the observance of all relevant anti-infectious precautions.

413987,Towards pragmatic adaptations: Orthopedic surgery amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 has significantly impacted the practice of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and likely affected outcomes of HCT recipients. Early reports document substantially higher case fatality rates for HCT recipients than seen in faced by the general population. Currently we do not have a clear picture of how much of this threat is present within the first year after HCT and how infection rates and outcomes vary with time after HCT. There are important because center-specific survival estimates for reporting purposes focus on 1-year post-HCT mortality. Transplantation centers have dramatically changed their practices in response to the pandemic. At many centers, quality assurance processes and procedures were disrupted, changes that likely affected team performance. Centers have been affected unevenly by the pandemic through time, location, and COVID-19 burdens. Assessment of center-specific survival depends on the ability to adjust for risk factors, such as COVID-19, that are outside center control using consistent methods so that team performance based on controllable risk factors can be ascertained. The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research (CIBMTR) convened a working group for the 2020 Center Outcomes Forum to assess the impact of COVID-19 on both patient-specific risks and center-specific performance. This committee reviewed the factors at play and developed recommendations for a process to determine whether adjustments in the methodology to assess center-specific performance are needed.","Wingard, John R; Ahn, Kwang Woo; Dandoy, Christopher; Perales, Miguel-Angel; Wood, William A; Logan, Brent; Riches, Marcie; Rizzo, J Douglas",,,224
415151,A Resilient Health System in Response to Coronavirus Disease 2019: Experiences of Turkey,2020,"BACKGROUND: In response to the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare systems worldwide have stepped up their infection prevention and control efforts in order to reduce the spread of the infection. Behaviours, such as hand hygiene, screening and cohorting of patients, and the appropriate use of antibiotics have long been recommended in surgery, but their implementation has often been patchy. METHODS: The current crisis presents an opportunity to learn about how to improve infection prevention and control and surveillance (IPCS) behaviours. The improvements made were mainly informal, quick and stemming from the frontline rather than originating from formal organizational structures. The adaptations made and the expertise acquired have the potential for triggering deeper learning and to create enduring improvements in the routine identification and management of infections relating to surgery. RESULTS: This paper aims to illustrate how adopting a human factors and ergonomics perspective can provide insights into how clinical work systems have been adapted and reconfigured in order to keep patients and staff safe. CONCLUSION: For achieving sustainable change in IPCS practices in surgery during COVID-19 and beyond we need to enhance organizational learning potentials.","Toccafondi, Giulio; Di Marzo, Francesco; Sartelli, Massimo; Sujan, Mark; Smyth, Molly; Bowie, Paul; Cardi, Martina; Cardi, Maurizio",Int J Qual Health Care,,224

One of these strains is the B.1.1.7 variant that has initially been described in the United Kingdom and has subsequently spread to several countries. Monitoring the amplification of the S gene-a major hotspot for molecular evolution-by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) allows rapidly screening for such variants. This report describes the detection of sequence variants in Romania by using this strategy followed by next-generation sequencing of the entire genome for confirmation and further characterization. One B.1.1.7 and three B.1.258 sequences were confirmed. Each of these strains presented additional mutations with possible impact on the replicative capacity.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 4 million people have died due to this disease, whereas there have been more than 180 million confirmed cases of COVID-19. The collapse of the health system in many countries has demonstrated the need of developing tools to automatize the diagnosis of the disease from medical imaging. Previous studies have used deep learning for this purpose. However, the performance of this alternative highly depends on the size of the dataset employed for training the algorithm. In this work, we propose a classification framework based on sparse coding in order to identify the pneumonia patterns associated with different pathologies. Specifically, each chest X-ray (CXR) image is partitioned into different tiles. The most relevant features extracted from PCA are then used to build the dictionary within the sparse coding procedure. Once images are transformed and reconstructed from the elements of the dictionary, classification is performed from the reconstruction errors of individual patches associated with each image. Performance is evaluated in a real scenario where simultaneously differentiation between four different pathologies: control vs bacterial pneumonia vs viral pneumonia vs COVID-19. The accuracy when identifying the presence of pneumonia is 93.85%, whereas 88.11% is obtained in the 4-class classification context. The excellent results and the pioneering use of sparse coding in this scenario evidence the applicability of this approach as an aid for clinicians in a real-world environment.","Arco, Juan E.; Ortiz, Andr'es; Ram'irez, Javier; Gorriz, Juan M",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14724v1.pdf,224

Compared to women, most countries with available data report that men with COVID-19 have greater disease severity and higher mortality. Lab and animal data indicate that men respond differently to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, offering possible explanations for the epidemiologic observations. The plausible theories underlying these observations include sex-related differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, immune function, hormones, habits, and coinfection rates.In this review we examine these factors and explore the rationale as to how each may impact COVID-19. Understanding why men are more likely to experience severe disease can help in developing effective treatments, public health policies, and targeted strategies such as early recognition and aggressive testing in subgroups.","Lipsky, Martin S; Hung, Man",Am J Mens Health,,224

420705,Physical activity during the coronavirus disease-2019 global pandemic,2020,"In real-world settings involving consequential decision-making, the deployment of machine learning systems generally requires both reliable uncertainty quantification and protection of individuals' privacy. We present a framework that treats these two desiderata jointly. Our framework is based on conformal prediction, a methodology that augments predictive models to return prediction sets that provide uncertainty quantification -- they provably cover the true response with a user-specified probability, such as 90%. One might hope that when used with privately-trained models, conformal prediction would yield privacy guarantees for the resulting prediction sets; unfortunately this is not the case. To remedy this key problem, we develop a method that takes any pre-trained predictive model and outputs differentially private prediction sets. Our method follows the general approach of split conformal prediction; we use holdout data to calibrate the size of the prediction sets but preserve privacy by using a privatized quantile subroutine. This subroutine compensates for the noise introduced to preserve privacy in order to guarantee correct coverage. We evaluate the method on large-scale computer vision datasets.","Angelopoulos, Anastasios N.; Bates, Stephen; Zrnic, Tijana; Jordan, Michael I.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06202v2.pdf,224
420706,Physical activity during the coronavirus disease-2019 global pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Higher comorbidity and older age have been reported as correlates of poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients worldwide; however, US data are scarce. We evaluated mortality predictors of COVID-19 in a large cohort of hospitalized patients in the United States. DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter cohort of inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 by RT-PCR from 1 March to 17 April 2020 was performed, and outcome data evaluated from 1 March to 17 April 2020. Measures included demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, laboratory values and imaging on admission. Primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, time to death and development of acute kidney injury in the first 48-h. RESULTS: The 1305 patients were hospitalized during the evaluation period. Mean age was 61.0 ± 16.3, 53.8% were male and 66.1% African American. Mean BMI was 33.2 ± 8.8 kg m-2 . Median Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 2 (1-4), and 72.6% of patients had at least one comorbidity, with hypertension (56.2%) and diabetes mellitus (30.1%) being the most prevalent. ACE-I/ARB use and NSAIDs use were widely prevalent (43.3% and 35.7%, respectively). Mortality occurred in 200 (15.3%) of patients with median time of 10 (6-14) days. Age > 60 (aOR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.26-2.94) and CCI > 3 (aOR: 2.71, 95% CI: 1.85-3.97) were independently associated with mortality by multivariate analyses. NSAIDs and ACE-I/ARB use had no significant effects on renal failure in the first 48 h. CONCLUSION: Advanced age and an increasing number of comorbidities are independent predictors of in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients. NSAIDs and ACE-I/ARB use prior to admission is not associated with renal failure or increased mortality.","Imam, Z; Odish, F; Gill, I; O039,; Connor, D; Armstrong, J; Vanood, A; Ibironke, O; Hanna, A; Ranski, A; Halalau, A",J Intern Med,,224

Vertical airspeed showed a large impact at velocities <0.05 m s-1 but a lesser effect at velocities >0.05 m s-1 . In addition, the efficacy of any upper-room UVC system is influenced greatly by the mean room fluence rate as opposed to a simple volume- or area-based dosing criteria.

I would like to thank the entire Abstract Program Committee, the reviewers, and the participants, without whom the ACSC Abstract Program would not be possible. Dr. Alain Gagnon Chair, Abstract Program Committee Methods: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study using the United States' Nationwide Inpatient Sample to evaluate the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears in women who underwent IOL at term between 2005 and 2014. We included all term livebirths and excluded, preterm births, previous cesarean deliveries, multifetal gestations, and non-cephalic presentation. Women who underwent an IOL at term were identified using ICD-9 coding. Patient characteristics were compared between those women being induced at term with those who weren't, and logistic regression analysis were carried out to estimate the adjusted effect of IOL at term with risk of 3rd and 4th perineal tears. Results: Among 5,982,945 eligible live births, 1,035,003 (17.3%) underwent an IOL at term, increasing from 15.7% to 18.5%. Women with an IOL were more likely to be older, Caucasian, and with comorbid illnesses. Compared with women who did not undergo an IOL, women in the IOL group had lower risk of cesarean deliveries, 0.89 (0.88–0.89), 2nd degree tears, 0.89 (0.89–0.90), 3rd degree tears, OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.79–0.82) and 4th degree tears, OR 0.84 (95% CI 0.82–0.87). Conclusions: Induction of labor at term results in significantly lower risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears among all deliveries as well as among women with vaginal deliveries.","Al-Wahaibi, Suhaila; Czuzoj-Shulman, Nicholas; Abenhaim, Haim",J.

As the awareness about the ailment increased, so did messages, videos and posts acknowledging its presence. The social networking site, Twitter, demonstrated similar effect with the number of posts related to coronavirus showing an unprecedented growth in a very short span of time. This paper presents a statistical analysis of the twitter messages related to this disease posted since January 2020. Two types of empirical studies have been performed. The first is on word frequency and the second on sentiments of the individual tweet messages. Inspection of the word frequency is useful in characterizing the patterns or trends in the words used on the site. This would also reflect on the psychology of the twitter users at this critical juncture. Unigram, bigram and trigram frequencies have been modeled by power law distribution. The results have been validated by Sum of Square Error (SSE), R2 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). High values of R2 and low values of SSE and RMSE lay the grounds for the goodness of fit of this model. Sentiment analysis has been conducted to understand the general attitudes of the twitter users at this time. Both tweets by general public and WHO were part of the corpus. The results showed that the majority of the tweets had a positive polarity and only about 15% were negative.","Rajput, Nikhil Kumar; Grover, Bhavya Ahuja; Rathi, Vipin Kumar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03925v1.pdf,224

The cyclic peptide inhibitor is designed to mimic the conformation of a substrate at a C-terminal autolytic cleavage site of Mpro. The cyclic peptide contains a [4-(2-aminoethyl)phenyl]-acetic acid (AEPA) linker that is designed to enforce a conformation that mimics a peptide substrate of Mpro. In vitro evaluation of the cyclic peptide inhibitor reveals that the inhibitor exhibits modest activity against Mpro and does not appear to be cleaved by the enzyme. Conformational searching predicts that the cyclic peptide inhibitor is fairly rigid, adopting a favorable conformation for binding to the active site of Mpro. Computational docking to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro suggests that the cyclic peptide inhibitor can bind the active site of Mpro in the predicted manner. Molecular dynamics simulations provide further insights into how the cyclic peptide inhibitor may bind the active site of Mpro. Although the activity of the cyclic peptide inhibitor is modest, its design and study lays the groundwork for the development of additional cyclic peptide inhibitors against Mpro with improved activities.","Kreutzer, Adam G; Krumberger, Maj; Diessner, Elizabeth M; Parrocha, Chelsea Marie T; Morris, Michael A; Guaglianone, Gretchen; Butts, Carter T; Nowick, James S",Eur J Med Chem,,224

The high transmission risk and mortality rates of COVID-19 cause serious concerns in ophthalmologists and may cause disruptions in clinical functioning. This study aims to identify changes in the clinical approaches of ophthalmologists, understand their anxiety levels, and exhibit how patients' follow-up processes progress during the pandemic. METHODS: A questionnaire that including demographic information, ophthalmology clinical activity scale, and Beck anxiety scale was sent to ophthalmologists in Turkey. Google Forms was used as a survey platform in this study. RESULTS: A total of 121 ophthalmologists participated in the study. The participants stated that they could not continue routine interventional diagnosis and treatment practices during the outbreak. It was clearly stated that there were changes in their clinical approach and decreased patient examination quality. For this reason, 14.9% of physicians said to missed the diagnosis in this process. Physicians who encounter infected patients state that it is more difficult to provide ophthalmological services and their clinical approaches are affected more negatively. Anxiety levels of physicians who could access personal protective equipment (PPE) and show positive solidarity with their colleagues in the process were found to be lower. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that ophthalmologists, like other healthcare professionals, were severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Accordingly, healthcare managers should provide adequate PPE for ophthalmologists, organize the clinical operation, and support the mental health of ophthalmologists.","Erdem, Burak; Gok, Mustafa; Bostan, Sedat",Int. ophthalmol,,224

The potential for home diagnosis and monitoring could reduce infectious risk for other patients and health care providers, limit use of finite hospital resources, and enable better social distancing and isolation practices. CASE REPORT: We report a case of an otherwise healthy emergency physician diagnosed with COVID-19 at home using portable ultrasound, pulse oximetry, and antibody testing. Her clinical picture and typical lung findings of COVID-19 on ultrasound, combined with a normal echocardiogram and negative deep vein thrombosis study, helped inform her diagnosis. She then monitored her clinical course using pulse oximetry, was able to self-isolate for 4 weeks, and had an uneventful recovery. Her diagnosis was confirmed with a positive IgG antibody test after 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Novel times call for novel solutions and our case demonstrates one possible path for home diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. The tools used, namely ultrasound and pulse oximetry, should be familiar to most emergency physicians. Ultrasound in particular was helpful in eliminating other potential diagnoses, such as pulmonary embolus.","Aminlari, Amir; Quenzer, Faith; Hayden, Stephen; Stone, Jennifer; Murchison, Charles; Campbell, Colleen",J. emerg. med,,224

Medical scientists worked tirelessly to develop vaccines. WHO introduced preventive/protective measures to reduce human-human transmission, while researchers are searching for alternative technologies in AI, ML, and feature engineering to improve medical test accuracy, perfect isolation, and disease control. Recent research unraveled radiology imaging techniques that predict fast spread and have accurate diagnosis by confirming pathogens in blood cells. Machine learning techniques utilized to identify and diagnose COVID-19 are medic-tech applications for analyzing pneumonic effects of the virus in the body. ML approaches can help to examine the heart through chest X-rays to reveal how it affects the lungs, kidney, liver, and other vital organs in the body. X-ray accuracy can be analyzed with multinomial MNB, ANN, SVM, GANS, and other deep learning tools that validate scan results. Data authenticity above 85% may depend on computed algorithms that show whether COVID-19 nucleic acid test results are negative or positive. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides a series of DNA samples for performing genetic test analysis. PCR helps experts to predict COVID-19 infectious agents using human DNA samples. However, PCR that supposes to show how COVID-19 spreads can be influenced by medical protocols causing further contaminations. Alternative use of technology has brought about an automated response while using CNN (convolutional neural network) to predict viruses and offer diagnostic options.

457742,Coronavirus disease 2019: achieving good mental health during social isolation,2020,"Many studies into surface contamination of hospital environments have demonstrated that occupational exposure to cytotoxics through the dermal route remains a possible risk. In this study, we assess the actual dermal exposure of the hands of pharmacy technicians and cleaning personnel in a panel of hospitals performing tasks that pose a risk of exposure. We compare the dermal exposure to a tentative limit value for cyclophosphamide. Pharmacy technicians and cleaning personnel were asked for hand rinsing after performance of nine tasks previously identified as posing a risk of occupational exposure. All samples were analyzed for the presence and quantity of eight antineoplastic drugs. By using data on both the frequency of the performance of the tasks and the measured dermal contamination during these tasks, weekly exposure to the marker drug (cyclophosphamide) was calculated. In five Dutch hospitals, 70 hand rinse samples and 8 blanks were collected. These were analyzed and results were used to calculate weekly exposure. The tentative limit value used was 0.74 µg of cyclophosphamide. For cleaning personnel, all results remained below this threshold value. For pharmacy technicians, the compounding itself also remained well below the limit; however, the task involving preparatory work, as well as the checking of compounded drugs, had a 13% chance of exceeding the limit. All of the highest values were found when employees were not wearing gloves on these tasks. Cleaning personnel and pharmacy technicians compounding cytotoxic drugs in our study were sufficiently protected from occupational exposure. In contrast, pharmacy technicians who perform preparatory and finishing tasks (before and after the actual compounding) are not protected enough when they do not wear gloves.","Crul, Mirjam; Hilhorst, Simone; Breukels, Oscar; Bouman-d039,; Onofrio, Johanna R C; Stubbs, Percival; van Rooij, Joost G",J Occup Environ Hyg,,224

A case report,2020,"This paper studies conspiracy and debunking narratives about COVID-19 origination on a major Chinese social media platform, Weibo, from January to April 2020. Popular conspiracies about COVID-19 on Weibo, including that the virus is human-synthesized or a bioweapon, differ substantially from those in the US. They attribute more responsibility to the US than to China, especially following Sino-US confrontations. Compared to conspiracy posts, debunking posts are associated with lower user participation but higher mobilization. Debunking narratives can be more engaging when they come from women and influencers and cite scientists. Our findings suggest that conspiracy narratives can carry highly cultural and political orientations. Correction efforts should consider political motives and identify important stakeholders to reconstruct international dialogues toward intercultural understanding.","Chen, Kaiping; Chen, Anfan; Zhang, Jingwen; Meng, Jingbo; Shen, Cuihua",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08409v1.pdf,224

In an unforeseen situation, approximately 25,000 frontline healthcare workers have also been infected by this disease while providing treatment to the infected patients. In this devastating scenario, without any drug or vaccine available for the treatment, frontline healthcare workers are highly prone to viral infection. However, some countries are drastically facing a shortage of healthcare workers in hospitals. Methods: The literature search was conducted in ScienceDirect and ResearchGate, using words ""Medical Robots"", and ""AI in Covid-19"" as descriptors. To identify and evaluate the articles that create the impact of robots and artificial intelligence in pandemic diseases. Eligible articles were included publications and laboratory studies before and after covid-19 and also the prospective and retrospective of application of Robots and AI. Conclusion: In this pandemic situation, robots were employed in some countries during the COVID-19 outbreak, which are medical robots, UV-disinfectant robots, social robots, drones, and COBOTS. Implementation of these robots was found effective in successful disease management, treatment, most importantly ensures the safety of healthcare workers. Mainly, the Disposal of deceased bodies and the location and transportation of infected patients to hospitals and hospitals were tough tasks and risk of infection. These tasks will be performed by employing mobile robots and automated guided robots respectively. Therefore, in the future, advanced automated robots would be a promising choice in hospitals and healthcare centers to minimize the risk of frontline healthcare workers.","Yoganandhan, A; Rajesh Kanna, G; Subhash, S D; Hebinson Jothi, J",Vacunas (Madrid),,224

Epidemiologic inquiry requires resources and time which may not be available or reduced when the outbreak is excessive. We evaluated the use of Google Maps Timeline (GMTL) for creating spatial epidemiologic timelines. The study compares locations, routes, and means of transport between GMTL and user recall for 17 suitable users who were recruited during March 2020. They were interviewed about their timeline using the Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) method which was then compared to their GMTL and discrepancies between both methods were addressed. Interviewer conclusions were divided into categories: (1) participant recalled, (2) no recall (until shown). Categories were subdivided by GMTL accuracy: [a] GMTL accurate, [b] GMTL inaccurate, [c] GMTL data missing. A total of 362 locations were compared. Participants recalled 322 (88.95% SD = 8.55) locations compared with 40 (11.05%, SD = 2.05) locations not recalled. There were 304 locations found accurate on GMTL (83.98%, SD = 9.49), 29 (8.01%, SD = 1.11) inaccurate locations, and 29 (8.01%, SD = 0.54) missing locations. The total discrepancy between GMTL and TLFB recall was 95 cases (26.24%, SD = 3.25). Despite variations between users, Google Maps with GMTL technology may be useful in identifying potentially exposed individuals in a pandemic. It is especially useful when resources are limited. Further research is required with a larger number of users who are undergoing a real epidemiologic investigation to corroborate findings and establish further recommendations.","Sonkin, Roman; Alpert, Evan Avraham; Jaffe, Eli",Health Technol (Berl),,224

Generated Fe2C6 and Fe2C12 are shown to be more cohesive than the mono-carbide on one hand, and increasingly cohesive from hexa- C6 to dodeca- C12 on the other hand. From energy differences, the ground state is spin-polarized SP, versus a non-spin-polarized NSP configuration, and identified as ferromagnetic versus a higher energy anti-ferromagnetic hypothesis. The projection of the magnetic charge density on Fe and C, shows that only Fe carries the magnetic moment, while carbon receives charges from Fe as illustrated by the electron localization function ELF 3D and 2D mapping. SP configuration induces an enlarged c/a hexagonal ratio, versus NSP, while a(hex.) remains constant thanks to the rigid C6 carbon substructure network, resulting in an anisotropic magneto-volume response. This feature, essentially due to in-plane diiron, is discussed from the energy-volume (E, V) NSP and SP equations of state EOS and derived quantities like volume- and d(Fe-Fe)- changes of the magnetization.","Matar, Samir F.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03901v1.pdf,224

Inspired by state and local governments that declared racism a public health crisis or emergency, the Anti-Racism in Public Health Act of 2020 reflects a shifting paradigm in which racism is considered a social determinant of health. Indeed, health inequities fundamentally rooted in structural racism have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which calls for the integration of antiracist praxis to promote ethical public health research processes. This commentary describes ways in which antiracist praxis-which emphasizes empowerment of traditionally marginalized populations-offers strategies to explicitly address power imbalance, stigmatization, and other consequences of structural racism in public health research.","Fletcher, Faith E; Jiang, Wendy; Best, Alicia L",Hastings Cent Rep,,224

Nevertheless, the usefulness of such models has been subject to controversy. An evolution in the epidemiological modeling field is urgently needed, beginning with an agreed-upon set of modeling standards for policy recommendations. The objective of this article is to propose a set of modeling standards to support policy decision making. METHODS: We identify and describe 5 broad standards: transparency, heterogeneity, calibration and validation, cost-benefit analysis, and model obsolescence and recalibration. We give methodological recommendations and provide examples in the literature that employ these standards well. We also develop and demonstrate a modeling practices checklist using existing coronavirus disease 2019 literature that can be employed by readers, authors, and reviewers to evaluate and compare policy modeling literature along our formulated standards. RESULTS: We graded 16 articles using our checklist. On average, the articles met 6.81 of our 19 categories (36.7%). No articles contained any cost-benefit analyses and few were adequately transparent. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant room for improvement in modeling pandemic policy. Issues often arise from a lack of transparency, poor modeling assumptions, lack of a system-wide perspective in modeling, and lack of flexibility in the academic system to rapidly iterate modeling as new information becomes available. In anticipation of future challenges, we encourage the modeling community at large to contribute toward the refinement and consensus of a shared set of standards for infectious disease policy modeling.","Zawadzki, Roy S; Gong, Cynthia L; Cho, Sang K; Schnitzer, Jan E; Zawadzki, Nadine K; Hay, Joel W; Drabo, Emmanuel F",Value Health,,224
489853,Evaluation of the potential for transmission of coronavirus disease via saliva: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"It has been 2 months since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. So far, COVID-19 has affected 85 403 patients in 57 countries/territories and has caused 2924 deaths in 9 countries. However, epidemiological data differ between countries. Although China had higher morbidity and mortality than other sites, the number of new daily cases in China has been lower than outside of China since 26 February 2020. The incidence ranged from 61.44 per 1 000 000 people in the Republic of Korea to 0.0002 per 1 000 000 people in India. The daily cumulative index (DCI) of COVID-19 (cumulative cases/no. of days between the first reported case and 29 February 2020) was greatest in China (1320.85), followed by the Republic of Korea (78.78), Iran (43.11) and Italy (30.62). However, the DCIs in other countries/territories were <10 per day. Several effective measures including restricting travel from China, controlling the distribution of masks, extensive investigation of COVID-19 spread, and once-daily press conferences by the government to inform and educate people were aggressively conducted in Taiwan. This is probably the reason why there was only 39 cases (as of 29 February 2020) with a DCI of 1 case per day in Taiwan, which is much lower than that of nearby countries such as the Republic of Korea and Japan. In addition, the incidence and mortality were correlated with the DCI. However, further study and continued monitoring are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism of COVID-19.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Wang, Cheng-Yi; Wang, Ya-Hui; Hsueh, Shun-Chung; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,224

There is controversy about indication and health care professionals' safety regarding the conventional or percutaneous technique. We performed a prospective analysis of a series of 27 consecutive patients with COVID-19 comparing both tracheostomy techniques, safety, and prognosis clinical markers. The results show that the techniques are equally safe, without cases of infection in surgeons. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score before surgery and the progression in ventilation support during the first 72 hours after tracheostomy are optimal prognostic markers for these patients.","Riestra-Ayora, Juan; Yanes-Diaz, Joaquin; Penuelas, Oscar; Molina-Quiros, Cristina; Sanz-Fernández, Ricardo; Martin-Sanz, Eduardo",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,224

The clinical spectrum of cutaneous manifestations observed in patients with COVID-19 is both heterogeneous and complex. To date, reports have identified 5main categories: acral lesions, vesicular rashes, urticarial rashes, maculopapular rashes, and livedoid and necrotic lesions. However, these will probably be modified as new information comes to light. Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 probably reflect the activation of pathogenic pathways by the virus or a response to inflammatory processes, vascular or systemic complications, or even treatments. Familiarity with the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 may enable early diagnosis or help guide prognosis.","Carrascosa, J M; Morillas, V; Bielsa, I; Munera-Campos, M",Actas dermo-sifiliogr.

The delivery of universal palliative care services has been called for by leading global health organizations and experts. Nurses are critical to realizing this goal. COVID-19 diagnoses and fatalities continue to rise, underscoring the importance of palliative care, particularly in the context of scant resources. To inform the writing of this paper, we undertook a review of the COVID-19 and palliative care literature and drew on our experiences. It is very clear that investment in nurses is needed to ensure appropriate palliative care services now and into the future. Avoiding futile interventions and alleviating suffering is an ethical imperative for nurses regardless of the setting. Multi-level practices and policies to foster the delivery of safe, high-quality palliative care for all are urgently needed.","Rosa, William E; Davidson, Patricia M",Int Nurs Rev,,224

BACKGROUND: During pandemic process, nurses reported to experience stress due to a very high risk of being infected and hard work. METHOD: A descriptive study. The sample of the study consisted of 169 emergency nurses. To collect data, a personal information form was used together with the Perceived Stress Scale. RESULTS: The factors that significantly affect the perceived stress score of emergency nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic included applying respiratory isolation, changing the way of life, not being able to access protective equipment, insufficient nurses in the unit and thinking that COVID-19 will be transmitted to oneself. CONCLUSION: Nearly half of the emergency nurses perceived stress above average during pandemic, and their working conditions affected this situation. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Meeting physiological needs and applying psychological guidance and counselling interventions in the stress management of emergency nurses may contribute to the reduction of their stress levels. Effective infection control, reducing workload, increasing the number of nurses and strengthening the coping mechanisms can minimize the perceived stress level of emergency nurses.","Çinar, Derya; Kiliç Akça, Nazan; Zorba Bahçeli, Pinar; Bag, Yasar",J. nurs. manag,,224

Clinical evidence indicates that the elevated number of peripheral neutrophils and higher ratio of neutrophils-to-lymphocytes are correlated with severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients, suggesting the possible immunopathological role of neutrophils during SARS-CoV-2 infection. As an abundant innate immune cell type, neutrophils are well known for their contributions to antimicrobial defense. However, their dysfunction is also associated with different inflammatory signatures during the pathogenesis of infection. Herein, in this mini-review, we summarize the recent progress on the potential role of neutrophils during COVID-19-associated inflammatory responses. In particular, we highlight the interactions between neutrophils and viruses as well as the relationship of neutrophils with cytokine storm and thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Lastly, we discuss the importance of neutrophils as potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19.","Cui, Shu-Nan; Tan, Hong-Yu; Fan, Guo-Chang",Shock (Augusta Ga.),,224

We investigated M2698, an oral p70S6K/AKT dual inhibitor, in patients with advanced cancer who failed standard therapies. METHODS: M2698 was administered as monotherapy (escalation, 15-380 mg daily; food effect cohort, 240-320 mg daily) and combined with trastuzumab or tamoxifen. RESULTS: Overall, 101 patients were treated (M2698, n = 62; M2698/trastuzumab, n = 13; M2698/tamoxifen, n = 26). Patients were predominantly aged < 65 years, were female, had performance status 1 and were heavily pretreated. There was a dose- and concentration-dependent inhibition of pS6 levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor tissue. M2698 was well tolerated; the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were gastrointestinal, abnormal dreams and fatigue (serious, attributed to M2698: monotherapy, 8.1%; M2698/trastuzumab, 7.7%; M2698/tamoxifen, 11.5% of patients). The recommended phase 2 doses of M2698 were 240 mg QD (monotherapy), 160 mg QD (M2698/trastuzumab) and 160 mg QD/240 mg intermittent regimen (M2698/tamoxifen). In the monotherapy cohort, 27.4% of patients had stable disease at 12 weeks; no objective response was noted. The median progression-free survival (PFS) durations in patients with PAM pathway alterations with and without confounding markers (KRAS, EGFR, AKT2) were 1.4 months and 2.8 months, respectively. Two patients with breast cancer (M2698/trastuzumab, n = 1; M2698/tamoxifen, n = 1) had partial response; their PFS durations were 31 months and 2.7 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: M2698 was well tolerated. Combined with trastuzumab or tamoxifen, M2698 demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with advanced breast cancer resistant to multiple standard therapies, suggesting that it could overcome treatment resistance.

The new strain 501.V2 in South Africa bears three mutations in the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD); K417 N, E484K, and N501Y, while the Brazilian B.1.1.248 lineage has 12 mutations. In the current study, we simulate the complex ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD system in which the RBD is in the wild-type and mutated isoforms. Additionally, the cell-surface Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (CS-GRP78) associated with the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD complex (ACE2-S RBD) is modeled at the presence of these mutant variants of the viral spike. The results showed that E484K and N501Y are critical in viral spike recognition through either ACE2 or CS-GRP78. The mutated variants (the UK, South African, and Brazilian) of the spike RBD tightly bind to GRP78 more than in the case of the wild-type RBD. These results point to the potent role of GRP78 with ACE2 in the attachment of the new variants, which could be a key for the design of inhibitors to block SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry to the host cell.","Ibrahim, Ibrahim M; Elfiky, Abdo A; Elgohary, Alaa M",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,224

503786,Just the Facts: Protected code blue - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the emergency department during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,2020,"There has been a huge impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global healthcare systems. Advisories across the world have appealed to people to stay at home and observe social distancing to slow down the pandemic. However it is important to realize as to how this is affecting acute cardiovascular care. Recent studies from Europe and USA have reported > 50% reduction in hospital admissions for ACS and declining rates of coronary interventions. The possible reasons for this noticeable reduction in patients with ACS/STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic are multi-factorial. On one hand, it is due to change in thresholds for referring patients of ACS/STEMI for cardiac catheterization, with fibrinolysis being acceptable for many stable STEMI patients and conservative management being preferred for NSTEMI patients. Theories abound on how ""staying at home"" strategy may have led to an reduction in acute coronary events due to healthier lifestyle, better compliance and reduced stress. Realistically however, a more disquieting reason would be a ""pseudo-reduction"" ie. the incidence of ACS/STEMI is actually the same, but these patients are staying away from hospitals due to fear of contracting the infection. Lockdown restrictions have also limited transport options for patients seeking to reach hospitals in time. Healthcare systems need to be prepared for an anticipated downstream deluge of such untreated patients who may present with sequelae like heart failure, reinfarction, arrhythmias, mechanical complications etc. Scientific societies should have proactive campaigns to alleviate patient concerns, and encourage them to seek timely medical attention despite the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kapoor, Aditya; Yadav, Rakesh",Indian Heart J,,224

Despite the fact that the majority of infected patients were managed in outpatient settings, little is known about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization. The aim of our study was to describe the clinical comorbidity and the pharmacological therapies of COVID-19 patients managed in outpatient settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an observational, retrospective analysis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients managed in outpatient settings in Naples, Italy between 9 March and 1 May 2020. Data were sourced from the prospectively maintained Health Search (HS)/Thales database, shared by 128 primary care physicians (PCPs) in Naples, Italy. The clinical features and pharmacological therapies of COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization and managed in outpatient settings have been described. RESULTS: A total of 351 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (mean age 54 ± 17 years; 193 males) with outpatient management were evaluated. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (35%). The distribution of cardiovascular comorbidities showed no gender-related differences. A total of 201 patients (57.3%) were treated with at least one experimental drug for COVID-19. Azithromycin, alone (42.78%) or in combination (27.44%), was the most widely used experimental anti-COVID drug in outpatient settings. Low Molecular Weight Heparin and Cortisone were prescribed in 24.87% and 19.4% of the study population, respectively. At multivariate regression model, diabetes (risk ratio (RR): 3.74; 95% CI 1.05 to 13.34; p = 0.04) and hypertension (RR: 1.69; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.7; p = 0.03) were significantly associated with the experimental anti-COVID drug administration. Moreover, only diabetes (RR: 2.43; 95% CI 1.01 to 5.8; p = 0.03) was significantly associated with heparin administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show a high prevalence of hypertension, more likely treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RASS) inhibitors, among COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization. Experimental COVID-19 therapies have been prescribed to COVID-19 patients considered at risk for increased venous thromboembolism based on concomitant comorbidities, in particular diabetes and hypertension.","Russo, Vincenzo; Piccinocchi, Gaetano; Mandaliti, Vincenzo; Annunziata, Saverio; Cimmino, Giovanni; Attena, Emilio; Moio, Nicola; Di Micco, Pierpaolo; Severino, Sergio; Trotta, Roberta; Del Guercio, Michele",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,224

512769,Seroprevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among health care workers from three pandemic hospitals of Turkey,2021,"BACKGROUND: A range of civil society organisations (CSOs) such as drug user groups, non-governmental/third sector organisations and networks of existing organisations, seek to shape the development of drugs policy at national and international levels. However, their capacity to do so is shaped by the contexts in which they operate nationally and internationally. The aim of this paper is to explore the lived experience of civil society participation in these contexts, both from the perspective of CSOs engaged in harm reduction advocacy, and the institutions they engage with, in order to inform future policy development. METHODS: This paper is based on the presentations and discussions from a workshop on 'Civil Society Involvement in Drug Policy hosted by the Correlation - European Harm Reduction Network at the International Society for the Study of Drugs Policy (ISSDP) annual conference in Paris, 2019. In the aftermath of the workshop, the authors analysed the papers and discussions and identified the key themes arising to inform CSI in developing future harm reduction policy and practice. RESULTS: Civil society involvement (CSI) in policy decision-making and implementation is acknowledged as an important benefit to representative democracy. Yet, the accounts of CSOs demonstrate the challenges they experience in seeking to shape the contested field of drug policy. Negotiating the complex workings of political institutions, often in adversarial and heavily bureaucratic environments, proved difficult. Nonetheless, an increase in structures which formalised and resourced CSI enabled more meaningful participation at different levels and at different stages of policy making. CONCLUSIONS: Civil society spaces are colonised by a broad range of civil society actors lobbying from different ideological standpoints including those advocating for a 'drug free world' and those advocating for harm reduction. In these competitive arena, it may be difficult for harm reduction orientated CSOs to influence the policy process. However, the current COVID-19 public health crisis clearly demonstrates the benefits of partnership between CSOs and political institutions to address the harm reduction needs of people who use drugs. The lessons drawn from our workshop serve to inform all partners on this pathway.","O039,; Gorman, Aileen; Schatz, Eberhard",Harm Reduct J,,224

The aim of this article is to present Zhejiang province's experience of establishing an accurate and smart control mechanism for epidemic prevention and control and resumption of work and production using a 'five-colour epidemic chart'. The number of confirmed cases, proportion of local cases, and occurrence of clustered outbreaks were used as evaluation indicators to calculate the county-level epidemic risk and were assigned different weight coefficients; the absence of cases for 3 and 7 consecutive days was used as the adjustment index. When the first chart was published on February 9, there were 1 very-high-risk, 12 high-risk, and 12 low-risk counties. Under the five-colour chart, Zhejiang began to adopt precise measures to prevent and control the epidemic and resume work and production. By February 24, the low-risk counties had expanded to 82, with no high-risk and very-high-risk counties. The epidemic situation in Zhejiang province has been effectively controlled. The experience of epidemic prevention and control in Zhejiang is worthy to be emulated and learned by other countries and regions.","He, Fan; Shang, Xiaopeng; Ling, Feng; Chen, Zhiping; Fu, Tiehong; Lin, Junfen; Wang, Zhen",Sci Rep,,224

Methods: COVID-19 cases, deaths, tests, case age distribution, and the difference between 2020 all-cause mortality and the average mortality of the previous 5 years were compared across nations. Patterns in cell phone mobility data, testing strategies, and seniors' care home deaths were also compared. Data for each nation were based on publicly available sources as of July 31, 2020. Results: Compared with its Nordic peers, Sweden had a higher incidence rate across all ages, a higher COVID-19-related death rate only partially explained by population demographics, a higher death rate in seniors' care, and higher all-cause mortality. Sweden had approximately half as much mobility change as its Nordic neighbours until April and followed similar rates as its neighbours from April to July. Denmark led its Nordic peers in testing rates, while Sweden had the highest cumulative test-positivity rate continuously from mid-March. Conclusions: COVID-19 pushed Sweden's health system to its capacity, exposed systemic weaknesses in the seniors' care system, and revealed challenges with implementing effective contact tracing and testing strategies while experiencing a high case burden. Looser government restrictions at the beginning of the outbreak are likely to have played a role in the impact of COVID-19 in Sweden. In an effort to improve epidemic control, Sweden has increased testing rates, implemented more restrictive prevention measures, and increased their intensive care unit bed capacity.","Yarmol-Matusiak, Erica A; Cipriano, Lauren E; Stranges, Saverio",Scand J Public Health,,224

517953,The cacophony of emotions in a mental health professional from the isolation ward during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the activity of Emergency Departments worldwide changed dramatically, focusing on diagnosis and care of the Sars-Cov-2 associated disease. These major changes also involved the activity of the Emergency Radiology Department (ERD). This study aimed to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on imaging studies, both in terms of the amount, frequency and subspecialty of different imaging modalities requested to the ERD of the Maggiore della Carità Hospital in Novara (Italy). METHODS: To this end, our observational study took into account the imaging studies requested by the emergency department during three-time spans. These were defined as phase 0 (pre-pandemic), phase 1 (pandemic peak with complete lockdown) and phase 2 (post-pandemic peak with partial lifting of restrictive measures), as derived from Italian urgent decrees by the President of the Council of Ministers (DPCM) which established the duration and entity of the lockdown measures throughout the pandemic. The dataset was processed and then compared with Pearson's chi-squared test. RESULTS: During the pandemic peak, our data showed a significant drop in the total number of studies requested and a significant rise in computed tomography (CT) studies. In particular, a statistically significant increase in chest CT studies was found, probably due to the high sensitivity of this imaging method in identifying pulmonary involvement during respiratory tract infection of possible viral etiology (SARS-Cov-2). Moreover, we observed a statistically significant decrease of X-ray (XR) and ultrasound (US) studies during phase 1 compared to phase 0 and phase 2 probably due to a reduction in the numbers of ER visits for minor traumas given the mobility restrictions and people hesitancy in visiting the ER due to fear of contagion. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that the activity of the ERD was heavily impacted by the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Further studies will be needed to estimate the impact of the pandemic on public health in terms of excess mortality related to delayed diagnosis and care of non-COVID diseases.","Garlisi, C; Licandro, D; Siani, A; Rodolfi, S; Pansini, S; Garcia Navarro, L I; Carriero, A; Avanzi, G C; Castello, L M",Emerg. radiol,,224

Most low-income countries have poor sanitation and wastewater management policies, which create potential risks of COVID 19 spread. Hence, the proposed measures include decentralization of wastewater treatment facilities, community-wide monitoring and testing of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples, improved sanitation, developing point-of-use devices for wastewater decontamination, and more focused policy interventions. Therefore, this paper adds useful insights into the monitoring and management of ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in low-income countries.","Adelodun, Bashir; Ajibade, Fidelis Odedishemi; Ibrahim, Rahmat Gbemisola; Bakare, Hashim Olalekan; Choi, Kyung-Sook",Sci Total Environ,,224

591186,Effect of different levels of PEEP on mortality in ICU patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis,2021-07-03,"The coronavirus disease 2019 crisis is creating a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), most critically, N95 respirators for healthcare personnel. Our group was interested in the feasibility of ozone disinfection of N95 respirators as an alternative for healthcare professionals and organizations that might not have access to other disinfection devices. We tested the effectiveness of ozone on killing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) on three different N95 respirators: 3M 1860, 3M 1870, and 3M 8000. We used an ozone chamber that consisted of: an airtight chamber, an ozone generator, an ozone destruct unit, and an ozone UV analyzer. The chamber was capable of concentrating ozone up to 500 parts per million (ppm) from ambient air, creating an airtight seal, and precisely measuring ozone levels within the chamber. Exposure to ozone at 400 ppm with 80% humidity for two hours effectively killed bacteria on N95 respirators, types 1860, 1870, and 8000. There were no significant changes in filtration efficiency of the 1860 and 1870 type respirators for up to ten cycles of ozone exposure at similar conditions. There was no change in fit observed in the 1870 type respirator after ozone exposure. There was no significant change in the strap integrity of the 1870 type respirator after ozone exposure. Tests for filtration efficiency were not performed on the 8000 type respirator. Tests for fit or strap integrity were not performed on the 8000 or 1860 type respirators. This study demonstrates that an ozone application achieves a high level of disinfection against PsA, a vegetative bacteria that the CDC identifies as more difficult to kill than medium sized viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19). Furthermore, conditions shown to kill these bacteria did not damage or degrade respirator filtration. This is the first report of successful disinfection of N95 PPE with ozone of which the authors are aware. It is also the first report, to the authors' knowledge, to identify necessary conditions for ozone to kill organisms on N95 masks without degrading the function of N95 filters.","Manning, E.

TaqMan–PCR was optimized to quantify BVD virus using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system and dual-labeled fluorogenic probes. Two different gene specific labeled fluorogenic probes for the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) were used to differentiate between BVD types I and II. Sensitivity of the single tube TaqMan assay was compared with two-tube TaqMan assay and standard RT–PCR using 10-fold dilutions of RNA. Single tube TaqMan assay was 10–100-fold more sensitive than the two-tube TaqMan assay and the standardized single tube RT–PCR. Specificity of the assay was evaluated by testing different BVD virus strains and other bovine viruses. A total of 106 BVD positive and negative pooled or single serum samples, field isolates and reference strains were tested. Quantitation of cRNA from types I and II BVD virus was accomplished by a standard curve plotting cycle threshold values (C(T)) versus copy number.

Are physicians, nurses and other healthcare workers morally obligated to put themselves in harm’s way and treat patients during a pandemic, occurring a great risk to themselves, their families and potentially to other patients? The issue was relevant during the 1918 influenza epidemic and more recently severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003. Since the risk to the healthcare workers was great, there was tension between the ethical duty and responsibility to treat and the risk to one’s own life. This tension was further noted during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa that left hundreds of healthcare workers dead. The AMA Code of Ethics states that physicians are to ‘provide urgent medical care during disasters…even in the face of greater than usual risk to physicians’ own safety, health or life.’1 Classic Jewish sources have dealt with this question as well. There is an obligation ‘to not stand by idly when your friends life is in danger’; however, the question arises as to whether there are limits to this obligation? Is one required to risk one’s own life to save another’s? There is a consensus that one is not required but the question open to debate is whether it is praiseworthy to do so. However, regarding healthcare workers, there is agreement for ethical, professional and societal reasons that they are required to put themselves in harm’s way to care for their patients.","Solnica, Amy; Barski, Leonid; Jotkowitz, Alan",J Med Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32424060/,224

This proportion is inappropriately high given that benefit from treatment with amoxicillin could only be demonstrated in adults with pneumonia (based on chest radiograph) or combined viral–bacterial infection (based on modern microbiological methodology). As routine use of chest radiographs and microbiological testing is costly, clinical prediction rules could be used to identify these patient subsets. In this secondary analysis of data from a multicentre randomised controlled trial in adults presenting to primary care with acute cough, we used prediction rules for pneumonia or combined infection and assessed the effect of amoxicillin in patients predicted to have pneumonia or combined infection on symptom duration, symptom severity and illness deterioration. In total, 2056 patients that fulfilled all inclusion criteria were randomised, 1035 to amoxicillin, 1021 to placebo. Neither patients with a predicted pneumonia nor patients with a predicted combined infection were significantly more likely to benefit from amoxicillin. While the studied clinical prediction rules may help primary care clinicians to reduce antibiotic prescribing for low-risk patients, they did not identify adult acute cough patients that would benefit from amoxicillin treatment.","Bruyndonckx, Robin; Stuart, Beth; Little, Paul; Hens, Niel; Ieven, Margareta; Butler, Christopher C.; Verheij, Theo J.

However, it is unknown how competent and confident podiatrists are in administering CPR and how they would respond in an emergency. Having a health professional who has a competent knowledge of CPR and skills in basic life support, can improve survival rates from sudden cardiac arrest. Therefore, the aim of this study was to survey New Zealand podiatrists to determine their CPR knowledge and qualifications; beliefs about the application of CPR; and perceptions of their competency in CPR. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a web-based survey. Participants were New Zealand registered podiatrists with a current annual practising certificate. The 31-item survey included questions to elicit demographic information, CPR practice and attitudes, and CPR knowledge. Responses were collected between March and August 2020. RESULTS: 171 podiatrists responded to the survey. 16 % of the podiatrists (n = 28) had performed CPR in an emergency, with a 50 % success rate. Participants were predominantly female (n = 127, 74 %) and working in private practice (n = 140,82 %). Nearly half of respondents were younger than 40 years (n = 75,44 %) and had less than 10 years of clinical experience (n = 73, 43 %). Nearly all (n = 169,97 %) participants had received formal CPR training in the past two years, with 60 % (n = 105) receiving training in the past 12 months. Most respondents (n = 167,98 %) self-estimated their CPR ability as being effective, very effective, or extremely effective. Participants’ knowledge of CPR was variable, with the percentage of correct answers for CPR protocol statements ranging between 20 and 90 %. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first insight into New Zealand podiatrists’ CPR knowledge and perceptions. Podiatrists were found to have high levels of CPR confidence but demonstrated gaps in CPR knowledge. Currently, New Zealand registered podiatrists require biennial CPR re-certification. However, resuscitation authorities in New Zealand and overseas recommend an annual update of CPR skills. Based on this study’s findings, and in line with Australia and the United Kingdom, the authors recommend a change from biennial to annual CPR re-certification for podiatrists in New Zealand.

Transplant activities at our center continue, and notably, no patient has been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, social distancing, masking, and education for patients and donors are major pillars of prevention. We recommend potential transplant recipients and donors to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 with qRT-PCR, serum antibody detection, and a lung CT scan pretransplant. If possible, stem cells from HLA-matched unrelated donors by local processing laboratories should be cryopreserved and shipped before initiating pretransplant conditioning. An alternative HLA-haplotype-matched related donor should be identified and evaluated as a backup. The interval immediately after discharge is the time of greatest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection because of travel and exposure to infected persons. We recommend self-isolation and minimal contact with family members. Nonessential clinic visits should be deferred or substituted with telemedicine consultations if possible. These recommendations are based on our experience at a major transplant center in China.

The aim of the study was to describe and evaluate end-of-life care for patients dying from COVID-19 in hospitals in Sweden up until up until 12 November 2020. METHODS: Data were collected from the Swedish Register of Palliative Care. Hospital deaths during 2020 for patients with COVID-19 were included and compared to a reference cohort of hospital patients who died during 2019. Logistic regression was used to compare the groups and to control for impact of sex, age and a diagnosis of dementia. RESULTS: The COVID-19 group (1476 individuals) had a lower proportion of women and was older compared to the reference cohort (13,158 individuals), 81.8 versus 80.6 years (p < .001). Breathlessness was more commonly reported in the COVID-19 group compared to the reference cohort (72% vs 43%, p < .001). Furthermore, anxiety and delirium were more commonly and respiratory secretions, nausea and pain were less commonly reported during the last week in life in the COVID-19 group (p < .001 for all five symptoms). When present, complete relief of anxiety (p = .021), pain (p = .025) and respiratory secretions (p = .037) was more often achieved in the COVID-19 group. In the COVID-19 group, 57% had someone present at the time of death compared to 77% in the reference cohort (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The standard medical strategies for symptom relief and end-of-life care in hospitals seemed to be acceptable. Symptoms in COVID-19 deaths in hospitals were relieved as much as or even to a higher degree than in hospitals in 2019. Importantly, though, as a result of closing the hospitals to relatives and visitors, patients dying from COVID-19 more frequently died alone, and healthcare providers were not able to substitute for absent relatives.","Martinsson, Lisa; Bergström, Jonas; Hedman, Christel; Strang, Peter; Lundström, Staffan",BMC Palliat Care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-021-00785-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34210312/,224

The present cohort was 104 individuals with RA (73.1%) and AS (26.9%) who had previously completed surveys for the Patient Opinion Real-Time Anonymous Liaison (PORTAL) project in 2018. Participants completed an online survey between July and September 2020 assessing their experiences over the first national COVID-19 lockdown in New Zealand (March–May, 2020). Fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection, baseline anxiety, and being younger in age were all predictors of participants’ current anxiety levels. Current QOL scores were significantly lower than prior to lockdown and were predicted by baseline QOL and current depression. No variables predicted current depression other than baseline levels. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have had an impact on QOL and anxiety levels, but not depression for people with RA and AS in New Zealand. These novel findings imply that appropriate screening of mental health issues should be included in planning within the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and for future pandemics to optimise the wellbeing of people with RA and AS.","Johnstone, Grace; Treharne, Gareth J.; Fletcher, Benjamin D.; Lamar, Roisin S.

604854,The impact of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic on migraine disorder,2021-05-05,"Undoubtedly, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has received the greatest concern with a global impact, and this situation will continue for a long period of time. Looking back in history, airborne transimission diseases have caused huge casualties several times. COVID-19 as a typical airborne disease caught our attention and reminded us of the importance of preventing such diseases. Therefore, this study focuses on finding a new way to guard against the spread of these diseases such as COVID-19. This paper studies the dynamic electromechanical response of metal-core piezoelectric fiber/epoxy matrix composites, designed as mass load sensors for virus detection, by numerical modelling. The dynamic electromechanical response is simulated by applying an alternating current (AC) electric field to make the composite vibrate. Furthermore, both concentrated and distributed loads are considered to assess the sensitivity of the biosensor during modelling of the combination of both biomarker and viruses. The design parameters of this sensor, such as the resonant frequency, the position and size of the biomarker, will be studied and optimized as the key values to determine the sensitivity of detection. The novelty of this work is to propose functional composites that can detect the viruses from changes of the output voltage instead of the resonant frequency change using piezoelectric sensor and piezoelectric actuator. The contribution of this detection method will significantly shorten the detection time as it avoids fast Fourier transform (FFT) or discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The outcome of this research offers a reliable numerical model to optimize the design of the proposed biosensor for virus detection, which will contribute to the production of high-performance piezoelectric biosensors in the future.","Wang, Yinli; Shi, Yu; Narita, Fumio",Sens Actuators A Phys,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924424721002053; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sna.2021.112742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33840899/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424721002053?v=s5,224

Not doing adequate cosmetic care of skin, hair, and nails might be one of the underexplored but preventable reasons for the same. AIMS: To identify the change in cosmetic care habits of female undergraduate medical students during the coronavirus disease pandemic and to identify its psychological impacts on them. METHODS: A total of 218 individuals participated in this online study. Data were collected using a preset pro forma as a Google questionnaire to fulfill the objectives. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.5 and presented as percentage, mean, SD, median, IQR in tables and graphs. RESULTS: Mean age of the participants was 21.56 ± 1.95 years. Maximum respondents (66.0%) are not taking cosmetic care of skin, hair, and nail during the pandemic as before. More than two‐thirds (68.8%) are feeling bad, 31.2% are neutral, whereas none are feeling good because of this change. Second‐year students and the participants from rural locations are taking least cosmetic care (p < 0.05). However, coronavirus disease infection and major life events in the family did not affect it. Nail care was prioritized by the maximum (64.2%). Of all participants who are not doing cosmetic care as before, a maximum (50.0%) had lost self‐satisfaction followed by increased irritability (43.8%). CONCLUSIONS: A huge number of female medical students are not doing cosmetic care of their skin, hair, and nail during the coronavirus disease lockdown; they also perceive significant negative psychological impact because of this change.","Marahatta, Suchana; Singh, Aditi; Pyakurel, Prajjwal",J Cosmet Dermatol,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocd.14380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34383992/,224
607040,Meta-analysis Comparing Outcomes in Patients With and Without Cardiac Injury and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19),2020-11-18,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. The FDA authorized emergency use of HCQ against COVID-19. HCQ may have dose-related cardiotoxicity. This clinical trial received ethical approval on May 15, 2020, operationalized in June to evaluate a low prophylaxis dose of HCQ (200mg BID) in household contacts of COVID-19-positive patients without physical contact between investigators and participants. It represents the first report of the FDA approved 6-lead EKGs with a smartphone KardiaMobile® 6L application. METHODS: To reach a sample size of 170, household members were contacted by telephone, emailed consent forms with electronic signature capability, and randomized 2:1 to HCQ or observation for 10 days with follow-up of 14 days. Home saliva PCR tests recorded COVID status on days 1 and 14. Symptoms and 6-lead EKGs were obtained daily. RESULTS: Fifty-one participants were randomized with 42 evaluable at day 14. Remote monitoring of 407 EKGs revealed no QTc prolongation or other ECG changes in either group. At time of consent, no participants were symptomatic or COVID+. On days 1 and 14, COVID tests were positive in 4 and 2 in the HCQ group and 4 and 0 in the observation group. No tests converted to positive. There were no deaths or hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: A clinical trial without personal contact, rapidly initiated and operationalized to exclude cardiac toxicity using daily remote 6-lead EKG monitoring, is feasible. Of 407 EKGs from 42 participants, there was no evidence of cardiac toxicity.

610278,Comorbidities and the risk of severe or fatal outcomes associated with coronavirus disease 2019: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-07-25,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic involving >5 500 000 cases worldwide as of May 26, 2020. The culprit is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, which invades cells by binding to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). While the majority of patients mount an appropriate antiviral response and recover at home, others progress to respiratory distress requiring hospital admission for supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, deterioration to acute respiratory distress syndrome necessitating mechanical ventilation, development of severe thrombotic events, or cardiac injury and dysfunction occurs. In this review, we highlight what is known to date about COVID-19 and cardiovascular risk, focusing in on the putative role of the endothelium in disease susceptibility and pathogenesis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Cytokine-driven vascular leak in the lung alveolar-endothelial interface facilitates acute lung injury in the setting of viral infection. Given that the virus affects multiple organs, including the heart, it likely gains access into systemic circulation by infecting or passing from the respiratory epithelium to the endothelium for viral dissemination. Indeed, cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 are highly prevalent and include acute cardiac injury, myocarditis, and a hypercoagulable state, all of which may be influenced by altered endothelial function. Notably, the disease course is worse in individuals with preexisting comorbidities that involve endothelial dysfunction and may be linked to elevated ACE2 expression, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Rapidly emerging data on COVID-19, together with results from studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1, are providing insight into how endothelial dysfunction may contribute to the pandemic that is paralyzing the globe. This may, in turn, inform the design of biomarkers predictive of disease course, as well as therapeutics targeting pathogenic endothelial responses.","Gustafson, Dakota; Raju, Sneha; Wu, Ruilin; Ching, Crizza; Veitch, Shawn; Rathnakumar, Kumaragurubaran; Boudreau, Emilie; Howe, Kathryn L.; Fish, Jason E.",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,https://doi.org/10.1161/atvbaha.120.314558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32510978/,224

METHODS: Subjects were 6 older adults who could walk independently and 10 older adults requiring walking assistance during gait. Total energy expenditure (TEE) was measured using the doubly labelled water (DLW) method over 2 weeks and PAL was calculated as the measured TEE divided by the basal metabolic rate measured using indirect calorimetry (PAL(DLW)). The participants wore a tri-axial accelerometer (Active style Pro HJA-750C) on the waist simultaneously as the DLW period, and the estimated PAL was derived from it (PAL(ACC)). RESULTS: The median PAL estimation error in the assisted walking group was −0.30 kcal/day (range: −0.77 to −0.01 kcal/day) and more underestimated than that in the independent walking group (p=0.02). The estimation error of PAL(ACC) was significantly correlated with PAL(DLW) (r=−0.80, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Using the accelerometer, PAL was underestimated for older adults who used walking aids but not for those who walked independently under free-living conditions.","Nishida, Yuki; Tanaka, Shigeho; Hatamoto, Yoichi; Hatanaka, Mana; Ishikawa-Takata, Kazuko; Abe, Takayuki; Higaki, Yasuki; Katsukawa, Fuminori",BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsem-2020-001014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249373/,224
612967,Mathematical Modeling and a Month Ahead Forecast of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: An Indian Scenario,2020-09-11,"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Relying on capacity increases and patient transfers to deal with the huge and continuous inflow of COVID-19 critically ill patients is a strategy limited by finite human and logistical resources. RATIONALE: Prioritising both critical care initiation and continuation is paramount to save the greatest number of lives. It enables to allocate scarce resources in priority to those with the highest probability of benefiting from them. It is fully ethical provided it relies on objective and widely shared criteria, thus preventing arbitrary decisions and guaranteeing equity. Prioritisation seeks to fairly allocate treatments, maximise saved lives, gain indirect life benefits from prioritising exposed healthcare and similar workers, give priority to those most penalised as a last resort, and apply similar prioritisation schemes to all patients. PRIORITISATION STRATEGY: Prioritisation schemes and their criteria are adjusted to the level of resource scarcity: strain (level A) or saturation (level B). Prioritisation yields a four level priority for initiation or continuation of critical care: P1 – high priority, P2 – intermediate priority, P3 – not needed, P4 – not appropriate. Prioritisation schemes take into account the patient’s wishes, clinical frailty, pre-existing chronic condition, along with severity and evolution of acute condition. Initial priority level must be reassessed, at least after 48 h once missing decision elements are available, at the typical turning point in the disease’s natural history (ICU days 7 to 10 for COVID-19), and each time resource scarcity levels change. For treatments to be withheld or withdrawn, a collegial decision-making process and information of patient and/or next of kin are paramount. PERSPECTIVE: Prioritisation strategy is bound to evolve with new knowledge and with changes within the epidemiological situation.","Leclerc, Thomas; Donat, Nicolas; Donat, Alexis; Pasquier, Pierre; Nicolas, Libert; Schaeffer, Elodie; D’aranda, Erwan; Cotte, Jean; Fontaine, Bruno; Perrigault, Pierre-François; Michel, Fabrice; Muller, Laurent; Meaudre, Eric; Veber, Benoît",Anaesth Crit Care Pain Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352556820300916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426441/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352556820300916?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accpm.2020.05.008,224
613097,Renal Resistive Index as a Predictor of Acute Kidney Injury and Mortality in COVID-19 Critically Ill Patients,2021-07-19,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has proved to be a historic challenge for healthcare systems, particularly with regard to cancer patients. So far, very limited data have been presented on the impact on integrated care pathways (ICPs). METHODS: We reviewed the ICPs of lung cancer patients who accessed the Veneto Institute of Oncology (IOV)/University Hospital of Padua (Center 1) and the University Hospital of Verona (Center 2) before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, through sixteen indicators chosen by the members of a multidisciplinary team (MDT). RESULTS: Two window periods (March and April 2019 and 2020) were chosen for comparison. Endoscopic diagnostic procedures and major resections for early stage NSCLC patients increased at Center 1, where a priority pathway with dedicated personnel was established for cancer patients. A slight decrease was observed at Center 2 which became part of the COVID unit. Personnel shortage and different processing methods of tumor samples determined a slightly longer time for diagnostic pathway completion at both Centers. Personnel protection strategies led to a MDT reshape on a web basis and to a significant selection of cases to be discussed in both Centers. The optimization of patient access to healthcare units reduced first outpatient oncological visits, patient enrollment in clinical trials, and end-of-life cancer systemic treatments; finally, a higher proportion of hypofractionation was delivered as a radiotherapy approach for early stage and locally advanced NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the experience of the two Centers, we identified the key steps in ICP that were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic so as to proactively put in place a robust service provision of thoracic oncology.","Pasello, Giulia; Menis, Jessica; Pilotto, Sara; Frega, Stefano; Belluomini, Lorenzo; Pezzuto, Federica; Caliò, Anna; Sepulcri, Matteo; Cernusco, Nunzia Luna Valentina; Schiavon, Marco; Infante, Maurizio Valentino; Damin, Marco; Micheletto, Claudio; Del Bianco, Paola; Giovannetti, Riccardo; Bonanno, Laura; Fantoni, Umberto; Guarneri, Valentina; Calabrese, Fiorella; Rea, Federico; Milella, Michele; Conte, PierFranco",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.669786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262861/,224

614040,Rheumatologists’ practice during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: a survey in Egypt,2020-07-24,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become the most severe global health issue. Abnormal liver functions are frequently reported in these patients. However, liver function abnormality was often overlooked during COVID-19 treatment, and data regarding liver functions after cure of COVID-19 is limited. This study aimed to reveal the changes of liver function tests (LFTs) during hospitalization, and its clinical significance in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective, bi-center study, a total of 158 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in China were included from January 22nd, 2020 to February 20th, 2020. Clinical features, laboratory parameters including LFTs, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. LFTs included alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and total bilirubin. Patients were considered with abnormal LFTs when any value of these tests was higher than upper limit of normal. RESULTS: Of 158 patients with COVID-19, 67 (42.41%) patients had abnormal LFTs on admission and another 50 (31.65%) patients developed abnormal LFTs during hospitalization. The incidence of LFTs abnormality in severe COVID-19 cases was significantly higher than non-severe cases. All LFTs in COVID-19 patients were correlated with oxygenation index. There was no statistical difference in treatment between the patients with or without liver test abnormalities. By the time of discharge, there were still 64 (40.50%) patients with abnormal LFTs. Logistic regression analysis identified younger age, hypertension and low lymphocyte counts as independent risk factors for persistent abnormal LFTs during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Liver function tests abnormality was common in COVID-19 patients and was more prevalent in severe cases than in non-severe cases. A substantial percentage of patients still had abnormal LFTs by the time of discharge.","Gan, Qinyi; Gong, Beilei; Sun, Manli; Cao, Zhujun; Zheng, Yuyan; Zhang, Yajie; Wen, Pengfei; Shen, Yuanbing; Hong, Lei; Hou, Tingting; Jia, Yuqin; Li, Wei; Li, Hecheng; Xie, Qing",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33815147/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.642922,224

These variants had unusually high genetic changes in the spike (S) protein. In an attempt to understand the genetic background of SARS‐CoV‐2 viruses in Hong Kong, especially before vaccination, the purpose of this study is to summarize the S protein mutations detected among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients in Hong Kong in 2020. COVID‐19 cases were selected every month in 2020. One virus from each case was analyzed. The full encoding region of the S proteins was sequenced. From January 2020 to December 2020, a total of 340 COVID‐19 viruses were sequenced. The amino acids of the S protein for 44 (12.9%) were identical to the reference sequence, WIV04 (GenBank accession MN996528). For the remaining 296 sequences (87.1%), a total of 43 nonsynonymous substitution patterns were found. Of the nonsynonymous substitutions found, some of them were only detected at specific time intervals and then they disappeared. The ongoing genetic surveillance system is important. It would facilitate early detection of mutations that can increase infectivity as well as mutations that are selected for the virus to escape immunological restraint.","Mak, Gannon C.

Our study aimed to analyze m(6)A RNA methylation regulators and m(6)A-related genes to understand the prognosis of early lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The relevant datasets were utilized to analyze 21 m(6)A RNA methylation regulators and 5,486 m(6)A-related genes in m(6)Avar. Univariate Cox regression analysis, random survival forest analysis, Kaplan–Meier analysis, Chi-square analysis, and multivariate cox analysis were carried out on the datasets, and a risk prognostic model based on three feature genes was constructed. RESULTS: Respectively, we treated GSE31210 (n = 226) as the training set, GSE50081 (n = 128) and TCGA data (n = 400) as the test set. By performing univariable cox regression analysis and random survival forest algorithm in the training group, 218 genes were significant and three prognosis-related genes (ZCRB1, ADH1C, and YTHDC2) were screened out, which could divide LUAD patients into low and high-risk group (P < 0.0001). The predictive efficacy of the model was confirmed in the test group GSE50081 (P = 0.0018) and the TCGA datasets (P = 0.014). Multivariable cox manifested that the three-gene signature was an independent risk factor in LUAD. Furthermore, genes in the signature were also externally validated using the online database. Moreover, YTHDC2 was the important gene in the risk score model and played a vital role in readers of m(6)A methylation. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggested that associated with m(6)A RNA methylation regulators and m(6)A-related genes, the three-gene signature was a reliable prognostic indicator for LUAD patients, indicating a clinical application prospect to serve as a potential therapeutic target.","Guo, Bingzhou; Zhang, Hongliang; Wang, Jinliang; Wu, Rilige; Zhang, Junyan; Zhang, Qiqin; Xu, Lu; Shen, Ming; Zhang, Zhibo; Gu, Fangyan; Zeng, Weiliang; Jia, Xiaodong; Yin, Chengliang",Front Genet,https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.656114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34178026/,224
620027,Factors Associated with the Incidence and Mortality of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) after 126-million Cases: A Meta-analysis,2021-09-11,"COVID-19 has led to the enormous rise of medical wastes throughout the world, and these have mainly been generated from hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare establishments. This creates an additional challenge in medical waste management, particularly in developing countries. Improper managing of medical waste may have serious public health issues and a significant impact on the environment. There are currently three disinfection technologies, namely incineration, chemical, and physical, that are available to treat COVID-19 medical waste (CMW). This study focuses on thermochemical process, particularly the pyrolysis process to treat medical waste. Pyrolysis is a process that utilizes the instability of organic components in medical waste to convert it into valuable products. Besides, the technique is environmentally friendly, more efficient, requires less landfill capacity, causes lower pollution, and cost-effective. The current pandemic situation generates a high amount of plastic medical waste, which has components like polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and nylon (N). These plastic wastes can be converted into valuable energy products like oil, gas and char through the pyrolysis process. This study provides detailed information about CMW handling, treatments, valuable product generations (biofuels), and proper discharge into the open environment.","Dharmaraj, Selvakumar; Ashokkumar, Veeramuthu; Pandiyan, Rajesh; Halimatul Munawaroh, Heli Siti; Chew, Kit Wayne; Chen, Wei-Hsin; Ngamcharussrivichai, Chawalit",Chemosphere,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653521005610?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0045653521005610; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984908/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130092,224
620293,Children Witnessing Domestic and Family Violence: A Widespread Occurrence during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,2021-05-05,"BACKGROUND: Methanol is widely used in industry; however, methanol poisoning is not common. In this regard, a number of outbreaks have been recently reported due to inappropriate processing of alcoholic beverages. Shiraz, a city located in the southern part of Iran, faced one of such outbreaks in 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic. There is no sufficient literature on the electrocardiographic findings in methanol toxicity. This study aimed to address this gap in the literature. METHOD: A total of 356 cases with methanol toxicity referred to Shiraz University of Medical Science Tertiary Hospitals (Faghihi and Namazi) in March and April, 2020. The clinical findings of blindness and impaired level of consciousness, lab data such as arterial blood gas, electrolytes, and creatinine, and the most common findings from ECGs were collected. RESULTS: The most common ECG findings were J point elevation (68.8%), presence of U wave (59.2%), QTc prolongation (53.2% in males and 28.6% in females), and fragmented QRS (33.7%). An outstanding finding in this study was the presence of myocardial infarction in 5.3% of the cases. This finding, to the best of our knowledge, has only been reported in a few case reports. Brugada pattern (8.1%) and Osborn wave (3.7%) were the other interesting findings. In multivariate analysis, when confounding factors were adjusted, myocardial infarction, atrioventricular conduction disturbances, sinus tachycardia, and the prolonged QTC > 500 msecond were four independent factors correlated with methanol toxicity severity measured with arterial blood PH on arterial blood gas measurements, with odds ratios of 12.82, 4.46, 2.32 and 3.15 (P < 0.05 for all), respectively. CONCLUSION: Electrocardiographic variations during methanol intoxication are remarkable and well-correlated with poisoning severity.

A much-needed step. The assaults on doctors have been happening in hospitals in India for a long time. This review article traces the journey of the Prevention of the Doctors Violence Act and suggests a way forward with regard to violence on the doctors and why there must be a permanent solution for the same. Methodology is based on a detailed study across a range of published literature in journals, articles, and other online sources. An extensive review has been undertaken of these articles based on an explanatory approach. The review provided insight into the current status of violence against doctors. Most of the initiatives on prevention of violence against doctors mentioned in the studies are mainly directed towards patient-doctor relationship, lack of infrastructure, strenuous working environment, and societal obligations. Study findings revealed that there was less emphasis on the current legal measures available and its implementation. This article highlights the critical aspect of protection of the health care workforce and also shares recommendations to enhance the protection of doctors at their workplace by sharing the current state-level legal measures available and advocates the impelling need for central legislation. These recommendations have been suggested as a combined effort of the medical fraternity, media, and the academic community.","Kuppuswamy, Gayathri; Warrier, Uma",J Family Med Prim Care,https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_912_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34017700/,224

METHODS: To evaluate the quality of the Ambu-aScope4 disposable bronchoscope, we carried out a cross-sectional study in 21 Spanish pulmonology services. We use a standardized questionnaire completed by the bronchoscopists at the end of each bronchoscopy. The variables were described with absolute and relative frequencies, measures of central tendency and dispersion depending on their nature. The existence of learning curves was evaluated by CUSUM analysis. RESULTS: The most frequent indications in 300 included bronchoscopies was bronchial aspiration in 69.3% and the median duration of these was 9.1 min. The route of entry was nasal in 47.2% and oral in 34.1%. The average score for ease of use, image, and aspiration quality was 80/100. All the planned techniques were performed in 94.9% and the bronchoscopist was satisfied in 96.6% of the bronchoscopies. They highlighted the portability and immediacy of the aScope4TM to start the procedure in 99.3%, the possibility of taking and storing images in 99.3%. The CUSUM analysis showed average scores > 70/100 from the first procedure and from the 9th procedure more than 80% of the scores exceeded the 80/100 score. CONCLUSIONS: The aScope4™ scored well for ease of use, imaging, and aspiration. We found a learning curve with excellent scores from the 9th procedure.

624661,Coagulopathy in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-07-16,"PURPOSE: We evaluated the impact of a virtual radiation oncology clerkship. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a 2-week virtual radiation oncology clerkship that launched on April 27, 2020. Clerkship components included a virtual clinic with radiation oncology faculty and residents, didactic lectures, student talks, and supplemental sessions such as tumor boards and chart rounds. Medical students completed pre- and post-clerkship self-assessments. Faculty and resident participants also completed surveys on their experience with virtual lectures and clinics. Pre- and post-clerkship results were compared using a 2-sided paired t test. An analysis of variance model was used to analyze the clerkship components. RESULTS: Twenty-six medical students, including 4 visiting students, enrolled over 2 clerkship periods (4 weeks). All students completed the pre- and post-clerkship self-assessments and agreed that the clerkship improved their understanding of radiation oncology. Compared with 3 (11.5%) students who agreed that they understood the daily responsibilities of a radiation oncologist before the clerkship, 22 (84.6%) students agreed and 3 (11.5%) strongly agreed that they understood the daily responsibilities of a radiation oncologist after the clerkship (P < .0001). Although 15 students (57.7%) reported an increased interest in radiation oncology because of the clerkship, the mean level of interest in radiation oncology as a career remained the same, with pre- and post-clerkship scores of 3.0 (±0.9) and 3.0 (±1.1) on a 5-point scale, respectively (P = .7). Students found virtual clinic and didactic lectures to be the most valuable components of the clerkship. Most respondents agreed (30.8%) or strongly agreed (65.4%) to recommend the clerkship to their classmates. CONCLUSIONS: Our virtual clerkship was effective in increasing medical student interest in and knowledge about radiation oncology.

METHODS: The training cohort were consecutive patients with COVID-19 in the First People’s Hospital of Jiangxia District in Wuhan from January 7, 2020 to February 11, 2020. We selected baseline clinical and laboratory data through the stepwise Akaike information criterion and ensemble XGBoost model to build mortality-prediction models. We then validated these models by randomly collecting COVID-19 patients in the Infection department of Union Hospital in Wuhan from January 1, 2020, to February 20, 2020. RESULTS: 296 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the training cohort, 19 of whom died during hospitalization and 277 were discharged from the hospital. The clinical model developed with age, history of hypertension and coronary heart disease showed AUC of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80-0.95); threshold, -2.6551; sensitivity, 92.31%; specificity, 77.44% and negative predictive value (NPV), 99.34%. The laboratory model developed with age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), neutrophil and lymphocyte count, D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) had a significantly stronger discriminatory power than the clinical model (p=0.0157), with AUC of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99); threshold, -2.998; sensitivity, 100.00%; specificity, 92.82% and NPV, 100.00%.

627582,Electrical impedance tomography: A compass for the safe route to optimal PEEP,2021,"BACKGROUND Social media enables the rapid consumption of news related to COVID-19 and serves as a platform for discussions. Its richness in text-based data in the form of posts and comments allows researchers to identify popular topics and assess public sentiment. Yet, the vast majority of topic extraction and sentiment analysis based on social media is done on the platform or country level and does not account for local culture and policies. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to use location-based subreddits on Reddit to study city-level variations in sentiments toward vaccine-related topics. METHODS Comments made on posts providing regular updates on COVID-19 statistics in the Vancouver (r/vancouver, 49,291), Toronto (r/toronto, 20,764), and Calgary (r/calgary, 21,277) subreddits between July 13th, 2020 and June 14th, 2021 were extracted. Latent Dirichlet allocation was used to identify frequently discussed topics. Sentiment (joy, sadness, fear, and anger) scores were assigned to comments using random forest regression. RESULTS The number of comments made on the 250 posts from the Vancouver subreddit positively correlated with the number of new daily COVID-19 cases in British Columbia (R = 0.51, 95% CI for slope = [0.18,0.29], P < 0.001). From the comments, thirteen topics were identified. Two were related to vaccines, one regarding vaccine uptake and the other about vaccine supply. The levels of discussion for both topics were linked to the total number of vaccinations given (Granger test for causality: P < 0.001). Comments pertaining to either topic displayed higher scores for joy compared to comments about other topics (P < 0.001). Calgary and Toronto also discussed vaccine uptake. Sentiment scores for this topic differed across the three cities (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Our work demonstrates that data from city-specific subreddits can be used to better understand concerns and sentiments around COVID-19 vaccines at the local level. This can potentially lead to more targeted and publicly-acceptable policies based on content on social media.

However, the field lacks methodology to assess synergistic or antagonistic interactions for drugs with non-traditional dose response curves. Specifically, our goal was to assess small-molecule modulators of antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven gene expression, which is largely regulated by the Nrf2 transcription factor. Known as Nrf2 activators, this class of compounds upregulates a battery of cytoprotective genes and shows significant promise for prevention of numerous chronic diseases. For example, sulforaphane sourced from broccoli sprouts is the subject of over 70 clinical trials. Nrf2 activators generally have non-traditional dose response curves that are hormetic, or U-shaped. We introduce a method based on the principles of Loewe Additivity to assess synergism and antagonism for two compounds in combination. This method, termed Dose-Equivalence/Zero Interaction (DE/ZI), can be used with traditional Hill-slope response curves, and it also can assess interactions for compounds with non-traditional curves, using a nearest-neighbor approach. Using a Monte-Carlo method, DE/ZI generates a measure of synergy or antagonism for each dosing pair with an associated error and p-value, resulting in a 3D response surface. For the assessed Nrf2 activators, sulforaphane and di-tert-butylhydroquinone, this approach revealed synergistic interactions at higher dosing concentrations consistently across data sets and potential antagonistic interactions at lower concentrations. DE/ZI eliminates the need to determine the best fit equation for a given data set and values experimentally-derived results over formulated fits.","Repash, Elizabeth M.; Pensabene, Kaitlin M.; Palenchar, Peter M.; Eggler, Aimee L.",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34163365/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.686201,224
633034,Experimental Models and Emerging Hypotheses for Acute Lung Injury,2011-07-01,"This paper examines the different socio-economic determinants of the fatalities associated with the COVID-19 pandemic globally in social determinants of health frameworks. It adapts the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PPML) and the quantile regression techniques to effectively exploit the non-linear estimates of the data in order to derive non-biased point estimates at each quantile and make interquantile comparisons. This is particularly useful in recommending which societal variables become most significant at catastrophic levels of a pandemic like COVID-19 when existing health systems become overwhelmed. These estimators are applied to panel data for 196 countries over days of infection from the first recorded case. The COVID-19-related data is from Our World in Data, and the socio-economic variables are from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. The results establish that an improved adequate health infrastructure for both testing and treatment is necessary, but not sufficient. Health systems ultimately become overwhelmed and ineffective in managing cases and reducing mortality in the face of the rising pandemic. Complementary social, economic, physical and environmental factors are necessary for curbing deaths. These factors relate to improving the health stock of the population through reductions in both communicable and non-communicable comorbidities; enhancing sanitation and hygiene; and improving the nutrition of the population. Socio-economic and environmental measures are the reduction of household and ambient air pollution; reduction of exposure to alcohol and cigarettes; reduction of poverty and ensuring economic inclusion; and learning from the past to fine-tune governments’ control measures in order to minimize harm to the population while effectively curbing mortality.","Ngepah, Nicholas",Health Policy Plan,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czaa161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439993/,224

WBC count and peripheral blood lymphocytes are normal or slightly reduced while these indicators may change with the progression of the disease. In addition, several studies demonstrated that decreased hemoglobin levels in COVID‐19 patients were associated with the severity of the disease. Moreover, thrombocytopenia, which is reported in 5%‐40% of patients, is known to be associated with poor prognosis of the disease. COVID‐19 can present with various hematologic manifestations.

In the context of the social determinants of health, focusing on health system preparedness is paramount for protecting the health of all of society. Faced with old threats (e.g., re-emergence of measles), disruptive new technologies (e.g., electronic cigarettes), increased challenges (e.g. drug-resistant organisms), and new threats (e.g., the current pandemic, climate change, politicized misinformation), our health systems must be robust and resilient. The response must include those who now suffer disproportionately—the poor and the vulnerable. Current World Health Organization priorities call for infrastructures capable of detecting, monitoring, and responding to health emergencies, such as COVID-19, and the health impacts of climate change in the context of health for all.

Many mathematical models have been developed to understand and predict the infectiousness of COVID-19. We aim to summarize these models to inform efforts to manage the current outbreak. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv, Preprints, and National Knowledge Infrastructure (Chinese database) for relevant studies published between 1 December 2019 and 21 February 2020. References were screened for additional publications. Crucial indicators were extracted and analysed. We also built a mathematical model for the evolution of the epidemic in Wuhan that synthesised extracted indicators. Results: Fifty-two articles involving 75 mathematical or statistical models were included in our systematic review. The overall median basic reproduction number (R(0)) was 3.77 [interquartile range (IQR) 2.78–5.13], which dropped to a controlled reproduction number (R(c)) of 1.88 (IQR 1.41–2.24) after city lockdown. The median incubation and infectious periods were 5.90 (IQR 4.78–6.25) and 9.94 (IQR 3.93–13.50) days, respectively. The median case-fatality rate (CFR) was 2.9% (IQR 2.3–5.4%). Our mathematical model showed that, in Wuhan, the peak time of infection is likely to be March 2020 with a median size of 98,333 infected cases (range 55,225–188,284). The earliest elimination of ongoing transmission is likely to be achieved around 7 May 2020. Conclusions: Our analysis found a sustained R(c) and prolonged incubation/ infectious periods, suggesting COVID-19 is highly infectious. Although interventions in China have been effective in controlling secondary transmission, sustained global efforts are needed to contain an emerging pandemic. Alternative interventions can be explored using modelling studies to better inform policymaking as the outbreak continues.","Lin, Yi-Fan; Duan, Qibin; Zhou, Yiguo; Yuan, Tanwei; Li, Peiyang; Fitzpatrick, Thomas; Fu, Leiwen; Feng, Anping; Luo, Ganfeng; Zhan, Yuewei; Liang, Bowen; Fan, Song; Lu, Yong; Wang, Bingyi; Wang, Zhenyu; Zhao, Heping; Gao, Yanxiao; Li, Meijuan; Chen, Dahui; Chen, Xiaoting; Ao, Yunlong; Li, Linghua; Cai, Weiping; Du, Xiangjun; Shu, Yuelong; Zou, Huachun",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32626719/,224

Healthy soil availability is the limiting parameter in the provision of a number of these services. As a result of anthropogenic abuses, and natural and global warming‐promoted extreme weather events, Planet Earth is currently experiencing an unprecedented crisis of soil deterioration, desertification and erosive loss that increasingly prejudices the services it provides. Such services are pivotal to the Sustainability Development Goals formulated by the United Nations. Immediate and coordinated action on a global scale is urgently required to slow and ultimately reverse the loss of healthy soils. Despite the ‘dirt‐dust’, non‐vital appearance of soil, it is a highly dynamic living entity, whose life is overwhelmingly microbial. The soil microbiota, which constitutes the greatest reservoir and donor of microbial diversity on Earth, acts as a vast bioreactor, mediating a myriad of chemical reactions that turn the biogeochemical cycles, recycle wastes, purify water, and underpin the multitude of other services soil provides. Fuelling the belowground microbial bioreactor is the aboveground plant and photosynthetic surface microbial life which captures solar energy, fixes inorganic CO(2) to organic carbon, and channels fixed carbon and energy into soil. In order to muster an effective response to the crisis, to avoid further deterioration, and to restore unhealthy soils, we need a new and coherent approach, namely to deal with soils worldwide as patients in need of health care and create (i) a public health system for development of effective policies for land use, conservation, restoration, recommendations of prophylactic measures, monitoring and identification of problems (epidemiology), organizing crisis responses, etc., and (ii) a healthcare system charged with soil care: the promotion of good practices, implementation of prophylaxis measures, and institution of therapies for treatment of unhealthy soils and restoration of drylands. These systems need to be national but there is also a desperate need for international coordination. To enable development of effective, evidence‐based strategies that will underpin the efforts of soil healthcare systems, a substantial investment in wide‐ranging interdisciplinary research on soil health and disease is mandatory. This must lead to a level of understanding of the soil:biota functionalities underlying key ecosystem services that enables formulation of effective diagnosis‐prophylaxis‐therapy pathways for sustainable use, protection and restoration of different types of soil resources in different climatic zones. These conservation‐regenerative‐restorative measures need to be complemented by an educative‐political‐economic‐legislative framework that provides incentives encouraging soil care: knowledge, policy, economic and others, and laws which promote international adherence to the principles of restorative soil management. And: we must all be engaged in improving soil health; everyone has a duty of care (https://www.bbc.co.uk/ideas/videos/why‐soil‐is‐one‐of‐the‐most‐amazing‐things‐on‐eart/p090cf64). Creative application of microbes, microbiomes and microbial biotechnology will be central to the successful operation of the healthcare systems.","Timmis, Kenneth; Ramos, Juan Luis",Microb Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33751840/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.13771,224
639454,The novel zoonotic Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: Health perspective on the outbreak,2020-10-14,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic poses significant challenges for the management of patients with cancer. In our institution, we adapted our delivery of outpatient systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) by introducing a number of ‘risk-reducing’ measures including pre-assessment screening. AIMS: We sought to evaluate the experience and perceptions of patients with cancer undergoing SACT during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients on SACT during the Covid-19 pandemic were eligible for participation. Data were collected by anonymous survey over a 1 week period during the most intensive phase of government restrictions. Patients were asked questions under three headings: perceived risk of infection exposure, changes to treatment plan and psychological impact of Covid-19. RESULTS: One hundred patients were assessed, 60% were male, 41% were > 65 years of age and 67% had advanced cancer. Eleven percent of patients were living alone. Fifty-seven percent reported feeling at increased risk in general of contracting Covid-19. Sixty-eight percent of patients did not feel worried about contracting Covid-19 in the hospital. Ninety-two percent of patients reported wanting to continue on SACT as originally planned. Fifty-eighty percent felt isolated and 40% reported increased anxiety. CONCLUSION: Though patients on active treatment for cancer during the Covid-19 pandemic reported increased anxiety and feelings of isolation due to Covid-19, the majority of patients wanted to continue SACT as originally planned. Patients would benefit from enhanced psycho-oncological supports in the event of a prolonged Covid-19 pandemic.","Hennessy, Maeve A.; Linehan, Anna; Cowzer, Darren; Coyne, Zachary L.; Fitzpatrick, Orla; Barrett, Fiona; Ni Dhonaill, Roisin; Hennessy, Bryan T.; Grogan, Liam; Morris, Patrick G.; Breathnach, Oscar S.",Ir J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33449325/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02457-3,224

OBJECTIVE: To detect SARS-CoV-2 in expressed breast milk (EBM) of mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 and clinical outcome of neonates delivered and breast fed by them. DESIGN: A single-centre, prospective observational study involving 50 SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers and their 51 neonates. SETTING: A tertiary care hospital in Eastern India. PARTICIPANTS: SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers and neonates delivered by them. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the breast milk of mothers, who tested positive for this virus in their nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). Clinical outcome was assessed in neonates breast fed by these mothers after 1 month of the postnatal period. RESULTS: 50 SARS-CoV-2-positive expectant mothers were enrolled for the study. One out of 51 neonates, who delivered through lower segment caesarean section at term gestation and tested SARS-CoV-2 negative, died due to severe birth asphyxia. One sample of EBM was collected from each of the 49 mothers within 4 days of delivery. All EBM samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 through real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). All the newborns were screened twice for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their NPS, by RT-PCR. 2 of 51 neonates had COVID-19 infection after 24 hours of life. Caregivers of 37 of 50 alive neonates responded to follow-up via telephone. Except for minor feed intolerance in one (1 of 37) neonate, all neonates were reported well after 1 month of their age. CONCLUSION: All the samples of breast milk were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Most of the neonates remained asymptomatic on breast feeding, whose mothers had SARS-CoV-2 infection before delivery.","Prasad, Arun; N, Yankappa; Kumar, Pradeep; Chaudhary, Bhavesh Kant; Pati, Binod Kumar; Anant, Monika; Tiwari, Lokesh Kumar",BMJ Paediatr Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192204/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2021-001087,224

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Retrospective cohort study with capillary blood glucose (CBG) readings and insulin use, dosed with 50% basal (glargine)-50% bolus (lispro) insulin, analyzed in hospitalized patients with insulin-treated DM given GC and matched controls without GC (n = 131 pairs). GC group (median daily prednisone-equivalent dose: 53.36 mg (IQR 30.00, 80.04)) had greatest CBG differences compared to controls at dinner (254±69 vs. 184±63 mg/dL, P<0.001) and bedtime (260±72 vs. 182±55 mg/dL, P<0.001). In GC group, dinner CBG was 30% higher than lunch (254±69 vs. 199±77 mg/dL, P<0.001) when similar lispro to controls given at lunch. Bedtime CBG not different from dinner when 20% more lispro given at dinner (0.12 units/kg (IQR 0.08, 0.17) vs. 0.10 units/kg (0.06, 0.14), P<0.01). Despite receiving more lispro, bedtime hypoglycemic events were lower in GC group (0.0% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Since equal bolus doses inadequately treat large dinner and bedtime GC-exacerbated glycemic excursions, initiating higher bolus insulin at lunch and dinner with additional enhanced GC-specific insulin supplemental scale may be needed as initial insulin doses in setting of high-dose GC.","Cheng, Yu-Chien; Guerra, Yannis; Morkos, Michael; Tahsin, Bettina; Onyenwenyi, Chioma; Fogg, Louis; Fogelfeld, Leon",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529703/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256682,224

However, the success of any vaccine depends on the share of the population that gets vaccinated. We designed a survey experiment in which a nationally representative sample of 3,133 adults in the USA stated their intentions to vaccinate themselves and their children for COVID-19. The factors that we varied across treatments were: the stated severity and infectiousness of COVID-19 and the stated source of the risk information (White House or the Centers for Disease Control). We find that 20% of people in the USA intend to decline the vaccine. We find no statistically significant effect on vaccine intentions from the severity of COVID-19. In contrast, we find that the degree of infectiousness of the coronavirus influences vaccine intentions and that inconsistent risk messages from public health experts and elected officials may reduce vaccine uptake. However, the most important determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy seem to be distrust of the vaccine safety (including uncertainty due to vaccine novelty), as well as general vaccine avoidance, as implied by not having had a flu shot in the last two years.

However, they seldom receive palliative care with the burden of support falling to hostel staff. AIM: To evaluate a model embedding palliative specialists, trained as ‘homelessness champions’, into hostels for two half-days a month to provide support to staff and residents and facilitate a multidisciplinary approach to care. DESIGN: An exploratory qualitative design. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Four homeless hostels in London, UK, including nine hostel managers/support staff and seven palliative care specialists (five nurses and two social workers). RESULTS: Benefits to introducing the model included: developing partnership working between hostel staff and palliative care specialists, developing a holistic palliative ethos within the hostels and improving how hostel staff seek support and connect with local external services. Challenges to implementation included limited time and resources, and barriers related to primary care. CONCLUSION: This is the first evaluation of embedding palliative care specialists within homeless hostels. Inequity in health and social care access was highlighted with evidence of benefit of this additional support for both hostel staff and residents. Considering COVID-19, future research should explore remote ways of working including providing in-reach support to homelessness services from a range of services and organisations.","Armstrong, Megan; Shulman, Caroline; Hudson, Briony; Brophy, Niamh; Daley, Julian; Hewett, Nigel; Stone, Patrick",Palliat Med,https://doi.org/10.1177/02692163211006318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775172/,224

Hence, it is difficult to make an exclusive diagnosis. METHODS: Thirty confirmed cases of COVID-19 and forty-three cases of other aetiology or clinically confirmed non-COVID-19 in a general hospital were included. The clinical data including age, sex, exposure history, laboratory parameters and aetiological diagnosis of all patients were collected. Seven positive signs (posterior part/lower lobe predilection, bilateral involvement, rounded GGO, subpleural bandlike GGO, crazy-paving pattern, peripheral distribution, and GGO +/− consolidation) from significant COVID-19 CT image features and four negative signs (only one lobe involvement, only central distribution, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening) from other non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used. The scoring analysis of CT features was compared between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19). RESULTS: Older age, symptoms of diarrhoea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 (p < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the combined CT image features analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the scoring system was 0.854. These cut-off values yielded a sensitivity of 56.67% and a specificity of 95.35% for a score > 4, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 23.26% for a score > 0, and a sensitivity of 86.67% and a specificity of 67.44% for a score > 2.

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using Medline/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar and official websites of Government of Pakistan and international organizations to identify empirical literature published in English from 2019 to June 2020. RESULTS: It was not until the end of December 2019 that the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered in Hubei province, China, with Wuhan the epicenter of it, sending the nation into an 11-week lockdown. It was the first of its kind and never seen before; hence, based on its novelty, the Chinese authorities named it novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV). Until January 23, 2020, there were only 17 cases in Wuhan, which surged to around 60,000 on February 16, 2020, with 2000 deaths. The World Health Organization declared it a global pandemic on January 30, 2020. Pakistan reported its first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in February in Karachi.

We investigated the role of tocilizumab (TCZ) on interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) trends and MV in SARS‐CoV‐2 patients. METHODS: In this longitudinal observational study, 112 patients were evaluated from 2/1/2020 ‐ 5/31/2020. TCZ was administered followed by methylprednisolone to patients with > 3L oxygen (O2) requirement and pneumonia severity index (PSI) score ≤ 130 with CT scan changes. IL‐6, C‐reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D‐dimer, and procalcitonin were monitored on days 0, 3, and 6 of therapy. Statistical analyses were performed with significance ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: 80/112 SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients (45 males, 56.96%; 34 females, 43.04%) were included in this study. Seven patients expired (8.75%) and nine patients required MV (11.25%). Median IL‐6 levels pre‐administration of TCZ was 342.50 (78.25 ‐ 666.25) pg/mL compared to post‐administration on day 3 (563; 162 ‐ 783) pg/mL (P < 0.00001). On day 6, the median dropped to 545 (333.50 ‐ 678.50) pg/mL compared to day 3 (P = 0.709). CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D‐dimer levels were reduced following TCZ therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Early use of TCZ may reduce the need for MV and decrease CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D‐dimer levels. The sequential use of methylprednisolone for 72 hours seems to potentiate the effect and prolong the suppression of the cytokine storm. IL‐6 levels may be helpful as a prognostic tool.

However, increased levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum is associated with the clinical outcome in patients with head injury, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, cardiac arrest, anoxic encephalopathy, encephalitis, brain metastasis, and status epilepticus. Recently, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which started in China, rapidly evolved into the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients with COVID-19 have a wide range of symptoms varying from mild upper respiratory symptoms to severe illness requiring mechanical ventilation. While coronaviruses primarily target the human respiratory system, neurological symptoms are also observed in some patients. These include symptoms such as loss of taste and olfaction and diseases like cerebrovascular disorders including ischemic stroke and hemorrhages, encephalopathies, Guillain‐Barré syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Here we report an observation from a patient whose NSE levels increased approximately four-fold in CSF. This finding was accompanied by increased white blood cell count and elevated protein in CSF indicating neuroinflammation. Thus, we suggest that NSE may be used as a CSF biomarker in COVID-19 patients with encephalopathy.","Ganti, Latha; Serrano, Enrique; Toklu, Hale Z",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.11033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33214960/,224

The absence of immunity, asymptomatic transmission, and the relatively high level of virulence of the COVID-19 infection it causes led to a massive flow of patients in intensive care units (ICU). This unprecedented situation calls for rapid and accurate mathematical models to best inform public health policies. We develop an original parsimonious model that accounts for the effect of the age of infection on the natural history of the disease. Analysing the ongoing COVID-19 in France, we estimate the value of the key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number (R0), and the efficiency of the national control strategy. We then use our deterministic model to explore several scenarios posterior to lock-down lifting and compare the efficiency of non pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) described in the literature.","Sofonea, M.

DESIGN: A geospatial statistical model was estimated as part of a real-time disease surveillance system to predict local daily incidence of COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: All hospitalisations for COVID-19 to University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust between 1 February 2020 and 30 September 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: Predictions of the incidence and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 hospitalisations in local areas, its weekly change and identification of predictive covariates. RESULTS: Peak hospitalisations occurred in the first and second weeks of April 2020 with significant variation in incidence and incidence rate ratios across the city. Population age, ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation were strong predictors of local incidence. Hospitalisations demonstrated strong day of the week effects with fewer hospitalisations (10%–20% less) at the weekend. There was low temporal correlation in unexplained variance. By day 50 at the end of the first lockdown period, the top 2.5% of small areas had experienced five times as many cases per 10 000 population as the bottom 2.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Local demographic factors were strong predictors of relative levels of incidence and can be used to target local areas for disease control measures. The real-time disease surveillance system provides a useful complement to other surveillance approaches by producing real-time, quantitative and probabilistic summaries of key outcomes at fine spatial resolution to inform disease control programmes.","Watson, Samuel I; Diggle, Peter J; Chipeta, Michael G; Lilford, Richard J",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34607866/,224

There was very high nucleotide and amino acid identity between canine strain RV198/95 and other canine strains, and to the human strain HCR3A. Strain RV52/96, however, was found to have about 95% identity to the G3 serotype canine strains K9, A79-10 and CU-1 and 96% identity to strain RV198/95 and to the simian strain RRV. Therefore both of the canine strains belong to the G3 serotype. Nevertheless, detailed analysis of the VP7 variable regions revealed that RV52/96 possesses amino acid substitutions uncommon to the other canine isolates. In addition, strain RV52/96 exhibited a nucleotide divergence greater than 16% from all the other canine strains studied; however, it revealed the closest identity (90.4%) to the simian strain RRV. With only a few exceptions, phylogenetic analysis allowed clear differentiation of the G3 rotaviruses on the basis of the species of origin. The nucleotide and amino acid variations observed in strain RV52/96 could account for the existence of a canine rotavirus G3 sub-type.","Martella, V.; Pratelli, A.; Greco, G.; Gentile, M.; Fiorente, P.; Tempesta, M.; Buonavoglia, C.",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170200002306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11226570/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170200002306,224

668709,The hearth of mathematical and statistical modelling during the Coronavirus pandemic,2020-04-09,"Abstract Developing a novel drug is a complex, risky, expensive and time-consuming venture. It is estimated that the conventional drug discovery process ending with a new medicine ready for the market can take up to 15 years and more than a billion USD. Fortunately, this scenario has recently changed with the arrival of new approaches. Many novel technologies and methodologies have been developed to increase the efficiency of the drug discovery process, and computational methodologies have become a crucial component of many drug discovery programs. From hit identification to lead optimization, techniques such as ligand- or structure-based virtual screening are widely used in many discovery efforts. It is the case for designing potential anticancer drugs and drug candidates, where these computational approaches have had a major impact over the years and have provided fruitful insights into the field of cancer. In this paper, we review the concept of rational design presenting some of the most representative examples of molecules identified by means of it. Key principles are illustrated through case studies including specifically successful achievements in the field of anticancer drug design to demonstrate that research advances, with the aid of in silico drug design, have the potential to create novel anticancer drugs.","Prada-Gracia, Diego; Huerta-Yépez, Sara; Moreno-Vargas, Liliana M.",Boletín Médico Del Hospital Infantil de México (English Edition),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2444340917001145; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444340917001145,224

Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a key molecule in innate immunity, functions as an ante-antibody before the specific antibody response. Here, we describe a case-control study that included 569 patients with SARS and 1188 control subjects and used in vitro assays to investigate the role that MBL plays in SARS-CoV infection. The distribution of MBL gene polymorphisms was significantly different between patients with SARS and control subjects, with a higher frequency of haplotypes associated with low or deficient serum levels of MBL in patients with SARS than in control subjects. Serum levels of MBL were also significantly lower in patients with SARS than in control subjects. There was, however, no association between MBL genotypes, which are associated with low or deficient serum levels of MBL, and mortality related to SARS. MBL could bind SARS-CoV in a dose- and calcium-dependent and mannan-inhibitable fashion in vitro, suggesting that binding is through the carbohydrate recognition domains of MBL. Furthermore, deposition of complement C4 on SARS-CoV was enhanced by MBL. Inhibition of the infectivity of SARS-CoV by MBL in fetal rhesus kidney cells (FRhK-4) was also observed. These results suggest that MBL contributes to the first-line host defense against SARS-CoV and that MBL deficiency is a susceptibility factor for acquisition of SARS","Ip, W. K.

This occurs equally with the prototype MHV3 and its neurotropic variant JHM as well as with the Edmonston vaccine and SSPE Hallé measles variants. In almost every instance that the infection becomes persistent at 32.5°, virus replication is found to be thermosensitive at 39.5°; however, progeny virus derived from such infections at 32.5° is itself thermostable when replicating in the indicator, fully permissive cell lines. The new data, therefore, reveal the existence of a host-conferred interrelationship between persistence and virus restriction at elevated temperature. They indicate that the two agents with neurotropic potential, when they become established as pathogens in the nervous system, could be under close host cell regulation involving as yet unknown mechanisms.","Lucas, Alexandra; Coulter, Marion; Anderson, Robert; Dales, Samuel; Flintoff, Wayne",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/211715/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682278902891; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682278902891,224

The parametric designs allow for adaptation to other core components and can be custom fit specifically to fire-fighter equipment, including their suspenders. The open source PAPR has controllable air flow and its design enables breathing even if the fan is disconnected or if the battery dies.

The uptake of 10x Genomics datasets has begun to calm this diversity, and the bioinformatics community leans once more towards the large computing requirements and the statistically driven methods needed to process and understand these ever-growing datasets. RESULTS: Here we outline several Galaxy workflows and learning resources for single-cell RNA-sequencing, with the aim of providing a comprehensive analysis environment paired with a thorough user learning experience that bridges the knowledge gap between the computational methods and the underlying cell biology. The Galaxy reproducible bioinformatics framework provides tools, workflows, and trainings that not only enable users to perform 1-click 10x preprocessing but also empower them to demultiplex raw sequencing from custom tagged and full-length sequencing protocols. The downstream analysis supports a range of high-quality interoperable suites separated into common stages of analysis: inspection, filtering, normalization, confounder removal, and clustering. The teaching resources cover concepts from computer science to cell biology. Access to all resources is provided at the singlecell.usegalaxy.eu portal. CONCLUSIONS: The reproducible and training-oriented Galaxy framework provides a sustainable high-performance computing environment for users to run flexible analyses on both 10x and alternative platforms. The tutorials from the Galaxy Training Network along with the frequent training workshops hosted by the Galaxy community provide a means for users to learn, publish, and teach single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis.","Tekman, Mehmet; Batut, Bérénice; Ostrovsky, Alexander; Antoniewski, Christophe; Clements, Dave; Ramirez, Fidel; Etherington, Graham J; Hotz, Hans-Rudolf; Scholtalbers, Jelle; Manning, Jonathan R; Bellenger, Lea; Doyle, Maria A; Heydarian, Mohammad; Huang, Ni; Soranzo, Nicola; Moreno, Pablo; Mautner, Stefan; Papatheodorou, Irene; Nekrutenko, Anton; Taylor, James; Blankenberg, Daniel; Backofen, Rolf; Grüning, Björn",Gigascience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079170/; https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giaa102,224
689842,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A literature review,2020-04-08,"Among 15 nonstructural proteins (Nsps), the newly emerging Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) encodes a large, multidomain Nsp3. One of its units is the ADP-ribose phosphatase domain (ADRP; also known as the macrodomain, MacroD), which is believed to interfere with the host immune response. Such a function appears to be linked to the ability of the protein to remove ADP-ribose from ADP-ribosylated proteins and RNA, yet the precise role and molecular targets of the enzyme remain unknown. Here, five high-resolution (1.07–2.01 Å) crystal structures corresponding to the apo form of the protein and its complexes with 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), AMP and ADP-ribose have been determined. The protein is shown to undergo conformational changes to adapt to the ligand in the manner previously observed in close homologues from other viruses. A conserved water molecule is also identified that may participate in hydrolysis. This work builds foundations for future structure-based research on ADRP, including the search for potential antiviral therapeutics.","Michalska, Karolina; Kim, Youngchang; Jedrzejczak, Robert; Maltseva, Natalia I.; Stols, Lucy; Endres, Michael; Joachimiak, Andrzej",IUCrJ,https://doi.org/10.1107/s2052252520009653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32939273/,224
690228,Potential harm caused by physicians' a-priori beliefs in the clinical effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and its impact on clinical and economic outcome – A simulation approach,2020-12-09,"Various mitigation measures have been implemented to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, including widely adopted social distancing and mandated face covering. However, assessing the effectiveness of those intervention practices hinges on the understanding of virus transmission, which remains uncertain. Here we show that airborne transmission is highly virulent and represents the dominant route to spread the disease. By analyzing the trend and mitigation measures in Wuhan, China, Italy, and New York City, from January 23 to May 9, 2020, we illustrate that the impacts of mitigation measures are discernable from the trends of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the pandemic trends in the three epicenters. This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public. We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with simultaneous social distancing, quarantine, and contact tracing, represents the most likely fighting opportunity to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work also highlights the fact that sound science is essential in decision-making for the current and future public health pandemics.","Zhang, Renyi; Li, Yixin; Zhang, Annie L.; Wang, Yuan; Molina, Mario J.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009637117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32527856/,224
