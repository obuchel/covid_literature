221,Chinese journals: a guide for epidemiologists,2008-09-30,"Chinese journals in epidemiology, preventive medicine and public health contain much that is of potential international interest. However, few non-Chinese speakers are acquainted with this literature. This article therefore provides an overview of the contemporary scene in Chinese biomedical journal publication, Chinese bibliographic databases and Chinese journals in epidemiology, preventive medicine and public health. The challenge of switching to English as the medium of publication, the development of publishing bibliometric data from Chinese databases, the prospect of an Open Access publication model in China, the issue of language bias in literature reviews and the quality of Chinese journals are discussed. Epidemiologists are encouraged to search the Chinese bibliographic databases for Chinese journal articles.","Fung, Isaac CH",Emerg Themes Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2648956/,77

552,Clustering Heart Rate Dynamics Is Associated with β-Adrenergic Receptor Polymorphisms: Analysis by Information-Based Similarity Index,2011-05-04,"BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms in the gene encoding the β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) have a pivotal role in the functions of the autonomic nervous system. Using heart rate variability (HRV) as an indicator of autonomic function, we present a bottom-up genotype–phenotype analysis to investigate the association between β-AR gene polymorphisms and heart rate dynamics. METHODS: A total of 221 healthy Han Chinese adults (59 males and 162 females, aged 33.6±10.8 years, range 19 to 63 years) were recruited and genotyped for three common β-AR polymorphisms: β(1)-AR Ser49Gly, β(2)-AR Arg16Gly and β(2)-AR Gln27Glu. Each subject underwent two hours of electrocardiogram monitoring at rest. We applied an information-based similarity (IBS) index to measure the pairwise dissimilarity of heart rate dynamics among study subjects. RESULTS: With the aid of agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis, we categorized subjects into major clusters, which were found to have significantly different distributions of β(2)-AR Arg16Gly genotype. Furthermore, the non-randomness index, a nonlinear HRV measure derived from the IBS method, was significantly lower in Arg16 homozygotes than in Gly16 carriers. The non-randomness index was negatively correlated with parasympathetic-related HRV variables and positively correlated with those HRV indices reflecting a sympathovagal shift toward sympathetic activity. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a bottom-up categorization approach combining the IBS method and hierarchical cluster analysis to detect subgroups of subjects with HRV phenotypes associated with β-AR polymorphisms. Our results provide evidence that β(2)-AR polymorphisms are significantly associated with the acceleration/deceleration pattern of heart rate oscillation, reflecting the underlying mode of autonomic nervous system control.","Yang, Albert C.; Tsai, Shih-Jen; Hong, Chen-Jee; Wang, Cynthia; Chen, Tai-Jui; Liou, Ying-Jay; Peng, Chung-Kang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3087751/,77
703,Essential epidemiological mechanisms underpinning the transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza,2012-02-07,"Seasonal influenza has considerable impact around the world, both economically and in mortality among risk groups, but there is considerable uncertainty as to the essential mechanisms and their parametrization. In this paper, we identify a number of characteristic features of influenza incidence time series in temperate regions, including ranges of annual attack rates and outbreak durations. By constraining the output of simple models to match these characteristic features, we investigate the role played by population heterogeneity, multiple strains, cross-immunity and the rate of strain evolution in the generation of incidence time series. Results indicate that an age-structured model with non-random mixing and co-circulating strains are both required to match observed time-series data. Our work gives estimates of the seasonal peak basic reproduction number, R(0), in the range 1.6–3. Estimates of R(0) are strongly correlated with the timescale for waning of immunity to current circulating seasonal influenza strain, which we estimate is between 3 and 8 years. Seasonal variation in transmissibility is largely confined to 15–30% of its mean value. While population heterogeneity and cross-immunity are required mechanisms, the degree of heterogeneity and cross-immunity is not tightly constrained. We discuss our findings in the context of other work fitting to seasonal influenza data.","Truscott, James; Fraser, Christophe; Cauchemez, Simon; Meeyai, Aronrag; Hinsley, Wes; Donnelly, Christl A.; Ghani, Azra; Ferguson, Neil",J R Soc Interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3243394/,77
727,Perspectives on Immunoglobulins in Colostrum and Milk,2011-04-14,"Immunoglobulins form an important component of the immunological activity found in milk and colostrum. They are central to the immunological link that occurs when the mother transfers passive immunity to the offspring. The mechanism of transfer varies among mammalian species. Cattle provide a readily available immune rich colostrum and milk in large quantities, making those secretions important potential sources of immune products that may benefit humans. Immune milk is a term used to describe a range of products of the bovine mammary gland that have been tested against several human diseases. The use of colostrum or milk as a source of immunoglobulins, whether intended for the neonate of the species producing the secretion or for a different species, can be viewed in the context of the types of immunoglobulins in the secretion, the mechanisms by which the immunoglobulins are secreted, and the mechanisms by which the neonate or adult consuming the milk then gains immunological benefit. The stability of immunoglobulins as they undergo processing in the milk, or undergo digestion in the intestine, is an additional consideration for evaluating the value of milk immunoglobulins. This review summarizes the fundamental knowledge of immunoglobulins found in colostrum, milk, and immune milk.","Hurley, Walter L.; Theil, Peter K.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257684/,77
902,"Seasonal influenza vaccination knowledge, risk perception, health beliefs and vaccination behaviours of nurses",2011-11-18,"The relationship between knowledge, risk perceptions, health belief towards seasonal influenza and vaccination and the vaccination behaviours of nurses was explored. Qualified nurses attending continuing professional education courses at a large London university between 18 April and 18 October 2010 were surveyed (522/672; response rate 77·7%). Of these, 82·6% worked in hospitals; 37·0% reported receiving seasonal influenza vaccination in the previous season and 44·9% reported never being vaccinated during the last 5 years. All respondents were categorized using two-step cluster analyses into never, occasionally, and continuously vaccinated groups. Nurses vaccinated the season before had higher scores of knowledge and risk perception compared to the unvaccinated (P<0·001). Nurses never vaccinated had the lowest scores of knowledge and risk perception compared to other groups (P<0·001). Nurses' seasonal influenza vaccination behaviours are complex. Knowledge and risk perception predict uptake of vaccination in nurses.","ZHANG, J.; WHILE, A. E.; NORMAN, I. J.",Epidemiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3405768/,77

1443,Lost in Translation (LiT),2014-04-11,"Translational medicine is a roller coaster with occasional brilliant successes and a large majority of failures. Lost in Translation 1 (‘LiT1’), beginning in the 1950s, was a golden era built upon earlier advances in experimental physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology, with a dash of serendipity, that led to the discovery of many new drugs for serious illnesses. LiT2 saw the large-scale industrialization of drug discovery using high-throughput screens and assays based on affinity for the target molecule. The links between drug development and university sciences and medicine weakened, but there were still some brilliant successes. In LiT3, the coverage of translational medicine expanded from molecular biology to drug budgets, with much greater emphasis on safety and official regulation. Compared with R&D expenditure, the number of breakthrough discoveries in LiT3 was disappointing, but monoclonal antibodies for immunity and inflammation brought in a new golden era and kinase inhibitors such as imatinib were breakthroughs in cancer. The pharmaceutical industry is trying to revive the LiT1 approach by using phenotypic assays and closer links with academia. LiT4 faces a data explosion generated by the genome project, GWAS, ENCODE and the ‘omics’ that is in danger of leaving LiT4 in a computerized cloud. Industrial laboratories are filled with masses of automated machinery while the scientists sit in a separate room viewing the results on their computers. Big Data will need Big Thinking in LiT4 but with so many unmet medical needs and so many new opportunities being revealed there are high hopes that the roller coaster will ride high again.","Dollery, Colin T",Br J Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3997269/,77

1795,Characterization of Plasmodium vivax-associated admissions to reference hospitals in Brazil and India,2015-03-20,"BACKGROUND: The benign character formerly attributed to Plasmodium vivax infection has been dismantled by the increasing number of reports of severe disease associated with infection with this parasite, prompting the need for more thorough and comprehensive characterization of the spectrum of resulting clinical complications. Endemic areas exhibit wide variations regarding severe disease frequency. This study, conducted simultaneously in Brazil and India, constitutes, to our knowledge, the first multisite study focused on clinical characterization of P. vivax severe disease. METHODS: Patients admitted with P. vivax mono-infection at reference centers in Manaus (Amazon - Brazil) and Bikaner (Rajasthan - India), where P. vivax predominates, were submitted to standard thorough clinical and laboratory evaluations in order to characterize clinical manifestations and identify concurrent co-morbidities. RESULTS: In total, 778 patients (88.0% above 12 years old) were hospitalized at clinical discretion with PCR-confirmed P. vivax mono-infection (316 in Manaus and 462 in Bikaner), of which 197 (25.3%) presented at least one severity criterion as defined by the World Health Organization (2010). Hyperlactatemia, respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation were more frequent in Manaus. Noteworthy, pregnancy status was associated as a risk factor for severe disease (OR = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.2-3.4; P = 0.007). The overall case fatality rate was 0.3/1,000 cases in Manaus and 6.1/1,000 cases in Bikaner, with all deaths occurring among patients fulfilling at least one severity criterion. Within this subgroup, case fatality rates increased respectively to 7.5% in Manaus and 4.4% in Bikaner. CONCLUSION: P. vivax-associated severity is not negligible, and although lethality observed for complicated cases was similar, the overall fatality rate was about 20-fold higher in India compared to Brazil, highlighting the variability observed in different settings. Our observations highlight that pregnant women and patients with co-morbidities need special attention when infected by this parasite due to higher risk of complications.

1930,Different Blood Cell-Derived Transcriptome Signatures in Cows Exposed to Vaccination Pre- or Postpartum,2015-08-28,"Periparturient cows have been found to reveal immunosuppression, frequently associated with increased susceptibility to uterine and mammary infections. To improve understanding of the causes and molecular regulatory mechanisms accounting for this phenomenon around calving, we examined the effect of an antigen challenge on gene expression modulation on cows prior to (BC) or after calving (AC) using whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq). The transcriptome analysis of the cows’ blood identified a substantially higher number of loci affected in BC cows (2,235) in response to vaccination compared to AC cows (208) and revealed a divergent transcriptional profile specific for each group. In BC cows, a variety of loci involved in immune defense and cellular signaling processes were transcriptionally activated, whereas protein biosynthesis and posttranslational processes were tremendously impaired in response to vaccination. Furthermore, energy metabolism in the blood cells of BC cows was shifted from oxidative phosphorylation to the glycolytic system. In AC cows, the number and variety of regulated pathways involved in immunomodulation and maintenance of immnunocompetence are considerably lower after vaccination, and upregulation of arginine degradation was suggested as an immunosuppressive mechanism. Elevated transcript levels of erythrocyte-specific genes involved in gas exchange processes were a specific transcriptional signature in AC cows pointing to hematopoiesis activation. The divergent and substantially lower magnitude of transcriptional modulation in response to vaccination in AC cows provides evidence for a suppressed immune capacity of early lactating cows on the molecular level and demonstrates that an efficient immune response of cows is related to their physiological and metabolic status.","Weikard, Rosemarie; Demasius, Wiebke; Hadlich, Frieder; Kühn, Christa",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4552870/,77
2043,Proteomic Analysis of the Vitreous following Experimental Retinal Detachment in Rabbits,2015-11-18,"Purpose. The pathogenesis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) remains incompletely understood, with no clinically effective treatment for potentially severe complications such as photoreceptor cell death and proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Here we investigate the protein profile of the vitreous following experimental retinal detachment using a comparative proteomic based approach. Materials and Methods. Retinal detachment was created in the right eyes of six New Zealand red pigmented rabbits. Sham surgery was undertaken in five other rabbits that were used as controls. After seven days the eyes were enucleated and the vitreous was removed. The vitreous samples were evaluated with two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the differentially expressed proteins were identified with tandem mass spectrometry. Results. Ten protein spots were found to be at least twofold differentially expressed when comparing the vitreous samples of the sham and retinal detachment surgery groups. Protein spots that were upregulated in the vitreous following retinal detachment were identified as albumin fragments, and those downregulated were found to be peroxiredoxin 2, collagen-Iα1 fragment, and α-1-antiproteinase F. Conclusions. Proteomic investigation of the rabbit vitreous has identified a set of proteins that help further our understanding of the pathogenesis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and its complications.","Mandal, Nakul; Lewis, Geoffrey P.; Fisher, Steven K.; Heegaard, Steffen; Prause, Jan U.; la Cour, Morten; Vorum, Henrik; Honoré, Bent",J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4667062/,77
2072,Effects of Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI) on N95 Respirator Filtration Performance and Structural Integrity,2015-07-01,"The ability to disinfect and reuse disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) may be needed during a pandemic of an infectious respiratory disease such as influenza. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is one possible method for respirator disinfection. However, UV radiation degrades polymers, which presents the possibility that UVGI exposure could degrade the ability of a disposable respirator to protect the worker. To study this, we exposed both sides of material coupons and respirator straps from four models of N95 FFRs to UVGI doses from 120–950 J/cm(2). We then tested the particle penetration, flow resistance, and bursting strengths of the individual respirator coupon layers, and the breaking strength of the respirator straps. We found that UVGI exposure led to a small increase in particle penetration (up to 1.25%) and had little effect on the flow resistance. UVGI exposure had a more pronounced effect on the strengths of the respirator materials. At the higher UVGI doses, the strength of the layers of respirator material was substantially reduced (in some cases, by >90%). The changes in the strengths of the respirator materials varied considerably among the different models of respirators. UVGI had less of an effect on the respirator straps; a dose of 2360 J/cm(2) reduced the breaking strength of the straps by 20–51%. Our results suggest that UVGI could be used to effectively disinfect disposable respirators for reuse, but the maximum number of disinfection cycles will be limited by the respirator model and the UVGI dose required to inactivate the pathogen.","Lindsley, William G.; Martin, Stephen B.; Thewlis, Robert E.; Sarkisian, Khachatur; Nwoko, Julian O.; Mead, Kenneth R.; Noti, John D.",J Occup Environ Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699414/,77

2679,Long term stability and infectivity of herpesviruses in water,2017-04-21,"For viruses to utilize environmental vectors (hard surfaces, soil, water) for transmission, physical and chemical stability is a prerequisite. There are many factors including pH, salinity, temperature, and turbidity that are known to contribute to the ability of viruses to persist in water. Equine herpesvirus type-1 (EHV-1) is a pathogenic alphaherpesvirus associated with domestic horses and wild equids. EHV-1 and recombinants of EHV-1 and EHV-9 are able to cause infections in non-equid animal species, particularly in captive settings. Many of the captive non-equid mammals are not naturally sympatric with equids and do not share enclosures, however, in many cases water sources may overlap. Similarly, in the wild, equids encounter many species at waterholes in times of seasonal drought. Therefore, we hypothesized that EHV-1 is stable in water and that water may act as a vector for EHV-1. In order to establish the conditions promoting or hindering EHV-1 longevity, infectivity and genomic stability in water; we exposed EHV-1 to varied water environments (pH, salinity, temperature, and turbidity) in controlled experiments over 21 days. The presence and infectivity of the virus was confirmed by both qPCR and cell culture experiments. Our results show that EHV-1 remains stable and infectious under many conditions in water for up to three weeks.","Dayaram, Anisha; Franz, Mathias; Schattschneider, Alexander; Damiani, Armando M.; Bischofberger, Sebastian; Osterrieder, Nikolaus; Greenwood, Alex D.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5399353/,77

During each visit, subjects performed a total of nine fit tests using three samples of the same FFR model. Inward leakage and filter penetration were measured for each donned respirator to determine face seal leakage (FSL). A total of 195 subjects completed the second visit and 134 subjects completed all seven visits. Acceptable fit was defined as 90th percentile FSL ≤ 5% and at least one fit factor ≥ 100. An unacceptable fit was observed for 14, 10, 7, 12, 15, and 16% of subjects on Visits 2–7, respectively. The predicted risk of an unacceptable fit increased with increasing length of time between fit tests, from 10% at Year 1 to 20% at Year 2 and to 25% at Year 3. Twenty-four percent of subjects who lost ≥ 20 lb had an unacceptable fit; these percentages ranged from 7–17% for subjects with lower weight losses or any degree of weight gain. Results support the current OSHA requirement for annual fit testing and suggest that respirator users who lose more than 20 lb should be re-tested for respirator fit.","Zhuang, Ziqing; Bergman, Michael; Brochu, Elizabeth; Palmiero, Andrew; Niezgoda, George; He, Xinjian; Roberge, Raymond; Shaffer, Ronald",J Occup Environ Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5505322/,77
2780,Travellers and influenza: risks and prevention,2016-12-24,"Background: Influenza viruses are among the major causes of serious human respiratory tract infection worldwide. In line with the high disease burden attributable to influenza, these viruses play an important, but often neglected, role in travel medicine. Guidelines and recommendations regarding prevention and management of influenza in travellers are scarce. Of special interest for travel medicine are risk populations and also circumstances that facilitate influenza virus transmission and spread, like travel by airplane or cruise ship and mass gatherings. Methods: We conducted a PUBMED/MEDLINE search for a combination of the MeSH terms Influenza virus, travel, mass gathering, large scale events and cruise ship. In addition we gathered guidelines and recommendations from selected countries and regarding influenza prevention and management in travellers. By reviewing these search results in the light of published knowledge in the fields of influenza prevention and management, we present best practice advice for the prevention and management of influenza in travel medicine. Results: Seasonal influenza is among the most prevalent infectious diseases in travellers. Known host-associated risk factors include extremes of age and being immune-compromised, while the most relevant environmental factors are associated with holiday cruises and mass gatherings. Conclusions: Pre-travel advice should address influenza and its prevention for travellers, whenever appropriate on the basis of the epidemiological situation concerned. Preventative measures should be strongly recommended for travellers at high-risk for developing complications. In addition, seasonal influenza vaccination should be considered for any traveller wishing to reduce the risk of incapacitation, particularly cruise ship crew and passengers, as well as those participating in mass gatherings. Besides advice concerning preventive measures and vaccination, advice on the use of antivirals may be considered for some travellers.","Goeijenbier, M.; van Genderen, P.; Ward, B.

2977,Tidal changes on CT and progression of ARDS,2017-06-20,"BACKGROUND: Uncertain prediction of outcome in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) impedes individual patient management and clinical trial design. OBJECTIVES: To develop a radiological metric of injurious inflation derived from matched inspiratory and expiratory CT scans, calibrate it in a model of experimental lung injury, and test it in patients with ARDS. METHODS: 73 anaesthetised rats (acid aspiration model) were ventilated (protective or non-protective) for up to 4 hours to generate a spectrum of lung injury. CT was performed (inspiratory and expiratory) at baseline each hour, paired inspiratory and expiratory images were superimposed and voxels tracked in sequential scans. In nine patients with ARDS, paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans from the first intensive care unit week were analysed. RESULTS: In experimental studies, regions of lung with unstable inflation (ie, partial or reversible airspace filling reflecting local strain) were the areas in which subsequent progression of injury was greatest in terms of progressive infiltrates (R=0.77) and impaired compliance (R=0.67, p<0.01). In patients with ARDS, a threshold fraction of tissue with unstable inflation was apparent: >28% in all patients who died and ≤28% in all who survived, whereas segregation of survivors versus non-survivors was not possible based on oxygenation or lung mechanics. CONCLUSIONS: A single set of superimposed inspiratory–expiratory CT scans may predict progression of lung injury and outcome in ARDS; if these preliminary results are validated, this could facilitate clinical trial recruitment and individualised care.","Cereda, Maurizio; Xin, Yi; Hamedani, Hooman; Bellani, Giacomo; Kadlecek, Stephen; Clapp, Justin; Guerra, Luca; Meeder, Natalie; Rajaei, Jennia; Tustison, Nicholas J; Gee, James C; Kavanagh, Brian P; Rizi, Rahim R",Thorax,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5738538/,77

In equine endurance athletes, blood testing is accepted as a support in training, however, only the changes before versus after exercise in creatine phosphokinase activity (CPK) and basic blood parameters are usually measured. This study is the first longitudinal investigation of the changes in routinely measured blood parameters and, additionally, serum amyloid A (SAA), during seven months, in Arabian horses introduced to endurance training and competing in events for young horses. It has been determined that CPK, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count (RBC), and concentration of total serum protein (TSP) slightly increased after training sessions and competitions in similar manner. The increase in white blood cell (WBC) count was higher after competitions and SAA increased only after competitions. Total protein concentration was the only parameter that increased with training during a 7-month program. SAA indicated only in the case of heavy effort, and, it thus may be helpful in the monitoring of training in young horses. In an optimal program, its concentration should not increase after a training session but only after heavy effort, which should not be repeated too often.","Witkowska-Piłaszewicz, Olga; Bąska, Piotr; Czopowicz, Michał; Żmigrodzka, Magdalena; Szczepaniak, Jarosław; Szarska, Ewa; Winnicka, Anna; Cywińska, Anna",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6616404/,77

A concentration of 40 µg DEAE-D/ml provided maximal enhancement of infection as determined by the time of onset of cytopathic effect (CPE), the percentage of cells infected by the inoculum, and the amount of virus produced. When DEAE-D was used in the inoculum, the CPE appeared a day earlier, the percentage of cells infected by the inoculum, as determined by the fluorescent antibody test, was increased 11 times, and the viral titer was increased 2 times as compared to results obtained without DEAE-D. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus-infected cultures contained much cell-associated virus which could be liberated by sonication to increase the titer of virus stocks. The use of BRSV-infected cells rather than supernates from BRSV-infected cells increased the rate at which a cytopathic effect developed, although it did not substantially increase the titer of virus which was harvested. The use of DEAE-D in the inoculum and the passage of BRSV-infected cells instead of viral suspensions was found to be the quickest and most effective method of consistently obtaining BRSV with a titer of about 10(5.5) TCID(50)/ml.","Rossi, C.

Toward the development of a plant-based expression system for the production of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) p24 capsid protein, the p24 gene was introduced into the genome of tobacco plants using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer. Southern blot analyses confirmed the presence of the p24 coding sequence within the genome of transgenic lines. Western blot analysis of protein extracts from transgenic plants identified plant-expressed p24 protein that cross-reacted with a p24-specific monoclonal antibody, thus confirming the maintenance of antigenicity. Quantification of the p24 protein using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) estimated yields of approx 3.5 mg per g of soluble leaf protein. Similar accumulation levels of p24 were also detected in T1 plants, confirming that the p24 gene is transmitted stably.

However, the biochemical signaling pathways that are activated by CD28 and how these pathways are integrated with TCR signaling are still not understood.

The main presentation in both cases consisted of flu-like symptoms manifesting as, fever, arthralgias and myalgias. The virus was isolated in one case from a throat swab and in another case following a bronchoalveolar lavage. Both patients received oseltamivir at a dose of 75 mg orally twice day. The dose of oseltamivir was increased to 150 mg twice per day due to the lack of improvement or progression of symptoms. In one case, clinical symptoms resolved without sequelae. In the second case, pulmonary symptomatology continued to deteriorate, despite aggressive polymicrobial treatment, requiring mechanical ventilation and ultimately the patient died from respiratory failure. These cases highlight the potentially serious effect of the ongoing Influenza A/pandemic 2009/H1N1 pandemic in this very vulnerable population and the urgent need to establish emergency preparedness strategies by oncology and bone marrow transplantation staff to face this serious healthcare challenge.","Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A.; Velez, Ana; Richards, Karla; Greene, John N.; Field, Teresa; Sandin, Ramon",Int J Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101598/,77

The clinical course was complicated by simultaneous infections with Pneumocystis carinii, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Herpes simplex, which proved to be fatal. A study of the literature shows that opportunistic infections in endogenous Cushing’s syndrome are associated with severe cortisol excess and carry a high mortality. Opportunistic infections are most prevalent in the ectopic ACTH syndrome, explained by the very high plasma cortisol concentrations in this condition. Infections with Aspergillus species, Cryptoccus neoformans, Pneumocystis carinii and Nocardia asteroides predominated. Cushing’s syndrome with a very high plasma cortisol concentration causes a severe immunocompromized state. Prompt evaluation of the cause of the hypercortisolism, initiation of cortisol lowering therapy, primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii infection when plasma cortisol exceeds 2500 nmol L(−1) and a search for concomitant infectious disease is recommended.","Bakker, R.

6610,Abstracts of oral presentations and posters,1993,"BACKGROUND: Multiple ventilatory strategies for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in children have been advocated, including high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). Despite the frequent deployment of HFOV, randomized controlled trials remain elusive and currently there are no pediatric trials looking at its use. Our longitudinal study analyzed the predictive clinical outcome of HFOV in pediatric AHRF given disease-specific morbidity. METHODS: A retrospective 8-year review on pediatric intensive care unit admissions with AHRF ventilated by HFOV was performed. Primary outcomes included survival, morbidity, length of stay (LOS), and factors associated with survival or mortality. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients underwent HFOV with a 66 % overall survival rate. Survivors had a greater LOS than nonsurvivors (p = 0.001). Mortality odds ratio (OR) for patients without bronchiolitis was 8.19 (CI = 1.02, 65.43), and without pneumonia it was 3.07 (CI = 1.12, 8.39). A lower oxygenation index (OI) after HFOV commencement and at subsequent time points analyzed predicted survival. After 24 h, mortality was associated with an OI > 35 [OR = 31.11 (CI = 3.25, 297.98)]. Sepsis-related mortality was associated with a higher baseline FiO(2) (0.88 vs. 0.65), higher OI (42 vs. 22), and augmented metabolic acidosis (pH of 7.25 vs. 7.32) evaluated 4 h on HFOV (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: High-frequency oscillatory ventilation may be safely utilized. It has a 66 % overall survival rate in pediatric AHRF of various etiologies. Patients with morbidity limited to the respiratory system and optimized oxygenation indices are most likely to survive on HFOV.","Babbitt, Christopher J.; Cooper, Michael C.; Nussbaum, Eliezer; Liao, Eileen; Levine, Glenn K.; Randhawa, Inderpal S.",Lung,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101837/,77

We aim to assess if there is an association between the viral load and the outcome in hospitalized patients with a confirmed influenza virus infection. A retrospective observational study including all adult patients who were hospitalized in our center with a confirmed influenza virus infection from January to May 2016. Viral load was measured by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) value on upper respiratory tract samples. Its value was categorized into three groups (low Ct, ≤ 20; intermediate Ct, > 20–30; and high Ct, > 30). Two hundred thirty-nine patients were included. Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 was isolated in 207 cases (86.6%). The mean Ct value was 26.69 ± 5.81. The viral load was higher in the unvaccinated group when compared with the vaccinated patients (Ct 25.17 ± 5.55 vs. 27.58 ± 4.97, p = 0.004). Only 27 patients (11.29%) presented a high viral load. Patients with a high viral load more often showed abnormal findings on chest X-ray (p = 0.015) and lymphopenia (p = 0.097). By contrast, there were no differences between the three groups (according to viral load), in associated pneumonia, respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, sepsis, or in-hospital mortality. Our findings suggest that in patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed influenza virus infection (mostly A/H1N1pdm09), a high viral load is associated with a higher presence of abnormal findings on chest X-ray but not with a significant worse prognosis. In these cases, standardized quantitative PCR could be useful.","Lalueza, Antonio; Folgueira, Dolores; Muñoz-Gallego, Irene; Trujillo, Hernando; Laureiro, Jaime; Hernández-Jiménez, Pilar; Moral-Jiménez, Noelia; Castillo, Cristina; Ayuso, Blanca; Díaz-Pedroche, Carmen; Torres, Marta; Arrieta, Estibaliz; Arévalo-Cañas, Coral; Madrid, Olaya; Lumbreras, Carlos",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102091/,77
7006,ECR 2001 Book of Abstracts - A - Postgraduate Educational Programme,2015-08-31,"Hollow protein containers are widespread in nature, and include virus capsids as well as eukaryotic and bacterial complexes. Protein cages are studied extensively for applications in nanotechnology, nanomedicine and materials science. Their inner and outer surfaces can be modified chemically or genetically, and the internal cavity can be used to template, store and/or arrange molecular cargos. Virus capsids and virus-like particles (VLP, noninfectious particles) provide versatile platforms for nanoscale bioengineering. Study of capsid protein self-assembly into monodispersed particles, and of VLP structure and biophysics is necessary not only to understand natural processes, but also to infer how these platforms can be redesigned to furnish novel functional VLP. Here we address the assembly dynamics of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a complex icosahedral virus. IBDV has a ~70 nm-diameter T = 13 capsid with VP2 trimers as the only structural subunits. During capsid assembly, VP2 is synthesized as a precursor (pVP2) whose C terminus is cleaved. The pVP2 C terminus has an amphipathic helix that controls VP2 polymorphism. In the absence of the VP3 scaffolding protein, necessary for control of assembly, 466/456-residue pVP2 intermediates bearing this helix assemble into VLP only when expressed with an N-terminal His(6) tag (the HT-VP2-466 protein). HT-VP2-466 capsids are optimal for genetic insertion of proteins (cargo space ~78 000 nm(3)). We established an in vitro assembly/disassembly system of HT-VP2-466-based VLP for heterologous nucleic acid packaging and/or encapsulation of drugs and other molecules. HT-VP2-466 (empty) capsids were disassembled and reassembled by dialysis against low-salt/basic pH and high-salt/acid pH buffers, respectively, thus illustrating the reversibility in vitro of IBDV capsid assembly. HT-VP2-466 VLP also packed heterologous DNA by non-specific confinement during assembly. These and previous results establish the bases for biotechnological applications based on the IBDV capsid and its ability to incorporate exogenous proteins and nucleic acids.","Pascual, Elena; Mata, Carlos P; Carrascosa, José L; Castón, José R",J Phys Condens Matter,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103166/,77

7204,Rash and Elevated Creatine Kinase in a Deployed Soldier,2014-02-11,"One of the key challenges in the field of genetics is the inference of haplotypes from next generation sequencing data. The MinION Oxford Nanopore sequencer allows sequencing long reads, with the potential of sequencing complete genes, and even complete genomes of viruses, in individual reads. However, MinION suffers from high error rates, rendering the detection of true variants difficult. Here, we propose a new statistical approach named AssociVar, which differentiates between true mutations and sequencing errors from direct RNA/DNA sequencing using MinION. Our strategy relies on the assumption that sequencing errors will be dispersed randomly along sequencing reads, and hence will not be associated with each other, whereas real mutations will display a non-random pattern of association with other mutations. We demonstrate our approach using direct RNA sequencing data from evolved populations of the MS2 bacteriophage, whose small genome makes it ideal for MinION sequencing. AssociVar inferred several mutations in the phage genome, which were corroborated using parallel Illumina sequencing. This allowed us to reconstruct full genome viral haplotypes constituting different strains that were present in the sample. Our approach is applicable to long read sequencing data from any organism for accurate detection of bona fide mutations and inter-strain polymorphisms.","Harel, Noam; Meir, Moran; Gophna, Uri; Stern, Adi",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107797/,77
7380,INFLUENZA A/ENGLAND: AN OUTBREAK AT A MILITARY ACADEMY,1974-09-11,"The antiviral function of pulmonary macrophages obtained by broncholavage of healthy smokers and nonsmokers was studied. Compared with nonsmokers' cells, smokers' macrophages produced significantly more virus during in vitro infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Exposure of macrophages to either antiviral macrophage-activating factor or interferon-y for 20 hr before infection resulted in diminished production of HSV-1 by both types of macrophages. However, in contrast to smokers' cells, exposure of nonsmokers' macrophages to these antiviral lymphokines totally prevented viral replication. This difference could not be attributed to diminished adsorption of virus to smokers' macrophages or to an increased proportion of extracellular to intracellular virus in smokers' cell cultures. The effect of smoking on viral infectivity did not appear to be mediated by secretion of a soluble factor by the macrophage because incubation of nonsmokers' cells with supernatant from smokers' cell cultures did not affect the growth of HSV-1.","Rose, Richard M.; Wasserman, Andrew S.; Weiser, Weishui Y.; Remold, Heinz G.",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109908/,77

Although several options exist for disinfecting contaminated environmental surfaces, few are compatible with use on both hard smooth non-porous (hard) and soft porous surfaces (soft) while still offering significant disinfection of the contaminating organisms. This study evaluated the efficacy of mist application of a stabilized chlorine dioxide and quaternary ammonium compound-based disinfectant (Cryocide20) for inactivation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) on various environmental surfaces. MRSA and VRE were applied to hard and soft surfaces (glass, steel, tile, carpet, and cotton fabric), allowed to dry, and exposed to a uniform mist application of the disinfectant solution. After 1 hr of contact time, the residual disinfectant was neutralized, and the bacteria were recovered and enumerated on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar. Reduction of both test bacteria was observed on most of the hard and soft surfaces tested. Log(10) reduction of the organisms tended to be higher on steel, tile, and carpet than glass or cotton. Overall, these results suggest that mist application of Cryocide20 disinfectant may be an effective option for reduction of low levels of infectious bacterial pathogens from contaminated environmental surfaces.","Callahan, K.L.; Beck, N.K.; Duffield, E.A.; Shin, G.; Meschke, J.S.",J Occup Environ Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196689/,77

Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) poses a major threat world-wide to wild and captive parrots. Yet data from wild birds on seasonal fluctuations in prevalence and infection intensity, and thereby the potential high-risk times for virus transmission, have been lacking. We screened wild Crimson Rosellas (Platycercus elegans) for BFDV in blood and cloacal swabs. Prevalence in blood samples and cloacal swabs, as well as viral load varied with Julian date and in blood, were highest after the breeding season. Breeding birds had lower viral load and lower BFDV prevalence in blood than non-breeding birds (10.1% prevalence in breeding vs. 43.2% in non-breeding birds). BFDV prevalence was much higher in younger (<3 years) than older (≥3 years) birds for both blood samples (42.9% vs. 4.5%) and cloacal swabs (56.4% vs. 12.3%). BFDV status in blood and cloacal samples was not correlated within individuals. We show that, at least in P. elegans, BFDV infection seems to occur year-round, with seasonal changes in prevalence and load found in our samples. Our analyses suggest that the seasonal changes were associated primarily with the breeding season.

10998,Ionizing Radiation Exposure in NICU,2019-12-12,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. In most cases, the development of the disease is sporadic and is not associated with any currently known mutations associated with PD. It is believed that changes associated with the epigenetic regulation of gene expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The study of individuals with an almost identical genetic background, such as monozygotic twins, is one of the best approaches to the analysis of such changes. A whole-transcriptome analysis of dermal fibroblasts obtained from three pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for PD was carried out in this work. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes were identified in the three pairs of twins. These genes were included in seven processes within two clusters, according to the results of an enrichment analysis. The cluster with the greatest statistical significance included processes associated with the regulation of the differentiation of fat cells, the action potential, and the regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The most significant genes, which occupied a central position in this cluster, were PTGS2, SCN9A, and GRIK2. These genes can be considered as potential candidate genes for PD.

11124,Perioperative Considerations in Endoscopic Skull Base Surgery,2020-03-19,"INTRODUCTION: The present study aimed to compare the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters of imipenem administered by two-step (50% delivered in a 30-min bolus, 50% for the following 90 min) or extended (administered continuously for 2 h) infusion. METHODS: Patients with sepsis and septic shock were prospectively enrolled and randomized into four groups. Subjects in the two-step or extended groups were given two doses of imipenem (0.5 g q6h and 1.0 g q8h). The plasma imipenem concentrations were measured at given time points after the fifth dose. The PK/PD target was defined as the achievement of a fractional time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of > 40%. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were eventually enrolled. No significant difference was observed in the percentage of patients achieving 40% T > MIC between the different infusion modes with the same dosage, although the two-step groups exhibited a significantly shorter T(max) compared with the extended groups (0.5 g q6h: 1.5 ± 0.8 vs. 2.0 ± 0.0 h; 1.0 g q8h: 1.0 ± 0.6 vs. 2.0 ± 0.0 h; both, p < 0.05). All four groups achieved 40% T > MIC when MIC was 0.5–4.0 μg/ml, but only regimens with a higher dose (1.0 g q8h) achieved target when MIC was 8 μg/ml. CONCLUSION: The two-step and extended regimens of imipenem are comparable to the PK/PD target in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock. A higher dose (1.0 g q8h) should be considered for target achievement at an MIC of > 8 μg/ml. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT02616354.

11756,In reply to the Letter to the Editor “Leadership to improve consistency in echocardiography date”,2020-06-04,"BACKGROUND: The role of minimally invasive surgery in trauma has continued to evolve over the past 20 years. Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) has become increasingly utilized for the diagnosis and management of both blunt and penetrating injuries. OBJECTIVE: While the safety and feasibility of laparoscopy has been established for penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma, it remains a controversial tool for other injury patterns due to the concern for complications and missed injuries. We sought to examine the role of laparoscopy for the initial management of traumatic injuries at our urban Level 1 trauma center. METHODS: All trauma patients who underwent DL for blunt or penetrating trauma between 2009 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, indications for DL, injuries identified, rate of conversion to open surgery, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 316 patients were included in the cohort. The mean age was 34.9 years old (± 13.7), mean GCS 14 (± 3), and median ISS 10 (4–18). A total of 110/316 patients (35%) sustained blunt injury and 206/316 patients (65%) sustained penetrating injury. Indications for DL included evaluation for peritoneal violation (152/316, 48%), free fluid without evidence of solid organ injury (52/316, 16%), evaluation of bowel injury (42/316, 13%), and evaluation for diaphragmatic injury (35/316, 11%). Of all DLs, 178/316 (56%) were negative for injury requiring intervention, which was 58% of blunt cases and 55% of penetrating cases. There were no missed injuries noted. Average hospital length of stay was significantly shorter for patients that underwent DL vs conversion to open exploration (2.2 days vs. 4.5 days, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this single institution, retrospective study, the high volume of cases appears to show that DL is a reliable tool for detecting injury and avoiding potential negative or non-therapeutic laparotomies. However, when injuries were present, the high rate of conversion to open exploration suggests that its utility for therapeutic intervention warrants further study.","Koganti, Deepika; Hazen, Benjamin J.; Dente, Christopher J.; Nguyen, Jonathan; Gelbard, Rondi B.",Surg Endosc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7271957/,77
11968,Implications of CRISPR/Cas9 system in Hypertension and its related diseases,2020-07-09,"PURPOSE: Macrophages are highly plastic cells. Under different stimuli, macrophages can be polarized into several different subsets. Two main macrophage subsets have been suggested: classically activated or inflammatory (M1) macrophages and alternatively activated or anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages. Macrophage polarization is governed by a highly complex set of regulatory networks. Many recent studies have shown that macrophages are key orchestrators in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and that regulation of macrophage polarization may improve the prognosis of ALI/ARDS. A further understanding of the mechanisms of macrophage polarization is expected to be helpful in the development of novel therapeutic targets to treat ALI/ARDS. Therefore, we performed a literature review to summarize the regulatory mechanisms of macrophage polarization and its role in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS. METHODS: A computer-based online search was performed using the PubMed database and Web of Science database for published articles concerning macrophages, macrophage polarization, and ALI/ARDS. RESULTS: In this review, we discuss the origin, polarization, and polarization regulation of macrophages as well as the role of macrophage polarization in various stages of ARDS. According to the current literature, regulating the polarized state of macrophages might be a potential therapeutic strategy against ALI/ARDS.","Chen, Xuxin; Tang, Jian; Shuai, Weizheng; Meng, Jiguang; Feng, Jian; Han, Zhihai",Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7347666/,77

Five themes emerged from the analysis of interviews: (1) genetic counseling and testing for breast/ovarian cancer was a new concept; (2) CREdIT’s story format was particularly appealing; (3) changes in participants’ perceived risk for breast cancer varied; (4) some misunderstandings about individual risk and heredity persisted after CREdIT and counseling; (5) the context for viewing CREdIT shaped responses to the presentation. Observations demonstrated ways to make the information provided in CREdIT and by genetic counselors more consistent. In a post-session counselor questionnaire, counselors’ rating of the patient’s preparedness before the session was significantly higher for patients who viewed CREdIT prior to their appointments than for other patients. This novel educational tool fills a gap in HBOC education by tailoring information to women of lower literacy and diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds. The tool was well received by interview participants and counselors alike. Further study is needed to examine the varied effects of CREdIT on risk perception. In addition, the implementation of CREdIT in diverse clinical settings and the cultural adaptation of CREdIT to specific populations reflect important areas for future work.","Joseph, Galen; Beattie, Mary S.; Lee, Robin; Braithwaite, Dejana; Wilcox, Carolina; Metrikin, Maya; Lamvik, Kate; Luce, Judith",J Genet Couns,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2944955/,77
13260,Age-Related Changes and Sex-Related Differences in Brain Iron Metabolism,2020-08-27,"Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) is an alphaherpesvirus that causes great economic losses in the cattle industry. Herpesvirus infection generally induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in infected cells. However, it is not clear whether ER stress and UPR can be induced by BoHV-1 infection. Here, we found that ER stress induced by BoHV-1 infection could activate all three UPR sensors (the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK)) in MDBK cells. During BoHV-1 infection, the ATF6 pathway of UPR did not affect viral replication. However, both knockdown and specific chemical inhibition of PERK attenuated the BoHV-1 proliferation, and chemical inhibition of PERK significantly reduced the viral replication at the post-entry step of the BoHV-1 life cycle. Furthermore, knockdown of IRE1 inhibits BoHV-1 replication, indicating that the IRE1 pathway may promote viral replication. Further study revealed that BoHV-1 replication was enhanced by IRE1 RNase activity inhibition at the stage of virus post-entry in MDBK cells. Furthermore, IRE1 kinase activity inhibition and RNase activity enhancement decrease BoHV1 replication via affecting the virus post-entry step. Our study revealed that BoHV-1 infection activated all three UPR signaling pathways in MDBK cells, and BoHV-1-induced PERK and IRE1 pathways may promote viral replication. This study provides a new perspective for the interactions of BoHV-1 and UPR, which is helpful to further elucidate the mechanism of BoHV-1 pathogenesis.","Wang, Song; Ma, Xiaomei; Wang, Hongmei; He, Hongbin",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7552016/,77

However, a logical design method of the dietary ingestion pattern controlling the postprandial blood glucose level has not yet been established. We constructed a mathematical model of blood glucose control by oral glucose ingestion in three healthy human subjects, and predicted that intermittent ingestion 30 min apart was the optimal glucose ingestion patterns that minimized the peak value of blood glucose level. We confirmed with subjects that this intermittent pattern consistently decreased the peak value of blood glucose level. We also predicted insulin minimization pattern, and found that the intermittent ingestion 30 min apart was optimal, which is similar to that of glucose minimization pattern. Taken together, these results suggest that the glucose minimization is achieved by suppressing the peak value of insulin concentration, rather than by enhancing insulin concentration. This approach could be applied to design optimal dietary ingestion patterns.","Fujii, Masashi; Murakami, Yohei; Karasawa, Yasuaki; Sumitomo, Yohei; Fujita, Suguru; Koyama, Masanori; Uda, Shinsuke; Kubota, Hiroyuki; Inoue, Hiroshi; Konishi, Katsumi; Oba, Shigeyuki; Ishii, Shin; Kuroda, Shinya",NPJ Syst Biol Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6718521/,77

13787,Correction to: The landscape of epilepsy-related GATOR1 variants,2018-08-29,"Deletion of a non-imprinted 500kb genomic region at chromosome 15q11.2, between breakpoints 1 and 2 of the Prader–Willi/Angelman locus (BP1–BP2 deletion), has been associated in previous studies with phenotypes including congenital cardiovascular malformations (CVM). Previous studies investigating association between BP1–BP2 deletion and CVM have tended to recruit cases with rarer and more severe CVM phenotypes; the impact of CVM on relatively unselected population cohorts, anticipated to contain chiefly less severe but commoner CHD phenotypes, is relatively unexplored. More precisely defining the impact of BP1–BP2 deletion on CVM risk could be useful to guide genetic counselling, since the deletion is frequently identified in the neurodevelopmental clinic. Using the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort of ~500,000 individuals, we identified individuals with CVM and investigated the association with deletions at the BP1–BP2 locus. In addition, we assessed the association of BP1–BP2 deletions with neuropsychiatric diagnoses, cognitive function and academic achievement. Cases of CVM had an increased prevalence of the deletion compared with controls (0.64%; OR = 1.73 [95% CI 1.08–2.75]; p = 0.03), as did those with neuropsychiatric diagnoses (0.68%; OR = 1.84 [95% CI 1.23–2.75]; p = 0.004). We conclude that BP1–BP2 deletion moderately increases the risk of the generally milder, but commoner, CVM phenotypes seen in this unselected population, in addition to its previously demonstrated association in case/control studies ascertained for CVM.","Williams, Simon G.; Nakev, Apostol; Guo, Hui; Frain, Simon; Tenin, Gennadiy; Liakhovitskaia, Anna; Saha, Priyanka; Priest, James R.; Hentges, Kathryn E.; Keavney, Bernard D.",Eur J Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608352/,77

14335,Acceptability of a Hypothetical Zika Vaccine among Women from Colombia and Spain Exposed to ZIKV: A Qualitative Study,2020-10-03,"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a mycotic disease caused by the Paracoccidioides species, a group of thermally dimorphic fungi that grow in mycelial form at 25 °C and as budding yeasts when cultured at 37 °C or when parasitizing the host tissues. PCM occurs in a large area of Latin America, and the most critical regions of endemicity are in Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The clinical diagnosis of PCM needs to be confirmed through laboratory tests. Although classical laboratory techniques provide valuable information due to the presence of pathognomonic forms of Paracoccidioides spp., nucleic acid-based diagnostics gradually are replacing or complementing culture-based, biochemical, and immunological assays in routine microbiology laboratory practice. Recently, taxonomic changes driven by whole-genomic sequencing of Paracoccidioides have highlighted the need to recognize species boundaries, which could better ascertain Paracoccidioides taxonomy. In this scenario, classical laboratory techniques do not have significant discriminatory power over cryptic agents. On the other hand, several PCR-based methods can detect polymorphisms in Paracoccidioides DNA and thus support species identification. This review is focused on the recent achievements in molecular diagnostics of paracoccidioidomycosis, including the main advantages and pitfalls related to each technique. We discuss these breakthroughs in light of taxonomic changes in the Paracoccidioides genus.","Pinheiro, Breno Gonçalves; Hahn, Rosane Christine; de Camargo, Zoilo Pires; Rodrigues, Anderson Messias",J Fungi (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7711936/,77
14398,Corrigendum,2020-10-29,"The maximum running speed that a football player can attain during match play has become one of the most popular variables to assess a player’s physical talent. However, the influence of a player’s maximum running speed on football performance has not yet been properly investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of a player’s peak/maximum running speed on the team’s ranking position at the end of a national league. A second aim was to investigate differences in maximum running speed among playing positions. To fulfil this aim, the peak/maximum running speeds of 475 male professional football players were recorded for 38 fixtures of the Spanish first-division league (LaLiga) from the 2017–2018 season (7838 data points). Players’ peak running speeds in each match were assessed with a validated multicamera tracking system and associated software (Mediacoach(®)). Players’ maximum running speed was established as the fastest running speed they attained during the entire season. Most players (53.5% of the total) had a maximum running speed in the range of 32.0–33.9 km/h, with only three players (0.6%) with a maximum running speed of over 35.0 km/h. Overall, forwards were faster than defenders and both types of players were faster than midfielders (33.03 ± 1.35 > 32.72 ± 1.32 > 32.08 ± 1.63 km/h; p < 0.001). There was no association between teams’ maximum running speed and ranking position at the end of the league (r = −0.356, p = 0.135). The correlations between teams’ maximum speeds and ranking position were low for defenders (r = −0.334, p = 0.163), midfielders (r = 0.125, p = 0.610), and forwards (r = −0.065, p = 0.791). As a result, the variance in the ranking position at the end of the season explained by a team’s maximum speed was of only 7.5%. Finally, as an average for all teams, players’ peak running speeds remained stable at ~30.7 ± 0.6 km/h throughout the whole season. These results suggest that successful and less successful football teams have squads with players able to obtain similar maximum running speeds during match play throughout the season. Hence, players’ maximum running speeds have a poor association with the team’s ranking position at the end of the Spanish professional national league.","Del Coso, Juan; Brito de Souza, Diego; Moreno-Perez, Víctor; Buldú, Javier M.; Nevado, Fabio; Resta, Ricardo; López-Del Campo, Roberto",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7729782/,77

Several studies in humans and animal models have demonstrated an association between gut microbial metabolites such as trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), short-chain fatty acids, and bile acid metabolites (amino acid breakdown products) with CVD. Human blood platelets are a critical contributor to the hemostatic process. Besides, these blood cells play a crucial role in developing atherosclerosis and, finally, contribute to cardiac events. Since the TMAO, and other metabolites of the gut microbiota, are asociated with platelet hyperactivity, lipid disorders, and oxidative stress, the diet-gut microbiota interactions have become an important research area in the cardiovascular field. The gut microbiota and their metabolites may be targeted for the therapeutic benefit of CVD from a clinical perspective.

The large, double-stranded DNA virus replicates in perinuclear cytoplasmic replication sites known as viral factories. These factories are complex, multi-dimensional structures. Here we investigated the protein and membrane compartments of the factory using super-resolution and electron tomography. Click IT chemistry in combination with stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy revealed a reticular network of newly synthesized viral proteins, including the structural proteins p54 and p34, previously seen as a pleomorphic ribbon by confocal microscopy. Electron microscopy and tomography confirmed that this network is an accumulation of membrane assembly intermediates which take several forms. At early time points in the factory formation, these intermediates present as small, individual membrane fragments which appear to grow and link together, in a continuous progression towards new, icosahedral virions. It remains unknown how these membranes form and how they traffic to the factory during virus morphogenesis.","Aicher, Sophie-Marie; Monaghan, Paul; Netherton, Christopher L.; Hawes, Philippa C.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7827680/,77

In contrast, only limited data are available after transient ischemic attack (TIA). We aim to assess sex-related differences in the presentation, cause, neuroimaging features, and predictors of long-term prognosis in patients with TIA. METHODS: We carried out a prospective cohort study of consecutive patients with TIA from January 2006 to June 2010. Nondefinitive TIA events were defined by the presence of isolated atypical symptoms. The risk of stroke recurrence (SR) and composite of major vascular events were stratified by sex after a median follow-up time of 6.5 (interquartile range, 5.0–9.6) years. RESULTS: Among the 723 patients studied, 302 (41.8%) were female and 79 (10.9%) suffered a nondefinitive TIA event. Vascular territory diffusion-weighted imaging patterns (odds ratio, 1.61 [95% CI, 0.94–2.77]), and nondefinitive TIA events (odds ratio, 2.66 [95% CI, 1.55–4.59]) were associated with women, whereas active smoking (odds ratio, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.15–0.58]) and large artery atherosclerosis causes (odds ratio, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.29–0.83]) were related to men. The risk of SR was similar in both sexes (12.6% [95% CI, 8.9–16.3] for women versus 14.3% [95% CI, 11.0–17.6] for men). In contrast, the risk of major vascular events was significantly lower in women than in men (17.5% [95% CI, 13.2–21.8] versus 23.8% [95% CI, 19.7–27.9]). In both sexes, after adjusting for age, large artery atherosclerosis was associated with SR (hazard ratio, 3.22 [95% CI, 1.42–7.24] and hazard ratio, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.14–3.51]). In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, females with positive diffusion-weighted imaging (P=0.014) and definitive TIA (log-rank test P=0.022) had a significantly higher risk of SR. CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar risks of SR, there were sex-related differences in baseline characteristics, presenting symptoms, patterns of acute ischemic lesions, cause, and outcomes. These findings encourage further research into optimal preventive strategies that take into account these differences.","Purroy, Francisco; Vicente-Pascual, Mikel; Arque, Gloria; Baraldes-Rovira, Mariona; Begue, Robert; Gallego, Yhovany; Gil, M.

Local microbiological surveillance of pathogens and resistance patterns for early-onset VAP (EOVAP) and late-onset VAP (LOVAP) will help to choose appropriate empiric antibiotics. OBJECTIVE: To compare the multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, treatment outcomes, and factors associated with hospital mortality of VAP. METHOD: A cross-sectional study between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2017 at Srinagarind hospital, Khon Kaen University was conducted. The demographic data, causative pathogens, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, mechanical ventilator (MV) days, and hospital mortality were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety patients were enrolled; 42 patients (22%) were EOVAP and 148 patients (78%) were LOVAP. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common pathogen in both groups (50% EOVAP vs 52.7% LOVAP). MDR pathogens were significant greater in LOVAP (81.8%) than EOVAP (61.9%) (p = 0.007). The EOVAP had a significantly better ICU LOS [median (interquartile range, IQR) 20.0 (11.0, 30.0) vs. 26.5 (17.0, 43.0) days], hospital LOS [median (IQR) 26.5 (15.0, 44.0) vs. 35.5 (24.0, 56.0) days] shorter MV days [median (IQR) 14.0 (10.0, 29.0) vs. 23.0 (14.0, 35.5) days] and lower hospital mortality (16.7% vs 35.1%) than LOVAP (p < 0.05). The factor associated with hospital mortality was having simplified acute physiology (SAP) II score ≥ 40 with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.22 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08–4.54, p = 0.02]. CONCLUSION: LOVAP had significantly higher MDR pathogens, MV days, ICU LOS, hospital LOS and hospital mortality than EOVAP.

15218,Psychiatric Comorbidities in Adolescents with Obesity: A Wake-Up Call for Life Course and Multisectoral Interventions,2021-02-04,"Innate immune receptors initiate a host immune response, or inflammatory response, upon detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Among the innate immune receptors, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) play a pivotal role in detecting cytosolic PAMPs and DAMPs. Some NLRs can form a multiprotein cytosolic complex known as the inflammasome. Inflammasome activation triggers caspase-1–mediated cleavage of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD), which drives a form of inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis. Parallelly, activated caspase-1 cleaves immature cytokines pro–IL-1β and pro–IL-18 into their active forms, which can be released via GSDMD membrane pores. The NLR family apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIP)-NLR family caspase-associated recruitment domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4) inflammasome is important for mounting an immune response against Gram-negative bacteria. NLRC4 is activated through NAIPs sensing type 3 secretion system (T3SS) proteins from Gram-negative bacteria, such as Salmonella Typhimurium. Mutations in NAIPs and NLRC4 are linked to autoinflammatory disorders in humans. In this review, we highlight the role of the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome in host defense, autoinflammatory diseases, cancer, and cell death. We also discuss evidence pointing to a role of NLRC4 in PANoptosis, which was recently identified as a unique inflammatory programmed cell death pathway with important physiological relevance in a range of diseases. Improved understanding of the NLRC4 inflammasome and its potential roles in PANoptosis paves the way for identifying new therapeutic strategies to target disease.","Sundaram, Balamurugan; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7864484/,77

Virtual synchronous focus groups provide an electronic means to obtain qualitative data and are convenient to implement; however, the protocols and acceptability for conducting virtual synchronous focus groups in HIV prevention research among BSMM are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocols and acceptability of conducting virtual synchronous focus groups in HIV prevention research among BSMM METHODS: Data for this study came from 8 virtual synchronous focus groups examined in 2 studies of HIV-negative BSMM in US cities, stratified by age (N=39): 2 groups of BSMM ages 18-24 years, 5 groups of BSMM ages 25-34 years, and 1 group of BSMM 35 years and older. Virtual synchronous focus groups were conducted via Zoom, and participants were asked to complete an electronic satisfaction survey distributed to their email via Qualtrics. RESULTS: The age of participants ranged from 18 to 44 years (mean 28.3, SD 6.0). All participants “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that they were satisfied participating in an online focus group. Only 17% (5/30) preferred providing written informed consent versus oral consent. Regarding privacy, most (30/30,100%) reported “strongly agree” or “agree” that their information was safe to share with other participants in the group.

Study Design and Methods: The study was designed as a diagnostic test. Having qualified patients for the study, an ultrasound examination was performed, consistent with a predetermined protocol, and employing convex and linear transducers. We investigated the possibility of B-line artifact conversion depending on the set frequency (2 MHz and 6 MHz), and examined pleural line abnormalities. Results: The study group comprised 32 patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) (and fibrosis) and 30 patients with pulmonary edema. In total, 1941 cineloops were obtained from both groups and analyzed. The employment of both types of transducers (linear and convex) was most effective (specificity 91%, specificity 97%, positive predictive value (PPV) 97%, negative predictive value (NPV) 91%, LR(+) 27,19, LR(−) 0.097, area under curve (AUC) = 0.936, p = 7 × 10(−6)).

16479,Hiding in plain sight,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND: There is limited quantitative research on the effect of physician attire on patient–physician relationships. This study aimed to measure the influence of Japanese family physicians’ attire on the “human” aspects of medical care in terms of patient-perceived relational empathy. METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective, controlled trial conducted in primary clinics in Japan. We explored the effects of family physician attire (white coat vs. casual attire) on patient-perceived empathy. Family physicians were allocated to alternate weeks of wearing a white coat or casual attire during consultations. Patients’ perceptions of physician empathy were evaluated using the self-rated Japanese Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) Measure. We used a linear mixed model to analyze the CARE Measure scores, adjusting for cluster effects of patients nested within doctor, age, and sex of patients, and doctors’ sex and years of clinical experience. We used the same method with Bonferroni adjustment to analyze patient sex differences in perceived empathy. RESULTS: A total of 632 patients of seven family physicians were allocated to white coat-wearing consultations (n = 328), and casual attire-wearing consultations (n = 304). There was no difference in CARE Measure scores between white coat and casual primary care consultations overall (p = 0.162). Subgroup analysis of patient sex showed that CARE Measure scores of male patients were significantly higher in the Casual group than in the White coat group (adjusted p-value = 0.044). There was no difference in female patient scores between White coat and Casual groups (adjusted p-value = 1.000). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that physician attire (white coat or casual attire) in a primary care setting did not affect patient-perceived relational empathy overall. However, male patients of physicians wearing casual attire reported higher physician empathy. Although empathy cannot be reduced to simple variables such as attire, white coats may have a negative effect on patients, depending on the context. Family physicians should choose their attire carefully. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Japanese University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN-ICDR).

17325,Progression from Type 2 Macular Neovascularization to Fibrovascular Pigment Epithelial Detachment,2021-03-25,"INTRODUCTION: Glucose variability is associated with mortality and macrovascular diabetes complications. The mechanisms through which glucose variability mediates tissue damage are not well understood, although cellular oxidative stress is likely involved. As heat shock proteins (HSPs) play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) complications and are rapidly responsive, we hypothesized that HSP-related proteins (HSPRPs) would differ in diabetes and may respond to glucose normalization. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective, parallel study in T2D (n=23) and controls (n=23) was undertaken. T2D subjects underwent insulin-induced blood glucose normalization from baseline 7.6±0.4 mmol/L (136.8±7.2 mg/dL) to 4.5±0.07 mmol/L (81±1.2 mg/dL) for 1 hour. Control subjects were maintained at 4.9±0.1 mmol/L (88.2±1.8 mg/dL). Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer-scan plasma protein measurement determined a panel of HSPRPs. RESULTS: At baseline, E3-ubiquitin-protein ligase (carboxyl-terminus of Hsc70 interacting protein (CHIP) or HSPABP2) was lower (p=0.03) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2G2 higher (p=0.003) in T2D versus controls. Following glucose normalization, DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 1 (DNAJB1 or HSP40) was reduced (p=0.02) in T2D, with HSP beta-1 (HSPB1) and HSP-70-1A (HSP70-1A) (p=0.07 and p=0.09, respectively) also approaching significance relative to T2D baseline levels. CONCLUSIONS: Key HSPRPs involved in critical protein interactions, CHIP and UBE2G2, were altered in diabetes at baseline. DNAJB1 fell in response to euglycemia, suggesting that HSPs are reacting to basal stress that could be mitigated by tight glucose control with reduction of glucose variability.","Atkin, Alexander S; Moin, Abu Saleh Md; Al-Qaissi, Ahmed; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Atkin, Stephen L; Butler, Alexandra E",BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8061861/,77
17703,The Neonatal Resuscitation Protocol: Keep It Simple?,2021-05-21,"The mechanism of intercellular transport of Wnt ligands is still a matter of debate. To better understand this issue, we examined the distribution and dynamics of Wnt8 in Xenopus embryos. While Venus-tagged Wnt8 was found on the surfaces of cells close to Wnt-producing cells, we also detected its dispersal over distances of 15 cell diameters. A combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and quantitative imaging suggested that only a small proportion of Wnt8 ligands diffuses freely, whereas most Wnt8 molecules are bound to cell surfaces. Fluorescence decay after photoconversion showed that Wnt8 ligands bound on cell surfaces decrease exponentially, suggesting a dynamic exchange of bound forms of Wnt ligands. Mathematical modeling based on this exchange recapitulates a graded distribution of bound, but not free, Wnt ligands. Based on these results, we propose that Wnt distribution in tissues is controlled by a dynamic exchange of its abundant bound and rare free populations.","Mii, Yusuke; Nakazato, Kenichi; Pack, Chan-Gi; Ikeda, Takafumi; Sako, Yasushi; Mochizuki, Atsushi; Taira, Masanori; Takada, Shinji",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8139832/,77
17817,Correction to Lancet Haematol 2021; 8: e185–93,2021-05-25,"Brain tumor localization and segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are hard and important tasks for several applications in the field of medical analysis. As each brain imaging modality gives unique and key details related to each part of the tumor, many recent approaches used four modalities T1, T1c, T2, and FLAIR. Although many of them obtained a promising segmentation result on the BRATS 2018 dataset, they suffer from a complex structure that needs more time to train and test. So, in this paper, to obtain a flexible and effective brain tumor segmentation system, first, we propose a preprocessing approach to work only on a small part of the image rather than the whole part of the image. This method leads to a decrease in computing time and overcomes the overfitting problems in a Cascade Deep Learning model. In the second step, as we are dealing with a smaller part of brain images in each slice, a simple and efficient Cascade Convolutional Neural Network (C-ConvNet/C-CNN) is proposed. This C-CNN model mines both local and global features in two different routes. Also, to improve the brain tumor segmentation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art models, a novel Distance-Wise Attention (DWA) mechanism is introduced. The DWA mechanism considers the effect of the center location of the tumor and the brain inside the model. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the BRATS 2018 dataset and show that the proposed model obtains competitive results: the proposed method achieves a mean whole tumor, enhancing tumor, and tumor core dice scores of 0.9203, 0.9113 and 0.8726 respectively. Other quantitative and qualitative assessments are presented and discussed.","Ranjbarzadeh, Ramin; Bagherian Kasgari, Abbas; Jafarzadeh Ghoushchi, Saeid; Anari, Shokofeh; Naseri, Maryam; Bendechache, Malika",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8149837/,77

A literature search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library database was conducted. Meta-analyses were carried out comparing restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the basis of cyanotic status. Five randomized controlled trials with a total of 497 children were included. There was no significant difference in the risk of in-hospital mortality between the two transfusion strategies (risk ratio 1.21; 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 2.99; P = 0.68). The trial sequential analysis suggested that the current meta-analysis had an absence of evidence for in-hospital mortality, and the data were insufficient. Moreover, no significant differences existed between groups in terms of risk of infection, blood loss, duration of mechanical ventilation, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) stay duration, or hospital stay duration. Cyanotic children treated with a liberal transfusion strategy had a shorter ventilator duration, but the transfusion strategy did not affect in-hospital mortality, infection, hospital stay, or PICU stay duration. On the basis of the available data, our analysis indicates that a liberal transfusion strategy did not lead to a better outcomes, but the data are extremely sparse, which highlights the need for clearer transfusion guidelines specific to this specific population.

Several glycans, including sialic acid, histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) are reported as RV attachment factors. The glycan binding specificity of different P[3] RV VP8*s were investigated in this study. Human HCR3A and dog P[3] RV VP8*s recognized glycans with terminal sialic acid and hemagglutinated the red blood cells, while bat P[3] VP8* showed neither binding to glycans nor hemagglutination. However, the bat P[3] VP8* mutant of C189Y obtained the ability to hemagglutinate the red blood cells, while human P[3] HCR3A/M2-102 mutants of Y189C lost the ability. Sequence alignment and structural analysis indicated that residue 189 played an important role in the ligand recognition and may contribute to the cross-species transmission. Structural superimposition exhibited that bat P[3] VP8* model was quite different from the simian P[3] Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) P[3] VP8*, indicating that bat P[3] RV was relatively distinct and partially contributed to the no binding to tested glycans. These results promote our understanding of P[3] VP8*/glycans interactions and the potential transmission of bat/human P[3] RVs, offering more insight into the RV infection and prevalence.","Li, Dandi; Wang, Mengxuan; Mao, Tongyao; Wang, Mingwen; Zhang, Qing; Wang, Hong; Pang, Lili; Sun, Xiaoman; Duan, Zhaojun",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8165343/,77

More recently, mast cells have been recognized as key orchestrators of anti-tumor immunity, modulators of the cancer stroma, and have also been implicated in cancer cell intrinsic properties. As such, mast cells are an underrecognized but very promising target for cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss the role of mast cells in shaping cancer and its microenvironment, the interaction between mast cells and cancer therapies, and strategies to target mast cells to improve cancer outcomes. Specifically, we address (1) decreasing cell numbers through c-KIT inhibition, (2) modulating mast cell activation and phenotype (through mast cell stabilizers, FcεR1 signaling pathway activators/inhibitors, antibodies targeting inhibitory receptors and ligands, toll like receptor agonists), and (3) altering secreted mast cell mediators and their downstream effects. Finally, we discuss the importance of translational research using patient samples to advance the field of mast cell targeting to optimally improve patient outcomes. As we aim to expand the successes of existing cancer immunotherapies, focused clinical and translational studies targeting mast cells in different cancer contexts are now warranted.","Lichterman, Jake N.; Reddy, Sangeetha M.",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8223777/,77

In this study, participants in the Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative (N = 53) with a personal and/or family history of Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Disorder were interviewed based on the Health Belief Model around hypothetical intention to test one’s children for probability of developing a mood disorder. Most participants (87 %) were interested in a hypothetical test for children that had high (“90 %”) positive predictive value, while 51 % of participants remained interested in a modestly predictive test (“20 %”). Interest was driven by beliefs about effects of test results on parenting behaviors and on discrimination. Most participants favored testing before adolescence (64 %), and were reluctant to share results with asymptomatic children before adulthood. Participants anticipated both positive and negative effects of testing on parental treatment and on children’s self-esteem. Further investigation will determine whether these findings will generalize to other complex disorders for which early intervention is possible but not clearly demonstrated to improve outcomes. More information is also needed about the effects of childhood genetic testing and sharing of results on parent–child relationships, and about the role of the child in the decision-making process.

18833,Issue Highlights,2021-07-01,"Investigation reveals that a high percentage of incident causes are ascribed to some forms of human error. To effectively prevent incidents from happening, Human Reliability Analysis (HRA), as a structured way to represent unintentional operator contribution to system reliability, is a critical issue. Human Error Reduction and Assessment Technique (HEART) as a famous HRA technique, provides a straightforward method to estimate probabilities of human error based on the analysis of tasks. However, it faces varying levels of uncertainty in assigning of weights to each error producing condition (EPC), denoted as assessed proportion of affect (APOA), by experts. To overcome this limitation and consider the confidence level (reliability or credibility) of the experts, the current study aimed at proposing a composite HEART methodology for human error probability (HEP) assessment, which integrates HEART and Z-numbers short for, Z-HEART. The applicability and effectiveness of the Z-HEART has been illustrated in the de-energization power line as a case study. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is fulfilled to investigate the validity of the proposed methodology. It can be concluded that Z-HEART is feasible for assessing human error, and despite the methodological contributions, it offers many advantages for electricity distribution companies.","Aghaei, Hamed; Mirzaei Aliabadi, Mostafa; Mollabahrami, Farzaneh; Najafi, Kamran",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8248607/,77
19329,Stigma from medication use: an under recognised burden of care,2021-03-11,"Bone and muscle tissues influence each other through the integration of mechanical and biochemical signals, giving rise to bone–muscle crosstalk. They are also known to secrete osteokines, myokines, and cytokines into the circulation, influencing the biological and pathological activities in local and distant organs and cells. In this regard, even osteoporosis and sarcopenia, which were initially thought to be two independent diseases, have recently been defined under the term “osteosarcopenia”, to indicate a synergistic condition of low bone mass with muscle atrophy and hypofunction. Undoubtedly, osteosarcopenia is a major public health concern, being associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The best current defence against osteosarcopenia is prevention based on a healthy lifestyle and regular exercise. The most appropriate type, intensity, duration, and frequency of exercise to positively influence osteosarcopenia are not yet known. However, combined programmes of progressive resistance exercises, weight-bearing impact exercises, and challenging balance/mobility activities currently appear to be the most effective in optimising musculoskeletal health and function. Based on this evidence, the aim of our review was to summarize the current knowledge about the role of exercise in bone–muscle crosstalk, highlighting how it may represent an effective alternative strategy to prevent and/or counteract the onset of osteosarcopenia.","Cariati, Ida; Bonanni, Roberto; Onorato, Federica; Mastrogregori, Ambra; Rossi, Danilo; Iundusi, Riccardo; Gasbarra, Elena; Tancredi, Virginia; Tarantino, Umberto",J Funct Morphol Kinesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8293201/,77

Understanding the molecular underpinnings that control adipogenesis is thus of fundamental importance for the development of novel therapeutics against metabolic disorders. However, translational approaches are hampered as current models do not accurately recapitulate adipogenesis. Here, a scaffold‐free versatile 3D adipocyte culture platform with chemically defined conditions is presented in which primary human preadipocytes accurately recapitulate adipogenesis. Following differentiation, multi‐omics profiling and functional tests demonstrate that 3D adipocyte cultures feature mature molecular and cellular phenotypes similar to freshly isolated mature adipocytes. Spheroids exhibit physiologically relevant gene expression signatures with 4704 differentially expressed genes compared to conventional 2D cultures (false discovery rate < 0.05), including the concerted expression of factors shaping the adipogenic niche. Furthermore, lipid profiles of >1000 lipid species closely resemble patterns of the corresponding isogenic mature adipocytes in vivo (R (2) = 0.97). Integration of multi‐omics signatures with analyses of the activity profiles of 503 transcription factors using global promoter motif inference reveals a complex signaling network, involving YAP, Hedgehog, and TGFβ signaling, that links the organotypic microenvironment in 3D culture to the activation and reinforcement of PPARγ and CEBP activity resulting in improved adipogenesis.","Shen, Joanne X.; Couchet, Morgane; Dufau, Jérémy; de Castro Barbosa, Thais; Ulbrich, Maximilian H.; Helmstädter, Martin; Kemas, Aurino M.; Zandi Shafagh, Reza; Marques, Marie‐Adeline; Hansen, Jacob B.; Mejhert, Niklas; Langin, Dominique; Rydén, Mikael; Lauschke, Volker M.",Adv Sci (Weinh),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8373086/,77

It is generally accepted that, in physiological conditions, cyclic AMP (cAMP) plays a key role in maintaining BBB permeability by regulating the formation of tight junctions between endothelial cells of the brain microvasculature. It is also known that intracellular cAMP signaling is highly compartmentalized into small nanodomains and localized cAMP changes are sufficient at modifying the permeability of the endothelial barrier. This spatial and temporal distribution is maintained by the enzymes involved in cAMP synthesis and degradation, by the location of its effectors, and by the existence of anchor proteins, as well as by buffers or different cytoplasm viscosities and intracellular structures limiting its diffusion. This review compiles current knowledge on the influence of cAMP compartmentalization on the endothelial barrier and, more specifically, on the BBB, laying the foundation for a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of AD.","Viña, Dolores; Seoane, Nuria; Vasquez, Elisardo C.; Campos-Toimil, Manuel",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8392343/,77

Efficacious dengue vaccines should be able to provide long-lasting immunity against all four DENV serotypes simultaneously. In this study, we constructed a novel vaccine platform based on tetravalent dengue virus-like particles (DENV-LPs) in which envelope (E) protein carried a FLAG tag sequence at the position located not only in the exterior loop on the protruding domain but outside of dimerization interface of the protein. We demonstrated an effective strategy to produce the DENV-LPs by transient transfection with expression plasmids for pre-membrane and E proteins of DENV-1 to DENV-4 in mammalian cells and to concentrate and purify them with one-step affinity chromatography. Characteristic features of VLPs such as particle size, shape and density were comparable to flavivirus-like particles reported. The neutralizing activity against all four DENV serotypes was successfully induced by immunization with the purified tetravalent VLPs in mice. Simple, one-step purification systems for VLP vaccine platforms using epitope-tagging strategy should be advantageous for vaccine development not only for dengue but for emerging pandemics in the future.","Imagawa, Toshifumi; Ito, Masahiko; Matsuda, Mami; Nakashima, Kenji; Tokunaga, Yuhei; Ohta, Isao; Li, Tian-Cheng; Suzuki, Ryosuke; Suzuki, Tetsuro",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8413300/,77

Due to their periodicity, conformational flexibility, pseudo-symmetry of the sulfation pattern, and the key role of electrostatics, these molecules are challenging for both experimental and theoretical approaches. In particular, conventional molecular docking applied for GAGs longer than 10-mer experiences severe difficulties. In this work, for the first time, 24- and 48-meric GAGs were docked using all-atomic repulsive-scaling Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics (RS-REMD), a novel methodology based on replicas with van der Waals radii of interacting molecules being scaled. This approach performed well for proteins complexed with oligomeric GAGs and is independent of their length, which distinguishes it from other molecular docking approaches. We built a model of long GAGs in complex with a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) prebound to its receptors, the B cell maturation antigen and the transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI). Furthermore, the prediction power of the RS-REMD for this tertiary complex was evaluated. We conclude that the TACI–GAG interaction could be potentially amplified by TACI’s binding to APRIL. RS-REMD outperformed Autodock3, the docking program previously proven the best for short GAGs.","Marcisz, Mateusz; Maszota-Zieleniak, Martyna; Huard, Bertrand; Samsonov, Sergey A.",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8465899/,77

Bleeding complications may offset the benefit of antiplatelet drugs in patients at increased risk of bleeding and low risk of recurrent ischemic events. We aimed to investigate the net benefit of antiplatelet treatment according to an individuals’ bleeding risk. METHODS: We pooled individual patient data from 6 randomized clinical trials (CAPRIE [Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events], ESPS-2 [European Stroke Prevention Study-2], MATCH [Management of Atherothrombosis With Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients], CHARISMA [Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance], ESPRIT [European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischemia Trial], and PRoFESS [Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes]) investigating antiplatelet therapy in the subacute or chronic phase after noncardioembolic transient ischemic attack or stroke. Patients were stratified into quintiles according to their predicted risk of major bleeding with the S(2)TOP-BLEED score. The annual risk of major bleeding and recurrent ischemic events was assessed per quintile for 4 scenarios: (1) aspirin monotherapy, (2) aspirin-clopidogrel versus aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy, (3) aspirin-dipyridamole versus clopidogrel, and (4) aspirin versus clopidogrel. Net benefit was calculated for the second, third, and fourth scenario. RESULTS: Thirty seven thousand eighty-seven patients were included in the analyses. Both risk of major bleeding and recurrent ischemic events increased over quintiles of predicted bleeding risk, but risk of ischemic events was consistently higher (eg, from 0.7%/y (bottom quintile) to 3.2%/y (top quintile) for major bleeding on aspirin and from 2.5%/y to 10.2%/y for risk of ischemic events on aspirin). Treatment with aspirin-clopidogrel led to more major bleedings (0.9%–1.7% per year), than reduction in ischemic events (ranging from 0.4% to 0.9/1.0% per year) across all quintiles. There was no clear preference for either aspirin-dipyridamole or clopidogrel according to baseline bleeding risk. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with a transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke included in clinical trials of antiplatelet therapy, the risk of recurrent ischemic events and of major bleeding increase in parallel. Antiplatelet treatment cannot be individualized solely based on bleeding risk assessment.","Hilkens, Nina A.; Algra, Ale; Diener, Hans Christoph; Bath, Philip M.; Csiba, László; Hacke, Werner; Kappelle, L.

We define financial uncertainty (FU) as the difference between an actual amount of claim (AC) and the discounted present value of the AC (DAC). DAC can be calculated based on a discounted present value calculated using a cash flow, a period of investment, and a discount rate. The present study considered these three items as AC, the length of hospital stay, and the predicted mortality rate. The mortality prediction model was built using typical data items in standard level electronic medical records such as sex, age, and disease information. The performance of the prediction model was moderate because an area under curve was approximately 85%. The empirical analysis primarily compares the FU of the top 20 diseases with the actual AC using a retrospective cohort in the University of Miyazaki Hospital. The observational period is 5 years, from April 1, 2013, to March 31, 2018. The analysis demonstrates that the proportion of FU to actual AC is higher than 20% in low-weight children, patients with leukemia, brain tumor, myeloid leukemia, or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. For these diseases, patients cannot avoid long hospitalization; therefore, the medical fee payment system should be designed based on uncertainty. Our method is both practical and generalizable because it uses a small number of data items that are required in standard electronic medical records. This method contributes to the decision-making processes of health policymakers.","Furuhata, Hiroki; Araki, Kenji; Ogawa, Taisuke",J Med Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8484292/,77
21925,Pharmacological properties of baicalin on liver diseases: a narrative review,2021-02-17,"OBJECTIVES: Disrespectful and poor treatment of newborns such as unnecessary separation from parents or failure to obtain parental consent for medical procedures occurs at health facilities across contexts, but little research has investigated the prevalence, risk factors or associated outcomes. This study examined these experiences and associations with healthcare satisfaction, use and breast feeding. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: 3 public hospitals, 2 private hospitals, and 1 health centre/dispensary in Nairobi and Kiambu counties in Kenya. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from women who delivered in health facilities between September 2019 and January 2020. The sample included 1014 women surveyed at baseline and at least one follow-up at 2–4 or 10 weeks post partum. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Outcomes related to satisfaction with care and care utilisation; (2) continuation of post-discharge newborn care practices such as breast feeding. RESULTS: 17.6% of women reported newborn separation at the facility, of whom 71.9% were separated over 10 min. 44.9% felt separation was unnecessary and 8.4% reported not knowing the reason for separation. 59.9% reported consent was not obtained for procedures on their newborn. Women separated from their newborn (>10 min) were 44% less likely to be exclusively breast feeding at 2–4 weeks (adjusted OR (aOR)=0.56, 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.76). Obtaining consent for newborn procedures corresponded with 2.7 times greater likelihood of satisfaction with care (aOR=2.71, 95% CI: 1.67 to 4.41), 27% greater likelihood of postpartum visit attendance for self or newborn (aOR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.55), and 33% greater likelihood of exclusive breast feeding at 10 weeks (aOR=1.33, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.62). CONCLUSIONS: Newborns, mothers and families have a right to high-quality, respectful care, including the ability to stay together, be informed and properly consent for care. The implications of these experiences on health outcomes a month or more after discharge illustrate the importance of a positive experience of postnatal care.","Nakphong, Michelle Kao; Sacks, Emma; Opot, James; Sudhinaraset, May",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8479975/,77

We aimed to characterize the anti-HIV-1 activity of the cervical mucus plugs against a panel of different HIV-1 strains in the contexts of cell-free and cell-associated virus. DESIGN: A cohort of consenting HIV-1-negative and HIV-1-positive pregnant women in labour was recruited from Mthatha General Hospital in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, from whom the cervical mucus plugs were collected in 6 M guanidinium chloride with protease inhibitors and transported to our laboratories at −80 °C. METHODS: Samples were centrifuged to remove insoluble material and dialysed before freeze--drying and subjecting them to the cell viability assays. The antiviral activities of the samples were studied using luminometric reporter assays and flow cytometry. Time-of-addition and BlaM-Vpr virus-cell fusion assays were used to pin-point the antiviral mechanisms of the cervical mucus plugs, before proteomic profiling using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The proteinaceous fraction of the cervical mucus plugs exhibited anti-HIV-1 activity with inter-individual variations and some degree of specificity among different HIV-1 strains. Cell-associated HIV-1 was less susceptible to inhibition by the potent samples whenever compared with the cell-free HIV-1. The samples with high antiviral potency exhibited a distinct proteomic profile when compared with the less potent samples. CONCLUSION: The crude cervical mucus plugs exhibit anti-HIV-1 activity, which is defined by a specific proteomic profile.","Mhlekude, Baxolele; Lenman, Annasara; Sidoyi, Phikolomzi; Joseph, Jim; Kruppa, Jochen; Businge, Charles Bitamazire; Mdaka, Mana Lungisa; Konietschke, Frank; Pich, Andreas; Gerold, Gisa; Goffinet, Christine; Mall, Anwar Suleman",AIDS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8505157/,77

They were the cause of a number of outbreaks of respiratory and neurological disease infecting horses and pigs respectively. Transmission from infected domestic animal species resulted in human infections as well, with high case fatality rates a feature. Today they continue to cause outbreaks of human and animal disease. NiV causes yearly disease outbreaks in humans in Bangladesh, and HeV causes sporadic disease outbreaks in horses in north eastern Australia. Due to their zoonotic nature, they have been ideal candidates for collaborative projects in the One Health space, bringing public health and animal health professionals together. This has lead to insightful epidemiological studies, which has resulted in practical disease prevention solutions including a horse vaccine for HeV and NiV spill-over prevention interventions in the field. As more surveillance is undertaken, their known distributions have expanded, as has the range of reservoir host species. The majority of bat species for which there is evidence of henipavirus infection belong to the group known as the Old World family of fruit and nectar feeding bats (Family Pteropodidae, Suborder Megachiroptera). This review of the bat borne henipaviruses discusses the epidemiology, pathology, transmission and disease symptoms in these closely related viruses which belong to the Genus Henipavirus, Family Paramyxoviridae.","Halpin, Kim; Rota, Paul",Zoonoses - Infections Affecting Humans and Animals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120151/,77

Antimicrobial therapy plays an essential role in combating invasive infections in the intensive care population that are often the ultimate causes of death. However, a parallel evolution of antimicrobial compensation has occurred, engendering resistance and virulence mechanisms to circumvent each new antimicrobial agent. The surgical intensive care unit provides the ultimate microcosm of antimicrobial resistance selection, combining complex and severe underlying illness with invasive devices, bypassed defenses, compromised tissues, and proximity to other high-risk patients, all in one intimate environment. New resistance mechanisms may be introduced from referring institutions or can emerge in response to treatments, and then may spread to others within or outside the ICU. Multidrug-resistant organisms have become a dominant issue in modern health care; a strategic response is essential to short- and long-term success.","Duncan, Robert A.",Surgical Intensive Care Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120634/,77

In developed countries, about 4% of older adults have been diagnosed with asthma and another 4% have been diagnosed with COPD, but the prevalence is doubled for each of these chronic respiratory diseases when objective tests are performed. COPD has become the fourth leading cause of death in some developed countries. COPD onset occurs almost exclusively in older age due to the cumulative effects of cigarette smoking in genetically-susceptible individuals. An upper respiratory viral infection commonly leads to the initial diagnosis of asthma at any age. About half of older adults with asthma have allergic triggers, compared to about 90% of asthmatic children. Exacerbations with dyspnea, wheezing and cough are the major morbidity of asthma and COPD, which limits activity, reduces quality of life and increases health care utilization and costs. In older adults as in younger adults, the most effective prevention for both asthma and COPD is smoking cessation.","Enright, Paul; Fragoso, Carlos A.

25633,Platelets and Inflammation,2005,"Despite the devastating pandemic of HIV/AIDS that erupted in the early 1980s, despite the failure to eradicate polio and the emergence of resistant forms of tuberculosis that came into focus in the 1990s, and despite newly emerging diseases like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the fearsome prospect of human-to-human avian flu, it is nevertheless a time of some excitement over prospects for effective control of much of infectious disease. Funded by national and international governmental and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), private foundations, and even popular entertainers, large-scale new efforts are under way to address global killers like AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, among others. This “marvelous momentum” can be seen as part of a continuing effort from the time of Jenner onward. Extrapolating from this, we explore the notion of a “comprehensive global effort for the eradication, elimination or control of infectious disease,” with particular attention to the ethical issues that arise. This is to “think big” about disease-control efforts that are now often done in piecemeal ways. This chapter identifies five tracks along which such efforts need to be pursued: (1) national and international organizations and the development of collective will; (2) epidemiological and health care infrastructure; (3) scientific development; (4) religious, social, and cultural considerations; (5) legal and social protections for individuals and groups. Each of these poses significant ethical issues which, we argue, should be viewed in a comprehensive way, to ensure that practice, research, and policy in each of these areas understands the person with communicable infectious disease as both victim and (potential) vector.","Battin, Margaret P.; Smith, Charles B.; Francis, Leslie P.; Jacobson, Jay A.",International Public Health Policy and Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122291/,77
25893,Demyelination,2007,"With the frequent outbreak of major infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, SARS, and H1N1, it is increasingly important for countries to have the capability to safeguard the health of their citizens and manage public health crises. The key to success lies in the availability and accessibility of essential medicines. Pushed by developing countries and international nongovernmental organizations, the conflicts regarding public access to essential medicines and protection of patented drugs have gained global attention. This chapter briefly introduces the history of the global response to the above challenges, beginning with the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement through the adoption of the Doha declaration and the protocol amending the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) agreement on TRIPS. Then, it discusses the practice of compulsory licenses in both developing and developed countries and describes the huge market demand for generic drugs against infectious disease in developing countries. Finally, the chapter describes the capacity of generic drug production in major developing countries, such as India and China, as well as the roles of these countries in providing generic drugs to patients at home and to other developing countries. History has repeated itself many times due to a continued lack of essential medicines; the initial epidemic of infectious disease in developing countries has become pandemic, spreading throughout the globe. Therefore, any efforts taken by developing countries to increase access to essential medicines against infectious disease are beneficial to people in both developing and developed countries. The developing countries with the capacity and experience to develop generic drugs for public use should learn from each other and collaborate in the research, production, and distribution of generic drugs under the rights granted by the WTO agreement. Developed countries and big pharmaceutical companies should be allies rather than opponents for the ultimate goal of health promotion for all of mankind.","Shao, Yiming",HIV/AIDS Treatment in Resource Poor Countries,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122610/,77

A respiratory transmitted disease caused by a virus, SARS is highly infectious and is rapidly transmitted, inflicting severe complications and a high case fatality rate. The first round of the SARS pandemic led to global panic and billions of dollars economic losses, for due to lack of effective SARS drugs, governments throughout the world had to take rigid steps toward prevention and treatment of the disease. The SARS epidemic began with the first reported case in Guangzhou, China (Wang et al., 2004), on 16 November 2002. Eight months later, the disease had spread to 26 countries in Asia, America, and Europe, resulting in a reported 8,096 cases and 774 deaths (WHO, 2004).

Newer molecular detection assays have allowed for the characterization of several respiratory viruses not previously recognized as having significant clinical impact in the immunocompromised population. Human rhinoviruses are the most common respiratory viruses detected in the upper respiratory tract of hematopoietic cell transplant and lung transplant recipients, and evidence on the impact on clinical outcomes is mounting. Other respiratory viruses including enteroviruses (EVs), coronaviruses (CoVs), and bocavirus may also contribute to pulmonary disease; however, data is limited in the immunocompromised population. Further studies are needed to define the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of these infections; this data will help inform decisions regarding development of antiviral therapy and infection prevention strategies.","Waghmare, Alpana; Boeckh, Michael",Transplant Infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123292/,77

Zoonoses are diseases naturally transmitted between animals and man and comprise in total about 80% of all described human infections. Attempts have been made to define different classes of zoonoses according to the man-animal relationship but generally this does not seem to have been accepted. Elton in 1927 stressed the field of wild animal pathology was still virtually untouched, and in 1968 McDiarmid reiterated the view that it remained one of the most neglected aspects of animal ecology. There is now an extensive literature but it is rarely incorporated into ecological texts although disease is often the driving force in population dynamics. The primary driver of infectious disease dynamics is transmission between individuals, yet in most important respects remarkably little is known about the subject (Craft et al. 2008, Haydon 2008). Occasionally, under high population densities, an organism may infect a host outside of its normal range with highly pathogenic effect in its adventitious host.","Spinage, Clive A.",African Ecology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123612/,77

Curriculum learning has recently been shown to improve neural models’ effectiveness by sampling batches non-uniformly, going from easy to difficult instances during training. In the context of neural Information Retrieval (IR) curriculum learning has not been explored yet, and so it remains unclear (1) how to measure the difficulty of training instances and (2) how to transition from easy to difficult instances during training. To address both challenges and determine whether curriculum learning is beneficial for neural ranking models, we need large-scale datasets and a retrieval task that allows us to conduct a wide range of experiments. For this purpose, we resort to the task of conversation response ranking: ranking responses given the conversation history. In order to deal with challenge (1), we explore scoring functions to measure the difficulty of conversations based on different input spaces. To address challenge (2) we evaluate different pacing functions, which determine the velocity in which we go from easy to difficult instances. We find that, overall, by just intelligently sorting the training data (i.e., by performing curriculum learning) we can improve the retrieval effectiveness by up to 2% (The source code is available at https://github.com/Guzpenha/transformers_cl.).","Penha, Gustavo; Hauff, Claudia",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148246/,77

The test results indicate that the combination of five green charcoal filaments and a mesh structure provides the elastic knits with the maximum functions and comfort, due to a high content of functional fibers per unit area. The optimal FIR emissivity reaches 0.89, maximum anion amount is 673±21.4, and the highest permeability is 63.9±2.6 cm(3)/cm(2)/s. As a result, the proposed elastic knits have an adjustable fabric structure that is feasible to meet any requirements and thus has a broad application range.","Pan, Yi-Jun; Hsieh, Chien-Teng; Lou, Ching-Wen; Wang, Chi-Chung; Lin, Zheng-Ian; Chen, Yueh-Sheng; Lin, Jia-Horng",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149054/,77

In imbalanced datasets, kNN becomes biased towards the majority instances of the training space. To solve this problem, we propose a method called Proximity weighted Evidential kNN classifier. In this method, each neighbor of a query instance is considered as a piece of evidence from which we calculate the probability of class label given feature values to provide more preference to the minority instances. This is then discounted by the proximity of the neighbor to prioritize the closer instances in the local neighborhood. These evidences are then combined using Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. A rigorous experiment over 30 benchmark imbalanced datasets shows that our method performs better compared to 12 popular methods. In pairwise comparison of these 12 methods with our method, in the best case, our method wins in 29 datasets, and in the worst case it wins in least 19 datasets. More importantly, according to Friedman test the proposed method ranks higher than all other methods in terms of AUC at 5% level of significance.","Kadir, Md.

In this model motivated by Crowdsourcing applications, Groz and Milo [18] show three bounds on the query complexity for the skyline problem. We improve significantly on that state of the art and provide two output-sensitive algorithms computing the skyline with respective query complexity [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], where k is the size of the skyline and [Formula: see text] the expected probability that our algorithm fails to return the correct answer.

35449,Chest Imaging,2020-06-22,"BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a severe subtype of hemorrhagic stroke, and deep-vein thrombosis is a frequent complication detected in these patients. In addition to other well-established risk factors, the early activation of coagulation systems present in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage could potentially play a role in the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis. This study aims to identify possible predictors for deep-vein thrombosis related to subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage who presented to our institution between 1 January 2014 and 1 August 2018. We reviewed electronic medical records and analyzed several parameters such as Fisher scale, World Federation of Neurosurgical Surgeons scale, aneurysm site, surgical or endovascular treatment, decompressive craniectomy, vasospasm, infection (meningitis and pneumonia), presence of motor deficit, length of stay in the ICU, length of hospital stay, number of days under ventilator support, d-dimer at hospitalization, and the time to thromboprophylaxis (days). RESULTS: The univariate analysis showed that intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage, d-dimer at hospitalization, the time to thromboprophylaxis, motor deficit, and aneurysm located at the internal carotid artery were statistically significant factors. Intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage (OR 2,78 95%CI 1.07–7.12), motor deficit (OR 3.46; 95%CI 1.37–9.31), and d-dimer at hospitalization (OR 1.002 95% CI 1.001–1.003) were demonstrated as independent risk factors for deep-vein thrombosis. Length of hospital stay was also found to be significantly longer in patients who developed deep-vein thrombosis (p value 0.018). CONCLUSION: Elevated d-dimer level at the time of hospitalization, motor deficit, and the presence of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage are independent risk factors for deep-vein thrombosis. Patients with DVT also had a significantly longer hospital stay. Even though further studies are needed, patients with elevated d-dimer at hospitalization and intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage may benefit from a more aggressive screening strategy for deep-vein thrombosis.","Geraldini, Federico; De Cassai, Alessandro; Correale, Christelle; Andreatta, Giulio; Grandis, Marzia; Navalesi, Paolo; Munari, Marina",Acta Neurochir (Wien),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7311113/,77

OBJECTIVES: Describing the respiratory complications and their predictive factors in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injuries at C5–T5 level during the initial hospitalization. SETTING: Hospital Vall d’Hebron, Barcelona. METHODS: Data from patients admitted in a reference unit with acute traumatic injuries involving levels C5–T5. Respiratory complications were defined as: acute respiratory failure, respiratory infection, atelectasis, non-hemothorax pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism or haemoptysis. Candidate predictors of these complications were demographic data, comorbidity, smoking, history of respiratory disease, the spinal cord injury characteristics (level and ASIA Impairment Scale) and thoracic trauma. A logistic regression model was created to determine associations between potential predictors and respiratory complications. RESULTS: We studied 174 patients with an age of 47.9 (19.7) years, mostly men (87%), with low comorbidity. Coexistent thoracic trauma was found in 24 (19%) patients with cervical and 35 (75%) with thoracic injuries (p < 0.001). Respiratory complications were frequent (53%) and were associated to longer hospital stay: 83.1 (61.3) and 45.3 (28.1) days in patients with and without respiratory complications (p < 0.001). The strongest predictors of respiratory complications were: previous respiratory disease (OR 5.4, 95% CI: 1.5–19.2), complete motor function impairment (AIS A–B) (OR 4.7, 95% CI: 2.4–9.5) and concurrent chest trauma (OR 3.73, 95% CI: 1.8–7.9). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory complications are common in traumatic spinal cord injuries between C5–T5. We identified previous respiratory disease, complete motor function impairment and the coexistence of thoracic trauma as predictors of respiratory complications. Identification of patients at risk might help clinicians to implement preventive strategies.","Sampol, Júlia; González-Viejo, Miguel Ángel; Gómez, Alba; Martí, Sergi; Pallero, Mercedes; Rodríguez, Esther; Launois, Patricia; Sampol, Gabriel; Ferrer, Jaume",Spinal Cord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7312109/,77

If the costs of false quarantine and false release exceed the cost of testing, the optimal myopic testing policy targets individuals with an intermediate likelihood of being infected. A high cost of false release means that testing is optimal for individuals with a low probability of infection, and a high cost of false quarantine means that testing is optimal for individuals with a high probability of infection. If individuals arrive over time, the policy-maker faces a dynamic trade-off: using tests for individuals for whom testing yields the maximum immediate benefit vs spreading out testing capacity across the population to learn prevalence rates thereby benefiting later individuals. We describe a simple policy that is nearly optimal from a dynamic perspective. We briefly discuss practical aspects of implementing our proposed policy, including imperfect testing technology, appropriate choice of prior, and non-stationarity of the prevalence rate.","Kasy, Maximilian; Teytelboym, Alexander",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313803/,77

It is however very difficult to identify non-compliance through survey research because claiming to follow the rules is socially desirable. Using three survey experiments, we examine the efficacy of different ‘face-saving’ questions that aim to reduce social desirability in the measurement of compliance with public health measures. Our treatments soften the social norm of compliance by way of a short preamble in combination with a guilty-free answer choice making it easier for respondents to admit non-compliance. We find that self-reported non-compliance increases by up to +11 percentage points when making use of a face-saving question. Considering the current context and the importance of measuring non-compliance, we argue that researchers around the world should adopt our most efficient face-saving question.","Daoust, Jean-François; Nadeau, Richard; Dassonneville, Ruth; Lachapelle, Erick; Bélanger, Éric; Savoie, Justin; van der Linden, Clifton",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7438621/,77

40943,Spanish influenza score: poder predictivo sin renunciar a lo clásico,2020-10-17,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The majority of patient care occurs in the ambulatory setting, and pediatric patients are at high risk of medical error and harm. Prior studies have described various safety threats in ambulatory pediatrics, and little is known about effective strategies to minimize error. The purpose of this review is to identify best practices for optimizing safety in ambulatory pediatrics. RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of the patient safety literature in ambulatory pediatrics describes frequencies and types of medical errors. Study of effective interventions to reduce error, and particularly to reduce harm, have been limited. There is evidence that medical complexity and social context are important modifiers of risk. Telemedicine has emerged as a care delivery model with potential to ameliorate and exacerbate safety threats. Though there is variation across studies, developing a safety culture, partnerships with patients and families, and use of structured communication are strategies that support patient safety. SUMMARY: There is no standardized taxonomy for errors in ambulatory pediatrics, but errors related to medications, vaccines, diagnosis, and care coordination and care transitions are commonly described. Evidence-based approaches to optimize safety include standardized prescribing and medication reconciliation practices, appropriate use of decision support tools in the electronic health record, and communication strategies like teach-back. Further high-quality intervention studies in pediatric ambulatory care that assess impact on patient harm and clinical outcomes should be prioritized.","Huth, Kathleen; Hotz, Arda; Starmer, Amy J.",Curr Treat Options Peds,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7553853/,77

Although the fact that it took place in the context of the broader Coronavirus crisis meant that it received relatively little publicity or attention, the central argument of this article is that the lecture provides great insight into the ideas shaping government policy, in general, and into the inner mind of Dominic Cummings, in particular. As such, we argue that although the lecture was given by Michael Gove, it was clearly floating ideas and themes that were taken, almost directly, from Dominic Cummings’ website. We draw out and explore these themes and suggest that what they combine to offer is a dangerous blend of technocratic populism that is as intellectually splintered as it is politically naïve.","Blunkett, David; Flinders, Matthew",Br Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7568759/,77

OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and evaluate the characteristics of newly injured patients admitted to two spinal cord injury (SCI) centers during a 4-year period. SETTING: Oulu and Tampere University Hospital, Finland. METHODS: A dedicated multidisciplinary team evaluated all of the patients with new traumatic SCI (TSCI). The data were recorded according to the International Spinal Cord Injury Core Data Sets. RESULTS: In a 4-year period, 346 new patients with TSCI were admitted to the study centers. In the Oulu and Tampere University Hospitals’ catchment areas, the mean annual incidence of TSCI was 36.6 per million. The leading causes of injury were low-level falls (36.2%), high-level falls (25.5%), and transport-related accidents (19.2%). In the patients >60 years, 72.6% were injured by falling and the proportion of low-level falls was 49.7%. In the patients ≤60 years old, 47.4% were alcohol-related. The proportion of cervical injuries in the patients >60 years was 77.1%, while in the patients ≤60 years the proportion was 59.6%. The incidence of TSCI was higher during the Summer and Autumn months. CONCLUSION: The mean annual incidence of TSCI was 36.6 per million corresponding to 200 new annual cases in Finland. Incomplete tetraplegia due to falling among elderly was overrepresented in the study population. Alcohol-consumption preceded injury in nearly half of the cases in the younger population. The prevention should focus on alcohol-related injuries and falls in the elderly.","Johansson, Elina; Luoto, Teemu M.; Vainionpää, Aki; Kauppila, Anna-Maija; Kallinen, Mauri; Väärälä, Eija; Koskinen, Eerika",Spinal Cord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7610166/,77
41964,Acknowledgement to referees,2020-11-12,"Owing to low-temperature deposition conditions and high deposition rate, cold spray offers unique advantages in manufacturing a wide variety of metallic and composite coatings including metal matrix composites produced from physically blended powders. One of the challenges of producing composite coatings using cold spray is the deviation of coatings composition from the blended feedstock powder composition. This is of utmost importance as it affects the composition and phase evolution of intermetallic forming coatings during post spray heat treatment. In this work, cold spray of composite Ni-Ti coatings and formation of intermetallics from post spray heat treatment were investigated as a first step to examine the potential of producing equiatomic bulk Ni-Ti by cold spray. Three different physically blended Ni and Ti powders mixtures were sprayed on titanium substrates to address the coating composition variation from the blended feedstock powder and study its influence on phase evolution during post spray heat treatment. High-density and well-dispersed composite coatings were achieved for each case. EDS analysis revealed as-sprayed coatings with 10.5, 35.9 and 56.9 at.% Ni (and with balanced Ti ratios) from the three powder mixtures. Annealing treatments were conducted at 400, 500 and 900 °C for 1 and 2 h and comparative studies of the intermetallic compound formations were carried out. Microstructural investigation showed that all three equilibrium intermetallics phases of binary Ni-Ti phase diagram (Ni(3)Ti, Ti(2)Ni and NiTi) formed in the two Ni-rich composite coatings with NiTi phase being maximum in the coating with the closest composition to equiatomic ratio while only Ti(2)Ni phase formed in the Ti-rich coating after annealing. Thermal etching analysis of coatings showed that NiTi phase forms with a gradient microstructure from Ti splats boundary toward the center of splats, which is attributed to the grain refinement of CS samples at splat boundary and intermetallic nucleation mechanism.","Nikbakht, R.; Assadi, H.; Jodoin, B.",J Therm Spray Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649038/,77

42444,Infection Prevention Control (IPC) and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR),2020-11-24,"AIM: Traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine has been used to treat viral infectious diseases. In particular, saikatsugekito (a combination drug of kakkonto, shosaikoto, Platicodon glandiflorum root, and gypsum) has been reported to be useful during the past influenza pandemic. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has spread worldwide, causing the novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) to emerge as a pandemic. In this article, we conducted a literature review on the pharmacological activities of the components present in saikatsugekito against viral infection and respiratory inflammation. METHODS: We searched PubMed and the Cochrane Library for English articles, as well as Ichushi and J‐stage for Japanese articles. Articles published until January 1, 2000 were retrieved using the keywords ‘kakkonto’, ‘shosaikoto’, ‘Platycodon’, and ‘gypsum’. We then extracted articles on basic research investigating viral infections, inflammation, cytokine, the immune response, and lung tissue damage. RESULTS: We extracted 28 eligible articles. Kampo medicines have antiviral activities by interfering with the attachment, internalization, replication, progeny virion release, and cell‐to‐cell spreading of single‐strand RNA viruses. They also enhance the immunomodulating activities of the host, including cytokine production, regulation of multiple immune cells, and protection from lung tissue injury. Furthermore, Kampo medicine has been found to regulate body temperature and airway mucin release. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that Kampo medicine has therapeutic activities against single‐strand RNA virus infections and respiratory inflammation, and may also have activities against SARS‐CoV‐2. Further research is required to investigate the activity of Kampo medicines, such as saikatsugekito, against SARS‐CoV‐2.","Arita, Ryutaro; Ono, Rie; Saito, Natsumi; Takayama, Shin; Namiki, Takao; Ito, Takashi; Ishii, Tadashi",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7675610/,77

We conducted telephone interviews with four groups from two LTC facilities and two hospitals: twelve older residents (Four suspected cases and two infected), ten family members, four direct frontline workers (two infected), two nursing home managers, and four health care professionals working in the two hospitals that infected older residents were transferred to. We found that the gap in the transition of care quality between LTC facilities and local hospitals was widened during the COVID-19 outbreak. LTC facilities were slow to take precautionary measures and underprepared to handle the crisis after the infections occurred. The wellbeing of older residents was significantly impacted during the transition, particularly for those with dementia. Health care professionals in local hospitals were under tremendous stress providing treatments for older residents while ensuring their safety. There is an urgent need to improve transitional care and the capacity in preventing and handling this type of crisis for older residents in LTC.","Cai, Yi; Wang, Jing; Wu, Bei",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740844/,77
43818,Authors’ Reply,2021-01-05,"The news is old – neoliberalism is dead for good, but this time, even Financial Times knows it. Obituaries claim that it had died from the coronavirus, as the state, not the markets, have had to save both the people and the economy. The argument of the article is that these academic and media interpretations of ‘emergency Keynesianism’ misidentify neoliberalism with its anti-statist rhetoric. For neoliberalism is, and has always been, about ‘the free market and the strong state’. In fact, rather than waning in the face of the coronavirus crisis, neoliberal states around the world are using the ongoing ‘war against the virus’ to strengthen their right-hand grip on the conditions of the working classes.","Šumonja, Miloš",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7770495/,77
44275,Pediatric Neurology Briefs: Year in Review,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in nearly 8 million cases and close to 500,000 deaths globally. Little is known about risk factors for favorable or adverse outcomes from COVID-19 among people living with HIV (PWH). Small case series have described outcomes for hospitalized PWH with COVID19. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of PWH with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 from 2 HIV ambulatory clinics from March 1 to May 31, 2020 in a large urban academic center that serves a substantial proportion of underserved minorities. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were abstracted using a standardized data collection tool. Bivariate analysis was performed to identify correlates of hospitalization. RESULTS: Among the clinic cohort of 1469 PWH, 94 (6.4%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 40 (42.5%) were positive. Fifty-percent were women, 65% were 50 years and older, 65% were black, 65% were former or active smokers, and 40% were active alcohol or substance users. The majority (90%) were on ART and 87.5% had HIV viral suppression (< 50 copies/ml). Among comorbidities, 50% had hypertension, 42.5% chronic lung disease, 42.5% cardiovascular disease (CVD), 40% obesity, 27.5% diabetes (DM), and 20% chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hospitalization occurred in 19 patients (47.5%) and of those, 4 (21%) required escalation of care. The median length of stay was 12 days (IQR5.5–15.5) and there was no inpatient mortality. Among the 12 PWH who had HIV viral load test during hospitalization, 11 (91.7%) maintained viral suppression and none of the 19 patients had ART interruption. Those who were hospitalized were more likely to be >50 years old (p=0.02); have CVD (p=0.003), DM (p=0.01), and CKD (p=0.02); or have multiple comorbidities (p=0.007) compared to those managed as outpatients. Furthermore, incremental numbers of comorbidities were associated with hospitalization (p=0.009). A history of AIDS, black race, obesity, smoking, and substance use disorders were not associated with hospitalization or adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: In this initial and to our knowledge largest cohort in an urban academic center, PWH with COVID-19 had favorable short-term outcomes. The risk factors associated with hospitalization were older age and multiple non-HIV related comorbidities.

44902,Emerging Nanomedicines for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis,2021-01-24,"Vaccinations are among the most successful prophylactic measures in medicine. As they are applied to healthy subjects, regulatory steps before licensing of any vaccination are strictly based on clinically controlled studies as well as on registry data in the further course. The probability and relevance of adverse reactions to vaccinations have to be weighed against any harm through the respective natural infection as well as the vaccination-induced protection against infections. Intolerance reactions to vaccinations are far more suspected than proven and altogether rare. Among these, specific dermatoses like psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and lichen planus are found as well as allergic reactions and a number of more nonspecific skin symptoms. Apart from provocation or exacerbation of an underlying dermatological disease, various intolerance reactions may be encountered which are classically allergologic or anaphylactoid. People with chronic dermatoses, especially those on immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapy, should have all recommended standard vaccinations. Vaccinations should not be administered during acute skin manifestations and relevant comedication—especially if immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive—has be taken into account in the decision to vaccinate and to define the time point of any vaccination. Inactivated vaccines may be administered even during ongoing immunosuppressive therapy, but may result in decreased immunological reactions and protection to infection. Live vaccines should be avoided.","Sticherling, M.",Hautarzt,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7818057/,77

Clinical features include fever, cough, dyspnea, body aches, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Some COVID-19-positive patients presented with unusual manifestations such as olfactory dysfunction, parotitis, or cervical lymphadenopathy. MAIN BODY: Since many patients are diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, the need for an up to date review of the atypical ENT presentations of COVID-19 is mandatory. Articles from PubMed and Google searches were reviewed and the atypical presentations in otolaryngology were presented. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial for ENT physicians to have high index of suspicion to identify those COVID 19 patients with atypical presentations.

This shortage of qualified personnel not only results in constraints in the provision of patient care but also has a negative impact on the health of available personnel, as these are by default expected to fill the gap. The situation is aggravated by demands and expectations of the younger generation of employees, who are particularly concerned with key topics, such as leadership, working hours and work-life balance. This transformation will inevitably necessitate both chief surgeons and hospital management to re-evaluate and adapt their strategies in order to retain full operability and high quality of medical care of clinics in the future. The objective of this article is to provide a personal assessment of the current and future situation in surgical clinics in Germany with a focus on human resources and leadership.","Grade, Marian; Ghadimi, Michael",Chirurg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7832412/,77
45662,Aufbruch zu einem allergologischen Klimawandel,2021-02-12,"The extensively utilized tool to detect novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RT-PCR kits are costly and consume critical time, around 6 to 9 hours to classify the subjects as COVID-19(+) or COVID-19(-). Due to the less sensitivity of RT-PCR, it suffers from high false-negative results. To overcome these issues, many deep learning models have been implemented in the literature for the early-stage classification of suspected subjects. To handle the sensitivity issue associated with RT-PCR, chest CT scans are utilized to classify the suspected subjects as COVID-19 (+), tuberculosis, pneumonia, or healthy subjects. The extensive study on chest CT scans of COVID-19 (+) subjects reveals that there are some bilateral changes and unique patterns. But the manual analysis from chest CT scans is a tedious task. Therefore, an automated COVID-19 screening model is implemented by ensembling the deep transfer learning models such as Densely connected convolutional networks (DCCNs), ResNet152V2, and VGG16. Experimental results reveal that the proposed ensemble model outperforms the competitive models in terms of accuracy, f-measure, area under curve, sensitivity, and specificity.","Singh, Dilbag; Kumar, Vijay; Kaur, Manjit",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7867501/,77

49198,Miscellaneous Areas of Personalized Medicine,2020-12-06,"Wildlife plays an important and complex role in the emergence of new diseases and the maintenance of endemic infectious diseases. The majority of the recent emerging diseases were caused by zoonotic viruses of wildlife origin and had significant impacts on public health and economies. Wildlife can act as a reservoir or maintenance or spill-over or amplifier hosts or simply a liaison host of diseases transmissible to human beings and farmed livestock. Anthropogenic factors like agricultural expansion, habitat destruction, urbanisation, trade of exotic or domestic animals and global travel comprise major drivers of the emergence of zoonotic disease. The viral families Arenaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Filoviridae, Hepeviridae, Hantaviridae, Herpesviridae, Nairoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Peribunyaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Phenuiviridae, Poxviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Togaviridae enclose viruses which represent most of the viral zoonoses of wildlife origin. The basic factors influencing the disease emergence from wildlife species are also the major drivers of biodiversity loss. Therefore, emerging zoonotic viruses are not only potential threats to human beings but can also be harmful to wildlife species. Thus, there is a convincing and effective chance for mutual gains for the conservation of wildlife and public health by collective and collaborative attempts.","Milton, Arockiasamy Arun Prince; Priya, Govindarajan Bhuvana; Ghatak, Sandeep; Das, Samir",Animal-Origin Viral Zoonoses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979103/,77
49599,Conclusion,2020-09-25,"Social media platforms are used for both entertainment and information sharing purposes across diverse populations in the world. Though content in all possible formats is shared in these platforms, there is a differential preference among the users. Despite the phenomenal growth and adherence to the regulations, TikTok, a video sharing platform, is dissuaded by a few governments and is discontinued by the users. But this platform seems to be preferred by people who are from semi-urban and are digital have-less. The present paper attempts to understand the non-use of TikTok in India. This paper has explored the negative perceptions resulting in the nonusage of social media among individuals by taking the case study of the application TikTok. For that, a qualitative approach was used, and twenty in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted from various regions in India through online and offline mode. The data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. A framework is provided to understand why people may not use social media platforms. Suggestions are also given as to how social media platforms can be altered or redesigned to appeal to a broader set of people. Numerous reasons were identified that resulted in negative perceptions about the platform. The findings indicate that individuals seem to dislike TikTok mostly because it leads to a waste of time, does not contribute to knowledge, and includes unrealistic and unethical content. People appeared to be concerned about the social stigma attached to it. Specific measures are suggested, for instance, filtering out content, culture-specific user interface, statutory warnings, safety, and encryption to address the negative perceptions and to improve the authenticity of the platform.","Chakraborty, Imon; Kapoor, Unnati; Ilavarasan, P.

Most of the proposed solutions, however, make use of a broadcast channel in every round, and it is unclear if the broadcast channel can be replaced by standard point-to-point communication in a round-preserving manner, and if so, at what cost on the resulting security. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the trade-off between number of broadcast rounds and achievable security level for two-round MPC tolerating arbitrarily many active corruptions. Specifically, we consider all possible combinations of broadcast and point-to-point rounds against the three standard levels of security for maliciously secure MPC protocols, namely, security with identifiable, unanimous, and selective abort. For each of these notions and each combination of broadcast and point-to-point rounds, we provide either a tight feasibility or an infeasibility result of two-round MPC. Our feasibility results hold assuming two-round OT in the CRS model, whereas our impossibility results hold given any correlated randomness.","Cohen, Ran; Garay, Juan; Zikas, Vassilis",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991685/,77

My review here describes the history and heterogeneity of the EPR effect, which involves defective tumor blood vessels and blood flow. We reported that restoring obstructed tumor blood flow overcomes impaired drug delivery, leading to improved EPR effects. I also discuss gaps between small animal cancers used in experimental models and large clinical cancers in humans, which usually involve heterogeneous EPR effects, vascular abnormalities in multiple necrotic foci, and tumor emboli. Here, I emphasize arterial infusion of oily formulations of nanodrugs into tumor-feeding arteries, which is the most tumor-selective drug delivery method, with tumor/blood ratios of 100-fold. This method is literally the most personalized medicine because arterial infusions differ for each patient, and drug doses infused depend on tumor size and anatomy in each patient. Future developments in EPR effect-based treatment will range from chemotherapy to photodynamic therapy, boron neutron capture therapy, and therapies for free radical diseases.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may represent a vulnerable population due to the frequent administration of immune-modifying treatments. METHODS: We aimed to depict the natural history of COVID-19 infection in Greek patients with IBD at a nationwide level via the unbiased reporting of all cases that were registered during the first and second waves of the pandemic. Following a national call from the Hellenic Society for the study of IBD, we enrolled all IBD patients with established diagnosis of COVID-19. Clinical and epidemiological data, including COVID-19 modifying factors and IBD-associated therapies were analysed against adverse outcomes (hospitalization, ICU admission, and death). RESULTS: We identified 80 patients with IBD who were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period (male:65%; median age=44 [IQR=26] years; CD:62.5%). Adverse outcomes were reported in 16 patients (20%), including 3 ICU admissions (3.75%) and 2 deaths (2.5%). Negative prognostic factors for adverse outcomes included age, Body Mass Index, and hypertension, as well as dyspnoea, fatigue and abdominal pain at presentation. In contrast, treatment with biologics, in particular anti-TNF agents, exerted a protective effect against an unfavorable course COVID-19. Patients on subcutaneous biologics were more likely to halt treatment due to the infection as compared to those on intravenous medications. CONCLUSION: Patients with IBD who developed COVID-19 had a benign course with adverse outcomes being scarce. Treatment with biologics had a beneficial effect, supporting the continuation of therapy during the pandemic.","Bamias, G; Kokkotis, G; Christodoulou, D; Delis, V; Gatopoulou, A; Giouleme, O; Kalantzis, C; Kapsoritakis, A; Karatzas, P; Karmiris, K; Katsanos, K; Kevrekidou, P; Mathou, N; Michalopoulos, G; Michopoulos, S; Papaconstantinou, I; Polymeros, D; Potamianos, S; Poulopoulos, G; Protopappas, A; Soufleris, K; Theodoropoulou, A; Triantafillidis, J K; Triantafyllou, K; Tsiolakidou, G; Tsironi, E; Tzouvala, M; Viazis, N; Zacharopoulou, E; Zampeli, E; Papatheodoridis, G; Mantzaris, G J",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194599/,77

This study aimed at evaluating antiepileptic drug entry into developing brain. Methods: Anaesthetised pregnant, non-pregnant adult females, postnatal and fetal rats were injected intraperitoneally with different doses, single or in combinations, of valproate and lamotrigine, all within clinical range. Injectate included (3)H-labelled drug. After 30min, CSF, blood and brain samples were obtained; radioactivity was measured using liquid scintillation counting. Some animals were also exposed to valproate in feed throughout pregnancy and into neonatal period. Drug levels were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results are given as CSF or tissue/plasma% as index of drug entry. Results: Entry of valproate into brain and CSF was higher at E19 and P4 compared to adult but was not dose-dependent; placental transfer increased significantly at highest dose of 100mg/Kg. Lamotrigine entry into the brain was dose dependent only at E19. Chronic valproate treatment, or combination of valproate and lamotrigine had little effect on either drug entry, except for reduced valproate brain entry in adult brain with chronic treatment. Placental transfer decreased significantly after chronic valproate treatment. LC-MS measurement of valproate in adults confirmed that rat plasma values were within the clinical range and CSF/plasma and brain/plasma ratios for LC-MS and (3)H-valproate were similar. Conclusion: Results suggest that entry of valproate may be higher in developing brain, the capacity of barrier mechanism is mostly unaffected by doses within the clinical range, with or without addition of lamotrigine. Chronic valproate exposure may result in upregulation in cellular mechanisms restricting its entry into the brain. Entry of lamotrigine was little different at different ages and was not dose dependent.","Toll, Samuel J.; Qiu, Fiona; Huang, Yifan; Habgood, Mark D.; Dziegielewska, Katarzyna M.; Nie, Shuai; Saunders, Norman R.",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8207807/,77

This scientific article analyzes the level of a possible safe withdrawal rate for diversified pension portfolios, considering historical returns and inflation rates. Consequently, this article provides immediate practical added value for a possible retirement provision. The evaluation is based on the consideration of historical returns of the stock and bond market in Germany. To determine a safe withdrawal rate, the development of portfolios with different compositions and inflation-adjusted withdrawal rates are simulated over periods of 15 to 35 years. In this simulation, the risky part of the portfolio is represented by German equities, the low risk part by German government bonds. To sum up, the empirical results show a maximum safe withdrawal rate of 4%. The underlying portfolio is composed of 50% equities and 50% government bonds. Particularly due to the outlined demographic change in Germany as well as the ongoing low-interest phase, the empirical study can provide significant theoretical and practical insights.

Construal level theory was used within the Touchpoint, Context, Qualities (TCQ) Framework (De Keyser et al., 2020) to integrate a comprehensive model of how touchpoints—websites or stores—influence the magnitude of customer responses to qualities of service encounters. A hierarchical linear model (HLM) was estimated using survey data describing the service encounters of 2.4 million customers with a global retailer. Online customers weighed cognitive and behavioral qualities more heavily than in-store customers, whereas they weighed emotional and sensorial qualities less heavily. Moreover, random effects in the HLM model indicated that each country and store would have unique clientele effects for specific qualities. Since each firm has limited resources, this research offers guidance on key qualities in designing satisfying service encounters for each touchpoint and how qualities should be standardized and customized in global omnichannel environments.

59513,New applications of a portable isolation hood for use in several settings and as a clean hood.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) is a phenomenon related to physiological conditions (e.g. exercise, stress) and to pathophysiological events (e.g. acute mesenteric ischemia, aortic surgery). Although intestinal IR has been studied extensively in animals, results remain inconclusive and data on human intestinal IR are scarce. Therefore, an experimental harmless model for human intestinal IR was developed, enabling us to clarify the sequelae of human intestinal IR for the first time. METHODS AND FINDINGS In 30 patients undergoing pancreatico-duodenectomy we took advantage of the fact that in this procedure a variable length of jejunum is removed. Isolated jejunum (5 cm) was subjected to 30 minutes ischemia followed by reperfusion. Intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein (I-FABP) arteriovenous concentration differences across the bowel segment were measured before and after ischemia to assess epithelial cell damage. Tissue sections were collected after ischemia and at 25, 60 and 120 minutes reperfusion and stained with H&E, and for I-FABP and the apoptosis marker M30. Bonferroni's test was used to compare I-FABP differences. Mean (SEM) arteriovenous concentration gradients of I-FABP across the jejunum revealed rapidly developing epithelial cell damage. I-FABP release significantly increased from 290 (46) pg/ml before ischemia towards 3,997 (554) pg/ml immediately after ischemia (p<0.001) and declined gradually to 1,143 (237) pg/ml within 1 hour reperfusion (p<0.001). Directly after ischemia the intestinal epithelial lining was microscopically normal, while subepithelial spaces appeared at the villus tip. However, after 25 minutes reperfusion, enterocyte M30 immunostaining was observed at the villus tip accompanied by shedding of mature enterocytes into the lumen and loss of I-FABP staining. Interestingly, within 60 minutes reperfusion the epithelial barrier resealed, while debris of apoptotic, shedded epithelial cells was observed in the lumen. At the same time, M30 immunoreactivity was absent in intact epithelial lining. CONCLUSIONS This is the first human study to clarify intestinal IR induced cell damage and repair and its direct consequences. It reveals a unique, endogenous clearing mechanism for injured enterocytes: rapid detachment of damaged apoptotic enterocytes into the lumen. This process is followed by repair of the epithelial continuity within an hour, resulting in a normal epithelial lining.","Derikx, Joep P M; Matthijsen, Robert A; de Bruïne, Adriaan P; van Bijnen, Annemarie A; Heineman, Erik; van Dam, Ronald M; Dejong, Cornelis H C; Buurman, Wim A",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18927609/,77

Subsequently, the University of Miami in Florida established one of the first interprofessional wound care centers located at Bernard Mevs Hospital in the central portion of Port-au-Prince, caring for patients with acute and chronic wounds. In 2012, the authors used a novel epidermal harvesting system (CelluTome Epidermal Harvesting System; Kinetic Concepts Inc, San Antonio, Texas) to harvest epithelium to be grafted on 7 patients at the Mevs Hospital with longstanding wounds. Epidermal microblisters were obtained from each patient's thigh using the CelluTome Epidermal Harvesting System. After 35 minutes, microblisters were raised using the device harvester, and an adhesive dressing was inserted into the harvester for transfer to the wound site. In patients with lower-extremity wounds, a 2-layer compression dressing was placed over epidermal grafts. Six of the 7 wounds improved or achieved complete closure in 4 weeks. One of the patients with a 2-year-old thigh wound failed to demonstrate improvement; this may have been secondary to an inability to adequately secure the graft. All donor sites healed without any visible scarring. The authors were able to conclude that epidermal grafting may represent a viable reconstructive option for patients in resource-poor countries.","Serena, Thomas; Francius, Adler; Taylor, Cristin; MacDonald, John",Advances in skin & wound care,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.asw.0000460839.72826.ce; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25658643/,77
60238,An Illustrated Forensic Pathology Case: Bilateral Putaminal Hemorrhages After Methanol Ingestion.,2021-01-21,"OBJECTIVE Hypoplasia of the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery is frequently observed in patients with anterior communicating artery (ACoA) aneurysms. The effect of this anatomical variant on ACoA aneurysm morphology is not well understood. METHODS Digital subtraction angiography images were reviewed for 204 patients presenting to the authors' institution with either a ruptured or an unruptured ACoA aneurysm. The ratio of the width of the larger A1 segment to the smaller A1 segment was calculated. Patients with an A1 ratio greater than 2 were categorized as having A1 segment hypoplasia. The relationship of A1 segment hypoplasia to both patient and aneurysm characteristics was then assessed. RESULTS Of 204 patients that presented with an ACoA aneurysm, 34 (16.7%) were found to have a hypoplastic A1. Patients with A1 segment hypoplasia were less likely to have a history of smoking (44.1% vs 62.9%, p = 0.0410). ACoA aneurysms occurring in the setting of a hypoplastic A1 were also found to have a larger maximum diameter (mean 7.7 vs 6.0 mm, p = 0.0084). When considered as a continuous variable, increasing A1 ratio was associated with decreasing aneurysm dome-to-neck ratio (p = 0.0289). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of A1 segment hypoplasia between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms (18.9% vs 10.7%; p = 0.1605). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that a hypoplastic A1 may affect the morphology of ACoA aneurysms. In addition, the relative lack of traditional risk factors for aneurysm formation in patients with A1 segment hypoplasia argues for the importance of hemodynamic factors in the formation of ACoA aneurysms in this anatomical setting.","Rinaldo, Lorenzo; McCutcheon, Brandon A; Murphy, Meghan E; Bydon, Mohamad; Rabinstein, Alejandro A; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2016.7.jns16736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27689465/,77

60912,Appendiceal stump closure with polymeric clips is a reliable alternative to endostaplers.,2019,"Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC; also known as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli ) are a significant cause of foodborne illnesses around the world. Due to the serological and genomic diversity of VTEC, methods of detection for VTEC in food samples require detection of verotoxin or its gene vt (also known as stx ). The current taxonomy of vt identifies three vt1 (a,c,d) and seven vt2 (a to g) subtypes. PCR detection of vt is convenient and rapid, but protocols may not detect all currently identified variants or subtypes of vt . The Health Canada Compendium of Analytical Methods for the analysis of food for VTEC is MFLP-52. MFLP-52 includes a VT Screening PCR that is used to determine the presumptive presence of VTEC by the detection of vt in food enrichments, and to differentiate VTEC from other isolates. The VT Screening PCR was developed prior to the establishment of the current vt taxonomy. An evaluation of VT Screening PCR for detection of the ten established vt -subtypes was performed and it was discovered that the method could not detect subtypes vt1d and vt2f . Additional primers and a modified protocol were developed and the modified VT Screening PCR was tested against an inclusivity panel of 50 VTEC strains, including representatives of ten vt -subtypes, and an exclusivity panel of 30 vt negative E. coli from various sources, to ensure specificity. The reliability of MFLP-52 with the modified VT Screening PCR was assessed by analysis of four priority food matrices (ground beef, lettuce, cheese and apple cider) inoculated with a VTEC strain at 2 to 5 CFU per 25 g. The modified VT Screening PCR was determined to be able to detect all ten vt -subtypes and reliably detect the presence of VTEC in all tested food enrichments.","McMahon, Tanis; Bastian, Jillian; Alshawa, Inas; Gill, Alexander",Journal of food protection,https://doi.org/10.4315/jfp-20-233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977337/,77
61400,Current landscape of natural products against coronaviruses: perspectives in COVID-19 treatment and antiviral mechanism.,2020-11-05,"SARS-CoV-2 and other microbes within aerosol particles can be partially shielded from UV radiation. The particles refract and absorb light, and thereby reduce the UV intensity at various locations within the particle. Previously we demonstrated shielding in calculations of UV intensities within spherical approximations of SARS-CoV-2 virions within spherical particles approximating dried-to-equilibrium respiratory fluids. The purpose of this paper is to extend that work to survival fractions of virions (i.e., fractions of virions that can infect cells) within spherical particles approximating dried respiratory fluids, and to investigate the implications of these calculations for using UV light for disinfection. The particles may be on a surface or in air. Here, the survival fraction (S) of a set of individual virions illuminated with a UV fluence (F, in J/m2) is assumed described by S(kF)=exp(-kF), where k is the UV inactivation rate constant (m2/J). The average survival fraction (Sp) of the simulated virions in a group of particles is calculated using the energy absorbed by each virion in the particles. The results show that virions within particles of dried respiratory fluids can have larger Sp than do individual virions. For individual virions, and virions within 1-, 5-, and 9-µm particles illuminated (normal incidence) on a surface with 260-nm UV light, the Sp = 0.00005, 0.0155, 0.22 and 0.28, respectively, when kF=10. The Sp decrease to <10-7, <10-7, 0.077 and 0.15, respectively, for kF = 100. Results also show that illuminating particles with UV beams from widely separated directions can strongly reduce the Sp. These results suggest that the size distributions and optical properties of the dried particles of virion-containing respiratory fluids are likely important to effectively designing and using UV germicidal irradiation systems for microbes in particles. The results suggest the use of reflective surfaces to increase the angles of illumination and decrease the Sp. The results suggest the need for measurements of the Sp of SARS-CoV-2 in particles having compositions and sizes relevant to the modes of disease transmission.","Hill, Steven C; Mackowski, Daniel W; Doughty, David C",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2021.1939877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161194/,77

62622,Research progress of imaging technologies for ischemic cerebrovascular diseases.,2021-03-01,"This study describes the neuroprotective effect of treatment with salubrinal 1 and 24 h following 15 min of ischemia in a two-vessel occlusion model of global cerebral ischemia. The purpose of this study was to determine if salubrinal, an enhancer of the unfolded protein response, reduces the neural damage modulating the inflammatory response. The study was performed in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas as well as in the cerebral cortex whose different vulnerability to ischemic damage is widely described. Characterization of proteins was made by western blot, immunofluorescence, and ELISA, whereas mRNA levels were measured by Quantitative PCR. The salubrinal treatment decreased the cell demise in CA1 at 7 days as well as the levels of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) in CA1 and cerebral cortex at 48 h and ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 cell adhesion molecules. However, increases in tumor necrosis factor α and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) inflammatory markers were observed at 24 h. Glial fibrillary acidic protein levels were not modified by salubrinal treatment in CA1 and cerebral cortex. We describe a neuroprotective effect of the post-ischemic treatment with salubrinal, measured as a decrease both in CA1 cell demise and in the blood-brain barrier impairment. We hypothesize that the ability of salubrinal to counteract the CA1 cell demise is because of a reduced ability of this structure to elicit unfolded protein response which would account for its greater ischemic vulnerability. Data of both treated and non-treated animals suggest that the neurovascular unit present a structure-dependent response to ischemia and a different course time for CA1/cerebral cortex compared with CA3. Finally, our study reveals a high responsiveness of endothelial cells to salubrinal in contrast to the limited responsiveness of astrocytes. The alleviation of ER stress by enhancing UPR with salubrinal treatment reduces the ischemic damage. This effect varies across the different neurovascular unit cell types. The salubrinal neuroprotective effect on CA1 supports differences in neurovascular unit for different brain regions and involves the inflammatory response and its time course. Thus, UPR modulation could be a therapeutic target in cerebral ischemia.","Anuncibay-Soto, Berta; Pérez-Rodríguez, Diego; Santos-Galdiano, María; Font, Enrique; Regueiro-Purriños, Marta; Fernández-López, Arsenio",Journal of neurochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.13651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27123756/,77

Vascular closure devices have been developed as alternatives to manual compression at the arteriotomy site and prolonged bed rest. The risks of using these devices include arterial dissection, groin hematoma, and device failure. Herein, we describe our experience with the use of a novel device used for arterial access and closure, the AXERA 2 Access System. METHODS A total of 13 patients underwent vascular access and closure with the AXERA 2 Access System. RESULTS Arterial access using the AXERA 2 Access System was achieved in 11 of 13 patients. Amongst the patients with successful access, one patient experienced a groin hematoma requiring manual compression and two patients suffered occlusions of the common femoral artery due to dissections, with both patients requiring femoral artery thromboendarterectomies. CONCLUSIONS This small series highlights a heretofore underreported serious complication rate of the AXERA 2 Access System.

However, no proper surgical approach or appropriate postsurgical management of RALP has been established for a patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Here, we present a case of a peritoneal dialysis patient who underwent RALP and reinstated peritoneal dialysis with no trouble associated with peritoneal dialysis. Case Presentation: The patient was a 61-year-old man with organ-confined prostate cancer. He had been on peritoneal dialysis for 2 years. The peritoneal dialysis catheter was routed subcutaneously from the left lateral region into the abdominal cavity at the paramedian region. RALP was performed by the transperitoneal anterior approach. The surgical maneuver was not influenced by the peritoneal dialysis catheter at all. At the end of surgery, the incised peritoneum was sutured and closed tightly. After surgery, peritoneal dialysis was temporarily interrupted for 2 weeks. Then it was safely reinitiated with no complications. Conclusion: Transperitoneal RALP with complete peritoneal repair can be a standard treatment option for a prostate cancer patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis.","Kuribayashi, Sohei; Takezawa, Kentaro; Okuda, Yohei; Kawamura, Masataka; Kishimoto, Nozomu; Tanigawa, Go; Tsutahara, Koichi; Takao, Tetsuya; Yamaguchi, Seiji",Journal of endourology case reports,https://doi.org/10.1089/cren.2017.0014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28451644/,77

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AKI, and some miRNAs have shown promise as therapeutic tools in animal models of AKI. However, less is known about the role of miRNAs in human AKI. Objective To evaluate the role of miRNAs in human subjects with AKI. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Measurements Quantification of miRNA levels from human blood, urine, or kidney biopsy samples, and measures of renal function as defined in the study protocol. Methods A comprehensive search strategy for Ovid MEDLINE All, Embase, Web of Science, and CENTRAL will be developed to identify investigational studies that evaluated the relationship between miRNA levels and human AKI. Primary outcomes will include measurements of kidney function and miRNA levels. Study screening, review and data extraction will be performed independently by 2 reviewers. Study quality and certainty of evidence will be assessed with validated tools. A narrative synthesis will be included and the possibility for meta-analysis will be assessed according to characteristics of clinical and statistical heterogeneity between studies. Limitations These include (1) lack of randomized trials of miRNAs for the prevention or treatment of human AKI, (2) quality of included studies, and (3) sources of clinical and statistical heterogeneity that may affect strength and reproducibility of results. Conclusion Previous studies of miRNAs in different animal models of AKI have generated strong interest on their use for the prevention and treatment of human AKI. This systematic review will characterize the most promising miRNAs for human research and will identify methodological constraints from miRNA research in human AKI to help inform the design of future studies.

METHODS After full-width L-2 and L-5 laminectomies, 1-cm midline durotomies were created and sutured closed, except for the last 1-2 mm on the cranial end to create spontaneous CSF leakage. All 5 control animals received no further treatment. Experimental animals received hydrogel at both durotomy sites via either the Dual Liquid applicator (5 animals) or MicroMyst gas-assisted sprayer (5 animals). Sealing of the CSF leak was confirmed by Valsalva maneuver. At 2 months, 2 animals from each group were killed to evaluate dural healing and epidural adhesion formation. The remaining animals were similarly evaluated 4 months after surgery. One animal died at 66 days due to a cause unrelated to hydrogel treatment. RESULTS In hydrogel-treated animals, all leaking durotomies were sealed intraoperatively. All animals recovered uneventfully. There were no treatment-related health effects. MicroMyst hydrogel application was more controlled, slower, and significantly less thick (p = 0.0094) than Dual Liquid application. All 5 control animals developed subcutaneous CSF accumulations under the incision within days of surgery, compared with only 1 of 10 hydrogel-treated animals (p = 0.002). At 2 and 4 months, control laminectomy sites showed extensive, dense epidural adhesions blending with neodura, compared with hydrogel-treated sites (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0234, respectively). At 2 months in hydrogel-treated animals, gel filled the epidural space and no epidural adhesions were noted (p < 0.0001 relative to controls). At 4 months, the hydrogel was absorbed. The hydrogel space was filled with scant, loosely organized connective tissue. CONCLUSIONS Hydrogel prevented CSF leakage and mitigated epidural scarring without affecting healing of the dura or laminectomy site. The safety profile of the hydrogel appears favorable due to its synthetic composition, polyethylene glycol chemistry, minimal local tissue response, and lack of neurological deficits. Controlled application of such hydrogel materials may reduce the incidence of postoperative leaks, prevent adhesion formation and thus improve recovery from spinal surgery, and improve identification of tissue planes for reoperations.","Preul, Mark C; Campbell, Patrick K; Garlick, David S; Spetzler, Robert F",Journal of neurosurgery.

Here, we report the discovery of high-magnesium calcite [CaMg(CO3)2] armor overlaying the exoskeletons of major workers of the leaf-cutter ant Acromyrmex echinatior. Live-rearing and in vitro synthesis experiments indicate that the biomineral layer accumulates rapidly as ant workers mature, that the layer is continuously distributed, covering nearly the entire integument, and that the ant epicuticle catalyzes biomineral nucleation and growth. In situ nanoindentation demonstrates that the biomineral layer significantly hardens the exoskeleton. Increased survival of ant workers with biomineralized exoskeletons during aggressive encounters with other ants and reduced infection by entomopathogenic fungi demonstrate the protective role of the biomineral layer.

Afterward, however, a warning was released regarding the possible association between COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease (KD) or Kawasaki-like disease. Thereafter, labels of Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) in Europe and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in the USA were coined to refer to this new disease entity. The reality is that PIMS-TS/MIS-C resembles certain KD complications such as toxic shock syndrome and macrophage activation syndrome than to classic KD. PIMS-TS/MIS-C and KD share the viral origin (however just supposed for KD) and consequent dysregulated innate immune system inflammatory reaction. PIMS-TS/MISC symptoms occur about 2-4 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 or having been exposed to somebody positive for COVID-19, rather than in the acute phase of the infection. Clinically PIMS-TS/MIS-C affects older children than KD and presents more often with gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and multi-organ dysfunction. myocarditis is more common in PIMS-TS/MIS-C than coronary artery aneurysms formation seen in KD. There are also differences in laboratory tests and immunology responses in KD and PIMS-TS/MIS-C. Thus PIMS-TS/MIS-C seems to be a new and multifaceted entity, distinct from KD, notwithstanding some common features in both. The dysregulated innate immune system reaction is responsible for PIMS-TS/MIS-C onset and outcome. A multidisciplinary approach, involving paediatric intensivists, paediatric cardiologists, infectious disease specialists, immunologists, and rheumatologists, is needed for the treatment of these children.","Calcaterra, Giuseppe; Mehta, Jawahar L; Fanos, Vassilios; Bassareo, Pier Paolo",Minerva pediatrica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4946.20.06140-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305919/,77

Accurate diagnostic tests to differentiate the 2 infections are necessary for patient management and disease control. Using characterized ZIKV and DENV patient plasma in a blind manner, we validated an ELISA and a rapid immunochromatographic test for ZIKV detection. We engineered the ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) for sensitive serologic detection with low cross reactivity against dengue and developed monoclonal antibodies specific for the ZIKV NS1 antigen. As expected, the serologic assays performed better with convalescent than acute plasma samples; the sensitivity ranged from 71% to 88%, depending on the performance of individual tests (IgM/IgG/NS1). Although serologic tests were generally less sensitive with acute samples, our ZIKV NS1 antibodies were able to complement the serologic tests to achieve greater sensitivity for detecting early infections.","Yap, Thai Leong; Hong, Shin Yee; Soh, Jun Hui; Ravichandraprabhu, Lekha; Lim, Vanessa W X; Chan, Hsi-Min; Ong, Tommy Z X; Chua, Ying Ping; Koh, Shi En; Wang, Huajing; Leo, Yee Sin; Ying, Jackie Y; Sun, William",Emerging infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2705.190121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33900180/,77
67291,Forthcoming articles.,1993,"Purpose To analyse structural and non-structural modifications of acute stroke care pathways undertaken at healthcare institutions across the regions of Italy due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods Research on National decrees specific for the pandemic was carried out. The stroke pathways of four Italian regions from North to South, such as Lombardy, Veneto, Lazio and Campania, were analysed before and after the pandemic outbreak. Findings On 29 February 2020, the Italian Minister of Health issued national guidelines on how to address the COVID-19 emergency. Stroke management was affected and required changes, basically resulting in the need to prioritise the ongoing COVID-19 emergency. In the most affected regions, the closure of departments and hospitals led to a complete reorganisation of previously functioning stroke networks. With the closure of several Stroke Units and Stroke Centres, the transportation time to hospital lengthened significantly, especially for the outlying populations. Discussion The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has been spreading rapidly in Italy and placing an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems. In response to this, political and healthcare decision-makers worked together to develop and implement efforts to sustain the national healthcare system while fighting the pandemic. Stroke care pathways changed during the pandemic and different organisational models were applied in the most affected regions. Conclusions Stroke treatment pathways will need to be redesigned so to guarantee that severe and acute disease patients do not lose their rights to the access and delivery of care during the COVID-19 pandemics.","Zedde, Marialuisa; Pezzella, Francesca Romana; Paciaroni, Maurizio; Corea, Francesco; Reale, Nicoletta; Toni, Danilo; Caso, Valeria",European stroke journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987320942622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072875/,77

However, the 2 guidelines differ with regard to the recommended threshold of aortic root or ascending aortic dilatation that would justify surgical intervention in patients with bicuspid aortic valves. The ACC and AHA therefore convened a subcommittee representing members of the 2 guideline writing committees to review the evidence, reach consensus, and draft a statement of clarification for both guidelines. This statement of clarification uses the ACC/AHA revised structure for delineating the Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence to provide recommendations that replace those contained in Section 9.2.2.1 of the thoracic aortic disease guideline and Section 5.1.3 of the valvular heart disease guideline.","Hiratzka, Loren F; Creager, Mark A; Isselbacher, Eric M; Svensson, Lars G; Nishimura, Rick A; Bonow, Robert O; Guyton, Robert A; Sundt, Thoralf M; Halperin, Jonathan L; Levine, Glenn N; Anderson, Jeffrey L; Albert, Nancy M; Al-Khatib, Sana M; Birtcher, Kim K; Bozkurt, Biykem; Brindis, Ralph G; Cigarroa, Joaquin E; Curtis, Lesley H; Fleisher, Lee A; Gentile, Federico; Gidding, Samuel; Hlatky, Mark A; Ikonomidis, John; Joglar, José; Kovacs, Richard J; Ohman, E Magnus; Pressler, Susan J; Sellke, Frank W; Shen, Win-Kuang; Wijeysundera, Duminda N",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000000331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26637530/,77

METHODS Three study periods with approximately the same number of patients were defined to span recruitment. Composite and individual rates of periprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction, and death rate were calculated separately by treatment assignment (carotid stenting/carotid endarterectomy). Temporal changes in unadjusted event rates, and rates after adjustment for temporal changes in patient characteristics, were assessed. RESULTS For patients randomized to carotid stenting, there was no significant temporal change in the unadjusted composite rates that declined from 6.2% in the first period, to 4.9% in the second, and 4.6% in the third (P=0.28). Adjustment for patient characteristics attenuated the rates to 6.0%, 5.9%, and 5.6% (P=0.85). For carotid endarterectomy-randomized patients, both the composite and the combined stroke and death outcome decreased between periods 1 and 2 and then increased in period 3. CONCLUSIONS The hypothesized temporal reduction of stroke+death events for carotid stenting-treated patients was not observed. Further adjustment for changes in patient characteristics between periods, including the addition of asymptomatic patients and a >50% decrease in proportion of octogenarians enrolled, resulted in practically identical rates.

Samples originated from 193 dairy and beef farms in 29 provinces distributed throughout Spain, and were tested for the occurrence of three target enteric pathogens by reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR): bovine rotavirus A (RVA), Cryptosporidium parvum and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing analysis were used to determine the G (VP7 gene) and P (VP4 gene) genotypes of 26 specimens positive for RVA. A total of 188 specimens (79.3 %) were positive for at least one of the three target enteric pathogens, and 101 samples (42.6 %) harbored mixed infections. The individual prevalence was 57.8 %, 50.6 % and 23.6 % for C. parvum, RVA and BCoV, respectively. Molecular analysis of selected RVA strains revealed the presence of the G6, G10, G3, P[5] and P[11] genotypes, with the combinations G6P[5] and G6P[11] being the most prevalent. Alignments of nucleotide sequences of the VP7 and VP4 markers showed a high frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with up to 294 SNPs found in 869bp of sequence at the G6 genotype (0.338 SNPs/nt), which reveals the extensive genetic diversity of RVA strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP7 gene of the G6 strains revealed four distinct lineages, with most strains clustering in the G6-IV lineage. The discrepancies between the RVA genotypes circulating in the sampled cattle farms and the genotypes contained in commercial vaccines currently available in Spain are discussed. We believe that this is the first study on the molecular characterization of rotavirus infecting cattle in Spain.","Benito, Alfredo A; Monteagudo, Luis V; Arnal, José L; Baselga, Cristina; Quílez, Joaquín",Preventive veterinary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.105196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197724/,77

METHODS A retrospective study was undertaken of patients with late complications after midurethral sling surgery who underwent placement of a Pelvilace sling at a center in the Netherlands between January 2006 and January 2011. A postoperative questionnaire was used to evaluate the continence status and continence-related quality of life. Patients scoring 0 in the Urogenital Distress Inventory stress symptoms section were considered cured. The subjective improvement or deterioration in symptoms was scored using the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I). RESULTS The questionnaire was completed and returned by 32 (84%) of 38 patients after a mean follow-up of 54.3 months. Nine (28%) patients were deemed cured. Among 29 patients who had not undergone a third surgery, the PGI-I showed a postoperative improvement in 14 (48%). The other 15 patients rated their postoperative situation as little improved, unchanged, or deteriorated. Further subanalysis showed clear differences in postoperative results between the different types of late complications (erosion and/or displacement).

70336,Mechanical-ventilatory responses to peak and ventilation-matched upper- versus lower-body exercise in normal subjects.,2019,"The type I interferon (IFN) response plays an essential role in the control of in vivo infection by the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). However, in vitro, most strains of MHV are largely resistant to the action of this cytokine, suggesting that MHV encodes one or more functions that antagonize or evade the IFN system. A particular strain of MHV, MHV-S, exhibited orders-of-magnitude higher sensitivity to IFN than prototype strain MHV-A59. Through construction of interstrain chimeric recombinants, the basis for the enhanced IFN sensitivity of MHV-S was found to map entirely to the region downstream of the spike gene, at the 3' end of the genome. Sequence analysis revealed that the major difference between the two strains in this region is the absence of gene 5a from MHV-S. Creation of a gene 5a knockout mutant of MHV-A59 demonstrated that a major component of IFN resistance maps to gene 5a. Conversely, insertion of gene 5a, or its homologs from related group 2 coronaviruses, at an upstream genomic position in an MHV-A59/S chimera restored IFN resistance. This is the first demonstration of a coronavirus gene product that can protect that same virus from the antiviral state induced by IFN. Neither protein kinase R, which phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2, nor oligoadenylate synthetase, which activates RNase L, was differentially activated in IFN-treated cells infected with MHV-A59 or MHV-S. Thus, the major IFN-induced antiviral activities that are specifically inhibited by MHV, and possibly by other coronaviruses, remain to be identified.","Koetzner, Cheri A; Kuo, Lili; Goebel, Scott J; Dean, Amy B; Parker, Monica M; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00385-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20519394/,77

In 2020, a total of 7,219 clinical isolates of gonococci from patients in the public and private sectors, in all jurisdictions, were tested for in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility by standardised methods. Current treatment recommendations for gonorrhoea, for the majority of Australia, continues to be dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. In 2020, decreased susceptibility (DS) to ceftriaxone (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] value ≥ 0.06 mg/L) was found nationally in 0.9% of isolates. There was one isolate, reported from Victoria in 2020, that was resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC value ≥ 0.25 mg/L). Resistance to azithromycin (MIC value ≥ 1.0 mg/L) was found nationally in 3.9% of N. gonorrhoeae isolates, continuing a downward trend observed and reported since 2017. Isolates with high-level resistance to azithromycin (MIC value ≥ 256 mg/L) are identified sporadically in Australia; in 2020, there was one such isolate reported in Queensland. In 2020, penicillin resistance was found in 27% of gonococcal isolates nationally, and ciprofloxacin resistance in 36%; however, there is considerable variation by jurisdiction. In some remote settings, penicillin resistance remains low, and this drug continues to be recommended as part of an empiric therapy strategy. In 2020, in remote Northern Territory, no penicillin resistance was reported, and in remote Western Australia 5/116 of gonococcal isolates (4.3%) were penicillin resistant. There was one ciprofloxacin-resistant isolate reported from remote Northern Territory, and ciprofloxacin resistance rates remain comparatively low in remote Western Australia (4/116; 3.4%).","Lahra, Monica M; Hogan, Tiffany R; Shoushtari, Masoud; Armstrong, Benjamin H",Communicable diseases intelligence,https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2021.45.24; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33934693/,77

71163,Efficacy of intraperitoneal and intravenous lidocaine on pain relief after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,2014,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on maternity care, supports and women's mental health. AIM The aim of this study was to assess pregnant women's satisfaction with antenatal care and social support and to examine stress-reduction strategies women used during the pandemic. METHODS An online survey was conducted between June and July 2020. Pregnant women, aged over 18 years were recruited. The survey included closed and open-ended questions to assess women's perceptions and satisfaction with their antenatal care, social support, and stress-reduction strategies. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis were used for quantitative analyses; qualitative content analysis was used for open-ended questions. FINDINGS 573 pregnant women completed the survey. Women reported low levels of social support which was predicted by women's mental health and demographic factors and was related to public health and maternity service restrictions. Women reported that restrictions implemented in the maternity services limited their face-to face interactions with healthcare professionals and meant their partners could not attend antenatal appointments or support them in the postpartum period in the maternity setting. The lack of information on COVID-19 and pregnancy meant women had greater uncertainty about pregnancy and birth. DISCUSSION Our findings indicate how the lack of access to antenatal care and reduced perceived social support as a result of the restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially intensifies pregnancy specific stress. CONCLUSIONS There is a need for the provision of supportive care, both formally and informally, particularly with women who may be more vulnerable during a pandemic.","Meaney, Sarah; Leitao, Sara; Olander, Ellinor K; Pope, Johanna; Matvienko-Sikar, Karen",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2021.04.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994134/,77

Until today, the most important clinical strategies for adhesion prevention are accurate surgical technique and the physical separation of traumatized serosal areas. Despite a variety of barriers which are available in clinical use, the optimal material has not yet been found. DISCUSSION Mesothelial cells play a crucial physiological role in friction less gliding of the serosa and the maintenance of anantiadhesive surface. The formation of postoperative adhesions results from a cascade of events and is regulated by various cellular and humoral factors. Therefore, optimization or functionalization of barrier materials by developments interacting with this cascade on a structural or pharmacological level could give an innovative input for future strategies in peritoneal adhesion prevention. For this purpose, the proper understanding of the formal pathogenesis of adhesion formation is essential. Based on the physiology of the serosa and the pathophysiology of adhesion formation, the available barriers in current clinical practice as well as new innovations are discussed in the present review.","Brochhausen, Christoph; Schmitt, Volker H; Planck, Constanze N E; Rajab, Taufiek K; Hollemann, David; Tapprich, Christine; Krämer, Bernhard; Wallwiener, Christian; Hierlemann, Helmut; Zehbe, Rolf; Planck, Heinrich; Kirkpatrick, C James",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-011-1819-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22297658/,77

PCR detected influenza A and B in NPA samples from 11 patients and in fNS samples from 10 patients. Little or no discomfort was perceived by 60% of the patients when sampled by NPA and by 66% when sampled by fNS. We conclude that NPA and fNS were equally sensitive for detection of respiratory agents by multiplex PCR, and the two sampling methods did not differ significantly regarding discomfort perceived by patients (p = 0.171, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Hence less invasive sampling by fNS might be preferable in certain settings and situations.","Hansen, Karin B; Westin, Johan; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Lindh, Magnus; Widell, Anders; Nilsson, Anna C",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3109/23744235.2015.1096956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26466764/,77
71507,Petition to ban nicotine pouches in Kenya.,2021-04-29,"OBJECTIVES To investigate the usefulness of the ultrasonography (US) fusion imaging system for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS Since the US fusion imaging system became available in 2010, we have conducted RFA with this system in all cases. The characteristics of 75 patients with 120 HCCs and 89 patients with 123 HCCs who underwent RFA before the introduction of this system (period A) and after it (period B), respectively, were retrospectively compared. RESULTS Significant difference in the characteristics of the patients and HCCs between the two periods was found only in the proportion of HCCs with poor conspicuity on grayscale US treated with RFA (1.7%, 2/120 for period A vs. 15.4%, 19/123 for period B, p < 0.01). Among the 19 HCCs with poor conspicuity on grayscale US for period B, 5 and 9 HCCs were identified on grayscale US and contrast-enhanced US, respectively, by the use of the US fusion imaging system, whereas the 5 remaining undetectable HCCs were treated by using the system in conjunction with reference images displayed side-by-side with grayscale US. CONCLUSION Since the introduction of the US fusion imaging system, it has become possible to perform RFA for HCCs with poor conspicuity on grayscale US.","Makino, Yuki; Imai, Yasuharu; Ohama, Hideko; Igura, Takumi; Kogita, Sachiyo; Sawai, Yoshiyuki; Fukuda, Kazuto; Takamura, Manabu; Ohashi, Hiroshi; Murakami, Takamichi",Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000345889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23428858/,77

The purpose of this study was to explore the immediate results of PMBV with respect to echocardiographic changes, outcomes, and complications, using a meta-analysis approach. Methods MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases were searched (01/2012 to 10/2018) for original research articles regarding the efficacy and safety of PMBV. Two reviewers independently screened references for inclusion and abstracted data including article details and echocardiographic parameters before and 24-72 h after PMBV, follow-up duration, and acute complications. Disagreements were resolved by third adjudicator. Quality of all included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale NOS. Results 44/990 references met the inclusion criteria representing 6537 patients. Our findings suggest that PMBV leads to a significant increase in MVA (MD = 0.81 cm2; 0.76-0.87, p < 0.00001), LVEDP (MD = 1.89 mmHg; 0.52-3.26, p = 0.007), LVEDV EDV (MD = 5.81 ml; 2.65-8.97, p = 0.0003) and decrease in MPG (MD = -7.96 mmHg; -8.73 to -7.20, p < 0.00001), LAP (MD = -10.09 mmHg; -11.06 to -9.12, p < 0.00001), and SPAP (MD = -15.55 mmHg; -17.92 to -13.18, p < 0.00001). On short term basis, the pooled overall incidence estimates of repeat PMBV, mitral valve surgery, post-PMBV severe MR, and post-PMBV stroke, and systemic thromboembolism were 0.5%, 2%, 1.4%, 0.4%, and 0.7%% respectively. On long term basis, the pooled overall incidence estimates of repeat PMBV, mitral valve surgery, post-PMBV severe MR, and post-PMBV stroke, systemic thromboembolism were 5%, 11.5%, 5.5%, 2.7%, and 1.7% respectively. Conclusion PMBV represents a successful approach for patients with mitral stenosis as evidenced by improvement in echocardiographic parameters and low rate of complications.","Abu Rmilah, Anan A; Tahboub, Mahmoud A; Alkurashi, Adham K; Jaber, Suhaib A; Yagmour, Asil H; Al-Souri, Deema; Lewis, Bradley R; Nkomo, Vuyisile T; Erwin, Patricia J; Reeder, Guy S",International journal of cardiology.

While tuberculosis (TB), one of the deadliest infectious diseases, is caused by uncontrolled Mtb infection, over 90% of presumed infected individuals remain asymptomatic and contain Mtb in a latent TB infection (LTBI) without ever developing disease, and some may clear the infection. A small number of heavily Mtb-exposed individuals appear to resist developing traditional LTBI. Because Mtb has mechanisms for intracellular survival and immune evasion, successful control involves all of the arms of the immune system. Here, we focus on immune responses to Mtb in humans and nonhuman primates and discuss new concepts and outline major knowledge gaps in our understanding of LTBI, ranging from the earliest events of exposure and infection to success or failure of Mtb control.","Boom, W Henry; Schaible, Ulrich E; Achkar, Jacqueline M",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci136222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33529162/,77
72617,COVID-19: Time for precision epidemiology.,2020-04-17,"PURPOSE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic recovery will require a broad and coordinated effort for infection testing, immunity determination, and vaccination. With the advent of several COVID-19 vaccines, the dissemination and delivery of COVID-19 immunization across the nation is of concern. Previous immunization delivery patterns may reveal important components of a comprehensive and sustainable effort to immunize everyone in the nation. METHODS The delivery of vaccinations were enumerated by provider type using 2017 Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service data and the 2013-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. The delivery of these services was examined at the service, physician, and visit level. RESULTS In 2017 Medicare Part B Fee-For-Service, primary care physicians provided the largest share of services for vaccinations (46%), followed closely by mass immunizers (45%), then nurse practitioners/physician assistants (NP/PAs) (5%). The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey showed that primary care physicians provided most clinical visits for vaccination (54% of all visits). CONCLUSIONS Primary care physicians have played a crucial role in delivery of vaccinations to the US population, including the elderly, between 2012-2017. These findings indicate primary care practices may be a crucial element of vaccine counseling and delivery in the upcoming COVID-19 recovery and immunization efforts in the United States.","Wilkinson, Elizabeth; Jetty, Anuradha; Petterson, Stephen; Jabbarpour, Yalda; Westfall, John M",Annals of family medicine,https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33707190/,77
73076,Errors in Table.,2017,"Men with the poorest health outcomes are, paradoxically, the least likely to access health services or to engage with health promotion interventions. This has focused attention on developing gender-sensitive and strengths-based approaches to engage so-called 'hard-to-reach' men. Men's Sheds ('Sheds') are recognized as an alternative space in which to engage older and more marginalized groups of men in health. The aim of this study was to establish key principles that could align the ethos of Sheds with a national health promotion initiative ('Sheds for Life'; SFL) in terms of methods of engagement, programme content and models of delivery. Qualitative methods incorporating semi-structured interviews, focus groups and observations were conducted with men in Sheds ('Shedders'; n = 38), oversight/advisory groups (n = 11) and partner organizations (n = 8). The principles of grounded theory were used to inform data collection and analysis. Findings revealed a range of mediating factors in terms of how Shedders engage with or 'do' health that were grounded in a recognition of the health-enhancing 'essence' of Sheds and in 'making men's health men's business'. Key learnings arising from the process of engaging with Shedders included the importance of investing in relationships, establishing credibility and tailoring SFL programme content and delivery to individual Sheds. In terms of conceptualizing SFL, attention was drawn to the need for a coherent and formalized SFL strategy and 'rules of engagement', as well as a robust and sustainable system for implementation. This is the first study that informs a more systematic and formal approach to health promotion in Sheds.","Bergin, Niamh; Richardson, Noel",Health promotion international,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daaa082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830228/,77

A novel ""D"" shape staple allows for an extremely low profile of the applicator. The acute and long-term efficacy of a D-shaped staple (Cardica, Redwood City, CA, USA) was compared to conventional B-form staples (Covidien, Norwalk, CN, USA) in an animal model for intestinal transections and anastomoses. METHODS Jejunojejunal anastomoses (JJ) were performed via mini-laparotomy in a swine model. White & blue D- and B-shaped staples were studied in three groups (planned survival 14-84 days). Intraoperative assessment included completeness of staple line, hemostasis, and need for intervention. Postoperatively, animals were evaluated for complications. At the time of sacrifice, gross pathological and histological assessments were performed. RESULTS Twenty-three animals had 40 anastomoses (23 ""D"" and 17 ""B"" staple anastomoses) with no intraoperative mortalities. One ""D"" staple application required a manual extension of the cut. Acute hemostasis was 100%. Group 1 (n = 5) compared white staples in JJs (D staple n = 5; B staple n = 5; 14-day survival = 100%). Group 2 (n = 12) compared white staples in JJs (D staple n = 12; B staple n = 6; 34-day survival = 92 %). One animal died on day 4 for a non-staple related cause. Group 3 (n = 6) compared blue staples in JJs (D staple n = 6; B staple n = 6; 84 day survival = 84%). One animal died on day 18 due to an obstruction at the B staple JJ caused by stricture. There were no other bleeding, leaks or strictures in any of the groups. Gross pathology and histology were unremarkable in all JJs. CONCLUSIONS This study showed no difference in intraoperative performance and the chronic healing response in JJs between D- and B-shaped staples. Based on these findings, the D-shaped staple elicits a normal healing response in jejunostomies and offers the possibility of clinical use of this advance in staple design.","Demertzis, Stefanos; Beslac, Oligca; Mettler, Daniel; Zalokar, Daniel; Spangler, Taylor; Hausen, Bernard; Swanstrom, Lee",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4125-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25795379/,77

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using multiple electronic databases and included studies from inception to July 19, 2019. The proportion of bleeding, thrombosis, and mortality were evaluated.Twenty-six studies (2,086 patients) were included. Bleeding occurred in 34.2% (95%CI 25.1;43.9) of the patients with anti-Xa-based versus 41.6% (95%CI 24.9;59.4) of the patients with time-based anticoagulation strategies. Thrombosis occurred in 32.6% (95%CI 19.1;47.7) of the patients with anti-Xa-based versus 38.4% (95%CI 22.2;56.1) of the patients with time-based anticoagulation strategies. And mortality rate was 35.4% (95%CI 28.9;42.1) of the patients with anti-Xa-based versus 42.9% (95%CI 36.9;48.9) of the patients with time-based anticoagulation strategies. Among the seven studies providing results from both anticoagulation strategies, significantly fewer bleeding events occurred in the anti-Xa-based anticoagulation strategy (adjusted OR 0.49 (95%CI 0.32;0.74), p < 0.001) and a significantly lower mortality rate (adjusted OR 0.61 (95%CI 0.40;0.95), p = 0.03). There was no significant difference in thrombotic events (adjusted OR 0.91 (95%CI 0.56;1.49), p = 0.71). In these seven observational studies, only a small fraction of the patients were adults, and data were insufficient to analyze the effect of the type of ECMO.In this meta-analysis of observational studies of patients on ECMO, an anti-Xa-based anticoagulation strategy, when compared to a time-based strategy, was associated with fewer bleeding events and mortality rate, without an increase in thrombotic events.","Willems, Ariane; Roeleveld, Peter P; Labarinas, Sonia; Cyrus, John W; Muszynski, Jennifer A; Nellis, Marianne E; Karam, Oliver",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659120952982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32862767/,77
73518,Impact of protein on the composition and metabolism of the human gut microbiota and health.,2020-12-22,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor of the central nervous system in adults. Despite advances in surgical and medical neuro-oncology, the median survival is about 15 months. For this reason, initial diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy of GBM represent very attractive areas of study. Aptamers are short three-dimensional structures of single-stranded nucleic acids (RNA or DNA), identified by an in vitro process, named systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), starting from a partially random oligonucleotide library. They bind to a molecular target with high affinity and specificity and can be easily modified to optimize binding affinity and selectivity. Thanks to their properties (low immunogenicity and toxicity, long stability, and low production variability), a large number of aptamers have been selected against GBM biomarkers and provide specific imaging agents and therapeutics to improve the diagnosis and treatment of GBM. However, the use of aptamers in GBM diagnosis and treatment still represents an underdeveloped topic, mainly due to limited literature in the research world. On these bases, we performed a systematic review aimed at summarizing current knowledge on the new promising DNA and RNA aptamer-based molecules for GBM diagnosis and treatment. Thirty-eight studies from 2000 were included and investigated. Seventeen involved the use of aptamers for GBM diagnosis and 21 for GBM therapy. Our findings showed that a number of DNA and RNA aptamers are promising diagnostic and therapeutic tools for GBM management.","Nuzzo, Silvia; Brancato, Valentina; Affinito, Alessandra; Salvatore, Marco; Cavaliere, Carlo; Condorelli, Gerolama",Cancers,https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12082173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764266/,77

The aim of the study was to compare clinical outcomes of patients with high grade dysplasia (HGD) or intramucosal cancer (IMC) at baseline from the United Kingdom RFA registry. PATIENTS AND METHODS Prior to RFA, visible lesions and nodularity were removed entirely by EMR. Thereafter, patients underwent RFA every 3 months until all visible Barrett's mucosa was ablated or cancer developed (end points). Biopsies were taken at 12 months or when end points were reached. RESULTS A total of 515 patients, 384 with HGD and 131 with IMC, completed treatment. Prior to RFA, EMR was performed for visible lesions more frequently in the IMC cohort than in HGD patients (77 % vs. 47 %; P < 0.0001). The 12-month complete response for dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia were almost identical in the two cohorts (HGD 88 % and 76 %, respectively; IMC 87 % and 75 %, respectively; P = 0.7). Progression to invasive cancer was not significantly different at 12 months (HGD 1.8 %, IMC 3.8 %; P = 0.19). A trend towards slightly worse medium-term durability may be emerging in IMC patients (P = 0.08). In IMC, EMR followed by RFA was definitely associated with superior durability compared with RFA alone (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION The Registry reports on endoscopic therapy for Barrett's neoplasia, representing real-life outcomes. Patients with IMC were more likely to have visible lesions requiring initial EMR than those with HGD, and may carry a higher risk of cancer progression in the medium term. The data consolidate the approach to ensuring that these patients undergo thorough endoscopic work-up, including EMR prior to RFA when necessary.","Haidry, Rehan J; Lipman, Gideon; Banks, Matthew R; Butt, Mohammed A; Sehgal, Vinay; Graham, David; Dunn, Jason M; Gupta, Abhinav; Sweis, Rami; Miah, Haroon; Morris, Danielle; Smart, Howard L; Bhandari, Pradeep; Willert, Robert; Fullarton, Grant; Morris, Jonathon; Di Pietro, Massimo; Gordon, Charles; Penman, Ian; Barr, High; Patel, Praful; Boger, Philip; Kapoor, Neil; Mahon, Brinder; Hoare, Jonathon; Narayanasamy, Ravi; O'Toole, Dermot; Cheong, Edward; Direkze, Natalie C; Ang, Yeng; Veitch, Andrew; Dhar, Anjan; Nyalender, David; Ragunath, Krish; Leahy, Anthony; Fullard, Mark; Rodriguez-Justo, Manuel; Novelli, Marco; Lovat, Laurence B",Endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1392414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26126159/,77

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort analysis. METHODS Utilizing the National Cancer Data Base, 2004 to 2015, patients with a diagnosis of oral cavity/oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma were studied. Multivariate analysis was completed with multivariate regression and Cox proportional hazard model, and survival outcomes were examined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS A total of 15,181 patients who had surgery for a head and neck cancer at an academic/research center were included in the study population. Of the study population, 4,890 (32.2%) patients completed PORT at a different treatment facility. Treatment at a different facility was more common among patients who were ≥65 years old, white, Medicare recipients, those with a greater distance between residence and surgical treatment facility, and with lower income within area of residence (each P < .05). Overall survival was worse in patients completing PORT at a different treatment facility versus at the institution where surgery was completed (61.9% vs. 66.4%; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS PORT at a different facility was more common in older individuals, Medicare recipients, those with greater distance to travel, and lower-income individuals.

Here, using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, combined with analysis of SMAD signaling, we show that the kinase domain of the type I receptor ALK2 and type II receptor BMPR2 form a heterodimeric complex via their C-terminal lobes. Formation of this dimer is essential for ligand-induced receptor signaling and is targeted by mutations in BMPR2 in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

METHODS An analysis was undertaken of all patients who underwent CBT resection at Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital and Greenslopes Private Hospital between 1982 and 2007. Primary tumor characteristics, surgical technique, and outcomes were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS A total of 49 consecutive CBT resections (2 recurrent tumors) were carried out in 39 patients (26 women [56%]) who were a mean age of 49 years (range, 17-75 years). A nontender neck mass was the presenting complaint in 85%, followed by screening in familial or contralateral tumors in 26%. Familial cases occurred in 11 patients (28%). There were no operative deaths. Complications occurred in 13 of the 49 operations (27%), predominantly temporary nerve palsies and were more likely to occur in tumors of large volume or in cases of removal of coexisting vagal tumors. Malignant disease was present in seven cases (15%). All patients have been followed-up postoperatively for a mean of 11 years (range, 2-26 years). Metachronous paragangliomas have been discovered in six patients, all with familial disease. CONCLUSIONS Early resection of carotid body tumors should be undertaken while still small to minimize the risk of neural injury, which increases with tumor size. In cases of bilateral CBT, we recommend that the smaller tumor be resected first, before the staged resection of the larger contralateral tumor. In familial or bilateral tumor cases, other synchronous and metachronous paragangliomas should be excluded. Mandatory lifelong follow-up is essential.","Kruger, Allan J; Walker, Philip J; Foster, Wallace J; Jenkins, Jason S; Boyne, Nicholas S; Jenkins, Julie",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2010.06.153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21146747/,77

DESIGN Prospective cohort analysis of the Reproductive Medicine Network's Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS) randomized controlled trial. SETTING Multicenter randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS A total of 868 couples with unexplained infertility (n=2,459 cycles). INTERVENTIONS OS-IUI treatment cycles (n = 2,459) as part of the AMIGOS clinical trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Live birth rates; unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (RR) for live birth by EMT category, calculated using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS The overall mean EMT on day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration in cycles with a live birth was significantly greater than in those without. Compared to the referent EMT group of 9 to 12 mm, the unadjusted RR for live birth for the EMT groups of ≤5 and 6-8 were 0.48 and 0.92, respectively. The test for trend indicated evidence of decreasing LBR with decreasing EMT. After adjustment for ovarian stimulation medication, a linear trend was no longer supported. Stratified analyses revealed no differences in associations by treatment group. CONCLUSIONS In OS-IUI for unexplained infertility, higher LBR are observed with increasing EMT; however, EMT is not significantly associated with LBR when adjusted for OS treatment type. Appreciable LBR are seen at all EMT, even those of ≤5 mm, suggesting that OS-IUI cycles should not be canceled for thin endometrium.

76485,Surveillance of tuberculosis.,2020-12-01,"Conventional mechanical ventilators rely on pneumatic pressure and flow sensors and controllers to detect breaths. New modes of mechanical ventilation have been developed to better match the assistance delivered by the ventilator to the patient's needs. Among these modes, neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) delivers a pressure that is directly proportional to the integral of the electrical activity of the diaphragm recorded continuously through an esophageal probe. In clinical settings, NAVA has been chiefly compared with pressure-support ventilation, one of the most popular modes used during the weaning phase, which delivers a constant pressure from breath to breath. Comparisons with proportional-assist ventilation, which has numerous similarities, are lacking. Because of the constant level of assistance, pressure-support ventilation reduces the natural variability of the breathing pattern and can be associated with asynchrony and/or overinflation. The ability of NAVA to circumvent these limitations has been addressed in clinical studies and is discussed in this report. Although the underlying concept is fascinating, several important questions regarding the clinical applications of NAVA remain unanswered. Among these questions, determining the optimal NAVA settings according to the patient's ventilatory needs and/or acceptable level of work of breathing is a key issue. In this report, based on an investigator-initiated round table, we review the most recent literature on this topic and discuss the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of NAVA compared with other modes, as well as the risks and limitations of NAVA.","Terzi, Nicolas; Piquilloud, Lise; Rozé, Hadrien; Mercat, Alain; Lofaso, Frédéric; Delisle, Stéphane; Jolliet, Philippe; Sottiaux, Thierry; Tassaux, Didier; Roesler, Jean; Demoule, Alexandre; Jaber, Samir; Mancebo, Jordi; Brochard, Laurent; Richard, Jean-Christophe Marie",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc11297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22715815/,77

There is a higher incidence in some regions and countries, especially where close association exists between growing numbers of cattle (the major source of Mycobacterium bovis) and people, many suffering from poverty, and where dairy products are consumed unpasteurised. More attention needs to be focused on possible increased zTB incidence resulting from growth in dairy production globally and increased demand in low income countries in particular (Ohlan, 2014). Evidence of new zoonotic mycobacterial strains in South Asia and Africa (e.g. M. orygis), warrants urgent assessment of prevalence, potential drivers and risk in order to develop appropriate interventions. Control of M. bovis infection in cattle through detect and cull policies remain the mainstay of reducing zTB risk, whilst in certain circumstances animal vaccination is proving beneficial. New point of care diagnostics will help to detect animal infections and human cases.. Given the high burden of human tuberculosis (caused by M. tuberculosis) in endemic areas, animals are affected by reverse zoonosis, including multi-drug resistant strains. This, may create drug resistant reservoirs of infection in animals.

78038,White matter and neurological disorders.,2020-09-25,"In an attempt to support care integration that promotes joined up service provision and patient-centred care across care boundaries, local health and social care organisations have embarked on several initiatives and approaches. A key component of service integration is the co-location of different professional groups. In this study, we consider the extent to which co-location is an enabler for service integration by examining multi-professional community care teams. The study presents findings from a qualitative evaluation of integrated care initiatives in a borough of East London, England, undertaken between 2017 and 2018. The evaluation employed a participatory approach, the Researcher-in-Residence model. Participant observation (n = 80 hr) and both semi-structured individual (n = 16) and group interviews (six groups, n = 17 participants) were carried out. Thematic analysis of the data was undertaken. The findings show that co-location can be an effective enabler for service integration providing a basis for joint working, fostering improved communication and information sharing if conditions such as shared information systems and professional cultures (shared beliefs and values) are met. Organisations must consider the potential barriers to service integration such as differing professional identity, limited understanding of roles and responsibilities and a lack of continuity in personnel. Co-location remains an important facet in the development of multi-professional teams and local service integration arrangements, but as yet, has not been widely acknowledged as a priority in care practice. Organisations that are committed to greying care boundaries and providing joined up patient care must ensure that sufficient focus is provided at the service delivery level and not assume that decades of silo working in health and social care and strong professional cultures will be resolved by co-location.","Lalani, Mirza; Marshall, Martin",Health & social care in the community,https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33152144/,77

Globalization has eroded the boundary between public and private health and between domestic and global health governance. In addition, the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003 focused global attention on China's public health. As a rising power with the largest population on earth, China is expected by the international community to play a better and more active role in health management. Since the turn of this century, China has increasingly embraced multilateralism in health governance. This paper argues that China's multilateral cooperation is driven by both necessity and conscious design. International concerns about good governance and its aspiration to become a 'responsible' state have exerted a normative effect on China to change tack. Its interactions with United Nations agencies have triggered a learning process for China to securitize the spread of infectious diseases as a security threat. Conversely, China has utilized multilateralism to gain access to international resources and technical assistance. It is still a matter of debate whether China's cooperative engagement with global health governance can endure, because of the persistent problems of withholding information on disease outbreaks and because of its insistence on the Westphalian notion of sovereignty.","Chan, L H; Lee, P K; Chan, G",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441690701524471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19153928/,77

The authors show how these effects are manifested in the domains of the self, emotional experience, psychological well-being, attitudes and evaluations, social categorization and perception, and judgment and decision making.

Current theoretical explanations converge on a single point: cooperators can prevail when they cluster in social space. However, we know very little about the real-world mechanisms that drive such clustering, particularly in systems where cognitive limitations make it unlikely that mechanisms such as score keeping and reputation are at play. Here, we show that Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) use a 'walk away' strategy, a simple social heuristic by which assortment by cooperativeness can come about among mobile agents. Guppies cooperate during predator inspection and we found that when experiencing defection in this context, individuals prefer to move to a new social environment, despite having no prior information about this new social group. Our results provide evidence in non-human animals that individuals use a simple social partner updating strategy in response to defection, supporting theoretical work applying heuristics to understanding the proximate mechanisms underpinning the evolution of cooperation among non-kin.","Darden, Safi K; James, Richard; Cave, James M; Brask, Josefine Bohr; Croft, Darren P",Proceedings.

DESIGN Mixed-method systematic review. DATA SOURCES Bibliographic databases were searched without date restriction up to June 2019: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Joanna Briggs and Cochrane Libraries. Back issues of leading critical care and patient experience journals were manually searched, as were the reference lists of included studies. All evaluation studies of relevant intervention activities were included; all research designs and outcome measures were eligible. Due to heterogeneity in interventions, designs and outcome measures, the synthesis followed a narrative approach. Service users met with the research team termly. RESULTS Out of 4962 possible citations, a total of 20 studies were included. The overall evidence base was assessed as moderate to weak. Six categories of interventions were identified: environmental unit changes (n=2), web-based support (n=4), discussion-based support (n=6), multicomponent support (n=4), participation in rounds (n=3) and participation in physical care (n=1). Clinical and methodological heterogeneity across studies hindered meta-analysis, hence a narrative synthesis was pursued. Six main outcomes were identified, grouped under two categories: (i) involvement outcomes: communication (mean difference ranged from 6.39 to 8.83), decision-making (mean difference ranged from -0.8 to 5.85), satisfaction (mean difference ranged from 0.15 to 2.48); and (ii) health outcomes: family trauma (mean difference ranged from -7.12 to 0.9), family well-being (mean difference ranged from -0.7 to -4), patient outcomes (relative risk ranged from 1.27 to 4.91). The findings from the qualitative studies were thematically analysed to identify features of the interventions that participants perceived to influence effectiveness. Synthesised into five overarching categories (practicality, development, interaction, reflexivity and bridging), these can serve as principles to inform the future design and development of more refined family member involvement interventions. CONCLUSIONS Future interventions should be developed with much closer family member input and designed by considering the key features we identified. We call for future interventions to be multilayered and allow for a greater or lesser level, and different kinds, of involvement for family members. Choice of intervention should be informed by a baseline diagnostic of family members' needs, readiness and preparedness for involvement.

One factor to control the breadth of T cell responses is the surface morphology of a peptide-MHC complex. Here, we present an in silico protocol for predicting peptide-MHC structure. A robust signature of a conformational transition was identified during all-atom molecular dynamics, which results in a model with high accuracy. A large test set was used in constructing our protocol and we went another step further using a blind test with a wild-type peptide and two highly immunogenic mutants, which predicted substantial conformational changes in both mutants. The center residues at position five of the analogs were configured to be accessible to solvent, forming a prominent surface, while the residue of the wild-type peptide was to point laterally toward the side of the binding cleft. We then experimentally determined the structures of the blind test set, using high resolution of X-ray crystallography, which verified predicted conformational changes. Our observation strongly supports a positive association of the surface morphology of a peptide-MHC complex to its immunogenicity. Our study offers the prospect of enhancing immunogenicity of vaccines by identifying MHC binding immunogens.","Park, Min-Sun; Park, Sung Yong; Miller, Keith R; Collins, Edward J; Lee, Ha Youn",Molecular immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2013.04.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23688437/,77

We investigated the clinical and chest computed tomography characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at the peak of the epidemic from multiple centres in China. METHODS We retrospectively analysed the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of 189 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to seven hospitals in four Chinese provinces from 18 January 2020 to 3 February 2020. RESULTS The mean patient age was 44 years and 52.9% were men; 186/189 had ≥1 co-existing medical condition. Fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, diarrhoea, and headache were common symptoms at onset; hypertension was the most common co-morbidity. Common clinical signs included dyspnoea, hypoxia, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, and neutropenia; most lesions exhibited subpleural distribution. The most common radiological manifestation was mixed ground-glass opacity with consolidation (mGGO-C); most patients had grid-like shadows and some showed paving stones. Patients with hypertension, dyspnoea, or hypoxia exhibited more severe lobe involvement and diffusely distributed lesions. Patients in severely affected areas exhibited higher body temperature; more fatigue and dyspnoea; and more manifestations of multiple lesions, lobe involvement, and mGGO-C. During the Wuhan lockdown period, cough, nausea, and dyspnoea were alleviated in patients with newly confirmed COVID-19; lobe involvement was also improved. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with COVID-19 hospitalised at the peak of the epidemic in China, fever, cough, and dyspnoea were the main symptoms at initial diagnosis, accompanied by lymphocytopenia and hypoxaemia. Patients with severe disease showed more severe lobe involvement and diffuse pulmonary lesion distribution.","Wang, Y; Luo, S; Zhou, C S; Wen, Z Q; Chen, W; Chen, W; Liao, W H; Liu, J; Yang, Y; Shi, J C; Liu, S D; Xia, F; Yan, Z H; Lu, X; Chen, T; Yan, F; Zhang, B; Zhang, D Y; Sun, Z Y",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj208725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32848097/,77

Here we characterize the neutralizing antibodies produced in two subjects who received combination immunizations against SARS-CoV-2, first with Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccine, followed 33 days later with a second dose (booster) shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Serum samples were collected 25 days following the primary vaccination and 13 days after the secondary Pfizer vaccination. Both subjects exhibited increased levels of isotype IgG and IgM antibodies directed against the entire spike protein following immunizations. These antibodies also exhibited increased reactivity with the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein and neutralized the infectivity of replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that contains the COVID-19 coronavirus S protein gene in place of its normal G glycoprotein. This VSV pseudovirus also contains the reporter gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Antibody titers against the spike protein and serum neutralization titers against the reporter virus are reported for the 2 heterologous vaccinated individuals and compared to a positive control derived from a convalescent patient and a negative control from an unexposed individual. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine increased antibody binding to the spike protein and RBD, and approached levels found in the convalescent positive control. Neutralizing antibodies against the VSV-S pseudovirus in the 2 subjects also approached levels in the convalescent sera. These results firmly validate the value of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in boosting immunity following initial Covishield inoculation.","Ostadgavahi, Ali Toloue; Booth, Ryan; Sisson, Gary; McMullen, Nichole; Warhuus, Michelle; Robertson, Peter; Miller, Matthew; Allen, Wanda C; El Sherif, May; Brownlie, Robert; Falzarano, Darryl; Richardson, Christopher D",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.15368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106888/,77

Consideration of disease progression, pattern of flares, level of functional impairment or disability, response to treatment, coexisting conditions such as cardiovascular disease or gastrointestinal disorders, and concomitant prescription medication use should be considered when creating a therapeutic plan for a patient with osteoarthritis. Although topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs historically have not been prevalent in many of the guidelines for osteoarthritis treatment, recent evidence-based medicine and new guidelines now support their use as a viable option for the clinician seeking alternatives to typical oral formulations.

83474,Response to a letter to the editor.,2019,"Increases in international travel and migratory flows have enabled infectious diseases to emerge and spread more rapidly than ever before. Hence, it is increasingly easy for local infectious diseases to become global infectious diseases (GIDs). National governments must be able to react quickly and effectively to GIDs, whether naturally occurring or intentionally instigated by bioterrorism. According to the World Health Organisation, global partnerships are necessary to gather the most up-to-date information and to mobilize resources to tackle GIDs when necessary. Communicable disease control also depends upon national public health laws and policies. The containment of an infectious disease typically involves detection, notification, quarantine and isolation of actual or suspected cases; the protection and monitoring of those not infected; and possibly even treatment. Some measures are clearly contentious and raise conflicts between individual and societal interests. In Europe national policies against infectious diseases are very heterogeneous. Some countries have a more communitarian approach to public health ethics, in which the interests of individual and society are more closely intertwined and interdependent, while others take a more liberal approach and give priority to individual freedoms in communicable disease control. This paper provides an overview of the different policies around communicable disease control that exist across a select number of countries across Europe. It then proposes ethical arguments to be considered in the making of public health laws, mostly concerning their effectiveness for public health protection.","Gainotti, Sabina; Moran, Nicola; Petrini, Carlo; Shickle, Darren",Bioethics,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00698.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18959729/,77

Lately, a new coronavirus causing pneumonia cases was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Soon after, the name of the virus was identified as the ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2"", and the World Health Organization named the disease coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). In our country, the first cases began to appear in the second week of March. In this study, we aimed to investigate the demographic characteristics and risk factors of patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19. A total of 100 patients (53 female and 47 male) were included in our study. The patients included in the study were randomly selected from the registration system and their information was evaluated retrospectively. The mean age of the patients was 54.42 (Age range= 20-90). When the risk factors for catching the disease were evaluated; it was determined that there was at least one risk factor in 46 patients; 30 patients had close contact with the COVID-19 patient in the social environment (30%) and 16 patients had a travel history outside the city in the last 14 days (16%). The most common symptoms in our patients were; cough (93%), fever (42%), dyspnea (22%), weakness (8%), sore throat (7%), diarrhea (6%), headache (5%) and sputum (2%). The most common comorbid conditions in our patients were detected as hypertension (42%), diabetes mellitus (DM) (21%), congestive heart failure (10%), allergic asthma (7%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6%), rheumatoid arthritis (3%), coronary artery disease (2%), solid organ tumour (2%), depression (1%) and epilepsy (1%). The mean age of our 15 patients who were monitored in intensive care unit was 65 y (± 11.46), the mean age of 85 patients followed in the service was 52.55 (± 16.35) and this difference was statistically significant (p= 0.006). When these two groups were compared in terms of comorbid diseases, the presence of DM was 40% higher (n= 6) in intensive care patients, and this difference was statistically significant (p= 0.05). In addition, the majority [11 patients (73%)] of the patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit were male (p= 0.03). When smoking was evaluated as a risk factor for serious illness, 4 of 11 patients (26%) in intensive care unit had a smoking history, while none of the patients who have died due to COVID-19 had a smoking history. These findings suggested to us that smoking does not increase the severity of COVID-19 disease. As a result, knowledge about the disease should be increased rapidly by sharing the studies on risk factors, transmission routes and clinical features of COVID-19 infection, which affects the whole world.","Günal, Özgür; Türe, Eda; Bayburtlu, Meryem; Arslan, Uğur; Demirağ, Mehmet Derya; Taşkın, Mehmet Hakan; Kılıç, Sırrı",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,https://doi.org/10.5578/mb.69811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33107286/,77
83773,Accessory extensor pollicis longus tendon in emergency surgery.,2020-07-01,"Cyclin-dependent 4/6 is a vital resistance pathway as it has a targetable treatment. According to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, as an expert opinion, primary endocrine resistance is defined as relapse while on the first 2 years of adjuvant endocrine treatment (ET), or progressive disease (PD) within first 6 months of first-line ET for advanced breast cancer (ABC), while on ET. This definition is based on endocrine monotherapy used in the adjuvant and metastatic process. It is obvious that the concept of primary endocrine resistance defined by ESMO for adjuvant is still applicable. However, the concept of primary endocrine resistance defined for metastatic disease is no longer viable. We think that a new concept such as ""primary ET + CDK 4/6 resistance"" should be defined. Because the progression-free survival achieved with monotherapies in metastatic disease does not exceed 12 months, this period has reached 27 months with ET + CDK 4/6 inhibitors. We think that the 6 months defined for primary endocrine resistance in patients with ABC during endocrine monotherapy is too short for patients receiving ET + CDK 4/6 inhibitor. Therefore, the concept of novel primary ET + CDK 4/6 inhibitor resistance should be created to be used in patients with ABC. The concept of ET + CDK 4/6 inhibitor resistance to be defined may be used in the stratification of clinical trials aimed at determining subsequent treatments in patients who progressed under ET + CDK 4/6 inhibitor.","Karacin, Cengiz; Ergun, Yakup; Oksuzoglu, Omur Berna",Medical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12032-020-01449-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411078/,77

The potential for healthcare infrastructure and broader context to support such initiatives in India has not been examined. We evaluated existing healthcare infrastructure to support digital health interventions and examined epidemiologic, socioeconomic, and geographical contextual correlates of healthcare infrastructure in 544 districts covering 29 states and union territories across India. METHODS The study was a cross-sectional analysis of India's Fourth District Level Household and Facility Survey (DLHS-4; 2012-2014), the most up-to-date nationally representative district-level healthcare infrastructure data. Facilities were the unit of analysis, and analyses accounted for clustering within states. The main outcome was healthcare system infrastructural context to implement hypertension management programs. Domains included diagnostics (functional BP instrument), medications (anti-hypertensive medication in stock), essential clinical staff (e.g., staff nurse, medical officer, pharmacist), and IT specific infrastructure (regular power supply, internet connection, computer availability). Descriptive analysis was conducted for infrastructure indicators based on the Indian Public Health Standards, and logistic regression was conducted to estimate the association between epidemiologic and geographical context (exposures) and the composite measure of healthcare system. RESULTS Data from 32,215 government facilities were analyzed. Among lowest-tier subcenters, 30% had some IT infrastructure, while at the highest-tier district hospitals, 92% possessed IT infrastructure. At mid-tier primary health centres and community health centres, IT infrastructure availability was 28 and 51%, respectively. For all but sub-centres, the availability of essential staff was lower than the availability of IT infrastructure. For all but district hospitals, higher levels of blood pressure, body mass index, and urban residents were correlated with more favorable infrastructure. By region, districts in Western India tended towards having the best prepared health facilities. CONCLUSIONS IT infrastructure to support digital health interventions is more frequently lacking at lower and mid-tier healthcare facilities compared with apex facilities in India. Gaps were generally larger for staffing than physical infrastructure, suggesting that beyond IT infrastructure, shortages in essential staff impose significant constraints to the adoption of digital health interventions. These data provide early benchmarks for state- and district-level planning.","Patel, Shivani A; Vashist, Kushagra; Jarhyan, Prashant; Sharma, Hanspria; Gupta, Priti; Jindal, Devraj; Venkateshmurthy, Nikhil Srinivasapura; Pfadenhauer, Lisa; Mohan, Sailesh; Tandon, Nikhil",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06999-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34654431/,77

84243,Error in Figure.,2021-03-15,"BACKGROUND We report mortality and post-operative complications from esophageal resection in the treatment of gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma or stricture, comparing a minimally invasive abdomen-only esophagectomy (MIAE) approach with a minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (MIILE) approach. METHODS A single-center retrospective cohort study of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma or stricture treated by either MIAE or MIILE was conducted. MIAE was offered for strictures less than five centimeters or cancers that were American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage ≤ T2 without lymphadenopathy. Patients treated with these surgical techniques were analyzed to assess pre-operative risk, intra and post-operative variables, adverse events, and overall survival. RESULTS This study included 17 patients undergoing MIAE and 32 patients treated with MIILE. There were a fewer median number of lymph nodes resected (p < 0.001) and shorter operative duration (p < 0.001) for MIAE compared to MIILE. MIAE patients also had significantly higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores and ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) surgical risk values than MIILE patients (p < 0.05). There was no difference in median estimated blood loss, length of stay, pulmonary or cardiac complications between groups. There was no significant difference in 90-day survival. CONCLUSION A minimally invasive abdomen-only approach in a specific patient population is comparable in safety to a minimally invasive Ivor Lewis approach, with associated shorter median operative duration. MIAE patients had significantly greater pre-operative comorbidities and higher calculated peri-operative risk of complication but demonstrated similar post-operative outcomes. This suggests that MIAE may be a suitable surgical approach for treating gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma or stricture in patients deemed unsuitable for MIILE.","Wang, Christopher P; Rogers, Michael P; Bach, Gregory; Sujka, Joseph; Mhaskar, Rahul; DuCoin, Christopher",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08468-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33825009/,77

AIM To evaluate ustekinumab trough concentrations and clinical response with exclusive subcutaneous ustekinumab induction. METHODS Patients with Crohn's disease who initiated treatment with subcutaneous ustekinumab at a single academic centre were included in this pilot study. A dosage of 360 mg ustekinumab was given subcutaneously in divided doses; 180 mg at Week 0, 90 mg at Week 1 and 90 mg at Week 2, with corresponding ustekinumab trough concentrations assessed to Week 8. The primary outcome measures were trough serum ustekinumab levels and clinical remission at Week 8. Secondary outcome measures were trough serum ustekinumab levels at Week 1 & 2 and changes in C-reactive protein, albumin and faecal calprotectin at Week 8. RESULTS Nineteen patients were included. Median Week 8 ustekinumab trough concentrations were 6.1 μg/mL (Inter-quartile range 4-9.8 μg/mL). There was a significant improvement in Harvey Bradshaw index from Week 0 (median HBI 5; interquartile range 2-8) to Week 8 (median HBI 1; interquartile range 0-3) (P = 0.002). C-reactive protein levels did not change significantly but faecal calprotectin improved significantly; median faecal calprotectin at Week 0 was 533 μg/g; at Week 8, it was 278 μg/g (P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS Ustekinumab trough concentrations are comparable whether ustekinumab induction treatment was administered subcutaneously or intravenously. A significant improvement in symptoms and faecal calprotectin was noted. These results support the use of subcutaneous induction as an alternative if there are barriers to intravenous induction.","Rowan, C R; Keegan, D; Byrne, K; Cullen, G; Mulcahy, H E; Sheridan, J; Ryan, E J; de Vries, A; D'Haens, G; Doherty, G A",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.14834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920697/,77

In Study 1 (180 university students, 66% female) participants read summaries describing evidence for sexual orientation existing on a continuum versus discrete categories or a control manipulation, and in Study 2 (460 participants in a nationally representative Qualtrics panel, 50% female) additionally read summaries describing sexual orientation as fluid versus stable across the life-course. After reading summaries, participants answered various questions about their sexual orientation. In Study 1, political moderates and progressives (but not conservatives) who read the continuous manipulation subsequently reported being less exclusively heterosexual, and regardless of political alignment, participants reported less certainty about their sexual orientation, relative to controls. In Study 2, after exposure to fluid or continuous manipulations heterosexual participants were up to five times more likely than controls to rate themselves as non-exclusively heterosexual. Additionally, those in the continuous condition reported less certainty about their sexual orientation and were more willing to engage in future same-sex sexual experiences, than those in the control condition. These results suggest that non-traditional theories of sexual orientation can lead heterosexuals to embrace less exclusive heterosexual orientations.","Morandini, James S; Dacosta, Liam; Dar-Nimrod, Ilan",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94479-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400657/,77

We report our ten-year experience of empiric transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for patients with massive or recurrent GIB. Methods All patients who had undergone empiric TAE at our hospital between March 2004 and June 2015 were identified using the institutional radiology information system. A retrospective chart review was performed using a structured pro forma. Technical success rate, 30-day clinical success rate, 30-day mortality rate, and rate of procedural complications were computed. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Results A total of 32 patients had undergone empiric TAE for GIB during the study period. The median age of subjects was 56 years and two-thirds of them were male (68.7%). Gastroduodenal (n=24), ileocolic (n=3), left gastric (n=2), right gastroepiploic (n=1), and branches of superior and middle rectal arteries (n=1) were embolized using microcoils (n=25), polyvinyl alcohol particles (n=25), and gelatin sponge (n=3)--either alone or in combination. Technical and 30-day clinical success rates were 96.9% (31/32) and 71.9% (23/32), respectively. The 30-day mortality rate for our cohort was 21.9% (7/32). One patient developed re-bleeding at two days after the initial procedure and required repeat embolization. Coil migration (n=3) and access site hematoma (n=1) were the observed procedural complications. Conclusion Empiric TAE can be a useful treatment option for selected patients with massive or recurrent GIB that is not amenable to endoscopic therapy.","Muhammad, Azeemuddin; Awais, Muhammad; Sayani, Raza; Saeed, Muhammad Anwar; Qamar, Saqib; Rehman, Abdul; Baloch, Noor U",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.4228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123650/,77

Despite initial focus on the elderly population with comorbidities, it seems that large studies from the worst affected countries follow a sex-disaggregation pattern. Analysis of available data showed marked variations in reported cases between males and females among different countries with higher mortality in males. At this early stage of the pandemic, medical datasets at the individual level are not available; therefore, it is challenging to conclude how different factors have impacted COVID-19 susceptibility. Thus, in the absence of patients' level data, we attempted to provide a theoretical description of how other determinants have affected COVID-19 susceptibility in males compared to females. In this article, we have identified and discussed possible biological and behavioral factors that could be responsible for the increased male susceptibility. Biological factors include - an absence of X-chromosomes (a powerhouse for immune-related genes), a high level of testosterone that inhibits antibody production, and the presence of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that facilitate viral replication. Similarly, behavioral factors constitute - higher smoking and alcohol consumptions, low level of handwashing practices, and high-risk behavior like non-adherence to health services and reluctance to follow public health measures in males.

85569,"Academic Neurology Departments: Structure, Diversity and Financial Pressures in 2019 vs 2002.",2021-01-27,"Social media poses a threat to public health by facilitating the spread of misinformation. At the same time, however, social media offers a promising avenue to stem the distribution of false claims - as evidenced by real-time corrections, crowdsourced fact-checking, and algorithmic tagging. Despite the growing attempts to correct misinformation on social media, there is still considerable ambiguity regarding the ability to effectively ameliorate the negative impact of false messages. To address this gap, the current study uses a meta-analysis to evaluate the relative impact of social media interventions designed to correct health-related misinformation (k = 24; N = 6,086). Additionally, the meta-analysis introduces theory-driven moderators that help delineate the effectiveness of social media interventions. The mean effect size of attempts to correct misinformation on social media was positive and significant (d = 0.40, 95% CI [0.25, 0.55], p =.0005) and a publication bias could not be excluded. Interventions were more effective in cases where participants were involved with the health topic, as well as when misinformation was distributed by news organizations (vs. peers) and debunked by experts (vs. non-experts). The findings of this meta-analysis can be used not only to depict the current state of the literature but also to prescribe specific recommendations to better address the proliferation of health misinformation on social media.","Walter, Nathan; Brooks, John J; Saucier, Camille J; Suresh, Sapna",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1794553; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32762260/,77

METHODS The English versions of the instruments were translated into Finnish and back-translated. Thereafter, OES-Fi and PIDAQ-Fi were established in a pilot study. The factorial validity was estimated using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFI, TLI, SRMR) in independent samples (Test and Validation samples). The measurement invariance of the factorial models was tested using multigroup analysis (ΔCFI). Convergent validity [Average Variance Extracted (AVE)] and reliability [Composite Reliability (CR) and α] were estimated. RESULTS A total of 3636 individuals [mean age = 32.0 (SD = 11.6) years, 75% women] participated in the study. After refinements, the factorial model of the instruments showed an adequate fit to the data (CFI ≥0.94, TLI ≥0.90, SRMR ≤0.07) and showed measurement invariance in two independent samples (|ΔCFI| <0.01). Convergent validity (AVE = 0.54-0.82) and reliability (α = 0.86-0.94) were adequate. CONCLUSION The data obtained using OES-Fi and PIDAQ-Fi were valid and reliable. Thus, these instruments could be useful for evaluating individual satisfaction with orofacial appearance and the psychosocial impact of dental aesthetics in a clinical or research setting.","Campos, Lucas Arrais; Kämäräinen, Minna; Silvola, Anna-Sofia; Marôco, João; Peltomäki, Timo; Campos, Juliana Alvares Duarte Bonini",Acta odontologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1080/00016357.2020.1857435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33370538/,77

The use of biological mesh has become an important adjunct in successful abdominal wall reconstruction. There are a variety of biological mesh products available; however, there is limited evidence supporting the use of one type over another. This study aims to compare the performance (eg, the rate of hernia recurrence) of either a crosslinked biological mesh product or a non-crosslinked product in patients undergoing abdominal wall reconstruction. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This is a single-centre, dual arm randomised controlled trial. Patients requiring abdominal wall reconstruction will be assessed for eligibility. Eligible patients will then undergo an informed consent process following by randomisation to either (1) crosslinked porcine dermis mesh (Permacol); or (2) non-crosslinked porcine dermis mesh (Strattice). These groups will be compared for the rate of hernia recurrence at 1 and 2 years as well as the rate of postoperative complications (eg, surgical site infections). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study has been approved by the institution's research ethics board and registered with clinicaltrials.gov. All eligible participants will provide informed consent prior to randomization. The results of this study may help guide the choice of biologic mesh for this population. The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals as well as national and international conferences.

This study evaluates the impact of this approach on GI recovery in low to moderate risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. IRB approved randomized controlled trial in low to moderate risk adults scheduled for major surgery. Patients were randomized to standard (n = 20) or GDT (n = 18) groups, whose fluids were managed to maintain stroke volume variation (SVV) <12 %. The primary outcome measure was GI recovery. Additional measures included quality of recovery score. Continuous, non-normally distributed by Mann-Whitney test; ordinal and nominal by Chi square analysis. GDT patients had lower average intraoperative SVV. The GDT group had faster return of GI function (p = 0.004) and higher quality of recovery scores. In low to moderate risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, intraoperative GDT guided by SVV optimization was associated with faster restoration of GI recovery and higher quality of recovery scores. These results suggest that outcome benefits related to the use of an intraoperative goal directed fluid protocol guided by SVV are not limited to high-risk patients.","Ramsingh, Davinder S; Sanghvi, Chirag; Gamboa, Joseph; Cannesson, Maxime; Applegate, Richard L",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-012-9422-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23264068/,77
87005,Reply to Letter to the Editor.,2015,"PURPOSE The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO2) measurements with the INVOS-5100-C and the ForeSight-Elite cerebral oximeters vary in their correlation with mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) upon changes in systemic oxygenation in extubated cardiac surgical patients. Additionally, we aimed to elucidate whether the ScO2 measurements of both devices can be used interchangeably to detect reduced SvO2. METHODS Forty-eight spontaneously breathing patients extubated after cardiac surgery were included in this prospective observational study. The patients were exposed to both high (10 oxygen L·min-1 via face mask) and low (room air) inspiratory oxygen concentrations. Bi-hemispherical ScO2 was determined with the INVOS and ForeSight Elite cerebral oximeters. The SvO2 was measured with a pulmonary artery catheter. RESULTS Significant changes in oxygen delivery, ScO2 (by both cerebral oximeters), and SvO2 were observed upon variation of oxygenation. The minimum mean (standard deviation) ScO2 (ScO2min) using the INVOS and ForeSight did not differ significantly during high oxygen delivery [63.1 (8.6) % vs 65.8 (4.7) %, respectively; P = 0.07], but during low oxygen delivery, the INVOS value was significantly lower than that of the ForeSight oximeter [56.7 (8.9) % vs 61.3 (4.4) %, respectively; P = 0.003]. Both devices differed in the correlation between ScO2min and SvO2 for the combined oxygenation data (0.59, INVOS vs 0.28, ForeSight; correlation difference, 0.31; Bonferroni-adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08 to 0.54; P = 0.008). The receiver-operating curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.9; P = 0.005) for detecting an SvO2 below 50% by ScO2min with the INVOS and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.41 to 0.62; P = 0.92), respectively, with the ForeSight. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that the cerebral oximeters tested react differently to variations in systemic oxygenation and in their relationship with SvO2 and thus give different information on cardiopulmonary function. These findings raise doubt about whether these devices should be used interchangeably.","Schmidt, Christian; Heringlake, Matthias; Kellner, Patrick; Berggreen, Astrid Ellen; Maurer, Holger; Brandt, Sebastian; Bucsky, Bence; Petersen, Michael; Charitos, Efstratios I",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-018-1093-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29484605/,77

Herein, sol-gel-based materials are applied to screen-selective aptamers for small molecules, such as pesticides. To enhance the efficiency of aptamer screening using a sol-gel, it is necessary to increase the binding surface. In this study, we applied the sol-gel to an anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane, and the morphological features were observed via electron microscopy after spin coating. The binding and elution processes were conducted and confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and polymerase chain reaction. The sol-gel coating on the AAO membrane formed a hollow nanocolumn structure. A diazinon-binding aptamer was bound to the diazinon-containing sol-gel-coated AAO membrane, and the bound aptamer was effectively retrieved from the sol-gel matrix by thermal elution. As a proof of concept, a sol-gel-coated AAO disc was mounted on the edge of a pipette tip, and the feasibility of the prepared platform for the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) of the aptamer binding was also confirmed. The proposed approach will be applied to an automated SELEX cycle using an automated dispenser, such as a pipetting robot, in the near future.","Lim, Eun Seob; Lim, Min-Cheol; Park, Kisang; Lee, Gaeul; Lim, Jeong-A; Woo, Min-Ah; Lee, Nari; Choi, Sung-Wook; Chang, Hyun-Joo",Nanomaterials,https://doi.org/10.3390/nano10081533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764256/,77

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) exert antibacterial activity in vitro and in acute bacterial infection models, but their activity in chronic infection with biofilm models has not been previously investigated. Therefore, we studied the effects of MSC administration in mouse and dog models of chronic infections associated with biofilms. Mice with chronic Staphylococcus aureus implant infections were treated by i.v. administration of activated or non-activated MSC, with or without antibiotic therapy. The most effective treatment protocol was identified as activated MSC co-administered with antibiotic therapy. Activated MSC were found to accumulate in the wound margins several days after i.v. administration. Macrophages in infected tissues assumed an M2 phenotype, compared to untreated infections which contained predominately M1 macrophages. Bacterial killing by MSC was found to be mediated in part by secretion of cathelicidin and was significantly increased by antibiotics. Studies in pet dogs with spontaneous chronic multi drug-resistant wound infections demonstrated clearance of bacteria and wound healing following repeated i.v. administration of activated allogeneic canine MSC. Thus, systemic therapy with activated MSC may be an effective new, non-antimicrobial approach to treatment of chronic, drug-resistant infections.","Johnson, Valerie; Webb, Tracy; Norman, Annalis; Coy, Jonathan; Kurihara, Jade; Regan, Daniel; Dow, Steven",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-08311-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28851894/,77

Although azoles are present throughout the natural environment, their interactions with NP are not well known. We investigated the effects of polystyrene (PS) NP on the toxicity of ketoconazole (KCZ) and fluconazole (FCZ) in zebrafish embryos using the developmental toxicity, oxidative-stress-related biochemical parameters, and expression of genes related to neurotoxicity (ache), cardiotoxicity (gata4, bmp4), inflammation (il1b), oxidative stress (sod1, sod2, cyp1a), and apoptosis (bax, bcl2). Co-exposure to NP (1 mg/L) and KCZ/FCZ (1 mg/L) for 96 h reduced the hatching rate, survival rate, and heart rate and increased the malformation rate and catalase activity. The bax/bcl2 ratio, an apoptosis indicator, was higher after NP, KCZ, or FCZ treatment. However, the bax/bcl2 ratio after exposure to NP + KCZ or NP + FCZ was much higher than that after single exposure. Overall, the results indicated that NP aggravated the toxicity of azole by significantly increasing the reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and altering the expression of oxidative-stress- and apoptosis-related genes. The interactive toxicity of PS NP with KCZ/FCZ reported in this study emphasises the need for caution in the release of azole fungicides in the environment.","Bhagat, Jacky; Zang, Liqing; Nakayama, Hiroko; Nishimura, Norihiro; Shimada, Yasuhito",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399343/,77

88119,2021 AMSSM Research Podium Presentations.,2021-03-01,"OBJECTIVE To assess surgical, oncologic, and pregnancy outcomes in patients undergoing radical vaginal, abdominal, or laparoscopic trachelectomy for the treatment of early-stage cervical cancer, using a methodic review of published literature. DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library sources, including ClinicalTrials.gov, were searched from 1990-2019 with terms ""cervical cancer"" and ""(vaginal, abdominal, open, minimally invasive, or laparoscopic) radical trachelectomy."" Grey literature and unpublished data were omitted. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION After removal of duplicates from a combined EndNote library of results, 490 articles were reviewed using Covidence software. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts, and then screened full texts. Selection criteria included articles that reported radical trachelectomy with lymph node assessment as primary therapy for cervical carcinoma, with stated follow-up intervals and recurrences. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS Variables of interest were manually extracted into an electronic database. A total 47 articles that reported on 2,566 women met inclusion criteria. Most tumors were of squamous histology (68.5%), stage IB1 (74.8%), 2 cm or less (69.2%), and without lymphovascular invasion (68.8%). Of planned trachelectomies, 9% were converted intraoperatively to hysterectomy. Separated by route of trachelectomy, 58.1%, 37.2%, and 4.7% were performed using radical vaginal, abdominal, and laparoscopic approaches, respectively. With median follow-up of 48 months (range 2-202 months) across studies, median recurrence rate was 3.3% (range 0-25%); median time to recurrence was 26 months (range 8-44 months). Median 5-year recurrence-free and overall survival were 94.6% (range 88-97.3%) and 97.4% (range 95-99%), respectively. The posttrachelectomy pregnancy rate was 23.9%, with a live-birth rate of 75.1%. CONCLUSION Radical trachelectomy for fertility-preserving treatment of cervical cancer is widely reported in the literature, though publications are mainly limited to case reports and case series. Reported follow-up periods infrequently meet standard oncologic parameters but show encouraging recurrence-free and overall survival rates and pregnancy outcomes. Higher-level evidence needed for meta-analysis is lacking.

88881,e-Bug health educator training.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND As treatments continue to progress, patients with advanced cancer are living longer. However, ongoing physical side-effects and psychosocial concerns can compromise quality of life (QoL). Patients and physicians increasingly look to the internet and other technologies to address diverse supportive needs encountered across this evolving cancer trajectory. OBJECTIVES 1. To examine the features and delivery of web and technological interventions supporting patients with advanced cancer. 2. To explore their efficacy relating to QoL and psychosocial well-being. METHODS Relevant studies were identified through electronic database searches (MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Web of Science and ProQuest) and handsearching. Findings were collated and explored through narrative synthesis. RESULTS Of 5274 identified records, 37 articles were included. Interventions were evaluated within studies targeting advanced cancer (13) or encompassing all stages (24). Five subtypes emerged: Interactive Health Communication Applications (n=12), virtual programmes of support (n=11), symptom monitoring tools (n=8), communication conduits (n=3) and information websites (n=3). Modes of delivery ranged from self-management to clinically integrated. Support largely targeted psychosocial well-being, alongside symptom management and healthy living. Most studies (78%) evidenced varying degrees of efficacy through QoL and psychosocial measures. Intervention complexity made it challenging to distinguish the most effective components. Incomplete reporting limited risk of bias assessment. CONCLUSION While complex and varied in their content, features and delivery, most interventions led to improvements in QoL or psychosocial well-being across the cancer trajectory. Ongoing development and evaluation of such innovations should specifically target patients requiring longer-term support for later-stage cancer.

To remove ultraviolet divergences we include counterterms quadratic and cubic in the Riemann curvature tensor. The two-loop numerical unitarity approach is used to deal with the challenging momentum dependence of the interactions. We exploit the algebraic properties of the integrand of the amplitude in order to reduce it to a minimal basis of Feynman integrals. Analytic expressions are obtained from numerical evaluations of the amplitude. Finally, we show that four-graviton scattering observables depend on fewer couplings than naïvely expected.","Abreu, S; Febres Cordero, F; Ita, H; Jaquier, M; Page, B; Ruf, M S; Sotnikov, V",Physical review letters,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.211601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530699/,77

89087,Immune-Driven Pathogenesis of Neurotoxicity after Exposure of Cancer Patients to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.,2020-08-11,"INTRODUCTION The use of checkpoint blockade therapy (CBT) has shown impressive results for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). The impact of CBT depends on the reversal of an exhausted T-cell immune phenotype and a consequential increase in the immunological, anti-tumor effect derived from a patient's adaptive immunity. As most patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma will relapse during or after this treatment, clinicians often provide consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is fit patients. However, the mechanisms responsible for CBT efficacy can also be those that increase the risk of immunological complications after alloHCT. AREAS COVERED We carried out in-depth research on current medical literature to report and discuss the mechanism of action of CBT within a cHL setting; clinical results of CBT in cHL setting pre-alloHCT and post-alloHCT; interactions between CBT and alloHCT; and further clinical considerations. EXPERT OPINION Checkpoint blockade therapy is an effective strategy for relapsed/refractory cHL. Its use is associated with higher immunological toxicities when administered before or after alloHCT. Whenever alloHCT is planned, clinicians should follow international recommendations such as using post-transplant cyclophosphamide GVHD prophylaxis.","Mussetti, Alberto; Bosch Vilaseca, Anna; Parody, Rocío; Paviglianiti, Annalisa; Domingo-Domenech, Eva; Sureda, Ana Maria",Expert review of hematology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17474086.2021.1965874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369849/,77
89220,Limb and back muscle activity adaptations to tripedal locomotion in dogs.,2015,"Due to the present drought events and dynamics of vegetation, the circumstances in mainland China could become even more serious. Therefore, we study the impact of drought on vegetation trends in mainland China, with the aim of discovering the temporal and spatial differences in vegetation dynamics caused by seasonal drought. Our method is based on the use of data from the AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 1983 to 2016 and temperature and precipitation data from Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (NASA's MERRA). Due to the sparse vegetation and low drought, NDVI is the most useful for describing drought conditions in mainland China. The NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, VCI, TVDI, and NAP from April to October increased rapidly, while the NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, NAP, TVDI, and VCI are stable every month in September, improve again in October, and then show in December a downward trend. The NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, NAP, TVDI, and VCI monthly values indicate that mainland China suffered from severe drought in 1984 and 1993, which lasted until 2007, which were the most drought years. For monitoring drought in mainland China, the NDVI, TVDI, NAP, VCI, and NVSWI values were selected as a tool for reporting drought events during different growing seasons. The seasonal values of TVDI, NDVI, NAP, NVSWI, and VCI confirmed that mainland China suffered from severe drought in 1984, 1993, and 2007 and led the durations of severe drought. Spatial correlation is generated between NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, NAP, TVDI, and VCI. The correlation between NDVI, TCI, VHI, NAP, and VCI showed a significantly positive correlation while significantly negative correlation between NVSWI and TVDI, TVDI and VHI, which showed a good indication for the assessment of drought, especially for the agricultural regions of mainland China. This shows that the positive sign to support NAP, NVSWI, and TVDI is a good monitoring of the drought indices. During the summer, it appears that compared to the southeastern part of mainland China, drought is more likely to occur in the northwestern areas. There is no doubt that these drought indices are comprehensive indicators of monitoring drought events in mainland China.","Ali, Shahzad; Haixing, Zhang; Qi, Ma; Liang, Sun; Ning, Jiang; Jia, Qianmin; Hou, Fujiang",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12146-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411304/,77

Procalcitonin (PCT) is classically used as a diagnostic marker in bacterial infections, but its role in predicting Covid-19 disease severity is emerging. We aimed to identify the association between PCT and Covid-19 disease severity in a critical care setting and whether bacterial co-infection is implicated.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed Covid-19 patients with PCT levels measured in a critical care setting at our institution between February and September 2020. Laboratory markers including peak PCT values and a range of bacterial culture results were analysed. Outcomes were the requirement and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation as well as inpatient mortality.ResultsIn total, 60 patients were included; 68% required invasive mechanical ventilation and 45% died as inpatient. Univariate analysis identified higher peak PCT levels significantly associated with both the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-9.0, p=0.02) and inpatient mortality (OR: 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.6, p=0.03). Higher peak PCT levels was an independent predictor of mortality on multivariate analysis (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.1-12.4, p=0.03). There was a significant positive correlation between increased peak PCT levels and duration on invasive mechanical ventilation. No significant difference was found between peak PCT levels of patients with positive and negative bacterial cultures. ConclusionsElevated PCT levels in Covid-19 patients are associated with respiratory failure requiring prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation and inpatient mortality. This association may be independent of bacterial co-infection.","Heer, Randeep S; Mandal, Amit K J; Kho, Jason; Szawarski, Piotr; Csabi, Peter; Grenshaw, Dawn; Walker, Ian A L; Missouris, Constantinos G",Annals of clinical biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00045632211022380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34018843/,77

Thus, we assessed occurrence and effects of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on patients on the Swiss national waiting list for solid organ transplantation. METHODS Patient data were retrospectively extracted from the Swiss Organ Allocation System (SOAS). From 16 March to 31 May 2020, we included all patients listed for solid organ transplantation on the Swiss national waiting list who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Severity of COVID-19 was categorised as follows: stage I, mild symptoms; stage II, moderate to severe symptoms; stage III, critical symptoms; stage IV, death. We compared the incidence rate (laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2), the hospital admission rate (number of admissions of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals), and the case fatality rate (number of deaths of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals) in our study population with the general Swiss population during the study period, calculating age-adjusted standardised incidence ratios and standardised mortality ratios, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS A total of 1439 patients were registered on the Swiss national solid organ transplantation waiting list on 31 May 31 2020. Twenty-four (1.7%) waiting list patients were reported to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the study period. The median age was 56 years (interquartile range 45.3–65.8), and 14 (58%) were male. Of all patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, two patients were asymptomatic, 14 (58%) presented in COVID-19 stage I, 3 (13%) in stage II, and 5 (21%) in stage III. Eight patients (33%) were admitted to hospital, four (17%) required intensive care, and three (13%) mechanical ventilation. Twenty-two patients (92%) of all those infected recovered, but two male patients aged >65 years with multiple comorbidities died in hospital from respiratory failure. Comparing our study population with the general Swiss population, the age-adjusted standardised incidence ratio was 4.1 (95% CI 2.7–6.0). CONCLUSION The overall rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in candidates awaiting solid organ transplantation was four times higher than in the Swiss general population; however, the frequency of testing likely played a role. Given the small sample size of affected patients, conclusions have to be drawn cautiously and results need verification in larger cohorts.","Benden, Christian; Haile, Sarah; Kruegel, Nathalie; Beyeler, Franziska; Aubert, John-David; Binet, Isabelle; Golshayan, Déla; Hadaya, Karine; Mueller, Thomas; Parvex, Paloma; Immer, Franz",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33382903/,77

This paper presents the results of two studies investigating the effectiveness of chemical preservation on ng/L concentrations of Cr(VI) in groundwater. Chemically preserved and unpreserved aliquots of a groundwater sample were spiked with a known amount of Cr(VI), then analyzed in tandem with sets of preserved and unpreserved performance test samples over 28 days. The studies showed that while Cr(VI) appears to be relatively stable over 28 days, it may be sensitive to minor matrix changes after collection. The studies also demonstrated significant challenges to measuring Cr(VI) below 100 ng/L, as the results can be subject to positive bias or contamination that may not be readily apparent. The authors concluded that Cr(VI) measurements using a US EPA published method below 100 ng/L may be categorized as semi-quantitative at best. This article is protected by copyright.

93452,Error in Figure.,2016,"INTRODUCTION There has been a decade-long federal commitment to prevent and end homelessness among U.S. military veterans. Substantial progress has been made; so, a question that stakeholders ask is: Is veteran homelessness still a problem? METHODS To answer this question, 2 different data sources were analyzed in 2020: (1) a nationally representative community survey of 4,069 veterans conducted in 2019 and (2) national administrative data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on >6 million healthcare and homeless services in 2019. RESULTS In the community sample, the lifetime prevalence of adult homelessness was 10.2%, with the highest prevalence found in participants aged 30-44 years (19.9% prevalence). In the Veterans Affairs administrative data, 4.2% of all Veterans Affairs service users used homeless services (n=290,515 Veterans Affairs homeless services); 27.9% of these were first-time Veterans Affairs homeless service users. Veterans who were racial/ethnic minorities were more likely to report any lifetime adult homelessness, more likely to be identified as homeless in Veterans Affairs records, and more likely to have used any Veterans Affairs homeless program. There was no sex difference in the lifetime prevalence of homelessness, but Veterans Affairs records showed that male veterans were more likely to be identified as homeless and to use homeless programs, suggesting possible underidentification of female veteran homelessness. Across age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups, 35.1% of Veterans Affairs homeless service users used emergency department services in the same year. CONCLUSIONS There is a continued need to dedicate resources to address veteran homelessness across sociodemographic groups, and these data serve as a benchmark before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tsai, Jack; Pietrzak, Robert H; Szymkowiak, Dorota",American journal of preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.12.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33583678/,77

As of April 27, 2020, provinces and territories provided the Public Health Agency of Canada with detailed information on 24,079 cases, of which 3.9% (n=938) were younger than 20 years of age. The detection rate per 100,000 population was lower in this age group (11.9 per 100,000), compared with those aged 20-59 years (72.4 per 100,000) and 60 and older (113.6 per 100,000). The median age among those younger than 20 years of age was 13 years, and cases were distributed equally across male and female genders. Among provinces and territories with more than 100 cases, 1.6% to 9.8% of cases were younger than 20 years of age. Cases in this age group were more likely to be asymptomatic: 10.7% compared with 2.4% in those aged 20-59 years and 4.1% in those aged 60 and older. Children and youth experienced severe outcomes less often, but 2.2% (n=15/672) of cases within this age group were severe enough to require hospitalization.

93851,Wide complex tachycardia with intermittent narrow beats: What is the mechanism?,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND Perioperative myocardial infarction/injury (PMI) diagnosed by high-sensitivity troponin (hs-cTn) T is frequent and a prognostically important complication of non-cardiac surgery. We aimed to evaluate the incidence and outcome of PMI diagnosed using hs-cTnI, and compare it to PMI diagnosed using hs-cTnT. METHODS We prospectively included 2455 patients at high cardiovascular risk undergoing 3111 non-cardiac surgeries, for whom hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT concentrations were measured before surgery and on postoperative days 1 and 2. PMI was defined as a composite of perioperative myocardial infarction (PMIInfarct) and perioperative myocardial injury (PMIInjury), according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. All-cause mortality was the primary endpoint. RESULTS Using hs-cTnI, the incidence of overall PMI was 9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8-10%), including PMIInfarct 2.6% (95% CI 2.0-3.2) and PMIInjury 6.1% (95% CI 5.3-6.9%), which was lower versus using hs-cTnT: overall PMI 15% (95% CI 14-16%), PMIInfarct 3.7% (95% CI 3.0-4.4) and PMIInjury 11.3% (95% CI 10.2-12.4%). All-cause mortality occurred in 52 (2%) patients within 30 days and 217 (9%) within 1 year. Using hs-cTnI, both PMIInfarct and PMIInjury were independent predictors of 30-day all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.5 [95% CI 1.1-6.0], and aHR 2.8 [95% CI 1.4-5.5], respectively) and, 1-year all-cause mortality (aHR 2.0 [95% CI 1.2-3.3], and aHR 1.8 [95% CI 1.2-2.7], respectively). Overall, the prognostic impact of PMI diagnosed by hs-cTnI was comparable to the prognostic impact of PMI using hs-cTnT. CONCLUSIONS Using hs-cTnI, PMI is less common versus using hs-cTnT. Using hs-cTnI, both PMIInfarct and PMIInjury remain independent predictors of 30-day and 1-year mortality.","Gualandro, Danielle M; Puelacher, Christian; Lurati Buse, Giovanna; Glarner, Noemi; Cardozo, Francisco A; Vogt, Ronja; Hidvegi, Reka; Strunz, Celia; Bolliger, Daniel; Gueckel, Johanna; Yu, Pai C; Liffert, Marcel; Arslani, Ketina; Prepoudis, Alexandra; Calderaro, Daniela; Hammerer-Lercher, Angelika; Lampart, Andreas; Steiner, Luzius A; Schären, Stefan; Kindler, Christoph; Guerke, Lorenz; Osswald, Stefan; Devereaux, P J; Caramelli, Bruno; Mueller, Christian",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-021-01827-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33768367/,77

94757,Lichenoid drug reaction to antituberculosis drugs treated through with topical steroids and phototherapy.,2012,"INTRODUCTION We established Zambia's first neurology residency program at the University of Zambia School of Medicine and the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka. We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of a modified Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) to assess clinical skills. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The neurology training program's three participants completed the OSCE exercise in February 2019. We used smartphones to videotape trainees performing a physical examination and oral presentation in the neurology clinic. Trainees and faculty reviewed the videos independently using a standardized rubric and then met for in-person feedback. ASSESSMENT & OUTCOMES Three trainees completed pre- and post-OSCE surveys rating their confidence in elements of the history and examination. Trainees' average self-confidence scores improved from the pre- to post-OSCE survey in every category (pre-OSCE: mean score 6.84, range 4.8-7.8, SD 0.92; post-OSCE: mean score 7.9, range 5.67-9.33, SD 0.86). Qualitative feedback showed trainees found the OSCE helpful, routinely applied feedback, and would appreciate repeating OSCEs. LESSONS LEARNED OSCEs improve trainees' self-confidence and can be modified and successfully implemented in a resource-limited neurology post-graduate training program. Important OSCE modifications involved using smartphones for videotaping and a real patient encounter rather than a standardized patient. Additionally, embedding the experience within a busy clinic day was practical, applicable, and efficient. FUTURE DIRECTIONS Future work should expand use of OSCEs both within the Zambian neurology residency program and non-neurology training programs. Including additional video reviewers could add to the validity of clinical skills assessment. Videos could also be used for remote mentorship and teaching purposes.","DiBiase, Rebecca Marie; Salas, Rachel Marie E; Gamaldo, Charlene E; Nutakki, Aparna; Elicer, Isabel; Attarian, Hrayr P; Kapembwa, Kenneth C; Strowd, Roy E; Tackett, Sean; Saylor, Deanna R",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000012134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931541/,77

Methods: The epidemiological data of RT-PCR test-confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected. Transmission chain was drawn and the transmission process was analyzed. Results: Cluster case 1 contained 13 cases and was caused by a family of 5 who traveled by car to Wuhan and returned to Shaanxi. Cluster case 2 had 5cases and caused by initial patient who participated family get-together right after back from Wuhan while under incubation period. Cluster case 3 contained 10 cases and could be defined as nosocomial infection. Cluster case 4 contained 4 cases and occurred in work place. Conclusion: Higher contact frequency and smaller places were more likely to cause a small-scale COVID-19 cluster outbreak, with potential longer incubation period. COVID-19 control strategies should turn the attention to infection prevention and control in crowded places, management of enterprise resumption and prevention of nosocomial infection.","Chen, S; Zhang, Y; Li, C; Ning, S S; Li, X X; Zhu, N; Nian, Y P; Cao, L; Yang, G J; Wang, W H; Liu, Y Z; Wang, L; Lei, F L; Liu, F; Shen, M W",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200225-00170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32867425/,77
94995,The doctors' lot.,2020-10-30,"UNLABELLED West Nile virus (WNV) is the most important cause of epidemic encephalitis in North America. Innate immune responses, which are critical for control of WNV infection, are initiated by signaling through pathogen recognition receptors, RIG-I and MDA5, and their downstream adaptor molecule, MAVS. Here, we show that a deficiency of MAVS in hematopoietic cells resulted in increased mortality and delayed WNV clearance from the brain. In Mavs(-/-) mice, a dysregulated immune response was detected, characterized by a massive influx of macrophages and virus-specific T cells into the infected brain. These T cells were polyfunctional and lysed peptide-pulsed target cells in vitro However, virus-specific T cells in the brains of infected Mavs(-/-) mice exhibited lower functional avidity than those in wild-type animals, and even virus-specific memory T cells generated by prior immunization could not protect Mavs(-/-) mice from WNV-induced lethal disease. Concomitant with ineffective virus clearance, macrophage numbers were increased in the Mavs(-/-) brain, and both macrophages and microglia exhibited an activated phenotype. Microarray analyses of leukocytes in the infected Mavs(-/-) brain showed a preferential expression of genes associated with activation and inflammation. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for MAVS in hematopoietic cells in augmenting the kinetics of WNV clearance and thereby preventing a dysregulated and pathogenic immune response. IMPORTANCE West Nile virus (WNV) is the most important cause of mosquito-transmitted encephalitis in the United States. The innate immune response is known to be critical for protection in infected mice. Here, we show that expression of MAVS, a key adaptor molecule in the RIG-I-like receptor RNA-sensing pathway, in hematopoietic cells is critical for protection from lethal WNV infection. In the absence of MAVS, there is a massive infiltration of myeloid cells and virus-specific T cells into the brain and overexuberant production of proinflammatory cytokines. These results demonstrate the important role that MAVS expression in hematopoietic cells has in regulating the inflammatory response in the WNV-infected brain.","Zhao, Jincun; Vijay, Rahul; Zhao, Jingxian; Gale, Michael; Diamond, Michael S; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00707-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27226371/,77
95270,Patch Testing to Diphenylguanidine by the North American Contact Dermatitis Group (2013-2016).,2020,"Even in the best of circumstances, a significant number of patients will require adjunctive endovascular and/or surgical revision prior to achieving functional patency after endovascular or percutaneous AVF creation, at least within the United States. This rate appears to be higher after percutaneous AVF than after endovascular AVF, although because published reports of the former are mostly derived from American experience and those of the latter derived from experience outside the United States, it is unclear whether these differences are due to the technique itself or cultural and/or anatomic differences in dialysis access practices and patient populations. If arterial inflow is poor, this should be corrected first. When flow is adequate (perhaps 900 cc/min) but no single vein is cannulatable, a dominant suitable vein can be superficialized or transposed. If no suitable vein is dominant (most accurately assessed by using an intraoperative flowmeter), the best vein can be used, with or without occlusion of the other veins or reimplantation into the brachial artery. Finally, if the original anastomosis remains the sole supply to the cannulated vein, the original fistula has achieved assisted primary maturation (and assisted primary patency continues), while if a new arteriovenous anastomosis has been constructed, the original fistula has failed. We point out that for this reason as well as to best utilize the upper arm for later access, endovascular and percutaneous AVFs should be constructed and maintained within an atmosphere where both surgeons and non-surgeons work together on the overall access plan.","Illig, Karl A; Lok, Charmaine; Rajan, Dheeraj K; Aruny, John; Peden, Eric; Nelson, Peter; London, Mark J; Ross, John R",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.1177/1129729820954724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912041/,77
95596,Global Collaborative Research Informs Wise Use of Tests and Antibiotics for Bronchiolitis.,2020-07-13,"The enzyme ficin, abundantly found in the leaves of the common Fig (Ficus carica. L), is a cysteine protease of the plant endopeptidase family. In terms of activity, this enzyme mimics the activity of the papain enzyme. However, the enzyme is more acidic than papain and binds with higher efficiency to its substrate. Ficin is widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industry along with the medical diagnosis. To date, there are no available data on cloning and recombinant production of various isoforms of ficin. In the present study, after the cloning process and optimized expression of ficin in E. coli BL21, by means of the central composite design (CCD) and approach-based response surface methodology (RSM), the recombinant protein was purified using the Ni-sepharose column and gel filtration. The activity of ficin was determined by its ability to hydrolyze the bovine casein enzyme as a substrate. These results showed the presence of different isoforms of ficin in this cultivar that they are distinct in terms of DNA coding sequences. The optimum conditions for maximum production of the recombinant ficin enzyme in E. coli were as follows; a cell density of 1.25, post-induction time 7 h, 10% (w/v) lactose concentration, and shaking at 115 rpm at 24 °C. The concentration of purified product was reported to be 0.27 mg/ml. The optimization procedures increased the amounts of ficin production by approximately 3 folds (0.67 mg/ml) compared with the expiration level (in the absence of optimization). Also, our findings showed that the recombinant ficin was able to hydrolyze casein, denoting the functionality of the enzyme when used in-vitro. The pitfall of cutting-off the young branches of the common fig tree to purify the enzyme from the young shoots was successfully solved in this study.","Sattari, Farinaz; Rigi, Garshasb; Ghaedmohammadi, Samira",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.10.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069821/,77

The cell tropism of the respective pseudotypes corresponded to the tropism of the viruses from which the S protein was derived. Higher infectivity values were obtained with the SARS-CoV S protein than with the TGEV S protein. Differences were observed with respect to the importance of the cytoplasmic tail and the membrane anchor of the S proteins. In the case of the SARS-CoV S protein, truncation of the cytoplasmic tail resulted in increased infectivity. For the TGEV S protein, the inactivation of an intracellular retention signal in the cytoplasmic tail was required. Exchange of the membrane anchor of the S proteins led to a low infection efficiency. Our results indicate that related glycoproteins may show substantial differences in their ability to mediate pseudotype infection.","Schwegmann-Wessels, Christel; Glende, Jörg; Ren, Xiaofeng; Qu, Xiuxia; Deng, Hongkui; Enjuanes, Luis; Herrler, Georg",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.009704-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19264610/,77

96583,A study to assess global availability of fetal surgery for myelomeningocele.,2018,"BACKGROUND Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy is a growing treatment modality for acute cardiorespiratory failure. Cardiac output monitoring during veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy remains challenging. This study aims to validate a new thermodilution technique during veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy using a pig model. METHODS Sixteen healthy pigs were centrally cannulated for veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and precision flow probes for blood flow assessment were placed on the pulmonary artery. After chest closure, cold boluses of 0.9% saline solution were injected into the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit, right atrium, and right ventricle at different extracorporeal membrane oxygenation flows (4, 3, 2, 1 l/min). Rapid response thermistors in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit and pulmonary artery recorded the temperature change. After calculating catheter constants, the distributions of injection volumes passing each circuit were assessed and enabled calculation of pulmonary blood flow. Analysis of the exponential temperature decay allowed assessment of right ventricular function. RESULTS Calculated blood flow correlated well with measured blood flow (r = 0.74, P < 0.001). Bias was -6 ml/min [95% CI ± 48 ml/min] with clinically acceptable limits of agreement (668 ml/min [95% CI ± 166 ml/min]). Percentage error varied with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation blood flow reductions, yielding an overall percentage error of 32.1% and a percentage error of 24.3% at low extracorporeal membrane oxygenation blood flows. Right ventricular ejection fraction was 17 [14 to 20.0]%. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation flow reductions increased end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes with reductions in pulmonary vascular resistance. Central venous pressure and right ventricular ejection fractions remained unchanged. End-diastolic and end-systolic volumes correlated highly (r = 0.98, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Adapted thermodilution allows reliable assessment of cardiac output and right ventricular behavior. During veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation weaning, the right ventricle dilates even with stable function, possibly because of increased venous return. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an accepted rescue therapy for patients experiencing severe cardiac or pulmonary failure.Weaning from veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is important for determining next steps in patients' cardiopulmonary care. Assessment of right ventricular function during veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and weaning is often done using echocardiography, but echocardiographic guidance provides challenges because right ventricular dimensions change with ventricular loading and may not be related to intrinsic right ventricular function. WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW In 16 healthy pigs that received veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support via central cannulation, a novel adaptation of thermodilution cardiac output assessment provided reliable estimation of right ventricular cardiac output and right ventricular function.Future studies appear warranted to determine whether this method of modified thermodilution can be used to accurately assess right ventricular output and function during veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.","Bachmann, Kaspar F; Zwicker, Lena; Nettelbeck, Kay; Casoni, Daniela; Heinisch, Paul Phillipp; Jenni, Hansjörg; Haenggi, Matthias; Berger, David",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000003443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657798/,77

Our objective was to evaluate the impact of a concurrent acute respiratory illness (based on a clinical definition and PCR detection of a panel of respiratory viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae) on the severity and resolution of symptoms in children with a nonhospitalized exacerbation of asthma. METHODS : Subjects were children aged 2 to 15 years presenting to an emergency department for an acute asthma exacerbation and not hospitalized. Acute respiratory illness (ARI) was clinically defined. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were examined for respiratory viruses, Chlamydia and Mycoplasma using PCR. The primary outcome was quality of life (QOL) on presentation, day 7 and day 14. Secondary outcomes were acute asthma severity score, asthma diary, and cough diary scores on days 5, 7, 10, and 14. RESULTS : On multivariate regression, presence of ARI was statistically but not clinically significantly associated with QOL score on presentation (B = -0.36, P = 0.025). By day 7 and 14, there was no difference between groups. Asthma diary score was significantly higher in children with ARI (B = 0.41, P = 0.039) on day 5 but not on presentation or subsequent days. Respiratory viruses were detected in 54% of the 78 NPAs obtained. There was no difference in the any of the asthma outcomes of children grouped by positive or negative NPA.

Independent authors selected studies, appraised quality and extracted data. After screening 7111 titles and abstracts, eleven studies were included. Seven studies evaluated interventions for moving/handling training. Four evaluated other interventions. None focused on our primary outcome education/work dropout. All studies reported on physical complaints among student nurses only. Overall, risk of bias was high and clinical heterogeneity prohibited pooling of data. Intervention effects were small and inconsistent. In conclusion, evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in the nursing curricula for the prevention/treatment of physical complaints is scarce and where available conflicting.

Accumulation of wear particles could alter key tissue-level mechanical properties of the synovium, hindering its characteristically low-friction interactions with underlying articular surfaces in the synovial joint. The present study employs a custom loading device to further the characterization of native synovium friction properties, while investigating the hypothesis that attachment of cartilage wear particles increases friction coefficient. Juvenile bovine synovium demonstrated characteristically low friction coefficients in sliding contact with glass, in agreement with historical measurements. Friction coefficient increased with higher normal load in saline, while lubrication with native synovial fluid maintained low friction coefficients at higher loads. Cartilage wear particles generated from juvenile bovine cartilage attached directly to synovium explants in static culture, with incorporation onto the tissue denoted by cell migration onto the particle surface. In dilute synovial fluid mimicking the decreased lubricating properties during osteoarthritis, wear particle attachment significantly increased friction coefficient against glass, and native cartilage and synovium. In addition to providing a novel characterization of synovial joint tribology this work highlights a potential mechanism for cartilage wear particles to perpetuate the degradative environment of osteoarthritis by modulating tissue-level properties of the synovium that could impact macroscopic wear as well as mechanical stimuli transmitted to resident cells.","Estell, Eben G; Murphy, Lance A; Gangi, Lianna R; Shah, Roshan P; Ateshian, Gerard A; Hung, Clark T",Journal of biomechanics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399243/,77

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 admitted to the Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou from January 21st to February 24th 2020 were enrolled. According to the clinical classification, the patients were divided into severe group and critical group. The myocardial injury markers, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), myoglobin (MYO), MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS A total of 55 COVID-19 patients were selected, including 15 critical cases and 40 severe cases. The patients with severe and critical COVID-19 were male-dominated (61.8%), the average age was (61.2±13.0) years old, 83.6% (46 cases) of them had contact history of Hubei, 38.2% (21 cases) of them were complicated with hypertension. There was no significant difference in baseline data between the critical group and the severe group. Myocardial injury markers of critical and severe COVID-19 patients were increased in different proportion, LDH increased in most patients (20 severe cases and 7 critical cases), followed by AST (16 severe cases and 5 critical cases). There was significant difference in the number of patients with elevated CK between severe group and critical group (cases: 1 vs. 4, P = 0.027). Abnormal ECG was found in 39 of 42 patients with ECG examination. Nonspecific change of T wave was the most common. Before and after treatment, 9 of 15 patients with changes of ECG and myocardial injury markers had oxygenation index less than 100 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and the prominent changes of ECG were heart rate increasing and ST-T change. CONCLUSIONS The increase of myocardial injury markers and abnormal ECG were not specific to the myocardial injury of severe and critical COVID-19 patients.

Participants (n = 144) were enrolled and randomly assigned into group TEAS or group sham TEAS. TEAS on bilateral Feishu (BL13), Hegu (L14), and Zusanli (ST36) was performed continuously throughout the procedure. The primary outcome was the quantities of natural killer (NK) cells at 30 minutes before induction (T0), 5 minutes after intubation (T1), at the beginning of the operation (T2), at the beginning of the lobectomy (T3), at the beginning of the lymphadenectomy (T4), and immediately after extubation (T5). The secondary outcomes were the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) at T0 to T5, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), the intraoperative consumption of propofol and remifentanil, the incidence of hypoxemia, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and the length of hospital stay. The quantities of NK cells were decreased in group sham TEAS after intubation compared to that in group TEAS, while the quantities of NK cells in group TEAS were similar at T0 to T5. Meanwhile, the quantities of NK cells in group sham TEAS at T1 ( P = .012), T2 ( P < .001), T3 ( P = .027), T4 ( P = .045), and T5 ( P = .021) were lower than those in group TEAS. In group TEAS, the serum levels of TNF-α were lower at T1 to T5, while the levels of IL-6 were lower at T2 to T5. Furthermore, the intraoperative MAP and HR were more stable, the total propofol and remifentanil consumptions were lower, and the length of hospital stay was shorter than those in group sham TEAS. The application of TEAS can effectively reverse the decrease in NK cells, decrease the serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6, maintain hemodynamic stability during the perioperative period, decrease the consumption of propofol and remifentanil, and shorten the length of the hospital stay.","Tu, Qing; Yang, Zhou; Gan, Jianhui; Zhang, Jian; Que, Bin; Song, Qiaofeng; Wang, Yan",Technology in cancer research & treatment,https://doi.org/10.1177/1533033818806477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30381011/,77
99631,Viral Diseases and Natural Products: Prospects in COVID-19 Treatment (Part II).,2021,"Sustained activation of the Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in infected cells has been shown to be crucial for full replication efficiency of orthopoxviruses in cell culture. In infected cells, this pathway is mainly activated by the vaccinia virus growth factor (VGF), an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein. We show here that chorioallantois vaccinia virus Ankara (CVA), but not modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), induced sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in infected human 293 cells, although both viruses direct secretion of functional VGF. A CVA mutant lacking the O1L gene (CVA-ΔO1L) demonstrated that the O1 protein was required for sustained upregulation of the ERK1/2 pathway in 293 cells as well as in other mammalian cell lines. The highly conserved orthopoxvirus O1L gene encodes a predicted 78-kDa protein with a hitherto-unknown function. CVA-ΔO1L showed reduced plaque size and an attenuated cytopathic effect (CPE) in infected cell cultures and reduced virulence and spread from lungs to ovaries in intranasally infected BALB/c mice. Reinsertion of an intact O1L gene into MVA, which in its original form harbors a fragmented O1L open reading frame (ORF), restored ERK1/2 activation in 293 cells but did not increase replication and spread of MVA in human or other mammalian cell lines. Thus, the O1 protein was crucial for sustained ERK1/2 activation in CVA- and MVA-infected human cells, complementing the autocrine function of VGF, and enhanced virulence in vivo.","Schweneker, Marc; Lukassen, Susanne; Späth, Michaela; Wolferstätter, Michael; Babel, Eveline; Brinkmann, Kay; Wielert, Ursula; Chaplin, Paul; Suter, Mark; Hausmann, Jürgen",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06166-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22171261/,77

100303,When Duty House Calls.,2020-09-14,"Because somatosensory PNS neurons, in particular nociceptors, are specially tuned to be able to detect a wide variety of both exogenous and endogenous signals, one might assume that these neurons express a greater variety of receptor genes. This assumption has not been formally tested. Because cells detect such signals via cell surface receptors, we sought to formally test the hypothesis that PNS neurons might express a broader array of cell surface receptors than CNS neurons using existing single cell RNA sequencing resources from mouse. We focused our analysis on ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRS), receptor tyrosine kinase and cytokine family receptors. In partial support of our hypothesis, we found that mouse PNS somatosensory, sympathetic and enteric neurons and CNS neurons have similar receptor expression diversity in families of receptors examined, with the exception of GPCRs and cytokine receptors which showed greater diversity in the PNS. Surprisingly, these differences were mostly driven by enteric and sympathetic neurons, not by somatosensory neurons or nociceptors. Secondary analysis revealed many receptors that are very specifically expressed in subsets of PNS neurons, including some that are unique among neurons for nociceptors. Finally, we sought to examine specific ligand-receptor interactions between T cells and PNS and CNS neurons. Again, we noted that most interactions between these cells are shared by CNS and PNS neurons despite the fact that T cells only enter the CNS under rare circumstances. Our findings demonstrate that both PNS and CNS neurons express an astonishing array of cell surface receptors and suggest that most neurons are tuned to receive signals from other cells types, in particular immune cells.","Wangzhou, Andi; Paige, Candler; Ray, Pradipta R; Dussor, Gregory; Price, Theodore J",Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2021.03.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33774127/,77

Ultrasonography revealed a mass at the ureteroneocystostomy site, and the mass was excised. Both the donor and recipient cats were seronegative for Toxoplasma gondii-specific IgG antibodies prior to transplantation. CLINICAL FINDINGS Histologic evaluation of the mass revealed lesions indicative of extensive necrotizing pyogranulomatous cystitis with numerous intralesional T gondii tachyzoites and bradyzoite cysts. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Treatment with clindamycin was initiated; however, the cat's clinical condition continued to decline, and it was euthanized 9 days after the mass was excised. Necropsy revealed T gondii cysts within the renal allograft and the transplanted ureter, with no evidence of systemic spread of organisms. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Toxoplasmosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis for azotemia in feline renal transplant recipients regardless of the results of assays for T gondii antibodies in the serum of donors or recipients. This report illustrated the need for improved screening of donor and recipient cats and the importance of minimizing exposure to potential sources of T gondii after transplantation.","Nordquist, Barbro C; Aronson, Lillian R",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.232.7.1010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18380617/,77

The diagnosis and assessment of intracranial stenosis are shifting from anatomic to hemodynamic for better risk stratification. However, the relationships between lesion geometry and translesional pressure gradient have not been clearly elucidated. Methods: Patients with symptomatic unifocal M1 middle cerebral artery (M1-MCA) stenosis were consecutively recruited. The translesional pressure gradient was measured with a pressure wire and was recorded as both mean distal/proximal pressure ratios (Pd/Pa) and translesional pressure difference (Pa-Pd). Lesion geometry measured on angiography was recorded as diameter stenosis, minimal lumen diameter, and lesion length. The correlations between pressure-derived and angiography-derived indices were then analyzed. Results: Forty-three patients were analyzed. A negative correlation was found between Pd/Pa and diameter stenosis (r = -0.371; p = 0.014) and between Pa - Pd and minimal lumen diameter (r = -0.507; p = 0.001). A positive correlation was found between Pd/Pa and minimal lumen diameter (r = 0.411; p = 0.006) and between Pa - Pd and diameter stenosis (r = 0.466; p = 0.002). Conclusions: In a highly selected ICAS subgroup, geometric indices derived from angiography correlate significantly with translesional pressure gradient indices. However, the correlation strength is weak-to-moderate, which implies that anatomic assessment could only partly reflect hemodynamic status. Translesional pressure gradient measured by pressure wire may serve as a more predictive marker of ICAS severity. More factors need to be identified in further studies.","Li, Long; Yang, Bin; Dmytriw, Adam A; Wang, Tao; Luo, Jichang; Li, Yanling; Ma, Yan; Chen, Jian; Wang, Yabing; Gao, Peng; Feng, Yao; Bai, Xuesong; Zhang, Xiao; Dong, Jia; Yang, Renjie; Jiao, Liqun; Ling, Feng",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.671778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34456841/,77

The aim of this systematic review was to summarise and synthesise current clinical evidence relating to the aetiology, diagnosis and treatment of ocular Demodex. RECENT FINDINGS A comprehensive literature search was performed in OVID Medline, OVID Embase, and clinical trial registries, for studies published between 1990 and August 2019, examining Demodex on the ocular surface. The review included primary clinical research studies and systematic reviews of primary clinical research studies, where Demodex was considered in the context of the ocular surface and/or adnexa. Studies were categorised using the National Health and Medical Research Council evidence hierarchy. Risk of bias assessment was performed using validated tools for studies categorised as providing Level I or II evidence. A total of 87 studies were eligible for inclusion, including two systematic reviews. Most studies (60%) were observational, describing the prevalence of ocular Demodex in different clinical populations. There was a high degree of variability in the epidemiological data derived from cross-sectional aetiology studies. There was mostly consistent evidence to support an association between ocular Demodex and chronic blepharitis. Seven diagnostic test-accuracy studies were identified, which considered a range of techniques, including slit lamp examination for cylindrical eyelash collarettes and/or eyelash manipulation techniques, light microscopic evaluation of epilated eyelashes and in vivo confocal microscopy. There is currently no accepted gold-standard diagnostic method for ocular Demodex. For intervention studies, there was one systematic review, 11 published randomised trials, six trial registry entries, and nine case series. Despite a number of recent trials, the appropriate treatment regimen for ocular Demodex (including the optimal criteria and timing of an intervention) is not clearly established. CONCLUSIONS This comprehensive narrative synthesis has captured the landscape of clinical evidence relating to the prevalence, aetiology, diagnosis and treatment of ocular Demodex. There remain opportunities to enhance understanding of its role in ocular surface disease, best diagnostic approaches and optimal treatment protocols.","Zhang, Alexis Ceecee; Muntz, Alex; Wang, Michael T M; Craig, Jennifer P; Downie, Laura E",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians,https://doi.org/10.1111/opo.12691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691894/,77
101690,Aortic stenosis progression: Doppler echocardiography shifted the paradigm.,2020-12-29,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been causing huge economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Commercial PRRSV vaccines including killed and modified live ones are available. However the protective efficacy of these vaccines is incomplete. Thus, it is in urgent need to develop safer and more effective PRRSV vaccines. In this study, we constructed a recombinant plasmid co-expressing porcine glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1) and the envelope glycoprotein (GP5) encoding-gene of PRRSV (pcDNA3.1-GPX1-LSynORF5), and investigated the immune response induced following inoculation of mice and piglets. Significantly enhanced GP5-specific antibody, PRRSV-specific neutralizing antibody, IFN-γ level, as well as lymphocyte proliferation response, were induced in mice and pigs immunized with the DNA construct encoding GPX1 and GP5 compared with those inoculated with a construct encoding PRRSV GP5 only (pcDNA3.1-SynORF5). The enhanced cellular immune response in pigs induced by pcDNA3.1-GPX1-LSynORF5 was comparable to that induced by the attenuated virus vaccine JXA1-R, although the humoral immune response induced by the plasmid was much lower than the response induced by JXA1-R. Following the challenge with highly pathogenic PRRSV, less-severe clinical signs and rectal temperatures were observed in pigs immunized with the GPX1-GP5 construct compared with the control group. However, the viraemia of groups immunized with plasmid was more severe than that inoculated with JXA1-R, and it is likely that this could be attributed to the poor humoral response induced by the GPX1-GP5 construct. These results demonstrated that inclusion of GPX1 in a PRRSV DNA vaccine leads to an adjuvant effect, enhancing the humoral and cellular responses following vaccination.","Du, Luping; Li, Bin; Pang, Fengjiao; Yu, Zhengyu; Xu, Xiangwei; Fan, Baochao; Tan, Yeping; He, Kongwang; Huang, Kehe",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.12.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28063474/,77

METHODS Retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent robotic (n=288) and laparoscopic (n=257) hysterectomies by minimally invasive surgeons at the University of Michigan from March 2001 until June 2010. RESULTS Age, body mass index, operative time, and estimated blood loss were not statistically different between groups. The RH subgroup had a larger uterine weight (LH 186.4±130.6 g vs RH 234.9±193.9 g, P=.001), higher prevalence of severe adhesions (13.2% vs 23.3%, respectively, P=.003), and stage III-IV endometriosis (4.7% vs 15.3%, respectively, P<.05).

The correlation and the prognostic impact of respiratory and heart impairment are poorly described. We aimed to describe the long-term cardiac and respiratory follow-up of these patients and to determine predictive factors of cardio-respiratory events and mortality in LGMD 2C and 2D. METHODS We reviewed the charts of 34 LGMD patients, followed from 2005 to 2015, to obtain echocardiographic, respiratory function and sleep recording data. We considered respiratory events (acute respiratory failure, pulmonary sepsis, atelectasis or pneumothorax), cardiac events (acute heart failure, significant cardiac arrhythmia or conduction block, ischemic stroke) and mortality as outcomes of interest for the present analysis. RESULTS A total of 21 patients had type 2C LGMD and 13 patients had type 2D. Median age was 30 years [IQR 24-38]. At baseline, median pulmonary vital capacity (VC) was 31% of predicted value [20-40]. Median maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) was 31 cmH2O [IQR 20.25-39.75]. Median maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) was 30 cm H2O [20-36]. Median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 55% [45-64] with 38% of patients with LVEF <50%. Over a median follow-up of 6 years, we observed 38% respiratory events, 14% cardiac events and 20% mortality. Among baseline characteristics, LVEF and left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) were associated with mortality, whilst respiratory parameters (VC, MIP, MEP) and the need for home mechanical ventilation (HMV) were associated with respiratory events. CONCLUSION In our cohort of severely respiratory impaired type 2C and 2D LGMD, respiratory morbidity was high.

It is now known that its DNA genome encodes for nearly 1000 proteins including enzymes that are required for the biosynthesis of the unusual sugar 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose, also known as d-viosamine. As observed in some bacteria, the pathway for the production of this sugar initiates with a nucleotide-linked sugar which in the Mimivirus is thought to be UDP-d-glucose. The enzyme required for the installment of the amino group at the C-4' position of the pyranosyl moiety is encoded in the Mimivirus by the L136 gene. Here we describe a structural and functional analysis of this PLP-dependent enzyme, referred to as L136. For this analysis, three high-resolution X-ray structures were determined: the wildtype enzyme/PMP/dTDP complex and the site-directed mutant variant K185A in the presence of either UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose or dTDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose. Additionally, the kinetic parameters of the enzyme utilizing either UDP-d-glucose or dTDP-d-glucose were measured and demonstrated that L136 is efficient with both substrates. This is in sharp contrast to the structurally related DesI from Streptomyces venezuelae, whose three-dimensional architecture was previously reported by this laboratory. Here we show that DesI shows a profound preference in its catalytic efficiency for the dTDP-linked sugar substrate. This difference can be explained in part by a hydrophobic patch in DesI that is missing in L136. Notably, the structure of L136 reported here represents the first three-dimensional model for a virally encoded PLP-dependent enzyme and thus provides new information on sugar aminotransferases in general.","Seltzner, Chase A; Ferek, Justin D; Thoden, James B; Holden, Hazel M",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.4139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34076307/,77

METHODS From January 2011 until August 2012, all operable patients were scheduled to undergo minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIE) with intrathoracic anastomosis. Patient characteristics, complications, morbidity and mortality were prospectively registered and analysed. RESULTS Forty-five patients underwent MIE with intrathoracic stapled end-to-side anastomosis. Major changes in operative technique were made 2 times due to non-satisfactory results, dividing the patients into 3 groups. One patient in group 1 died. The anastomotic leakage rate decreased from 44% in group 1 to 0% in groups 2 and 3 (p = 0.007). The pulmonary complication rate decreased from 67% in group 1 to 44% in group 2 (not significant, NS) and 22% in group 3 (p = 0.04).

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to explore potential mechanisms of sleep fragmentation influencing alterations of perceived sleep quality. METHODS We analyzed polysomnography (PSG) recordings from a double-blind crossover study with zopiclone 7.5 mg and placebo, in elderly participants with insomnia complaints and age-matched healthy controls. We compared survival dynamics of sleep and wake across group and treatment. Subsequently, we used a previously proposed model to estimate the amount of sleep onset latency (SOL) misperception from PSG-defined sleep fragmentation. Self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were compared across group and treatment, as well as model prediction errors. RESULTS In the zopiclone night, the average segment length of NREM sleep was increased (group F = 1.16, p = 0.32; treatment F = 8.89, p < 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.44, p = 0.65), while the segment length of wake was decreased (group F = 1.48, p = 0.23; treatment F = 11.49, p < 0.01; group x treatment F = 0.36, p = 0.70). The self-reported and model-estimated amount of SOL misperception were lower during the zopiclone night (self-reported group F = 6.08, p < 0.01, treatment F = 10.8, p < 0.01, group x treatment F = 2.49, p = 0.09; model-estimated F = 1.70, p = 0.19, treatment F = 16.1, p < 0.001, group x treatment F = 0.60, p = 0.55). The prediction error was not altered (group F = 1.62, p = 0.20; treatment F = 0.20, p = 0.65; group x treatment F = 1.01, p = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS Impaired subjective sleep quality is associated with decreased NREM stability, together with increased stability of wake. Furthermore, we conclude that zopiclone-induced changes in SOL misperception can be largely attributed to predictable changes of sleep architecture.","Hermans, Lieke W A; Regis, Marta; Fonseca, Pedro; Overeem, Sebastiaan; Leufkens, Tim R M; Vermeeren, Annemiek; van Gilst, Merel M",Psychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-020-05660-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32939597/,77

The aim of this study was to identify the quality of evidence of physical therapy interventions that address mobility and participation in older patients with VDB and to characterize the used primary and secondary outcomes. METHODS A systematic search via MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PEDro, forward citation tracing and hand search was conducted initially in 11/2017 and updated in 7/2019. We included individual and cluster-randomized controlled trials and trials with quasi-experimental design, published between 2007 and 2017/2019 and including individuals ≥65 years with VDB. Physical therapy and related interventions were reviewed with no restrictions to outcome measurement. Screening of titles, abstracts and full texts, data extraction and critical appraisal was conducted by two independent researchers. The included studies were heterogeneous in terms of interventions and outcome measures. Therefore, a narrative synthesis was conducted. RESULTS A total of 20 randomized and 2 non-randomized controlled trials with 1876 patients met the inclusion criteria. The included studies were heterogeneous in terms of complexity of interventions, outcome measures and methodological quality. Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) was examined in twelve studies, computer-assisted VR (CAVR) in five, Tai Chi as VR (TCVR) in three, canal repositioning manoeuvres (CRM) in one and manual therapy (MT) in one study. Mixed effects were found regarding body structure/function and activities/participation. Quality of life and/or falls were assessed, with no differences between groups. VR is with moderate quality of evidence superior to usual care to improve balance, mobility and symptoms. CONCLUSION To treat older individuals with VDB, VR in any variation and in addition to CRMs seems to be effective. High-quality randomized trials need to be conducted to inform clinical decision making.

103748,Negative pressure therapy stimulates healing of critical-size calvarial defects in rabbits.,2013,"Tissue macrophages self-renew during homeostasis and produce inflammatory mediators upon microbial infection. We examined the relationship between proliferative and inflammatory properties of tissue macrophages by defining the impact of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, a central regulator of self-renewal, in alveolar macrophages (AMs) . Activation of β-catenin by Wnt ligand inhibited AM proliferation and stemness, but promoted inflammatory activity. In a murine influenza viral pneumonia model, β-catenin-mediated AM inflammatory activity promoted acute host morbidity; in contrast, AM proliferation enabled repopulation of reparative AMs and tissue recovery following viral clearance. Mechanistically, Wnt treatment promoted β-catenin-HIF-1α interaction and glycolysis-dependent inflammation while suppressing mitochondrial metabolism and thereby, AM proliferation. Differential HIF-1α activities distinguished proliferative and inflammatory AMs in vivo. This β-catenin-HIF-1α axis was conserved in human AMs and enhanced HIF-1α expression associated with macrophage inflammation in COVID-19 patients. Thus, inflammatory and reparative activities of lung macrophages are regulated by β-catenin-HIF-1α signaling, with implications for the treatment of severe respiratory diseases.","Zhu, Bibo; Wu, Yue; Huang, Su; Zhang, Ruixuan; Son, Young Min; Li, Chaofan; Cheon, In Su; Gao, Xiaochen; Wang, Min; Chen, Yao; Zhou, Xian; Nguyen, Quynh; Phan, Anthony T; Behl, Supriya; Taketo, M Mark; Mack, Matthias; Shapiro, Virginia S; Zeng, Hu; Ebihara, Hideki; Mullon, John J; Edell, Eric S; Reisenauer, Janani S; Demirel, Nadir; Kern, Ryan M; Chakraborty, Rana; Cui, Weiguo; Kaplan, Mark H; Zhou, Xiaobo; Goldrath, Ananda W; Sun, Jie",Immunity,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2021.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951416/,77

Previous work in children receiving intravenous rehydration has correlated end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) with serum bicarbonate. We evaluated whether EtCO2 predicts weight change in children with vomiting and/or diarrhea. METHODS A prospective cohort study was conducted. Eligible children were 3 months to 10 years old and presented for emergency department (ED) care because of vomiting and/or diarrhea. End-tidal carbon dioxide measurements were performed after triage. The diagnostic standard was weight change determined from serial measurements after symptom resolution. A receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to identify a cut-point to predict 5% or more dehydration. RESULTS In total, 195 children were enrolled. Among the 169 (87%) with EtCO2 measurements, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) was 30.4 (27.8 to 33.1). One hundred fifty-eight had repeat weights performed at home; the median (IQR) weight change from ED presentation to well weight was +0.06 (-0.14 to +0.30) or +0.72% (-1.2% to +2.1%). Sixteen percent (25/158) had 3% or more and 4% (6/158) had 5% or more weight gain (ie, percent dehydration). One hundred sixteen (60%) completed home follow-up and had acceptable EtCO2 recordings. Receiver operating curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.34 (95% confidence interval, 0.06 to 0.62) for EtCO2 as a predictor of 5% or more dehydration. CONCLUSIONS The limited accuracy of EtCO2 measurement to predict 5% or more dehydration precludes its use as a tool to assess dehydration severity in children. End-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring does not have the ability to identify those children with 5% or more dehydration in a cohort of children with vomiting and/or diarrhea presenting for ED care.","Freedman, Stephen B; Johnson, David W; Nettel-Aguirre, Alberto; Mikrogianakis, Angelo; Williamson-Urquhart, Sarah; Monfries, Nicholas; Cheng, Adam",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000001177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28538608/,77
104456,Ethical considerations in global HIV phylogenetic research.,2018,"OBJECTIVE Comparison of primary anastomosis (PA) and Hartmann's procedure (HP) in perforated diverticulitis is biased as the patient groups are different in age, comorbidity and severity of disease. Still, PA has been advocated as the procedure of choice. The aim of this study was to compare the two surgical procedures after eliminating this selection bias using a propensity score model. METHOD Sixty-five HP and 46 PA patients who underwent emergency laparotomy for perforated diverticulitis were analysed. Multivariate logistic regression using the Mannheim peritonitis index, Colorectal Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity, Charlson comorbidity index and Hinchey score was performed to determine the propensity score. RESULTS Patients with HP had significantly higher scores, median age and were more often on immunosuppressive medication. Unadjusted logistic regression for outcome showed a significant risk of HP vs PA for nonsurgical morbidity (odds ratio 3.25, 95% CI: 1.26-8.43; P = 0.015), but not for mortality and surgical morbidity. After adjusting for the propensity score, outcome was not significantly different. Patients with PA had a clinical leak rate of 28% and none of the patients with leakage had a protective ileostomy. Patients with PA and leak had higher Charlson scores whereas all other scores were similar to nonleak patients. CONCLUSION The theory that PA is generally superior to HP cannot be supported. HP remains a safe technique for emergency colectomy in perforated diverticulitis, especially in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. If PA is performed, a protective ileostomy must be considered.","Zingg, U; Pasternak, I; Dietrich, M; Seifert, B; Oertli, D; Metzger, U",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2008.01694.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19175638/,77
104602,[Method of endonasal endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy with plastic stoma formation].,2021,"OBJECTIVE This study explored whether all-cause healthcare attendance rate post-vaccination could detect the two historical influenza safety episodes occurring in 2010 and 2015 using a large de-identified general practitioner (GP) consultations dataset. METHODS A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted using GP consultation data routinely collected from 2008 to 2017 in Victoria, Australia. Post-vaccination GP consultation rates were monitored, over a 22-week surveillance period each year that aligned with each year's influenza vaccination season, using the Observed minus Expected (O-E) and the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) CUSUM charts. Days 1-7 post-vaccination were considered as the risk period. The LLR CUSUM was designed to detect both a 50% and two-fold rise in the odds of the baseline post-vaccination GP consultation rates. RESULTS Over the 10-year study period, more than 1.5 million seasonal influenza vaccines doses were administered to 295,091 persons. Overall, 1.29% had a GP consultation within one week of vaccination, but 98.53% of the consultations occurred in days 1-3 post-vaccination. The LLR CUSUM chart detected significant increases in the weekly rates of post-vaccination GP consultation in 2010 in children aged under ten years and in 2015 in adults aged 19-64 years. These increases were aligned by week, but one week earlier and by age category, with the historical adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) signals occurring in 2010 and 2015. However, in the absence of historical AEFI signals, increased rates of post-vaccination GP consultations were identified in three of the eight influenza vaccination years. CONCLUSION The crude post-vaccination healthcare attendance rate has the potential to offer a sensitive proxy to monitor vaccine safety signal. Implications for public health: Vaccine safety monitoring using syndromic indicator has the potential to augment the existing surveillance systems as part of an integrated vaccine safety monitoring approach.","Mesfin, Yonatan Moges; Cheng, Allen C; Enticott, Joanne; Lawrie, Jock; Buttery, Jim",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617131/,77

An added key factor has been a patient-initiated delay in the presentation because of the fear of viral infection. Patterns of clinical consultation have changed, including a greater level of virtual visits, physical spacing, masking, staffing changes to ensure a COVID-free population and significant changes in patterns of family involvement. While this has occurred to improve safety from COVID-19 infection, the implications for cancer outcomes have not yet been defined. Based on prior epidemics and financial recessions, it is likely that delayed presentation and treatment of high-grade malignancy will be associated with worse cancer outcomes. Cancer patients are also at increased risk from COVID-19 infection compared to the general population.

Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) has become accepted as an alternative to conventional multiport cholecystectomy. However, SILC is still limited in applicability in low resource centres due to the expense associated with specialized access platforms, curved instruments, and flexible scopes. Presentation of Case. We present three cases where a modified SILC technique was used with conventional instruments and no working ports. The evolution of this technique is described. Discussion. In order to contain cost, we used conventional instruments and three transfascial ports placed in an umbilical incision, but we noted significant instrument clashes that originated at the port platforms. Therefore, we modified our technique by omitting ports for the working instruments. The technique allowed us to exchange instruments as necessary, maximized ergonomics, and prevented collisions from the bulky port platforms. Finally, the puncture left by the instrument alone did not require fascial closure at the termination of the procedure. Conclusion. The direct transfascial puncture using conventional laparoscopic instruments without working ports is a feasible option that minimizes cost and increases ergonomics.","Cawich, Shamir O; Thomas, Dexter; Hassranah, Dale; Naraynsingh, Vijay",Case reports in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/164342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25349766/,77

Available data suggest that minimally invasive radical cystectomy can provide comparable outcomes to open radical cystectomy despite the scarcity of level 1-2 evidence. Perioperative, functional and early oncologic outcomes seem comparable between the two surgical approaches. Robotic technology has allowed more surgeons to perform minimally invasive radical cystectomy and has simplified technically demanding steps that posed problems in conventional laparoscopy. This is evident by the rapid dissemination of robotics in many bladder cancer centers worldwide and by the numerous emerging series of robot-assisted intracorporeal urinary diversion. Until more data are available regarding the oncologic performance of minimally invasive radical cystectomy, open radical cystectomy remains the gold standard procedure for now.","Azzouni, Faris",Expert review of anticancer therapy,https://doi.org/10.1586/era.13.59; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23773103/,77

In acute full-thickness wounds, it is desirable to replace both the damaged dermis and epidermis in a single procedure. This approach requires appropriate properties of tissue-engineered dressings to support simultaneous regenerative processes in the dermis and epidermis while they are temporally separated in the natural wound healing process. In this study, a collagen-based scaffold inhabited by skin cells was employed. Its ability to stimulate the skin repair of full-thickness excisional splinting wounds in a murine model was evaluated in comparison with that of acellular collagen and commercially available gelatin porous sponge Spongostan®. The study showed that cell-based skin equivalent promoted the immediate filling of the wound bed and provided simultaneous reorganization of the dermal component into highly vascularized granulation-like tissue and rapid epithelialization, thus improving the quality of healing. Inflammation was delayed and less pronounced. In contrast, acellular collagen and especially Spongostan® failed to demonstrate similar results. The porous structure of Spongostan® prevented effective long-term epithelialization and impeded the formation of an adequate connective tissue at the wound bed.","Chermnykh, Elina S; Kiseleva, Ekaterina V; Rogovaya, Olga S; Rippa, Aleksandra L; Vasiliev, Andrey V; Vorotelyak, Ekaterina A",Histology and histopathology,https://doi.org/10.14670/hh-18-006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845594/,77

Eligibility criteria included all reports, reviews; case series with more than 100 individuals and that reported at least three of the following: maternal characteristics, maternal COVID-19 clinical presentation, pregnancy outcomes, maternal outcomes and/or neonatal/perinatal outcomes. We included eight studies that met the inclusion criteria, representing 10,966 cases distributed in 15 countries around the world until July 20, 2020. The results of our review demonstrate that the maternal characteristics, clinical symptoms, maternal and neonatal outcomes almost 11,000 cases of COVID-19 and pregnancy described in 15 different countries are not worse or different from the general population. We suggest that pregnant women are not more affected by the respiratory complications of COVID-19, when compared to the outcomes described in the general population. We also suggest that the important gestational shift Th1-Th2 immune response, known as a potential contributor to the severity in cases of viral infections during pregnancy, are counter-regulated by the enhanced-pregnancy-induced ACE2-Ang-(1-7) axis. Moreover, the relatively small number of reported cases during pregnancy does not allow us to affirm that COVID-19 is more aggressive during pregnancy. Conversely, we also suggest, that down-regulation of ACE2 receptors induced by SARS-CoV-2 cell entry might have been detrimental in subjects with pre-existing ACE2 deficiency associated with pregnancy. This association might explain the worse perinatal outcomes described in the literature.","Figueiro-Filho, Ernesto Antonio; Yudin, Mark; Farine, Dan",Journal of perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33001856/,77

Having regard to the prevalence of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders and a clear tendency to increase the demand for melatonin, and the current lack of alternative green and cost-efficient technologies of its synthesis, the supply of this remedy will not be enough to guarantee melatonin supply and affordability on a global scale. The emergence of naturally occurring melatonin and its isomers in fermented foods has opened an exciting new research area; there are still, however, some obscure points in the efficient microbiological biosynthesis of melatonin. This review summarizes the research progress and recent evidence related to melatonin and its isomers in various foodstuffs. Additionally, one possible way to synthesize melatonin is also discussed. The evidence pointed out that the presence of melatonin and its isomers is not exclusive for grapes and grape-derived products, because it can be also found in sweet and sour cherries. However, different species of both Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts could be used to obtain melatonin and melatonin isomers in the process of alcoholic fermentation biotechnologically. The availability of L-tryptophan has been a key factor in determining the concentration of indolic compounds produced, and the utilization of probiotic lactic acid bacteria could help in the formation of melatonin isomers during malolactic fermentation. These approaches are environmentally friendly alternatives with a safer profile than conventional ones and could represent the future for sustainable industrial-scale melatonin production.","Juhnevica-Radenkova, Karina; Moreno, Diego A; Ikase, Laila; Drudze, Inese; Radenkovs, Vitalijs",Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety,https://doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.12639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33337029/,77

We studied an endotoxin-induced inflammatory state in rats to identify biomarkers of hemostatic imbalance favoring hypercoagulability. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS at 15 mg/kg body weight resulted in peripheral leukopenia and widespread neutrophilic sequestration characteristic of an acute systemic inflammatory response. Early indicators of hemostatic pathway activation developed within 4 hours, including increased circulating concentrations of procoagulant extracellular vesicles (EVs), EVs expressing endothelial cell and platelet membrane markers, and high concentration of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and D-dimers. Inflammation persisted throughout the 48-hour observation period; however, increases were found in a subset of serum microRNA (miRNA) that coincided with gradual resolution of hemostatic protein abnormalities and reduction in EV counts. Dose-adjusted LPS treatment in rats provides a time-course model to develop biomarker profiles reflecting procoagulant imbalance and rebalance under inflammatory conditions.","Brooks, Marjory B; Turk, James R; Guerrero, Abraham; Narayanan, Padma K; Nolan, John P; Besteman, Elizabeth G; Wilson, Dennis W; Thomas, Roberta A; Fishman, Cindy E; Thompson, Karol L; Ellinger-Ziegelbauer, Heidrun; Pierson, Jennifer B; Paulman, April; Chiang, Alan Y; Schultze, Albert E",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28081568/,77

108617,FD-OCT and IVUS intravascular imaging modalities in peripheral vasculature.,2017,"The RAS (renin-angiotensin system) is now recognized as an important regulator of liver fibrosis and portal pressure. Liver injury stimulates the hepatic expression of components of the RAS, such as ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) and the AT(1) receptor [AngII (angiotensin II) type 1 receptor], which play an active role in promoting inflammation and deposition of extracellular matrix. In addition, the more recently recognized structural homologue of ACE, ACE2, is also up-regulated. ACE2 catalyses the conversion of AngII into Ang-(1-7) [angiotensin-(1-7)], and there is accumulating evidence that this 'alternative axis' of the RAS has anti-fibrotic, vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects, thus counterbalancing the effects of AngII in the liver. The RAS is also emerging as an important contributor to the pathophysiology of portal hypertension in cirrhosis. Although the intrahepatic circulation in cirrhosis is hypercontractile in response to AngII, resulting in increased hepatic resistance, the splanchnic vasculature is hyporesponsive, promoting the development of the hyperdynamic circulation that characterizes portal hypertension. Both liver fibrosis and portal hypertension represent important therapeutic challenges for the clinician, and there is accumulating evidence that RAS blockade may be beneficial in these circumstances. The present review outlines new aspects of the RAS and explores its role in the pathogenesis and treatment of liver fibrosis and portal hypertension.","Grace, Josephine A; Herath, Chandana B; Mak, Kai Yan; Burrell, Louise M; Angus, Peter W",Clinical science,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20120030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22548407/,77

109090,Clinical challenges in managing bronchiectasis.,2009,"Over the last years, the endovascular approach to the management of the acute and chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has gained more and more attention from the scientific community. DVT is the third most common cardiovascular disease after coronary heart disease and stroke, with classic treatment based on anticoagulation. Recent evidences have highlighted the risk of postthrombotic syndrome as high as 30%-50% in proximal ilio-femoral lesions, with irreversible clinical symptoms and impact on the quality of life of the population. Since 2000s, the new concept of thrombus removal in the acute phase has been supported by the introduction of different techniques based on the endovascular ablation of the clot by in-situ fibrinolysis and, more recently, fragmentation and aspiration. In the chronic phase, recanalization of the thrombosed segment is recommended by stent placement to remove the obstruction and eventually reduce the congestion. Immediate technical success of these procedures is widely satisfying, whereas the long-term clinical benefits are still debated. This paper presents an overview of the modern management of the DVT by endovascular approach with regard to the clinical contexts, interventional strategies and clinical outcomes. Endovascular specialist needs to be aware of this incoming challenge, as local expertise is demanded for the modern management of these patients in multidisciplinary theaters.","Midulla, Marco; Chevallier, Olivier; Comby, Pierre-Olivier; Giordano, Giuseppe; Pescatori, Lorenzo Carlo; Falvo, Nicolas; C van den Berg, Jos; Cariati, Maurizio; Loffroy, Romaric",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.29375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33185318/,77
109223,COVID-19: An Update on Pathogenesis and Treatment.,2020-12-22,"BACKGROUND CT is important in the care of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, CT morphology can change significantly over the course of the disease. To evaluate the CT morphology of RT-PCR-proven COVID-19 pneumonia in a German cohort with special emphasis on identification of potential differences of CT features depending on duration and severity of disease. METHOD All patients with RT-PCR-proven COVID-19 pneumonia and chest CT performed between March 1 and April 15, 2020 were retrospectively identified. The CT scans were evaluated regarding the presence of different CT features (e. g. ground glass opacity, consolidation, crazy paving, vessel enlargement, shape, and margin of opacifications), distribution of lesions in the lung and extent of parenchymal involvement. For subgroup analyses the patients were divided according to the percentage of parenchymal opacification (0-33 %, 34-66 %, 67-100 %) and according to time interval between symptom onset and CT date (0-5 d, 6-10 d, 11-15 d, > 15 d). Differences in CT features and distribution between subgroups were tested using the Mantel-Haenszel Chi Squared for trend. RESULTS The frequency of CT features (ground glass opacity, consolidation, crazy paving, bronchial dilatation, vessel enlargement, lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion) as well as pattern of parenchymal involvement differed significantly depending on the duration of disease and extent of parenchymal involvement. The early phase of disease was characterized by GGO and to a lesser extent consolidation. The opacifications tended to be round and to some extent with sharp margins and a geographic configuration. The vessels within/around the opacifications were frequently dilated. Later on, the frequency of consolidation and especially crazy paving increased, and the round/geographic shape faded. After day 15, bronchial dilatation occurred, and lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were seen more frequently than before. CONCLUSION The prevalence of CT features varied considerably during the course of disease and depending on the severity of parenchymal involvement. Radiologists should take into account the time interval between symptom onset and date of CT and the severity of disease when discussing the likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia based on CT morphology. KEY POINTS · The frequency of CT features and pattern of parenchymal involvement vary depending on the duration and extent of COVID-19 pneumonia.. · The early phase is characterized by GGO and consolidation which demonstrate a round shape and at least to some extent have sharp margins and a geographic configuration.. · The frequency of consolidation and especially crazy paving increases during the course of disease.. · Beyond day 15 after symptom onset, bronchial dilatation occurs.. · Radiologists should take into account the duration and severity of disease when considering COVID-19 pneumonia..

METHODS A cross-sectional study design was used to survey 245 students from 6 different professional programs. Participants read 4 case-based scenarios, selected 1 of 4 actions in a multiple-choice format, and responded to an open-ended question. Demographic questions asked whether participants had been a victim of violence and whether they have taken a certified active shooter course. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and chi-square testing. RESULTS For each case, most students chose ""patient-centric"" versus ""provider-centric"" actions (range: 66%-94% and 4%-17%, respectively). The gender of the patient made no difference in actions. Those who attended a certified active shooter course tended to act with more ""provider-centric"" concerns than those who did not take such a course. CONCLUSION A significant majority of interprofessional health care students, when presented with specific case-scenarios, declared they would act to protect themselves and their patients during an active shooter event. This ""patient-centric"" attitude transcends the oversimplified ""Run-Hide-Fight"" axiom and must be addressed by all health care educational institutions.","McKenzie, Nicole; Wishner, Carolina; Sexton, Martha; Saevig, Danielle; Fink, Brian; Rega, Paul",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2019.67; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31337463/,77

Background: As a highly vulnerable group, people in need of long-term care are particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to their care-dependency, measures of social distancing can only be carried out to a very limited extent. In addition, the social and health consequences of reduced contacts are particularly high for nursing home residents. AIM The study aims to describe the extent to which nursing homes are affected, the human and material resources of nursing homes, the organizational handling of the situation, and their requests for public support. METHODS More than 7,000 nursing homes were invited to participate in an online survey with quantitative and qualitative elements. Data analysis applies descriptive statistics. RESULTS 824 nursing homes participated in the survey. One in five nursing homes has at least one confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 among its residents and / or employees. The initial lack of protective equipment has now decreased, but the facilities still have to cope with additional corona-related care needs with reduced staff. Nursing homes have banned contacts between residents and relative to an extent that now has to be reduced again. Nursing homes demand the provision and external financing of protective equipment as well as the systematic and regular testing of nursing staff and the provision of uniform guidelines for action throughout Germany. CONCLUSIONS As about half of all deceased people with COVID-19 have been living in nursing homes, the support of nursing homes in their attempt to restrict the pandemic requires highest attention.","Rothgang, Heinz; Domhoff, Dominik; Friedrich, Anna-Carina; Heinze, Franziska; Preuss, Benedikt; Schmidt, Annika; Seibert, Kathrin; Stolle, Claudia; Wolf-Ostermann, Karin",Pflege,https://doi.org/10.1024/1012-5302/a000760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32996856/,77
111355,Is COVID-19 a New Hematologic Disease?,2020-05-12,"OBJECTIVE Study the impact of local policies on near-future hospitalization and mortality rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS We introduce a novel risk-stratified SIR-HCD model that introduces new variables to model the dynamics of low-contact (e.g., work from home) and high-contact (e.g., work on-site) subpopulations while sharing parameters to control their respective R0(t) over time. We test our model on data of daily reported hospitalizations and cumulative mortality of COVID-19 in Harris County, Texas, from May 1, 2020, until October 4, 2020 , collected from multiple sources (USA FACTS, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council COVID-19 report, TMC daily news, and Johns Hopkins University county-level mortality reporting). RESULTS We evaluated our model's forecasting accuracy in Harris County, TX (the most populated county in the Greater Houston area) during Phase-I and Phase-II reopening. Not only does our model outperform other competing models, but it also supports counterfactual analysis to simulate the impact of future policies in a local setting, which is unique among existing approaches. DISCUSSION Mortality and hospitalization rates are significantly impacted by local quarantine and reopening policies. Existing models do not directly account for the effect of these policies on infection, hospitalization, and death rates in an explicit and explainable manner. Our work is an attempt to improve prediction of these trends by incorporating this information into the model, thus supporting decision-making. CONCLUSION Our work is a timely effort to attempt to model the dynamics of pandemics under the influence of local policies.","Huang, Tongtong; Chu, Yan; Shams, Shayan; Kim, Yejin; V Annapragada, Ananth; Subramanian, Devika; Kakadiaris, Ioannis; Gottlieb, Assaf; Jiang, Xiaoqian",Journal of biomedical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34022420/,77

Survey results from the Polish FD Collaborative Group.,2021-04-28,"OBJECTIVE Cancer and its treatment can lead to a variety of physical and emotional concerns impacting on those affected, including subclinical or clinical depression and anxiety, which in turn have a significant impact on wellbeing, quality of life and survival. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effect of yoga-based interventions on self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms in people with cancer in randomized controlled trials. METHOD Six databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Systematic review procedures were followed including a quality assessment. Meta-analysis of suitable studies was conducted. RESULTS 26 studies from our search criteria were eligible for inclusion for depressive and 16 for anxiety symptoms. Meta-analyses revealed evidence for significant medium effects of yoga on depression symptoms (N = 1,486, g = -0.419, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.558 to -0.281, p < 0.001) and anxiety (N = 977, g = -0.347, 95% CI = -0.473 to -0.221, p < 0.001) compared to controls. Subgroup analyses for depressive symptoms revealed significant effects for all analyses performed (type of cancer, type of control, treatment status, duration of intervention or frequency of yoga sessions), with effect sizes being comparable between subgroups. Similar findings were found for anxiety symptoms except for treatment status, where the only significant effect was found when yoga was delivered during active treatment. CONCLUSIONS This review provides evidence that in people with cancer, yoga-based interventions are associated with amelioration of depression and anxiety symptoms and therefore a promising therapeutic modality for their management. However, the potential for risk of bias together with control group design challenges means the results should be interpreted with caution.","Gonzalez, Maria; Pascoe, Michaela C; Yang, Guoyan; de Manincor, Michael; Grant, Suzanne; Lacey, Judith; Firth, Joseph; Sarris, Jerome",Psycho-oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763925/,77

Mainly, most of the studies evaluates postoperative early period results. Our aim in this study is to compare the long-term quality of life depending on the different surgical levels (sympathectomy levels) and evaluate the postoperative complications. METHODS 165 patients operated due to palmar hyperhidrosis between January 2012 and July 2017 were evaluated. Sympathectomy was performed either by clipping or cauterization and sympathetic nerves included were T2-4, T3-4, or T3 levels. Data were retrospectively reviewed for complications, factors affecting the postoperative quality of life. RESULTS Ninety of the patients were male (54.5%) and 75 (45.5%) were female. The level of ganglion block was T2-T4 in 62 patients (37.6%), T3-T4 in 46 patients (27.9%), and T3 in 57 patients (34.5%). Early complications were observed in 27 patients (16.4%). Compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH) was observed in 62 patients (37.6%). There was a significant difference in the postoperative quality of life according to ETS level (p < 0.001). Patients who underwent T2-T4 sympathectomy had a lower quality of life than patients who underwent isolated T3 or T3-T4 sympathectomy. CONCLUSION Based on our results, we recommend performing lower level resections to increase the long-term quality of life in palmar hyperhidrosis patients. The lower risk of CH and comparable quality of life suggest that T3 sympathectomy is more effective.","Dogru, Mustafa Vedat; Sezen, Celal Bugra; Girgin, Oguz; Cansever, Levent; Kocaturk, Celalettin Ibrahim; Metin, Muzaffer; Dincer, Seyyit Ibrahim",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11748-019-01210-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31542862/,77

The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 24, 2020 were investigated and prediction was made until April 15, 2020. METHODS By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and timedependent death rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. RESULTS Based on our predictions of Iran about 29000 people will be infected from March 25 to April 15, 2020. On average, 1292 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within 3 days (March 25 to March 27, 2020) and reaches its highest point on March 25, 2020 with 1715 infected cases.

112240,First-year complications after immediate breast reconstruction with a biological and a synthetic mesh in the same patient: A randomized controlled study.,2020-10-13,"An evolutionarily ancient plant hormone receptor complex comprising the α/β-fold hydrolase receptor KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (KAI2) and the F-box protein MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX2) mediates a range of developmental responses to smoke-derived butenolides called karrikins (KARs) and to yet elusive endogenous KAI2 ligands (KLs). Degradation of SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1) after ligand perception is considered to be a key step in KAR/KL signaling. However, molecular events which regulate plant development downstream of SMAX1 removal have not been identified. Here we show that Lotus japonicus SMAX1 is specifically degraded in the presence of KAI2 and MAX2 and plays an important role in regulating root and root hair development. smax1 mutants display very short primary roots and elongated root hairs. Their root transcriptome reveals elevated ethylene responses and expression of ACC Synthase 7 (ACS7), which encodes a rate-limiting enzyme in ethylene biosynthesis. smax1 mutants release increased amounts of ethylene and their root phenotype is rescued by treatment with ethylene biosynthesis and signaling inhibitors. KAR treatment induces ACS7 expression in a KAI2-dependent manner and root developmental responses to KAR treatment depend on ethylene signaling. Furthermore, in Arabidopsis, KAR-induced root hair elongation depends on ACS7 Thus, we reveal a connection between KAR/KL and ethylene signaling in which the KAR/KL signaling module (KAI2-MAX2-SMAX1) regulates the biosynthesis of ethylene to fine-tune root and root hair development, which are important for seedling establishment at the beginning of the plant life cycle.","Carbonnel, Samy; Das, Debatosh; Varshney, Kartikye; Kolodziej, Markus C; Villaécija-Aguilar, José A; Gutjahr, Caroline",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2006111117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32817510/,77
112321,An international collaborative study of 105 new cases of adenomatoid odontogenic tumors.,2020-06-09,"BACKGROUND Recruitment manoeuvres are often used to treat patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but the effect of this treatment on clinical outcomes has not been well established. OBJECTIVES The objective of this review was to examine recruitment manoeuvres compared to standard care as therapy for adults with acute lung injury in order to quantify the effects on patient outcomes (mortality, length of ventilation, and other relevant outcomes). SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2); MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2008); EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2008); LILACS (1982 to May 2008); CINAHL (1982 to May 2008); and Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials of adults who were mechanically ventilated comparing recruitment manoeuvres to standard care for those patients diagnosed with ALI or ARDS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. MAIN RESULTS Seven trials met the inclusion criteria for this review (the total number of included participants was 1170). All trials included a recruitment manoeuvre as part of the treatment strategy for patients on mechanical ventilation for ARDS or ALI. However, two of the trials included a package of ventilation that was different from the control ventilation in aspects other than the recruitment manoeuvre. The intervention group showed no significant difference on 28-day mortality (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.17, P = 0.2). Similarly there was no statistical difference for risk of barotrauma (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.52, P = 0.5) or blood pressure (MD 0.9 mm Hg, 95% CI -4.28 to 6.08, P = 0.73).

METHODS A literature search of MEDLINE, Google Scholar, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases was performed. Included studies reported outcomes related to RTP (time and rate), durability and player participation, and player performance following AT rupture in professional athletes of the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), and professional soccer leagues. RESULTS Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria for analysis. Athletes were able to return to professional sport participation 76% of the time, with mean time to RTP of 11 months following AT injury. Athletes experienced a decline in player efficiency ratings, power ratings, and sport- and position-specific statistics in the NFL, NBA, and professional soccer leagues compared to noninjured controls. RTP rate was significantly lower following AT rupture in comparison to athletes sustaining other common orthopaedic injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament injuries, meniscal tears, and ankle fractures in both NFL and NBA athletes. CONCLUSIONS AT rupture prohibits nearly 25% of professional athletes from returning to their respective sport. Of those able to return to compete at a professional level, the mean time to RTP is 11 months-nearly double the estimated 6-month recovery for RTP in the general population. Furthermore, player performance and durability were curtailed following AT rupture. This review of the literature should be used to set evidence-based goals and establish realistic expectations for RTP for elite athletes following AT injuries.

Many are important human pathogens such as DENV-1-4 (dengue virus types 1-4), WNV (West Nile virus), YFV (yellow fever virus), JEV (Japanese encephalitis virus) and TBEV (tick-borne encephalitis). Given their RNA genomes it is not surprising that flaviviral life cycles revolve around critical RNA transactions. It is these we highlight in the present article. First, we summarize the mechanisms governing flaviviral replication and the central role of conserved RNA elements and viral protein-RNA interactions in RNA synthesis, translation and packaging. Secondly, we focus on how host RNA-binding proteins both benefit and inhibit flaviviral replication at different stages of their life cycle in mammalian hosts. Thirdly, we cover recent studies on viral non-coding RNAs produced in flavivirus-infected cells and how these RNAs affect various aspects of cellular RNA metabolism. Together, the article puts into perspective the central role of flaviviral RNAs in modulating both viral and cellular functions.","Bidet, Katell; Garcia-Blanco, Mariano A",The Biochemical journal,https://doi.org/10.1042/bj20140456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102029/,77
113052,Minimum staffing requirements for the performance of GI endoscopy.,2010,"Background Aquaculture systems for giant gourami, Osphronemus goramy Lacepède (1801), have significantly improved fish production yields and food security in Indonesia. However, these systems also cause serious problems in terms of eutrophication in waterbodies. This study analysed the nutrient loading and farm characteristics of giant gourami in floating cages in Lake Maninjau. Method A total of 20 floating cages were used to record these nutrients in feed supply, female and male juvenile fish, dead fish and harvested fish to estimate nutrient loading. Data on the harvested fish, production cycle, stock number and cage capacity were used to estimate the stocking density, feeding rate, feed efficiency, and net fish yield, and the relationship between feed supply and nutrient loading and farm characteristics was analysed by least squares regression methods. Results A total of 20 floating cages released nutrients into waterbodies at an average rate of 236.27±60.44 kg/cycle for C, 84.52±20.86 kg/cycle for N and 8.70±3.63 kg/cycle for P. On average, fish production for each floating cage (±SD) was 1226±282 kg wet weight/cycle, and the net fish yield was 12.63±2.82 kg/m 3/cycle. Survival rates ranged from 86.33 to 95.27%/cycle. The production cycles varied from 160 to 175 days with feed conversion ratios between 1.60 and 1.75, feed conversion efficiencies were between 0.58 and 0.63. The production parameters that had strong relationships with the net fish yield were feed supply ( r 2=0.960), stocking rates ( r 2=0.924) and feeding rates ( r 2=0.961). In contrast, the length of the production cycle was not strongly related to the net fish yield ( r 2=0.187). Conclusion Nutrient loading from the supplied feed was greater than that from the harvested fish, juvenile fish and dead fish. Increasing the net fish yield in floating cages was better predicted by the stocking densities and feeding levels than by the other factors.","Syandri, Hafrijal; Azrita, Azrita; Sumiarsih, Eni; Undefined, Elfiondri",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.52613.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34621506/,77

Mesh placement for the prevention of trocar site incisional hernia (TSIH) is still a controversial issue. We tested the hypothesis that closure with an intraperitoneal prophylactic mesh of the umbilical trocar after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy can reduce the incidence of a TSIH in high-risk patients. STUDY DESIGN A randomized clinical trial was conducted among patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy who presented the following high-risk factors for incisional hernia, according to the literature: age 65 years and older, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary disease, and obesity (ie, body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2)). Patients were assigned to have closure of the umbilical trocar site with either nonabsorbable sutures (group A) or intraperitoneal polypropylene omega-3 mesh (group B). Trocar site incisional hernia, pain, and surgical complications were evaluated at the early postoperative course and at 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS A total of 106 patients were randomized into the study and 92 patients were finally analyzed, including 47 in group A and 45 in group B. The TSIH rate was higher in group A (31.9%) than in group B (4.4%) (odds ratio = 10.1; 95% CI, 2.15-47.6; p < 0.001)). The wound infection rate was 4.3%; 8.5% in group A and 0% in group B (odds ratio = 2.04; 95% CI, 1.7-2.5; p = 0.045). Median postoperative pain evaluated by a visual analogue scale was 3 in group A and 2 in group B (p = 0.05). No differences were observed in complication rate, operative time, or hospital stay between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Prosthetic closure of the umbilical trocar site after laparoscopic surgery could become the standard method for preventing TSIH in high-risk patients.","Armañanzas, Laura; Ruiz-Tovar, Jaime; Arroyo, Antonio; García-Peche, Pedro; Armañanzas, Ernesto; Diez, María; Galindo, Isabel; Calpena, Rafael",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2014.01.049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680572/,77

We describe a needs assessment, design, implementation, and descriptive evaluation of an oncology-specific pilot clinical encounter program developed for PhD students in the Cancer Biology Training Area (CAB) in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) and Tisch Cancer Institute (TCI) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). Prior to the development of this pilot program, CAB students, in years 2-5 + , were surveyed to determine their interest in a structured clinical experience. Seventeen out of thirty-one students responded (55%) to the survey. Of those seventeen respondents, fifteen (88.2%) expressed that exposure to cancer patients in the clinical setting would be useful for their pre-doctoral biomedical science and cancer biology training and indicated an interest in participating in the clinical encounter program. Based on these responses, a three-session clinical encounter pilot program was designed. Two separate cohorts of 5 students participated in this pilot program. During a formal debrief, following the clinical experience, students commented on the resilience of patients and the importance of research on clinical decision making, and reported that they found the experience motivational. Five out of 10 students responded (50%) to a post-program assessment survey; all five respondents answered that they would recommend the clinical encounter program to their peers. While limited in size and scope, this pilot TCI Clinical Encounter Program proved feasible and has the potential to enrich and inform the experience of PhD students pursing advanced degrees in a cancer biology.","Real, Alexander M; Lin, Jenny J; Gabrilove, Janice L",Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-021-02088-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651280/,77

RECENT FINDINGS Community-based interventions and telemedicine may be useful in increasing access to care and identifying/assisting patients with HTN, especially in populations with geographical and economic barriers to healthcare. Home blood pressure monitoring is beneficial for HTN control in diverse regions. Polypills have proven benefits to decrease HTN and CVD risk. Continuation of treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers in high risk COVID-19 patients appears appropriate. SUMMARY Extensive research demonstrates that early screening/treatment, lifestyle modification, and pharmacotherapy are essential to control HTN worldwide.

Development of anti-Trichinella vaccines is prospective to eliminate Trichinella infection in food animal. The aim of this study was to assess the biological properties of a novel T. spiralis trypsin (TsT) and its elicited immune protection against larval challenge. The cDNA sequence of TsT gene was cloned and expressed. Western blotting showed rTsT was identified by infection serum and anti-TsT serum. RT-PCR results revealed that TsT gene was transcribed at diverse T. spiralis lifecycle stages. The IIFT results showed that natural TsT was principally expressed at epicuticle of 5-6 day adult worms, indicating that TsT is a worm somatic antigen and adult-stage specific surface antigen. Vaccination of mice with rTsT triggered an evident humoral immune response (high levels of serum IgG, IgG1/IgG2a, and enteral sIgA), and it also induced the systemic and enteral local cellular immune response, demonstrated by an significantly elevation of cytokines IFN-γ and IL-4. The mice vaccinated with rTsT exhibited a 33.17% reduction of enteral adult worms and a 37.80% reduction of muscle larvae after larval challenge.

114312,A model to measure lymphatic drainage from the eye.,2011,"OBJECTIVES To analyze the association between morbid obesity and COVID-19 hospitalization and severe disease. METHODS We evaluated the incidence of hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a prospective population-based cohort of 433,995 persons aged 25-79 years in Spain during March and April 2020. Persons with and without morbid obesity were compared using Poisson regression to estimate the adjusted relative risk (aRR) of morbid obesity for COVID-19 hospitalization and for severe disease (intensive care unit admission or death). Differences in the effect by age, sex and chronic conditions were evaluated. RESULTS Individuals with morbid obesity had higher risk of hospitalization (aRR=2.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.66-2.93) and severe COVID-19 (aRR=2.30; 95%CI 1.20-4.40). In people younger than 50 years, these effects were more pronounced (aRR=5.02, 95%CI 3.19-7.90; and aRR=13.80, 95%CI 3.11-61.17, respectively), while no significant effects were observed in those aged 65-79 years (aRR=1.22, 95%CI 0.70-2.12; and aRR=1.42, 95%CI 0.52-3.88, respectively). Sex and chronic conditions did not modify the effect of morbid in any of the outcomes.

114354,Surgical procedure for a late abdominal pregnancy with complete placenta removal.,2017,"The rationale for single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is minimizing morbidity, as well as improving cosmetic results of laparoscopic approach. This technique has been used for a variety of procedures and has recently been proposed for colonic resections as well. We report our preliminary experience of right colectomy, performed through a SILS approach. Five patients (3 males, 2 females, mean age 81.6 years) were selected to undergo SILS right colectomy for cancer. The procedure was carried out through a SILS multi-port device (SILS™ Port, Covidien Ltd, Norwalk, CT, USA), with either conventional or specially designed instruments. A medial-to-lateral approach and an extra-corporeal anastomosis were performed. In three cases, the procedure was completed through the SILS technique; in two of these cases a combined procedure was carried out (right colectomy plus cholecystectomy, right colectomy plus cholecystectomy plus i.o. colonoscopy and polypectomy). In one case, a switch to standard laparoscopy was necessary because of the large dimension of the tumour, while in the other case an intolerance of pneumoperitoneum was registered, thus requiring a conversion to open surgery. SILS procedures proved to be oncologically correct. No major complications occurred. In selected patients, SILS right colectomy for cancer appears to be feasible and oncologically safe. Beyond the cosmetic advantage, the procedure may reduce postoperative morbidity. Further studies are needed, with larger series and a longer follow-up, to determine the incidence of possible long-term complications and to evaluate possible cost-effectiveness of the procedure.","Pietrasanta, Dario; Romano, Nicola; Prosperi, Valerio; Lorenzetti, Luca; Basili, Giancarlo; Goletti, Orlando",Updates in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-010-0023-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20872107/,77

This article discusses the optimum design of an indoor and semi-outdoor air purifier, using a water-based filtration system. METHODS An air purifier was fabricated, then comparison of purifying efficacy of the system between untreated air and using an air pump was done. Incense smoke was generated within a room for 10 seconds. The number of particle sizes of PM0.3, PM0.5, PM1.0, PM3.0, PM5.0, and PM10 μm (particle/m3) as well as the detection of mass concentration of PM1.0, PM2.5, PM5.0, and PM10 (mg/m3) at 0 and 5 minutes were recorded. Each experiment was repeated 10 times. RESULTS Particles in untreated air, except PM10, showed the maximum increase rate of the number of particle sizes greater than the air pump experiment. The highest differentiation between two methods was that PM1.0 and PM0.5 of untreated air increased to 113.647 and 61.539 % whereas the air pump method showed 4.720 and 2.533 %, respectively. The PM mass concentration of untreated air increased from 50.217 to 51.167 % while the increased rate of PM using an air pump was 2.784 to 2.902 %. CONCLUSION This study proposed a water-based air filtration technique, which can reduce the level of particulate matter, and also is a low-cost prototype. For the next experiment, the study should extend test length, clarify an optimum ratio of disinfectant technologies, connect with the internet of things, compare the efficiency with a HEPA filter air purifier, and then also measure some particles which are smaller than 0.2 μm.","Jumlongkul, Arnon",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33844972/,77
114739,Alectinib for Retinal Metastasis of a Primary Mucinous Adenocarcinoma of the Lung.,2020-12-29,"BACKGROUND Neuroinflammation has long been considered a driver of Alzheimer's disease progression. However, experiments developed to explore the interaction between neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology showed a surprising reduction in amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque deposition. We sought to understand this unexpected outcome by examining microglia phenotypes during chronic neuroinflammation. METHODS Using an adeno-associated virus vector carrying hIL-1β cDNA, inflammation was induced in one hippocampus of 8-month-old amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 mice for 4 weeks, while the other hemisphere received control injections. Bone marrow chimeras and staining analysis were used to identify the origins and types of immune cells present during sustained inflammation. Arginase 1 (Arg1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunoreactivity were used as markers of alternatively activated and classically activated cells, respectively, and changes in cellular uptake of Aβ by Arg1+ or iNOS+ microglia was demonstrated by confocal microscopy. To determine if an anti-inflammatory phenotype was present during neuroinflammation, RNA was extracted on flow-sorted microglia and rt-PCR was performed. Interleukin-4 injection was used to induce alternatively activated cells, whereas a minipump and intrahippocampal cannula was used to deliver an interleukin (IL)-4Rα antibody to block the induction of Arg1+ cells in the setting of sustained IL-1β expression. RESULTS We observed a robust upregulation of centrally derived Arg1+ microglia present only in the inflamed hemisphere. Furthermore, in the inflamed hemisphere, greater numbers of Arg1+ microglia contained Aβ when compared to iNOS+ microglia. RNA isolated from flow-sorted microglia from the inflamed hemisphere demonstrated elevation of mRNA species consistent with alternative activation as well as neuroprotective genes such as BDNF and IGF1. To explore if Arg1+ microglia mediated plaque reduction, we induced Arg1+ microglia with IL-4 and observed significant plaque clearance. Moreover, when we reduced Arg1+ microglia induction in the context of neuroinflammation using an anti-IL-4Rα antibody delivered via intrahippocampal cannula, we observed a clear correlation between numbers of Arg1+ microglia and plaque reduction. CONCLUSIONS Together, these findings suggest that Arg1+ microglia are involved in Aβ plaque reduction during sustained, IL-1β-dependent neuroinflammation, opening up possible new avenues for immunomodulatory therapy of AD.","Cherry, Jonathan D; Olschowka, John A; O'Banion, M Kerry",Journal of neuroinflammation,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-015-0411-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26538310/,77

Increased age is associated with a significant increase in postoperative atrial fibrillation risk. This common complication is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of nebivolol in preventing atrial fibrillation following coronary artery bypass surgery in patients over 60 years of age. METHODS In this prospective randomized study, 200 patients who were candidates for elective coronary artery bypass surgery were divided into two groups. The first group was administered with nebivolol and the second group was administered with metoprolol. Treatment was initiated four days prior to surgery, and patients were monitored for atrial fibrillation until discharge. Forty-one patients received 50 mg metoprolol succinate daily, which was initiated minimum 4 days before surgery. RESULTS Demographic data were similar in both groups. The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in both groups was similar, with no significant difference being identified [n=20 (20%); n=18 (18%), P=0.718; respectively]. There were not any mortality at both groups during study. Inotropic agent requirement at ICU was similar for both groups [n=12 (12%), n=18 (18%), P=0.32]. CONCLUSION We compared the effectiveness of nebivolol and metoprolol in decreasing the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, and determined that nebivolol was as effective as metoprolol in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation at patients. Nebivolol may be the drug of choice due to its effects, especially after elective coronary artery bypass surgery.","Erdil, Nevzat; Kaynak, Murat; Dönmez, Köksal; Disli, Olcay Murat; Battaloglu, Bektas",Revista brasileira de cirurgia cardiovascular : orgao oficial da Sociedade Brasileira de Cirurgia Cardiovascular,https://doi.org/10.5935/1678-9741.20140078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25714213/,77

In order to assess contribution of protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) in the pathogenesis of migraine, we quantified expression levels of PIAS1-PIAS4 genes in the circulation of patients with migraine compared with controls. Expression of PIAS1 was substantially lower in total migraineurs compared with controls (ratio of mean expressions (RME) = 0.18, SE = 0.29, P value < 0.001) and in both male and female migraineurs compared with sex-matched controls. Expression of PIAS2 was lower in migraineurs without aura compared with controls (RME = 0.64, SE = 0.31, P value = 0.04) and in male subgroup of these patients compared with male controls (RME = 0.60, SE = 0.22, P value < 0.001). In migraineurs with aura, downregulation of PIAS2 was only observed among male subgroups (RME = 0.37, SE = 0.49, P value = 0.01). PIAS3 was downregulated in total male migraineurs (RME = 0.52, SE = 0.43, P value = 0.04) and in male migraineurs with aura (RME = 0.49, SE = 0.45, P value = 0.03) compared with male controls.

115490,The role of endoscopy in the management of suspected small-bowel bleeding.,2017,"A series of NiAl-Cr-Mo systems were produced and assessed as far as their microstructure and their sliding wear resistance is concerned. The NiAl content was kept constant and seven compositions of Cr-Mo were tested, namely, 40Cr-0Mo, 30Cr-10Mo, 25Cr-15Mo, 20Cr-20Mo, 15Cr-25Mo, 10Cr-30Mo, and 0Cr-40Mo. It was observed that most of the systems contained primary phases, eutectic microconstituents, and, occasionally, intermetallic phases as the outcome of peritectic reactions. The extent and the nature of all these microstructural features was proved to be affected by the Cr/Mo relative ratio, and an attempt was conducted in order to explain the microstructural features based on solidification and other related phenomena.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Two hundred patients undergoing laparoscopic RYGB were prospectively randomized regarding running enterotomy closure of the linear stapled gastrojejunal (GJA) and jejunojejunal anastomosis (JJA). Two groups were created: V-group (Vicryl® 2/0-Ethicon) and S-group (Stratafix™ 2/0-Ethicon). Time spent on closing the enterotomies was measured from first needle in until knot and cut (V-group) or last stitch and cut (S-group). If needed, a nonabsorbable ""correction"" (""c""; in order to close a small hiatus at the anastomosis) or hemostatic (""h"") stitch was made (using a single Prolene® 2/0-Ethicon). RESULTS Average total procedure time was similar (S-group 1:01:22, V-group 1:00:44, P = 0.340). Closure of the enterotomy (GJA) was significantly shorter in the S-group (07:41 min versus 08:13 min in the V-group, P = 0.005). Extra stitches (GJA) were performed in 33 patients (16.5%): 3 (h) and 20 (c) in the V-group and 1 (h) and 9 (c) in the S-group. Four patients in the V-group suffered from postoperative intraluminal bleeding (3 self-limiting, 1 underwent endoscopic clipping). In the S-group, 1 patient suffered from leakage at the vertical transected staple line of the stomach. CONCLUSIONS The use of unidirectional barbed sutures for running enterotomy closure after linear stapled RYGB is feasible and safe. Significant time benefit was seen regarding the closure of the GJA. Fewer additional stitches were necessary and postoperative intraluminal bleeding was less encountered.","Gys, Ben; Gys, Tobie; Lafullarde, Thierry",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-017-2628-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28281235/,77

Its selective antioxidant properties were well noticed. Most of the ionizing radiation-induced damage is caused by hydroxyl radicals (OH) from radiolysis of H2O. Since hydrogen can mitigate such damage through multiple mechanisms, it presents noteworthy potential as a novel radio-protective agent. This review analyses possible mechanisms for hydrogen's radioprotective properties and effective delivery methods. We also look into details of vitro and vivo studies for hydrogen's radioprotective effects, and clinical practices. We conclude that hydrogen has good potential in radio-protection, with evidence that warrants greater research efforts in this field.","Hu, Qiongge; Zhou, Yunxiang; Wu, Shijie; Wu, Wei; Deng, Yongchuan; Shao, Anwen",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763820/,77
116131,A most hazardous year.,2021-01-01,"The phenotype of infused cells is a major determinant of Adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) efficacy. Yet, the difficulty in deciphering multiparametric cytometry data limited the fine characterization of cellular products. To allow the analysis of dynamic and complex flow cytometry samples we developed cytoChain, a novel dataset mining tool and a new analytical workflow. CytoChain was challenged to compare state-of-the-art and innovative culture conditions to generate stem-like memory cells (TSCM ) suitable for ACT. Noticeably, the combination of IL-7/15 and super-oxides scavenging sustained the emergence of a previously un-identified non-exhausted Fit-TSCM signature, overlooked by manual gating and endowed with superior expansion potential. CytoChain proficiently traced back this population in independent datasets, and in T-cell receptor engineered lymphocytes. cytoChain flexibility and function were then further validated on a published dataset from circulating T cells in COVID-19 patients. Collectively, our results support the use of cytoChain to identify novel, functionally critical immunophenotypes for ACT and patients immunomonitoring. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS The clinical interventional, prospective, single-centre, case series study included patients with age-related macular degeneration-related geographic atrophy (GA), in whom the eye with the worse best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) underwent a single, or repeated, intravitreal injection of EGF (0.75 µg in 50 µL). At baseline and afterwards, the eyes underwent ophthalmological examinations. RESULTS The study included seven patients (mean age:70.0±12.2 years (range: 54-86 years), with five patients receiving a single injection and two patients receiving two intravitreal injections in an interval of 4 weeks. Mean duration of follow-up was 97±97 days (median:35 days; range: 7-240 days). Mean BCVA was lower at baseline than at study end (1.41±0.44 logMAR vs 0.97±0.12 logMAR; p=0.03). Mean size of the GA lesions did not differ significantly between baseline and study end (29 212±22 887 pixels vs 29 300±22 905 pixels; p=0.59) nor did the mean perimetric mean defect (-10.3±5.9 dB vs 12.0±8.8 dB; p=0.35) or the electroretinographical b-wave amplitude (44.53±31.7 µV vs 64.5±25.5 µV; p=0.12). After a second injection 4 weeks after the first injection, one of two patients developed a cystoid macular oedema in association with an induced incomplete posterior vitreous detachment. It persisted for 3 weeks. Visual acuity in this eye improved from 1.0 logMAR at baseline to 0.80 logMAR at study end. CONCLUSIONS Except for one eye with temporary, self-resolving cystoid macular oedema, single and repeated intravitreal applications of EGF (0.75 µg) in patients with GA did not lead to intraocular inflammations or any observed intraocular side effect.

Objective To compare the change in the rate of memory decline after CABG vs PCI. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study of community-dwelling participants in the Health and Retirement Study, who underwent CABG or PCI between 1998 and 2015 at age 65 years or older. Data were modeled for up to 5 years preceding and 10 years following revascularization or until death, drop out, or the 2016-2017 interview wave. The date of final follow-up was November 2017. Exposures CABG (including on and off pump) or PCI, ascertained from Medicare fee-for-service billing records. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was a summary measure of cognitive test scores and proxy cognition reports that were performed biennially in the Health and Retirement Study, referred to as memory score, normalized as a z score (ie, mean of 0, SD of 1 in a reference population of adults aged ≥72 years). Memory score was analyzed using multivariable linear mixed-effects models, with a prespecified subgroup analysis of on-pump and off-pump CABG. The minimum clinically important difference was a change of 1 SD of the population-level rate of memory decline (0.048 memory units/y). Results Of 1680 participants (mean age at procedure, 75 years; 41% female), 665 underwent CABG (168 off pump) and 1015 underwent PCI. In the PCI group, the mean rate of memory decline was 0.064 memory units/y (95% CI, 0.052 to 0.078) before the procedure and 0.060 memory units/y (95% CI, 0.048 to 0.071) after the procedure (within-group change, 0.004 memory units/y [95% CI, -0.010 to 0.018]). In the CABG group, the mean rate of memory decline was 0.049 memory units/y (95% CI, 0.033 to 0.065) before the procedure and 0.059 memory units/y (95% CI, 0.047 to 0.072) after the procedure (within-group change, -0.011 memory units/y [95% CI, -0.029 to 0.008]). The between-group difference-in-differences estimate for memory decline for PCI vs CABG was 0.015 memory units/y (95% CI, -0.008 to 0.038; P = .21). There was statistically significant increase in the rate of memory decline after off-pump CABG compared with after PCI (difference-in-differences: mean increase in the rate of decline of 0.046 memory units/y [95% CI, 0.008 to 0.084] after off-pump CABG), but not after on-pump CABG compared with PCI (difference-in-differences: mean slowing of decline of 0.003 memory units/y [95% CI, -0.024 to 0.031] after on-pump CABG). Conclusions and Relevance Among older adults undergoing coronary revascularization with CABG or PCI, the type of revascularization procedure was not significantly associated with differences in the change of rate of memory decline.","Whitlock, Elizabeth L; Diaz-Ramirez, L Grisell; Smith, Alexander K; Boscardin, W John; Covinsky, Kenneth E; Avidan, Michael S; Glymour, M Maria",JAMA,https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.5150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34003225/,77

DESIGN An exploratory study incorporating social network and phylogenetic analysis. METHODS Recently diagnosed HIV-infected MSM attending one major HIV specialist clinic in Hong Kong were recruited in the study involving the administration of a self-administered questionnaire on behaviours and partnership patterns using a Likert Scale, the results of which were assessed using social network analysis and in context of the phylogenetic analysis from sequencing the HIV-1 pol gene, as part of the clinical investigation for genotypic resistance. Clusters were defined using social and molecular methods. RESULTS An 'Internet-centred' cluster and 'Sauna-centred' cluster could be delineated using correspondence analysis and network diagrams. The main distinguishing features of MSM in the 'Internet-centred' social cluster were: younger age, higher education level, and multiple partner types. Three genetic clusters could be identified in the phylogenetic tree, two of which associated with Internet use and one with sauna for sex partnership. There were partial overlaps between social and genetic clusters. Characteristically, the virus strains in sauna users were more disperse compared with the closely knit configuration of those using Internet. CONCLUSION The principle of the duality of place and person can be strategically applied in epidemiologic investigation. The characterization of MSM cluster using anonymized network data provides a potentially powerful tool for informing public health intervention.","Lee, Shui Shan; Tam, Dennise K P; Tan, Yi; Mak, Wai Lai; Wong, Ka Hing; Chen, Jonathan H K; Yam, Wing Cheong",AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/qad.0b013e32832dc025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19609202/,77

Ventilation may exert detrimental hemodynamic effects that must be balanced with its expected benefits. The risks of hyperventilation have been thoroughly addressed, even questioning the need for ventilation, emphasizing the need to prioritize chest compression quality. However, ventilation is mandatory for adequate gas exchange as soon as CPR is prolonged. Factors affecting the capability of chest compressions to produce alveolar ventilation are poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the conventional interpretation of interactions between ventilation and circulation, from the perspective of novel physiological observations. RECENT FINDINGS Many patients with cardiac arrest exhibit 'intrathoracic airway closure.' This phenomenon is associated with lung volume reduction, impedes chest compressions to generate ventilation and overall limits the delivered ventilation. This phenomenon can be reversed by the application of small levels of positive end-expiratory pressure. Also, a novel interpretation of the capnogram can rate the magnitude of this phenomenon, contributing to clarify the physiological meaning of exhaled CO2 and may help assess the real amount of delivered ventilation. SUMMARY Recent advances in the understanding of ventilatory physiology during CPR shows that capnogram analysis not only provides information on the quality of resuscitation but also on the amount of ventilation produced by chest compressions and on the total amount of ventilation.","Cordioli, Ricardo L; Grieco, Domenico L; Charbonney, Emmanuel; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Savary, Dominique",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30531537/,77

118092,An in vitro comparison of tracheostomy tube cuffs.,2015,"Recently, human infections caused by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), which can lead to fatality, have dramatically increased in East Asia. With the unavailability of vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent and/or treat SFTSV infection, early rapid diagnosis is critical for prevention and control of the disease. Here, we report the development of a simple, rapid and sensitive portable detection method for SFTSV infection applying reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) combined with one-pot colorimetric visualization and electro-free reaction platform. This method utilizes a pocket warmer to facilitate diagnosis in a resource-limited setting. Specific primers were designed to target the highly-conserved region of L gene of SFTSV. The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was approximately 100 viral genome copies from three different SFTSV strains. This assay exhibited comparable sensitivity to qRT-PCR and 10-fold more sensitivity than conventional RT-PCR, with a rapid detection time of 30 to 60 minutes. The RT-LAMP assay using SFTSV clinical specimens has demonstrated a similar detection rate to qRT-PCR and a higher detection rate compared to conventional RT-PCR. Moreover, there was no observed cross-reactive amplification of other human infectious viruses including Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), Dengue, Enterovirus, Zika, Influenza and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

118642,Sidestream capnographic monitoring reduces the incidence of arterial oxygen desaturation during propofol ambulatory anesthesia for surgical abortion.,2014,"UNLABELLED The replication of coronaviruses occurs in association with multiple virus-induced membrane structures that evolve during the course of infection; however, the dynamics of this process remain poorly understood. Previous studies of coronavirus replication complex organization and protein interactions have utilized protein overexpression studies and immunofluorescence of fixed cells. Additionally, live-imaging studies of coronavirus replicase proteins have used fluorescent reporter molecules fused to replicase proteins, but expressed from nonnative locations, mostly late-transcribed subgenomic mRNAs, in the presence or absence of the native protein. Thus, the timing and targeting of native replicase proteins expressed in real time from native locations in the genome remain unknown. In this study, we tested whether reporter molecules could be expressed from the replicase polyprotein of murine hepatitis virus as fusions with nonstructural protein 2 or 3 and whether such reporters could define the targeting and activity of replicase proteins during infection. We demonstrate that the fusion of green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase with either nonstructural protein 2 or 3 is tolerated and that these reporter-replicase fusions can be used to quantitate replication complex formation and virus replication. The results show that the replicase gene has flexibility to accommodate a foreign gene addition and can be used directly to study replicase complex formation and evolution during infection as well as to provide highly sensitive and specific markers for protein translation and genome replication. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses that are important agents of disease, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Replication is associated with multiple virus-induced membrane structures that evolve during infection; however, the dynamics of this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we tested whether reporter molecules expressed from native locations within the replicase polyprotein of murine hepatitis virus as fusions with nonstructural proteins could define the expression and targeting of replicase proteins during infection in live cells. We demonstrate that the replicase gene tolerates the introduction of green fluorescent protein or firefly luciferase as fusions with replicase proteins. These viruses allow early quantitation of virus replication as well as real-time measurement of replication complexes.","Freeman, Megan Culler; Graham, Rachel L; Lu, Xiaotao; Peek, Christopher T; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00021-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623413/,77

The general morphology of the columella shows considerable variation across species, yet few studies have attempted to provide quantitative comparisons, and basic anatomical data has not been thoroughly reported. In this study, we examined the middle ear in 49 taxonomically diverse species of bird. We found significant correlations between measurements of several features (columellar length, mass, tympanic membrane area, footplate area) and interaural diameter. While scaling of columellar length with interaural diameter is consistent with isometry, masses and areas showed negative allometry, or a non-proportional scaling with interaural diameter. These observations remained true even for species with unusual middle ear morphology, such as Alcedinidae (Kingfishers) in which the basal struts of the columella form a structure almost resembling a mammalian stapes, or Tytonidae (Barn Owls) which have a highly bulbous footplate.

However, there is a lack of studies investigating whether these factors are associated with expectations of longevity. Therefore, we aimed to clarify this association. METHODS Cross-sectional data were taken from a nationally representative sample of middle-aged and older individuals (analytical sample, n = 4857). Well-established scales were used to measure loneliness and social isolation. Equally to other large cohort studies, expectations of longevity were assessed using the question 'What age do you think you will live to?' It was adjusted for various socioeconomic and health-related factors. RESULTS After adjusting for various socioeconomic and health-related covariates, multiple linear regressions showed that both loneliness (total sample: β = -0.97, P < 0.001; men: β = -1.04, P < 0.001; women: β = -0.97, P < 0.01) and social isolation (total sample: β = -0.93, P < 0.001; men: β = -0.86, P < 0.001; women: β = -0.91, P < 0.01) were associated with lower expectations of longevity in the total sample and stratified by gender. Furthermore, lower expectations of longevity were consistently associated with younger age (β = 0.32, P < 0.001), being retired (β = -2.39, P < 0.001), not being employed (β = -1.97, P < 0.001), worse self-rated health (β = -1.31, P < 0.001), and a higher number of chronic illnesses (β = -0.38, P < 0.001) in the total sample, and in both genders. CONCLUSIONS Even after adjusting for various covariates, findings still indicate an association between both loneliness and social isolation and markedly lower expectations of longevity.

Aim of this research article is to investigate whether different metabolomic profiles occurred according to oxygen concentration administered at resuscitation. In order to perform the experiment, forty newborn piglets were subjected to normocapnic hypoxia and reoxygenation and were randomly allocated in 4 groups resuscitated with different oxygen concentrations, 18%, 21%, 40%, and 100%, respectively. Urine metabolic profiles at baseline and at hypoxia were analysed by (1)H-NMR spectroscopy and metabolites were also identified by multivariate statistical analysis. Metabolic pathways associations were also built up by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Bioinformatics analysis of metabolites characterized the effect of metabolism in the 4 groups; it showed that the 21% of oxygen is the most ""physiological"" and appropriate concentration to be used for resuscitation. Our data indicate that resuscitation with 21% of oxygen seems to be optimal in terms of survival, rapidity of resuscitation, and metabolic profile in the present animal model. These findings need to be confirmed with metabolomics in human and, if so, the knowledge of the perinatal asphyxia condition may significantly improve.","Fanos, V; Noto, A; Xanthos, T; Lussu, M; Murgia, F; Barberini, L; Finco, G; d'Aloja, E; Papalois, A; Iacovidou, N; Atzori, L",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/731620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24696864/,77

Methods Data of 21 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 84 patients with suspected COVID-19 were analyzed by RT-PCR. The epidemiologic and clinical features as well as clinical outcomes were compared between the confirmed and suspected cases. Results Altogether 105 patients had been enrolled in this study by February 15, 2020 in north Shanghai, including 21 confirmed cases and 84 suspected cases of COVID-19. The incubation period of these confirmed patients with imported COVID-19 was 17.6 days (IQR 5-34 days) and the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 145.64 h (IQR 21-441 h). More than 50% of the confirmed patients were older than 51 (range, 51-60) years. Fifty (59.5%) of the 84 probably patients were younger than 40 years, including 27 (32%) patients younger than 30 years. Most confirmed patients were men (61.9%, 13/21), and less than 50% of them had underlying diseases, including diabetes (9.5%, 2/21), hypertension (19%, 4/21), COPD (23.8%, 5/21), and CD (23.8%, 5/21). In addition, 10 (47.6%) of the 21 confirmed patients were ordinary employees, and 12 (57.2%) of them had recently been to Wuhan or had close contacts with people from Wuhan. Of the 84 suspected patients, 28 (33.3%) were retired employees; 69 (82.1%) had recently been to supermarkets and groceries or had a history of traveling abroad or to other cities of China. The common onset symptoms of the patients in both groups were fever and cough. The symptom of Sputum production was more pronounced in probably patients (40.5%, 34/84) than that in confirmed patients (9.5%, 2/21). More than 50% imported patients (53.3%, 56/105) had one and two affected lobes. Twenty-nine (27.6%) of the 105 imported patients had been discharged, no patient had died, and all the other patients are still in hospital. Conclusions The overall incubation period in this cohort of imported confirmed COVID-19 patients was longer than that in Wuhan, mostly infecting older men. The disease onset of imported COVID-19 infection was occult, and the clinical symptoms were usually mild, mostly presenting as low fever, fatigue, light cough, and mild dyspnea.","Xie, Shuanshuan; Zhang, Guoliang; Yu, Hong; Wang, Jin; Wang, Sheng; Tang, Guangyu; Guo, Changfeng; Li, Jiyu; Wei, Songhua; Wang, Changhui; Qin, Huanlong",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-2119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566574/,77

121641,Generative adversarial networks in ophthalmology: what are these and how can they be used?,2021-07-27,"OBJECTIVE The virtual interview season has challenged general surgery residency programs to recruit applicants through the loss of visiting clerkships, tours, and time with residents. Webinars, increased informal resident and faculty sessions, and live-narrated video tours are potential solutions. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of these elements in virtually showcasing a residency program during the virtual interview season. DESIGN/SETTING Prospective applicants to one general surgery residency program (Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota) were invited to attend six webinars: Program Overview, Simulation Education, Diversity, Resident Life, Mingle with Residents, and Last-Minute Q&A. An anonymous survey was sent to all registered participants of the webinars. Interviewees participated in a preinterview social hour with resident and faculty and a live-narrated video tour of our facilities during their interview. A second anonymous survey was sent to all interviewees. PARTICIPANTS Webinars - 33% of 159 unique registrants surveyed participated. Interviews - 46% of 109 interviewees surveyed participated. RESULTS Average satisfaction with the webinars was 9.4/10. Overall, 98% of attendees felt that the webinars gave them a ""feel"" for the program. Attendees found the Last-Minute Q&A webinar and Program Overview to be most useful. For resident-led webinars, 100% of attendees felt that themed break-out rooms were effective. Average satisfaction with the interviews was 4.4/5. Interviewees rated access to faculty and residents highly (4.4/5 and 4.5/5, respectively). 98% of interviewees found the live-narrated video tour helpful. CONCLUSIONS A webinar curriculum can be effective in virtual residency recruitment, as prospective applicants developed a good understanding of the resident program after participating. Further, live-narrated video tours and purposefully incorporating several avenues for informal conversations with residents and faculty can successfully address applicant concerns about virtual interviews.","Lund, Sarah; MacArthur, Taleen; Keune, Jonie; Enger, Teresa; Martinez-Jorge, Jorys; McKenzie, Travis; Nelson, Megan; Olson, Angela; Que, Florencia; Stulak, John; Rivera, Mariela",Journal of surgical education,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2021.04.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34090839/,77

This study was intended to explore the psychological and physiological responses of patients with GAD after cycling in a virtual environment containing natural images. Seventy-seven participants with GAD were recruited in the present study and randomly assigned to a virtual nature (VN) or a virtual abstract painting (VAP) group. Their electroencephalogram alpha activity, perceived stress, and levels of restorative quality and satisfaction were assessed at baseline and after an acute bout of 20 min of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. The results showed that both the VN and VAP groups showed significantly higher alpha activity post-exercise as compared to pre-exercise. The VN group relative to the VAP group exhibited higher levels of stress-relief, restorative quality, and personal satisfaction. These findings imply that a virtual exercise environment is an effective way to induce a relaxing effect in patients with GAD. However, they exhibited more positive psychological responses when exercising in such an environment with natural landscapes.","Wang, Tsai-Chiao; Sit, Cindy Hui-Ping; Tang, Ta-Wei; Tsai, Chia-Liang",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32640554/,77
121958,Regulation of medical devices in the United States and European Union.,2012,"Driving under the influence (DUI) is illegal in the United States because a driver's mental and motor skills can be seriously impaired by alcohol or drugs. Consequently, DUI violators' involvement in severe crashes is high. Motivated by the spatial and temporal nature of traffic crashes, this study introduces an integrated spatio-temporal approach to analyzing highway safety data. Specifically, this study estimates Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) models to understand the consequences of DUI in crashes. GTWR can theoretically outperform traditional regression methods by accounting for unobserved heterogeneity that may be related to the location and time of a crash. Using Southeast Michigan crash data, this study finds that DUI is associated with a 25% higher likelihood of injury in a crash. The association between injury severity and DUI varies significantly across space and time. From the spatial aspect, DUI crashes in rural or small-town areas are more likely to cause injuries than urban crashes. From the temporal aspect, different times are associated with varying relationships between injury severity and DUI. If focusing on DUI crashes in late nights and early mornings, on Fridays, the entire northeast part from Clinton Charter Township to Port Huron is associated with severer injuries than other regions including Detroit's urban area and its south. On Mondays, the DUI crashes in the northwest are also more likely to cause severe injuries. The methodology introduced in this study takes advantage of modern computational tools and localized crash/inventory data. This method offers researchers and practitioners an opportunity to understand highway safety outcomes in great spatial and temporal details and customize safety countermeasures for specific locations and times such as saturation patrols.","Liu, Jun; Li, Xiaobing; Khattak, Asad J",Accident; analysis and prevention,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2020.105742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942168/,77

However, the advantages of giving PRE to all patients needs to be balanced against any negative impact on patients' quality of life. PATIENTS AND METHODS All 1,350 patients were asked to complete the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-item (MOS SF-36) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Colorectal 38-item (EORTC QLQ-CR38) questionnaires. A priori hypotheses related to the impact of treatment on sexual, bowel, and physical function and general health. RESULTS Male sexual dysfunction was significantly increased following surgery (P < .001), although there was no difference between treatment arms. However, a treatment difference had emerged at 6 months (PRE patients reporting significantly greater dysfunction; P = .004), which persisted out to at least 2 years (an insufficient number of female patients completed the sexual dysfunction questions to draw firm conclusions). Both treatment groups reported similar levels of decreased physical function at 3 months, but thereafter it returned to baseline levels. There was no evidence of any major changes between treatments or time points in terms of general health or bowel function, but exploratory analysis indicated a significant (P = .006 at 2 years) increase in the level of fecal incontinence with PRE. CONCLUSION These results from a large randomized trial using validated patient-completed questionnaires show that, for males, the main adverse effect was sexual dysfunction, and the main cause of this was surgery, but that PRE also affected sexual and some aspects of bowel functioning.","Stephens, Richard J; Thompson, Lindsay C; Quirke, Phil; Steele, Robert; Grieve, Robert; Couture, Jean; Griffiths, Gareth O; Sebag-Montefiore, David",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2009.26.5264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20585099/,77

This study aims to investigate the network structures of PTSD and the directions of relationships between symptoms among adolescent survivors in the year after the Yancheng Tornado in China. Method: A total of 395 youth survivors completed the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (Foa et al., 2001) at 3 months and 12 months following the tornado. Network analysis was used to compare networks of PTSD symptoms and changes over time. Results: Different centrality symptoms existed at different time points. Anger, startle responses, and physiological reactivity were important to the maintenance of PTSD symptoms arising from the tornado at 3 months, while dreams/nightmares and distancing/avoidance were important to maintaining PTSD symptoms at 12 months. Analysis suggested that sleep difficulty and intrusive thoughts were the key PTSD symptoms to be treated at 3 months; sleep remained to be the key symptoms to be treated at 12 months. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that sleep difficulty could be a main cause of other symptoms and trigger the entire symptom system into undesirable psychopathological development among adolescent survivors in the year following major disasters.

Several independent trends in technological developments are seen to converge towards the elaboration of the digital replication of individual human data and life history, notably in health industries. Among the main ones, we consider the ubiquitous distribution of digital assistants, the rapid progress of machine learning concurrent with the exponential growth of 'personal' Big Data and the incipient interest in developing lifelogs. The core hypothesis here is that among the psychological effects of the digital transformation, the externalization of cognitive faculties such as memory, planning and judgement, the decision-making processes located within the human person are also emigrating to digital functions, perhaps as a prelude to a later re-integration within the person via brain-computer interfaces.

Based on this, we aimed to show the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of this drug molecule via in vitro, in silico and molecular techniques. Ribavirin showed antiviral activity in Vero E6 cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection whereas the drug itself did not show any toxic effect over the concentration range tested. In silico analysis suggested that Ribarivin has a broad-spectrum impact on SARS-CoV-2, acting at different viral proteins. According to the detailed molecular techniques, Ribavirin was shown to decrease the expression of TMPRSS2 both at mRNA and protein levels 48 hours after treatment. The suppressive effect of Ribavirin in ACE2 protein expression was shown to be dependent on cell types. Finally, proteolytic activity assays showed that Ribavirin also showed an inhibitory effect on TMPRSS2 enzyme. Based on these results, we hypothesized that Ribavirin may inhibit the expression of TMPRSS2 by modulating the formation of inhibitory G-quadruplex structures at the TMPRSS2 promoter. As a conclusion, Ribavirin is a potential antiviral drug for the treatment against SARS-CoV-2, and it interferes with the effect of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression.","Unal, Mehmet Altay; Bitirim, Ceylan Verda; Summak, Gokce Yagmur; Bereketoglu, Sidar; Cevher Zeytin, Inci; Besbİnar, Omur; Gurcan, Cansu; Aydos, Dunya; Goksoy, Ezgi; Kocakaya, Ebru; Eran, Zeynep; Murat, Merve; Demir, Nil; Aksoy Ozer, Zeynep Busra; Somers, Julia; Demir, Emek; Nazir, Hasan; Ozkan, Sibel Aysil; Ozkul, Aykut; Azap, Alpay; Yilmazer, Açelya; Akcali, Kamil Can",Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1139/cjpp-2020-0734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33689451/,77
122708,[Diagnosis of Periprosthetic Joint Infection of Shoulder Arthroplasties].,2017,"Lambda interferon (IFN-λ) has potent antiviral effects against multiple enteric viral pathogens, including norovirus and rotavirus, in both preventing and curing infection. Because the intestine includes a diverse array of cell types, however, the cell(s) upon which IFN-λ acts to exert its antiviral effects is unclear. Here, we sought to identify IFN-λ-responsive cells by generation of mice with lineage-specific deletion of the receptor for IFN-λ, Ifnlr1 We found that expression of IFNLR1 on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in the small intestine and colon is required for enteric IFN-λ antiviral activity. IEC Ifnlr1 expression also determines the efficacy of IFN-λ in resolving persistent murine norovirus (MNoV) infection and regulates fecal shedding and viral titers in tissue. Thus, the expression of Ifnlr1 by IECs is necessary for the response to both endogenous and exogenous IFN-λ. We further demonstrate that IEC Ifnlr1 expression is required for the sterilizing innate immune effects of IFN-λ by extending these findings in Rag1-deficient mice. Finally, we assessed whether our findings pertained to multiple viral pathogens by infecting mice specifically lacking IEC Ifnlr1 expression with reovirus. These mice phenocopied Ifnlr1-null animals, exhibiting increased intestinal tissue titers and enhanced reovirus fecal shedding. Thus, IECs are the critical cell type responding to IFN-λ to control multiple enteric viruses. This is the first genetic evidence that supports an essential role for IECs in IFN-λ-mediated control of enteric viral infection, and these findings provide insight into the mechanism of IFN-λ-mediated antiviral activity.IMPORTANCE Human noroviruses (HNoVs) are the leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. Type III interferons (IFN-λ) control enteric viral infections in the gut and have been shown to cure mouse norovirus, a small-animal model for HNoVs. Using a genetic approach with conditional knockout mice, we identified IECs as the dominant IFN-λ-responsive cells in control of enteric virus infection in vivo Upon murine norovirus or reovirus infection, Ifnlr1 depletion in IECs largely recapitulated the phenotype seen in Ifnlr1-/- mice of higher intestinal tissue viral titers and increased viral shedding in the stool. Moreover, IFN-λ-mediated sterilizing immunity against murine norovirus requires the capacity of IECs to respond to IFN-λ. These findings clarify the mechanism of action of this cytokine and emphasize the therapeutic potential of IFN-λ for treating mucosal viral infections.","Baldridge, Megan T; Lee, Sanghyun; Brown, Judy J; McAllister, Nicole; Urbanek, Kelly; Dermody, Terence S; Nice, Timothy J; Virgin, Herbert W",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02079-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077655/,77

This paper discusses moral injury in the context of disaster and epidemic and how easily the moral psychology of individuals and society can be shaken. Moral injury is a multiscientific concept involving psychology, culture, and religion. Amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, immoral behaviors and events such as violence, injury, and illness have also caused different degrees of impact on the moral standards of individuals, confusing moral cognition, destroying moral emotion, and weakening moral toughness, resulting in varying degrees of moral injury. If there is no national health, there will be no positive society for all. Based on this, the public needs to pay close attention to the moral health of the whole people and effectively avoid the occurrence of moral injury.

In such settings, identifying the most-likely multistep reaction mechanisms which lead to the production of a particular defined product species is an extremely challenging problem, requiring search and evaluation over a large number of different possible candidate mechanisms while also addressing the permutational challenges posed when considering a large number of reaction routes available to sets of identical molecular species. In this article, the problem of generating candidate reaction mechanisms which form a defined product from a diverse set of reactive molecules is cast as a discrete optimization of a permutationally invariant cost function describing similarity between the target product and the product generated by a trial reaction mechanism. This approach is demonstrated by generating 2230 candidate reaction mechanisms which form benzene from diverse sets of reactive molecules which have been experimentally identified in the interstellar medium. By screening this set of autogenerated mechanisms, using dispersion-corrected DFT to evaluate reaction energies and activation barriers, we identify several candidate barrierless reaction mechanisms (both previously proposed and new) for benzene formation which may operate in the low temperatures found in the interstellar medium and could be investigated further to supplement existing microkinetic models.","Robertson, Christopher; Hyland, Ross; Lacey, Andrew J D; Havens, Sebastian; Habershon, Scott",Journal of chemical theory and computation,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730851/,77

This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gender-based violence by comparing the prevalence of spousal violence against women before and during the COVID-19 related lockdown periods. This study was conducted in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq using a self-administered online questionnaire survey after the COVID-19 lockdown period in June 2020. Data were collected from a sample of 346 married women about the occurrence, frequency, and forms of spousal violence before and during the lockdown period. Significant increases in violence were observed from the pre-lockdown period to the lockdown period for any violence (32.1% to 38.7%, p = .001), emotional abuse (29.5% to 35.0%, p = .005), and physical violence (12.7% to 17.6%, p = .002). Regarding emotional abuse, humiliation (24.6% to 28.3%, p = .041) and scaring or intimidation (14.2% to 21.4%, p < .001) significantly increased during the lockdown. For physical violence, twisting the arm or pulling hair (9.0% to 13.0%, p = .004) and hitting (5.2% to 9.2%, p = .003) significantly increased during the lockdown. Forcing to have sexual intercourse also significantly increased during lockdown (6.6% to 9.5%., p = .021).

Methods: The response protocol of the emergency surgical management of ruptured intracranial aneurysm during the epidemic period (from January to March, 2020) at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University was reviewed. The prognosis of emergent aneurysm surgery under different levels of protection or during the same period of 2019 and 2020 was further compared to describe the operation and prognosis under the new management protocol. Results: A total of 127 emergency cases with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were referred to Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University from January 20 to March 25, 2020, and 42 cases(33.1%) underwent emergent aneurysm clipping after multi-desciplinary consultation. Admissions of emergency cases required epidemiological, laboratory, and imaging screenings for COVID-19, with additional throat swab virus nucleic acid screening afterwards. During the same period, 9 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the emergency screening, and no false negative cases were found. Compared with the same period in 2019, the interval between emergency visits and emergency craniotomy did not increase significantly due to the preoperative screening ((37±17) hours during the epidemic period versus (29±12) hours at the same period in 2019, P=0.058). There was no significant difference in the incidence of perioperative adverse events and postoperative neurological dysfunction (P=0.779). According to the screening results, the corresponding operative and postoperative management protocol and protection standards were adopted. There was no significant difference in the prognosis of emergent surgery between patients with a negative initial screening and those who were to be excluded or suspected in the initial screening (P=0.678). Although viral nucleic acid screening tended to prolong the time interval before surgical intervention ((36±15) hours before nucleic acid screening versus (40±20) hours after nucleic acid screening, P=0.453), there was no statistically significant difference in the preoperative adverse events and postoperative neurological function (P=0.653). Conclusion: The current protocol of COVID-19 screening and stratified emergent surgery management based on screening results can effectively identify suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases, thereby ensuring timely, safe and effective emergent surgery and prohibiting nosocomial spread.","Ma, L; Chen, Y; Chen, X L",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112137-20200814-02385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33379841/,77

This unprecedented time provided the opportunity to reenvision the delivery of nursing education and operation of the college of nursing, using the principles of the four Cs of interorganizational partnering as a guide supported by positive organizational scholarship. METHOD The Villanova University Fitzpatrick College of Nursing designed and implemented strategies to provide seamless learning opportunities for students in undergraduate and graduate nursing programs, while providing necessary support and future planning for the upcoming academic year. RESULTS Online and virtual learning platforms integrated into curricula assisted students to meet course objectives and program outcomes. Strategies for effective communication, collegiality, and collaboration within and among the college, university, and nursing community served as mechanism for innovation. CONCLUSION Communication, cooperation, coordination, and collaboration, along with positive organizational strategizing and support contributed to a successful transition during the COVID-19 pandemic; many of the approaches implemented during the emergency transition will continue into the future.[J Nurs Educ. 2020;59(12):675-682.].","Mariani, Bette; Havens, Donna S; Metz, Sarah",The Journal of nursing education,https://doi.org/10.3928/01484834-20201118-04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33253396/,77

125117,Errors in Figure.,2020-09-08,"INTRODUCTION The Electronic Health Record (EHR) has become an integral component of healthcare delivery. Survey based studies have estimated that physicians spend 4-6 hours of their workday devoted to EHR. Our study was designed to use computer software to objectively obtain time spent on EHR. METHODS We recorded EHR time for 248 physiciansover 2 time intervals. EHR active use was defined as more than 15 keystrokes, or 3 mouse clicks, or 1700 ""mouse miles"" per minute. We recorded total time and % of work hours spent on EHR, and differences in those based on seniority. Physicians reported duty hours using a standardized toolkit. RESULTS Physicians spent 3.8 (±2) hours on EHR daily, which accounted for 37% (±17%), 41% (±14%), and 45% (±12%) of their day for all clinicians, residents, and interns, respectively. With the progression of training, there was a reduction in EHR time (all p values <0.01). During the first academic quarter, clinicians spent 38% (± 8%) of time on chart review, 17% (± 7%) on orders, 28% (±11%) on documentation (i.e. writing notes) and 17% (±7%) on other activities (i.e. physician hand-off and medication reconciliation). This pattern remained unchanged during the fourth quarter. CONCLUSIONS Physicians spend close to 40% of their work day on EHR, with interns spending the most time. There is a significant reduction in time spent on EHR with training and greater experience, although the overall amount of time spent on EHR remained high.","Verma, Gautam; Ivanov, Alexander; Benn, Francis; Rathi, Anil; Tran, Nathaniel; Afzal, Ashwad; Mehta, Parag; Heitner, John F",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609757/,77

We previously reported the efficacy of the Hokkaido Ultrasonography (US)-based scoring system (HokUS-10) for US findings. To establish easier-to-use criteria, we retrospectively evaluated US findings from 441 patients, including 30 patients with SOS using the HokUS-10 scoring system. Using logistic regression analysis, we established the novel diagnostic criteria HokUS-6. In the presence of ascites, US diagnosis was made in the presence of two of the following 6 parameters: moderate amount of ascites, the appearance of a paraumbilical vein blood flow signal, gallbladder wall thickening, portal vein dilatation, portal vein velocity decrease, and hepatic artery resistive index increase. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of HokUS-6 were 0.974 (95% confidence interval 0.962-0.990), 95.2%, and 96.9%, respectively. The scores were significantly higher in patients with severe SOS than in those with non-severe SOS (p = 0.013). Furthermore, the scores before HSCT were significantly higher in patients who developed SOS than in controls (p = 0.001). The HokUS-6 is an easy and useful way to diagnose and identify the risk of SOS.","Nishida, Mutsumi; Sugita, Junichi; Takahashi, Shuichiro; Iwai, Takahito; Sato, Megumi; Kudo, Yusuke; Omotehara, Satomi; Horie, Tatsunori; Sakano, Ryosuke; Shibuya, Hitoshi; Yokota, Isao; Iguchi, Akihiro; Teshima, Takanori",International journal of hematology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12185-021-03137-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763826/,77
126216,Inclusion of next-generation leaders and cost-effective precision diagnostic techniques are vital in combatting antimicrobial resistance in low- and middle-income countries.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND Cells derived from native rodents have limits at distinct steps of HIV replication. Rat primary CD4 T-cells, but not macrophages, display a profound transcriptional deficit that is ameliorated by transient trans-complementation with the human Tat-interacting protein Cyclin T1 (hCycT1). RESULTS Here, we generated transgenic rats that selectively express hCycT1 in CD4 T-cells and macrophages. hCycT1 expression in rat T-cells boosted early HIV gene expression to levels approaching those in infected primary human T-cells. hCycT1 expression was necessary, but not sufficient, to enhance HIV transcription in T-cells from individual transgenic animals, indicating that endogenous cellular factors are critical co-regulators of HIV gene expression in rats. T-cells from hCD4/hCCR5/hCycT1-transgenic rats did not support productive infection of prototypic wild-type R5 HIV-1 strains ex vivo, suggesting one or more significant limitation in the late phase of the replication cycle in this primary rodent cell type. Remarkably, we identify a replication-competent HIV-1 GFP reporter strain (R7/3 YU-2 Env) that displays characteristics of a spreading, primarily cell-to-cell-mediated infection in primary T-cells from hCD4/hCCR5-transgenic rats. Moreover, the replication of this recombinant HIV-1 strain was significantly enhanced by hCycT1 transgenesis. The viral determinants of this so far unique replicative ability are currently unknown. CONCLUSION Thus, hCycT1 expression is beneficial to de novo HIV infection in a transgenic rat model, but additional genetic manipulations of the host or virus are required to achieve full permissivity.","Michel, Nico; Goffinet, Christine; Ganter, Kerstin; Allespach, Ina; Kewalramani, Vineet N; Saifuddin, Mohammed; Littman, Dan R; Greene, Warner C; Goldsmith, Mark A; Keppler, Oliver T",Retrovirology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-6-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144136/,77

We have done a prospective comparative study on two different techniques of mesh fixation, i.e., transfascial suture and tack fixation. Materials and Methods It was a prospective, non-randomised comparative study done on inguinal hernia patients operated by TEP repair from October 2014 to September 2016. These data were compared in two techniques of mesh fixation (tack and transfascial sutures) in terms of post-operative complications, pain scores by visual analogue scale (VAS) and cost analysis of the procedure. Results Our study on 69 total patients (44 tack fixation and 25 suture fixation group) revealed that mean VAS scores for post-operative pain were not having any statistically significant difference in the tack group versus suture group (2.42 ± 0.24 vs. 2.2 ± 0.24) at 24 h, but VAS scores in the follow-up period at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months were 1.14 ± 0.33 versus 0.67 ± 0.27; 0.78 ± 0.24 versus 0.07 ± 0.06; 0.42 ± 0.17 versus 0.07 ± 0.06 and 0.5 ± 0.11 versus 0.07 ± 0.06, respectively, which showed significant difference at 1 and 3 months, suggesting less pain in the suture group. No significant difference was noted in other post-operative complications. Conclusion Transfascial suture fixation of mesh in TEP repair of inguinal hernia can be a cost-effective procedure with a comparable safety profile as compared to tack fixation.","Kumar, Awanish; Pal, Ajay Kumar; Choudhary, Anuraag; Anand, Akshay; Sonkar, Abhinav Arun; Pahwa, Harvinder Singh",Journal of minimal access surgery,https://doi.org/10.4103/jmas.jmas_192_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777988/,77

Researchers are interrogating on how individual genetic differences contribute to the diversity of clinical manifestations or ethnic and geographic disparities of COVID-19. While efforts were spent to understand mechanistically the infectious potential of the virus, recent progresses in molecular genetics and bioinformatics allowed the characterization of viral sequence and construction of phylogeographical maps of viral dispersion worldwide. These data will help understanding epidemiological disparities among continents and ethnic populations. Much effort was also spent in analyzing host genetics by studying individual genes involved in innate and immune responses or explaining pathogenesis of comorbidities that complicate the fate of elderly patients. Several international consortia launched already Genome wide Association Studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing strategies to identify genetic markers with immediate application in patients at risk of respiratory failure.

Age is the most consistent predictor of higher FCR, with prevalence rates as high as 70% among young adults. Although the association between age and higher FCR is well established, a more comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to higher FCR among young adult breast cancer survivors is needed. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this integrative review was to explore the factors associated with higher FCR among young adult breast cancer survivors (≤ 45 years old). METHODS A literature search was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases with specific Medical Subject Headings terms delimited to FCR, diagnosis, sex, and age range. The initial search yielded 378 studies, 13 of which met the eligibility criteria. RESULTS Themes include motherhood status, health behaviors and decision making (eg, surveillance behaviors and surgical decision making), psychological morbidity, and social support. Cognitive behavioral factors include cognitive processing, metacognition, illness intrusiveness, and self-efficacy. CONCLUSION Fear of cancer recurrence among young adult breast cancer survivors is a unique construct requiring further exploration and tailored interventions to improve the health-related quality of life for this population. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Oncology nurses should screen all cancer survivors for FCR, with particular attention to the unique needs of young adults. Future research should address the role of age-appropriate support and increased levels of FCR during surveillance periods.","Gormley, Maurade; Ghazal, Lauren; Fu, Mei R; Van Cleave, Janet H; Knobf, Tish; Hammer, Marilyn",Cancer nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/ncc.0000000000000858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657897/,77

METHODS Prospective, observational, single-center, cohort study. Sixty-four post-COVID-19 patients and fifty control were recruited. All participants underwent a complete ophthalmological examination including: Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire (OSDI), Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundus examination, Schirmer test type 1, Tear Break Up Time test (tBUT), evaluation of conjunctival hyperemia, corneal staining and tear film osmolarity test. RESULTS OSDI score was higher in the post-COVID19 group in the quantitative and qualitative analysis (respectively p<0.001 and p =0.012). Mean tBUT in post-COVID-19 patients was 6.95 ± 4.07 sec compared to a mean tBUT of 10.12 ± 3.90 sec in the control group. The post-COVID-19 group showed a higher number of patients with a simultaneous impairment of OSDI score and tBUT (p = 0.019). The Schirmer test results were strikingly significant both in the quantitative and qualitative analysis (p <0.001 and p = 0.0014 respectively). Both quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed a significant difference in terms of tear osmolarity in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Comparing the ocular surface assessment of post-COVID-19 patients with heathy control a statistically significant increase of DED has emerged both in subjective and objective evaluations. Our clinical results support the findings that suggested a susceptibility of the ocular surface to the virus and it underlines the importance of the ocular surface assessment in post-COVID-19 patients for a correct diagnosis and therapy.","Gambini, Gloria; Savastano, Maria Cristina; Savastano, Alfonso; De Vico, Umberto; Crincoli, Emanuele; Cozzupoli, Maria Grazia; Culiersi, Carola; Rizzo, Stanislao",Cornea,https://doi.org/10.1097/ico.0000000000002643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33214412/,77

The term health diplomacy has been used to describe this growing interface between foreign policy and global health, and it encompasses both the concept of using health to further foreign policy objectives as well as the idea that diplomatic tools can be helpful for attaining public health goals. The Chinese presence in Africa has grown in the last 15 years, generating increased interest in Sino-African relations. While much has been written in recent years about the Chinese presence in Africa, the growing numbers of Africans in China have attracted considerably less attention. Many are small-scale traders and might be expected to face many of the health challenges common among foreign migrants, but their health needs have been largely unrecognised. In this paper, we consider how a health diplomacy approach could be applied to African migrants in China, and the potential advantages and limitations of this strategy. We identify areas of overlap between public health, trade and foreign policy goals that can be emphasised to generate support for improved services for African migrants in China and to engage partners from a diversity of sectors.","McLaughlin, Megan M; Lee, Margaret C; Hall, Brian J; Bulterys, Marc; Ling, Li; Tucker, Joseph D",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2014.908935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24807820/,77
126964,Mucosal changes in a long-term bovine intestinal segment model following removal of ingesta and microflora.,2011,"Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are increasingly being identified as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). They have potentially detrimental ecological and human health impacts but most are not currently subject to environmental regulation. Addressing the life cycle of these pharmaceuticals plays a significant role in identifying the potential sources and understanding the environmental impact that pharmaceuticals may have in surface waters. The stability and biological activity of these ""micro-pollutants"" can lead to a pseudo persistence, with ensuing unknown chronic behavioural and health-related effects. Research that investigates pharmaceuticals predominantly focuses on their occurrence and effect within surface water environments. However, this review will help to collate this information with factors that affect their environmental concentration. This review focuses on six pharmaceuticals (clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, venlafaxine, gemfibrozil and diclofenac), chosen because they are heavily consumed globally, have poor removal rates in conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (CAS WWTPs), and are persistent in the aquatic environment. Furthermore, these pharmaceuticals are included in numerous published prioritisation studies and/or are on the Water Framework Directive (WFD) ""Watch List"" or are candidates for the updated Watch List (WL). This review investigates the concentrations seen in European Union (EU) surface waters and examines factors that influence final concentrations prior to release, thus giving a holistic overview on the source of pharmaceutical surface water pollution. A period of 10 years is covered by this review, which includes research from 2009-2020 examining over 100 published studies, and highlighting that pharmaceuticals can pose a severe risk to surface water environments, with each stage of the lifecycle of the pharmaceutical determining its concentration. This review additionally highlights the necessity to improve education surrounding appropriate use, disposal and waste management of pharmaceuticals, while implementing a source directed and end of pipe approach to reduce pharmaceutical occurrence in surface waters.","O'Flynn, Dylan; Lawler, Jenny; Yusuf, Azeez; Parle-McDermott, Anne; Harold, Denise; Mc Cloughlin, Thomas; Holland, Linda; Regan, Fiona; White, Blánaid",Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0ay02098b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33507166/,77
127351,Alternative uses of lumen apposing metal stents.,2020-06-07,"Effective ultraviolet-C (UV-C) decontamination protocols of N95 respirators require validation that the entire N95 surface receives sufficient dose. Photochromic indicators (PCIs) can accurately measure UV-C dose on nonplanar surfaces, but often saturate below doses required to decontaminate porous, multilayered textiles like N95s. Here, we investigate the use of optical attenuators to extend PCI dynamic range while maintaining a near-ideal angular response - critical for accurate measurements using uncollimated UV-C. We show analytically that tuning attenuator refractive index, attenuation coefficient, and thickness can extend dynamic range, but compromises angular response unless the attenuator is an ideal diffuser. To investigate this tradeoff empirically, we stack PCIs behind model specular (floated borosilicate) and diffuse (polytetrafluoroethylene) attenuators, characterize the angular response, and evaluate on-N95 UV-C measurement accuracy within a decontamination system. Both attenuators increase PCI dynamic range >4×, but simultaneously introduce angle-dependent transmittance, which causes location-dependent underestimation of UV-C dose. PCI-borosilicate and PCI-polytetrafluoroethylene stacks underreport true on-N95 dose by 1) 14.7% and 3.6%, respectively, when near-normal to the source lamp array, and 2) 40.8% and 19.8%, respectively, in a steeply sloped location. Overall, we demonstrate that while planar attenuators can increase PCI dynamic range, verifying near-ideal angular response is critical for accurate UV-C measurements.","Su, Alison; Geldert, Alisha; Grist, Samantha M; Herr, Amy E",Photochemistry and photobiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/php.13532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34596899/,77

127393,Cervical Screening Performance.,2021-01-05,"To reduce pulmonary complications after esophagectomy, the transthoracic procedure should be shortened or totally avoided. Transcervical approach assisted by mediastinoscope for the upper mediastinum may be advantageous for this purpose. We carried out video-assisted transcervical mediastinal dissection (VATCMD) as part of totally non-transthoracic radical esophagectomy. A single-port laparoscopy device was adopted to a small cervical incision and the mediastinum was inflated with a positive pressure of 6 to 10 mmHg. Without assistant's retractor, the upper mediastinum and partially the middle mediastinum were dissected mainly by mediastinoscopic-assisted surgery. Video of the operation is demonstrated with illustrations. We have carried out and reported 17 cases of esophagectomy including VATCMD and its perioperative outcome. Non-transthoracic esophagectomy was completed without conversion to transthoracic procedure in all 17 cases. Procedure-related adverse event was not observed and postoperative course was favorable with a zero occurrence (0%) of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, chyle leakage or pulmonary complications. Median number of harvested lymph nodes from the upper mediastinal stations was 10. VATCMD is suggested as a safe and feasible approach for the upper mediastinum in esophagectomy for malignancies. It enabled a totally non-transthoracic radical esophagectomy in combination with a transhiatal approach. Video-assisted transcervical mediastinal dissection is suggested as a safe and feasible approach for the upper mediastinum in esophagectomy for malignancies.

Leaves and branches of V. coloratum, defined as edible or medicinal mistletoe species in Korean, are used to prepare Korean herbal medicines as well as leached tea. However, other mistletoe species including Taxillus sutchuenensis var. duclouxii, Korthalsella japonica, and Loranthus tanakae are frequently distributed as authentic V. coloratum in Korean markets because of similarities in the branches morphology and Korean names of these species with V. coloratum. Although herbal medicines and food products prepared from the other mistletoe species are inauthentic, they are sold at high prices because of the rarity of these species. Thus, it is important to distinguish between authentic and inauthentic adulterant mistletoe species. In this study, we developed species-specific primer, based on matK sequences, suitable for both conventional PCR and real time PCR (qPCR) assay. These assays allowed rapid discrimination among all four mistletoe species. Moreover, qPCR assay enabled the detection of trace amounts of adulterant mistletoe species in V. coloratum samples. Furthermore, we used these assays to monitor commercial mistletoe products distributed in Korean markets. Our data suggest that these methods would serve as a reliable genetic tool to prevent adulteration and standardize the quality of commercial V. coloratum products.","Kim, Wook Jin; Yang, Sungyu; Choi, Goya; Park, Inkyu; Noh, Pureum; Lee, A Yeong; Kim, Hyo Seon; Moon, Byeong Cheol",Phytochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.112400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408189/,77

Methods: Based on the patients' admission detection indicators, mild or severe status of COVID-19, and dynamic changes in admission indicators (the differences between indicators of two measurements) and other input variables, XGBoost method was applied to establish a prediction model to evaluate the risk of severe outcomes of the COVID-19 patients after admission. Follow up was done for the selected patients from admission to discharge, and their outcomes were observed to evaluate the predicted results of this model. Results: In the training set of 100 COVID-19 patients, six predictors with higher scores were screened and a prediction model was established. The high-risk range of the predictor variables was calculated as: blood oxygen saturation <94%, peripheral white blood cells count >8.0×10(9), change in systolic blood pressure <-2.5 mmHg, heart rate >90 beats/min, multiple small patchy shadows, age >30 years, and change in heart rate <12.5 beats/min. The prediction sensitivity of the model based on the training set was 61.7%, and the missed diagnosis rate was 38.3%. The prediction sensitivity of the model based on the test set was 75.0%, and the missed diagnosis rate was 25.0%. Conclusions: Compared with the traditional prediction (i.e. using indicators from the first test at admission and the critical admission conditions to assess whether patients are in mild or severe status), the new model's prediction additionally takes into account of the baseline physiological indicators and dynamic changes of COVID-19 patients, so it can predict the risk of severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients more comprehensively and accurately to reduce the missed diagnosis of severe COVID-19.","Peng, Z H; Chen, X F; Hu, Q Y; Hu, J C; Zhao, Z P; Zhang, M Z; Deng, S T; Xu, Q Q; Xia, Y K; Li, Y",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200331-00479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33297614/,77

OBJECTIVE This systematic review examined the effects of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations and musculoskeletal health outcomes in military personnel. DATA SOURCES A comprehensive search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SportDiscus, and the Cochrane Library databases and the reference lists of existing review articles and relevant studies. STUDY SELECTION Reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts of the articles using predefined criteria. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level 3. DATA EXTRACTION Three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality. Mean differences with 95% CI in serum 25(OH)D concentrations between the vitamin D and placebo arms were calculated. RESULTS Four RCTs were included in the qualitative analyses. The 25(OH)D concentrations was improved with 2000 IU/d supplementation (mean difference = 3.90 ng/mL; 95% CI, 0.22-7.58). A trial on female Navy recruits showed a significant decrease in stress fractures (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.95), particularly tibial fractures, from daily supplementations of 800 IU vitamin D and 2000 mg calcium. CONCLUSION There was a positive trend in 25(OH)D concentrations from higher doses of supplementary vitamin D in military submariners and a possible benefit to bone health when vitamin D was combined with calcium.","Sivakumar, Gaya; Koziarz, Alex; Farrokhyar, Forough",Sports health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1941738119857717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31268835/,77

The graft reinforcement consisted of graft extension for eliminating occult type I endoleak, and relining for eliminating occult type III endoleak. Six months after the procedure, CT showed no signs of sac expansion. Transgraft sac embolization combined with graft reinforcement is one of the available options for persistent and refractory mixed-type endoleak.","Nakai, Motoki; Ikoma, Akira; Loffroy, Romaric; Midulla, Marco; Rao, Pramod; Kamisako, Atsufumi; Higashino, Nobuyuki; Fukuda, Kodai; Sonomura, Tetsuo",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-018-2144-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30539235/,77
129589,Insights on the role of antimicrobial cuffed endotracheal tubes in preventing transtracheal transmission of VAP pathogens from an in vitro model of microaspiration and microbial proliferation.,2014,"BACKGROUND Gastric fistula (GF) is a serious complication after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Furthermore, gastrobronchial fistula (GBF) may appear some time after a primary LSG. The objective of this study was to characterize GBF after LSG and establish standardized treatment procedures. METHODS All patients undergoing surgery for GBF after LSG at a public university medical center in France between November 2004 and January 2013 were included in this study. Surgical and perioperative care was standardized. The primary efficacy criterion was the complication rate. Secondary efficacy criteria were the mortality rate, surgical data, types of complications, and the length of stay (LOS) in hospital. RESULTS Six patients were treated for GBF after LSG: 2 presented GBF after primary LSG performed in our institution and 4 had been referred by tertiary centers. The median (range) time to onset of GBF after LSG was 136 days (99-238 d). Preoperative refeeding was performed in 5 cases. The median time interval between the discovery of GBF and its surgical treatment was 31 days (7-137 d). Five patients underwent simultaneous abdominal and thoracic procedures. The abdominal procedures consisted of total gastrectomy (n = 1) and 60-cm Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal anastomosis (n = 6). There were no postoperative mortalities. Four postoperative complications occurred (66.6%), 2 of which were postoperative fistulas (33.3%) requiring revisional surgery. The median time to oral refeeding was 10 days (8-65 d) and the median LOS was 14 days (13-25 d). CONCLUSIONS Our treatment of GBF is based on effective drainage with endoscopic procedures, allowing optimal preoperative refeeding before combined abdominal and thoracic surgery. For the abdominal procedure, we prefer a 60-cm Roux-en-Y gastrojejunal anastomosis to total gastrectomy, because the former is simpler and minimizes the long-term risk of postoperative malabsorption.","Rebibo, Lionel; Dhahri, Abdennaceur; Berna, Pascal; Yzet, Thierry; Verhaeghe, Pierre; Regimbeau, Jean-Marc",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2013.08.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24238732/,77

In view of the high death rate for Covid-19 patients over 70 years of age, and given the fact that BCG vaccination is typically given early in life, we compared countries that had introduced BCG in the 1950s with those that had not. No effect on Covid-19 case fatality rate or number of deaths per population could be demonstrated. Since some countries test for Covid-19 more than others, the effect of tests performed per million population on reported deaths per million was also assessed, but again did not demonstrate an effect of BCG vaccination in the 1950s. Whether countries had never used the vaccine, had historically used it but since ceased to do so, or were presently vaccinating with BCG did not correlate to national total number of deaths or case fatality rates. We conclude that there is currently no evidence for a beneficial effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 reported cases or fatalities.","Wassenaar, Trudy M; Buzard, Gregory S; Newman, David J",Letters in applied microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/lam.13365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734625/,77
130601,Wanted: long term studies on massage therapy in hypertension.,2020-08-14,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a worldwide chronic inflammatory lung disease, and influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a common cause of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). Therefore, targeting viral infections represents a promising strategy to prevent the occurrence and development of inflammatory flare ups in AECOPD. Jianpiyifei II (JPYFII) is a traditional herbal medicine used in China to treat patients with COPD, and its clinical indications are not well understood. However, investigation of the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanism using an animal model of smoking has been reported in a previous study by our group. In addition, some included herbs, such as Radix astragali and Radix aupleuri, were reported to exhibit anti-viral effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether JPYFII formulation relieved acute inflammation by clearing the IAV in a mouse model that was exposed to cigarette smoke experimentally. JPYFII formulation treatment during smoke exposure and IAV infection significantly reduced the number of cells observed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, chemokines, superoxide production, and viral load in IAV-infected and smoke-exposed mice. However, JPYFII formulation treatment during smoke exposure alone did not reduce the number of cells in BALF or the expression of Il-6, Tnf-a, and Il-1β. The results demonstrated that JPYFII formulation exerted an anti-viral effect and reduced the exacerbation of lung inflammation in cigarette smoke (CS)-exposed mice infected with IAV. Our results suggested that JPYFII formulation could potentially be used to treat patients with AECOPD associated with IAV infection.","Yu, Xuhua; Cai, Tiantian; Fan, Long; Liang, Ziyao; Du, Qiuling; Wang, Qi; Yang, Zifeng; Vlahos, Ross; Wu, Lei; Lin, Lin",Clinical science,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20210050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34236078/,77

Although necessary to control spread of the virus and preserve personal protective equipment, this shift highlights existing disparities in access and care. Patients without the skills and tools to access telehealth services may increase their risk of exposure by seeking care in person or may delay care entirely. We know that patients need internet access, devices capable of visual communication, and the skills to use these devices to experience the full benefits of telehealth, yet we also know that disparities are present in each of these areas. Currently, federal programs have given physicians greater flexibility in providing care remotely and have expanded internet access for vulnerable patients to promote telehealth services. However, these changes are temporary and it is uncertain which will remain when the pandemic is over. Family medicine physicians have an important role to play in identifying and addressing these disparities and facilitating more equitable care moving forward.","Sieck, Cynthia J; Rastetter, Mark; McAlearney, Ann Scheck",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.s1.200229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622843/,77

Even though the role of potential sources of infection in the epidemiology of the disease at the farm level (feed, fomites) has been extensively investigated, there is a lack of knowledge about the dynamics of disease spread at the regional level. Here, we investigated the dissemination of PEDV infection in two areas located in the regions with the highest swine density in the country (Southeast and Midwest) including more than 2400 farms. Location and date of outbreaks were used to assess the spatial and temporal clustering of cases using global (Cuzick-Edwards, Knox and directional tests) and local (Bernouilli model of the spatial scan statistic) techniques in the first 10 months of the epidemic. A strong spatio-temporal pattern was detected in both areas of study, with an increased risk of disease at <2km distances of recently (<7 days) infected farms, although extent of clustering was higher in the Southeast. Results, computed for two different locations in the first months of the epidemic, suggest that local transmission from infected farms into neighboring PEDV-free sites is a likely explanation for a substantial proportion of the reported PEDV-positive farms and consistent with the rapid spread of a highly infectious disease in the absence of immunity.","Alvarez, Julio; Goede, Dane; Morrison, Robert; Perez, Andres",Preventive veterinary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.11.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26586344/,77

131727,The Reply.,2020-10-01,"Film-forming sprays offer many advantages compared to conventional topical preparations because they can provide uniform drug distribution and dose, increased bioavailability, lower incidence of irritation, continuous drug release, and accelerated wound healing through moisture control. Film-forming sprays consist of polymers and excipients that improve the characteristics of preparations and enhance the stability of active substances. Each type of polymer and excipient will produce films with different features. Therefore, the various types of polymers and excipients and their evaluation standards need to be examined for the development of a more optimal form of film-forming spray. The selected literature included research on polymers as film-forming matrices and the application of these sprays for medical purposes or for potential medical use. This article discusses the types and concentrations of polymers and excipients, sprayer types, evaluations, and critical parameters in determining the sprayability and film characteristics. The review concludes that both natural and synthetic polymers that have in situ film or viscoelastic properties can be used to optimise topical drug delivery.","Umar, Abd Kakhar; Butarbutar, Maria; Sriwidodo, Sriwidodo; Wathoni, Nasrul","Drug design, development and therapy",https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s256666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884234/,77

Radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (RAMPS) was designed to achieve R0 resection more successfully with better lymph-node clearance; however, there is still insufficient evidence of its short- and long-term results to confirm its superiority. We conducted this study to compare the efficiency of these two procedures. METHODS The subjects of this retrospective analysis were 103 patients with left-sided PDAC who underwent either RAMPS (n = 46) or CDPS (n = 57). We assessed perioperative data and surgical information and used univariate and multivariate analyses to identify prognostic factors for survival. RESULTS There were no significant differences in baseline data between the groups. RAMPS was associated with a significantly shorter hospital stay (12.11 days vs. 22.98 days; P < 0.001), and significantly less blood loss (451.09 ml vs. 764.04 ml, P = 0.002), as well as a significantly lower rate of blood transfusion (15.22% vs. 33.33%, P = 0.035). RAMPS and CDPS had comparable perioperative complication rates. Moreover, RAMPS achieved more effective lymph-node retrieval (17.87 vs. 10.23; P < 0.001). The RAMPS group had a higher overall survival (OS) rate (28.73 months vs. 18.30 months; P = 0.003) and a higher disease-free survival (DFS) rate (21.97 months vs. 9.40 months; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION RAMPS achieved better survival and surgical outcomes than CDPS for patients with left-sided PDAC.","Dai, Menghua; Zhang, Hanyu; Li, Yatong; Xing, Cheng; Ding, Cheng; Liao, Quan; Zhang, Taiping; Guo, Junchao; Xu, Qiang; Han, Xianlin; Liu, Wenjing; Liu, Qiaofei",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-020-02203-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389192/,77

Here, we introduce our laparoscopic technique and present the associated perioperative outcomes relative to an open approach. METHODS From April 2014 to November 2017, 26 patients underwent central bisectionectomy or right anterior sectionectomy. A total of 17 patients underwent the laparoscopic approach and nine underwent an open approach. We used a perihilar Glissonian approach to determine each anatomical resection plane and employed a rubber band self-retraction technique to ensure proper exposure of the two resection planes. Detailed descriptions, illustrations, video, and perioperative outcomes of the approach are presented. RESULTS Among patients who underwent the laparoscopic approach, there were no cases of conversion to open surgery. The mean operative times for the laparoscopic and open groups were similar (333 ± 76 vs. 305 ± 62 min, respectively, p = 0.345). Intraoperative blood loss (535 ± 443 vs. 966 ± 650, p = 0.056) and postoperative complications (1 vs. 3, p = 0.065) were slightly less in the laparoscopic group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Surgical margins of both approaches were comparable (0.8 ± 0.6 vs. 0.7 ± 0.2 cm, p = 0.671). The length of hospital stay after surgery was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (8.8 ± 2.6 vs. 17.1 ± 12.7 days, p = 0.015).

However, the percutaneous approach is challenging in the minimally invasive setting. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of fluorescence liver segmentation by superselective intra-hepatic arterial injection of indocyanine green (ICG). MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight pigs (mean weight: 26.01 ± 5.21 kg) were involved. Procedures were performed in a hybrid experimental operative suite equipped with the Artis Zeego®, multiaxis robotic angiography system. A pneumoperitoneum was established and four laparoscopic ports were introduced. The celiac trunk was catheterized, and a microcatheter was advanced into different segmental hepatic artery branches. A near-infrared laparoscope (D-Light P, Karl Storz) was used to detect the fluorescent signal. To assess the correspondence between arterial-based fluorescence demarcation and liver volume, metallic markers were placed along the fluorescent border, followed by a 3D CT-scanning, after injecting intra-arterial radiological contrast (n = 3). To assess the correspondence between arterial and portal supplies, percutaneous intra-portal angiography and intra-arterial angiography were performed simultaneously (n = 1). RESULTS Bright fluorescence signal enhancing the demarcation of target segments was obtained from 0.1 mg/mL, in matter of seconds. Correspondence between the volume of hepatic segments and arterial territories was confirmed by CT angiography. Higher background fluorescence noise was found after positive staining by intra-portal ICG injection, due to parenchymal accumulation and porto-systemic shunting. CONCLUSIONS Intra-hepatic arterial ICG injection, rapidly highlights hepatic target segment borders, with a better signal-to-background ratio as compared to portal vein injection, in the experimental setting.","Diana, Michele; Liu, Yu-Yin; Pop, Raoul; Kong, Seong-Ho; Legnèr, Andras; Beaujeux, Remy; Pessaux, Patrick; Soler, Luc; Mutter, Didier; Dallemagne, Bernard; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5136-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27495341/,77

Being a parent in this situation was not easy for anyone, much less for parents of children with special needs. The shutting down of special education systems meant that parents lost a vital support network and had to be the sole full-time caregivers despite often lacking the skills to cope with this new and daunting situation. We interviewed parents and learned that the main difficulties faced by homebound autistic children stemmed from the change in routine, lack of special education services, limited physical space, and food- and sleep-related issues. Some children experienced worsening in behavioral, social, and developmental domains, yet others seemed to not only overcome the challenges of changing conditions but even benefit from them. The children's success or failure was directly related to how their parents coped. The key factors that enabled successful coping were the parents' ability to accommodate to the child's needs, their own creativeness and resourcefulness, and a generally positive outlook. The results of this analysis revealed that the best way to benefit autistic children caught up in drastic changes in their routine lifestyle is to invest in a strong support system for their parents.","Tokatly Latzer, Itay; Leitner, Yael; Karnieli-Miller, Orit",Autism : the international journal of research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361320984317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33435701/,77

PURPOSE Medication reconciliation (MR) is a complicated and tedious process but is crucial to prevent errors when ordering patients' discharge medications during a hospital admission. Our institution currently uses a variety of methods to gather a patient's medication history, including review of the medical records and electronic pharmaceutical claims data (EPCD) from a commercial health information exchange organization, as well as a patient or caregiver interview. Occasionally, more information is needed to obtain the most accurate history. To augment current methods, EPCD can also be accessed for patients with Medicaid insurance using a state Medicaid Web portal. We aimed to evaluate the utility of the Medicaid Web portal for reducing medication errors during the MR process at hospital admission. SUMMARY A single-center, prospective, quality improvement initiative was conducted to evaluate 100 patient medication lists for all nonobstetric Medicaid patients admitted to our institution to identify discrepancies in medication lists when the state Medicaid Web portal was used in addition to standard MR methods. We found that, when EPCD from commercial organizations were available, they matched the patient's current medication list 64% of the time. One in 4 patients had at least 1 discrepancy on their verified medication list that was identified using the Medicaid Web portal.

134254,Dynamic Optical Coherence Elastography of the Anterior Eye: Understanding the Biomechanics of the Limbus.,2020-11-02,"To maintain homeostasis, all cells respond to environmental cues via a multitude of surface receptors. In order to act appropriately in their environment, cells are dependent on the transduction of the incoming signal through tightly regulated and interconnected signaling pathways to the cell nucleus. In particular, cells implicated in the immune system greatly depend on such systems to respond in a flexible and dynamic manner to environmental challenges. One major group of intracellular proteins that are involved in these signaling pathways are adaptor proteins. Although adaptor proteins are essential for normal immune cell operation, the functional role of this group of signaling proteins remains to be fully appreciated. So far, research on adaptor proteins has revealed their unique potential in building transient complexes in a reversible, dynamic, and inducible manner. In this review, we explore the roles of adaptor proteins - in space and time of intracellular signaling - and their associations with human disease. Examples of adaptor proteins expressed in hematopoietic cells highlight their crucial role in the immune system. Lastly, we present challenges faced in elucidating roles of adaptor proteins, as illustrated by the T cell-specific adaptor (TSAd) protein encoded by the SH2D2A gene.","Borowicz, Paweł; Chan, Hanna; Hauge, Anette; Spurkland, Anne",Scandinavian journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/sji.12951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734639/,77

A questionnaire of 23 questions was answered by medical and SRs in an Athens General Hospital. The questionnaire was designed based on the 2005 resuscitation guidelines. The questionnaire was answered by 137 residents (53.3% medical and 46.7% surgical). With regard to the knowledge questions, the mean score, on a maximum scale of 10, was 5.39±1.93 for the medical residents and 5.27±2.33 for the SRs. Their resuscitation knowledge was positively influenced by their attendance of Basic Life Support (P=0.005) and Advanced Life Support/Advanced Cardiac Life Support courses (P=0.013). Residents in this tertiary general hospital in Athens had inadequate knowledge of resuscitation guidelines and the majority of them were not currently certified in any of these courses.","Kyriakou, Fani; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Garofalakis, Ioannis; Trianti, Myrto; Stasinakis, Dionysios; Xanthos, Theodoros",European journal of emergency medicine : official journal of the European Society for Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mej.0b013e32833b02e4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20512040/,77

In the last decades there has been a resurgence of studies on psychological, psychiatric and neuroscientific aspects of mediumship, as well as studies assessing the claim that mediums can obtain anomalous information from deceased persons. OBJECTIVE To assess the evidence for anomalous information reception about deceased people in texts produced through alleged mediumistic writing (psychographic letters) under strictly controlled experimental conditions. METHOD Eight mediums and ninety-four sitters participated in the study. Eighteen mediumistic writing sessions were carried out using blind proxy sitters. Later, each sitter received the target mediumistic letter and five control letters paired by gender and age. Sitters blindly scored the accuracy of the six letters both with a global score and for each of the objectively verifiable items of information presented on the letters. Scores from target and control letters were compared. RESULTS There was no difference in global evaluation and specific fit scores between control and target letters. The mediums involved in the research were not able to show evidence for providing anomalous information about deceased people when under our strict controlled conditions. We argue for establishing a reasonable compromise between ecological validity and controlled condition.","Freire, Elizabeth Schmitt; Rocha, Alexandre Caroli; Tasca, Victor Scio; Marnet, Mateus Moreira; Moreira-Almeida, Alexander",Explore,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.explore.2020.08.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917531/,77

During the H1N1 pandemic, obesity was associated with an increased risk of influenza-associated intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and longer duration of ICU and hospital length of stay compared with the non-obese. These observations have raised a concern about the correlation between obesity and the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we have outlined the potential impacts of obesity on respiratory physiology and the function of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Also, it has been clearly illustrated that obese patients are potentially more vulnerable to COVID-19 and more contagious than lean patients. The comorbidities associated with obesity were found to be correlated with a severe clinical course of COVID-19 and increased mortality and high BMI has been shown to be correlated with hospitalisation, the need for mechanical ventilation and non-survival.

136030,Letter to the editor.,2020-01-01,"OBJECT We investigated possible associations among the presence of cholesterol crystals in embolic debris, the proportions of debris components, and postoperative cerebral embolism in patients undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS). METHODS Sixty-seven consecutive procedures were performed for internal carotid artery stenosis with CAS at our hospital between November 2015 and February 2018. Procedures for emergency CAS for stroke in evolution or crescendo transient ischemic attack were excluded (n = 12). The embolic debris from remaining procedures (n = 55) was stained with hematoxylin-eosin and the red blood cells, white blood cells, and fibrin were quantified by color-based segmentation. Cholesterol crystals and calcification were examined histopathologically. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed 1-3 days after CAS, and the images were used to classify procedures according to the presence of new lesions. RESULTS Of the 55 CAS procedures, new DWI lesions were identified after 32. One patient had symptomatic cerebral embolism. Higher proportions of patients with cholesterol crystals in embolic debris (17 vs. 78%, p < 0.001) and higher proportion of white blood cells (mean 2.3 [0-9.9] vs. 4.2% [0-29.9%], p < 0.01) were observed in the embolic debris of procedures with and without new DWI lesions. CONCLUSIONS Cholesterol crystals were common in the embolic debris from patients with postoperative ischemic lesions after CAS. These results suggest that inflammatory destabilization of the intraplaque lipid component is related to postprocedural DWI lesions.","Maekawa, Kota; Shibata, Masunari; Nakajima, Hideki; Kitano, Yotaro; Seguchi, Masaru; Kobayashi, Kazuto; Sano, Takanori; Yabana, Tadashi; Miya, Fumitaka",Cerebrovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000495795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30602147/,77
136087,Passing the Baton.,2015,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE To determine the frequency of new ischaemic or hemorrhagic brain lesions on early follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with cervical artery dissection (CAD) and to investigate the relationship with antithrombotic treatment. METHODS This prospective observational study included consecutive CAD patients with ischaemic or non-ischaemic symptoms within the preceding 4 weeks. All patients had baseline brain MRI scans at the time of CAD diagnosis and follow-up MRI scans within 30 days thereafter. Ischaemic lesions were detected by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), intracerebral bleeds (ICBs) by paramagnetic-susceptible sequences. Outcome measures were any new DWI lesions or ICBs on follow-up MRI scans. Kaplan-Meier statistics and calculated odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used for lesion occurrence, baseline characteristics and type of antithrombotic treatment (antiplatelet versus anticoagulant). RESULTS Sixty-eight of 74 (92%) CAD patients were eligible for analysis. Median (interquartile range) time interval between baseline and follow-up MRI scans was 5 (3-10) days. New DWI lesions occurred in 17 (25%) patients with a cumulative 30-day incidence of 41.3% (standard error 8.6%). Occurrence of new DWI lesions was associated with stroke or transient ischaemic attack at presentation [7.86 (2.01-30.93)], occlusion of the dissected vessel [4.09 (1.24-13.55)] and presence of DWI lesions on baseline MRI [6.67 (1.70-26.13)]. The type of antithrombotic treatment had no impact either on occurrence of new DWI lesions [1.00 (0.32-3.15)] or on functional 6-month outcome [1.27 (0.41-3.94)]. No new ICBs were observed. CONCLUSION New ischaemic brain lesions occurred in a quarter of CAD patients, independently of the type of antithrombotic treatment. MRI findings could potentially serve as surrogate outcomes in pilot treatment trials.","Gensicke, H; Ahlhelm, F; Jung, S; von Hessling, A; Traenka, C; Goeggel Simonetti, B; Peters, N; Bonati, L H; Fischer, U; Broeg-Morvay, A; Seiffge, D J; Gralla, J; Stippich, C; Baumgartner, R W; Lyrer, P A; Arnold, M; Engelter, S T",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.12682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25712171/,77

New recommendations from a national organization have urged the elimination of traditional surgeon's caps (surgical skull caps) and mandated the use of bouffant caps to prevent SSIs. OBJECTIVE To report SSI rates for >15 000 class I (clean) surgical procedures 13 mo before and 13 mo after surgical skull caps were banned at a single site with 25 operating rooms. METHODS SSI data were acquired from hospital infection control monthly summary reports from January 2014 to March 2016. Based on a change in hospital policy mandating obligatory use of bouffant caps since February 2015, data were categorized into nonbouffant and bouffant groups. Monthly and cumulative infection rates for 13 mo before (7513 patients) and 13 mo after (8446 patients) the policy implementation were collected and analyzed for the groups, respectively. RESULTS An overall increase of 0.07% (0.77%-0.84%) in the cumulative rate of SSI in all class I operating room cases and of 0.03% (0.79%-0.82%) in the cumulative rate of SSI in all spinal procedures was noted. However, neither increase reached statistical significance (P > .05). The cumulative rate of SSI in neurosurgery craniotomy/craniectomy cases decreased from 0.95% to 0.75%; this was also not statistically significant (P = 1.00). CONCLUSION National efforts at improving healthcare performance are laudable but need to be evidence based. Guidelines, especially when applied in a mandatory fashion, should be assessed for effectiveness. In this large, single-center series of patients undergoing class I surgical procedures, elimination of the traditional surgeon's cap did not reduce infection rates.","Shallwani, Hussain; Shakir, Hakeem J; Aldridge, Ashley M; Donovan, Maureen T; Levy, Elad I; Gibbons, Kevin J",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyx211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29447369/,77

The DNA DSB response and repair is facilitated by hierarchical signaling networks that orchestrate chromatin structural changes specifically histone modifications which impact cell-cycle checkpoints through enzymatic activities to repair the broken DNA ends. Various histone posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation have been shown to play a role in DNA damage repair. Recent studies have provided important insights into the role of histone-specific modifications in sensing DNA damage and facilitating the DNA repair. Histone modifications have been shown to determine the pathway choice for repair of DNA DSBs. This review will summarize the role of important histone acetyltransferases MOF and Tip60 mediated acetylation in repair of DNA DSBs in eukaryotic cells.","Mir, Ulfat Syed; Bhat, Audesh; Mushtaq, Arjamand; Pandita, Shruti; Altaf, Mohammad; Pandita, Tej K",DNA repair,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dnarep.2021.103205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399315/,77

METHODS Three hundred and three patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from the East Hospital of People's Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, China) were selected and divided into four groups: youth (20-40 years, n = 64), middle-aged (41-60 years, n = 89), older (61-80 years, n = 118) and elderly (81-100 years, n = 32). The clinical characteristics and imaging/laboratory findings including chest computed tomography (CT), initial blood count, C-reactive protein [CRP]), procalcitonin (PCT) and serum total IgE were captured and analysed. RESULTS (1) The first symptoms of all age groups were primarily fever (76%), followed by cough (12%) and dyspnoea (5%). Beside fever, the most common initial symptom of elderly patients was fatigue (13%). (2) Fever was the most common clinical manifestation (80%), with moderate fever being the most common (40%), followed by low fever in patients above 40 years old and high fever in those under 40 years (35%). Cough was the second most common clinical manifestation and was most common (80%) in the middle-aged. Diarrhoea was more common in the middle-aged (21%) and the older (19%). Muscle ache was more common in the middle-aged (15%). Chest pain was more common in the youth (13%), and 13% of the youth had no symptoms. (3) The proportion of patients with comorbidities increased with age. (4) Seventy-one per cent of the patients had positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results and 29% had positive chest CT scans before admission to the hospital. (5) Lesions in all lobes of the lung were observed as the main chest CT findings (76%). (6) Decrease in lymphocytes and increase in monocytes were common in the patients over 40 years old but rare in the youth. Eosinophils (50%), red blood cells (39%) and haemoglobin (40%) decreased in all age groups. (7) The proportion of patients with CRP and PCT elevation increased with age. (8) Thirty-nine per cent of the patients had elevated IgE, with the highest proportion in the old (49%). CONCLUSION The clinical characteristics and imaging/laboratory findings of COVID-19 patients vary in different age groups.

The two major membrane-associated proteins of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), GP5 and M (encoded by ORF5 and ORF6 genes, respectively), are associated as disulfide-linked heterodimers (GP5/M) in the virus particle. In this study, we designed 5 of the small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the GP5 and M gene of PRRSV respectively, and investigated their inhibition to the production of PRRSV. The highest activity displayed in shRNAs of the ORF6e sequence (nts 261-279), which the inhibition rate reached was 99.09%. The result suggests that RNAi technology might serve as a potential molecular strategy for PRRSV therapy. Furthermore, the transgenic Marc-145 cell line of piggyBac transposon-derived targeting shRNA interference against PRRS virus was established. It presented stable inhibition to the replication and amplification of PRRS. The work implied that shRNAs targeting the GP5 and M gene of PRRSV may be used as potential RNA vaccines in vivo, and supplied the screening methods of transformed pig embryonic fibroblast which are prerequisite for the disease-resistant transgenic pigs to PRRS.","Zhou, Fang; Liang, Shuang; Chen, An-hui; Singh, Chabungbam Orville; Bhaskar, Roy; Niu, Yan-shan; Miao, Yun-gen",Veterinary research communications,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11259-012-9519-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22297554/,77

RESULTS Median operative time was higher in patients with SPLS (p = 0.01), but the median operative blood loss was significantly lower (p = 0.006). No significant difference was found in intraoperative- (p = 0.14) or postoperative complication rate (p = 0.4) or 30-day mortality (p = 0.62). A tendency towards fewer late complications in the SPLS-group was seen (11.1% vs. 25.3%), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.084).

Carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) resulting from delayed aneurysmal rupture is a rare complication of PED placement with unknown pathophysiology. Here, we describe a case of CCF resulting from aneurysmal rupture following PED placement, and present the details of treatment by transvenous coil embolization. An 81-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for treatment of an 18.0 × 10.3 mm intracranial aneurysm located in the cavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery, noted during an examination of her diplopia. Endovascular treatment was conducted by positioning a single PED (4.75 × 25 mm) across the neck of the aneurysm. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 8 days post procedure. On post-procedure day 10, her left oculomotor nerve palsy had worsened and she had developed left abducens nerve palsy, left exophthalmos, and left chemosis. Angiography demonstrated left direct CCF because of rupture of the aneurysm that had been treated with PED. Transvenous coil embolization was performed on post-procedure day 11 to treat the CCF, and complete resolution of the CCF and significant thrombus formation within the aneurysm sac were confirmed 11 days after the second procedure. Our angiographic results suggest that the aneurysmal rupture was caused by aneurysmal volume expansion associated with PED-induced thrombosis.

138855,Emerging glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists for the treatment of obesity.,2021-06-28,"Phenanthrene (PHE) is an important organic compound, which is widespread in the soil environment and exhibits potential threats to soil organisms. Toxic effects of PHE to earthworms have been extensively studied, but toxic mechanisms on PHE-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress at the molecular and cellular levels have not been reported yet. Therefore, we explored the cytotoxicity and oxidative stress caused by PHE in earthworm coelomocytes and the interaction mechanism between PHE and the major antioxidant enzymes SOD/CAT. It was shown that high-dose PHE exposure induced the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mediated lipid peroxidation, reduced total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in coelomocytes, and triggered oxidative stress, thus resulted in a strong cytotoxicity at higher concentrations (0.6-1.0 mg/L). The intracellular SOD/CAT activity in cells after PHE exposure were congruent with that in molecular levels, which the activity of SOD enhanced and CAT inhibited. Spectroscopic studies showed the SOD/CAT protein skeleton and secondary structure, as well as the micro-environment of aromatic amino acids were changed after PHE binding. Molecular docking indicated PHE preferentially docked to the surface of SOD. However, the key residues Tyr 357, His 74, and Asn 147 for activity were in the binding pocket, indicating PHE more likely to dock to the active center of CAT. In addition, H-bonding and hydrophobic force were the primary driving force in the binding interaction between PHE and SOD/CAT. This study indicates that PHE can induce cytotoxicity and oxidative damage to coelomocytes and unearthes the potential effects of PHE on earthworms.","He, Falin; Liu, Qiang; Jing, Mingyang; Wan, Jingqiang; Huo, Chengqian; Zong, Wansong; Tang, Jingchun; Liu, Rutao",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118541/,77
138886,Cryptic brain abscess - do not forget hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia!,2021-01-27,"This report consists of two separate studies on the use of continuous capnography monitoring conducted in an effort to improve patient safety at Virtua Health System. The desire for improved patient safety is motivating continuous monitoring and improved surveillance in clinical areas not traditionally equipped for such monitoring. We explored the use of remote monitoring of capnography, using enterprise middleware, in patients recovering from surgery in a medical-surgical unit. Continuous monitoring traditionally has been used in higher-acuity settings, such as intensive care units. Patients diagnosed or suspected to have obstructive or central sleep apnea may benefit from the increased surveillance afforded by continuous monitoring. Pain management in this cohort of patients, recovering from bariatric, joint replacement, or other major surgery, often involves administration of opioids (e.g., hydromorphone, morphine sulfate), which are known to increase risk of respiratory depression. Continuous monitoring of these patients increases the likelihood of detecting adverse clinical events. Our goal was to implement continuous monitoring in order to identify alarm conditions caused by adverse clinical events requiring intervention (e.g., opioid-induced respiratory depression) and artifacts related to patient movement, suspect measurements, or other medical device-generated alarm signals.","Supe, Dana; Baron, Leah; Decker, Tom; Parker, Kyle; Venella, Jeanne; Williams, Sarah; Beaton, Kari; Zaleski, John",Biomedical instrumentation & technology,https://doi.org/10.2345/0899-8205-51.3.236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28530876/,77

LOCAL PROBLEM No standard method exists for measuring perceived HRQOL during the COVID-19 pandemic in participants as they attempt to improve their self-determined wellness goals. An implementation plan that considers the social distancing limitations imposed can be used to predict an individual's likelihood of long-term success. METHODS During the four, 2-week plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles, the Social Cognitive Theory model informed the implementation of the four core interventions. To guide iterative changes, the data was analyzed through Excel and run charts. INTERVENTIONS The four core interventions were the shared decision-making tool (SDMT), health mobile app tool (HMAT), wellness tracker tool (WTT), and the team engagement plan. RESULTS Among 28 participants, perceived quality of life increased by 70%, engagement in shared decision-making increased to 82%, app use and confidence increased to 85%, and goal attainment reached 81%. CONCLUSIONS The SDMT, health app, and wellness tracker created a methodical plan of accountability for increasing participant wellness. The contextual barrier of the COVID-19 pandemic added a negative wellness burden which was mitigated by creating a patient-centered culture of wellness.","Myers, Sybilla; Kennedy, Christopher",Journal of doctoral nursing practice,https://doi.org/10.1891/jdnp-d-20-00078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34108200/,77

Single-access laparoscopic surgery (SALS) can be effective for benign and malignant diseases of the ileum in both the elective and urgent setting. Methods. Ten consecutive, nonselected patients with ileal disease requiring surgery over a twelve month period were included. All had a preoperative abdominopelvic computerized tomogram. Peritoneal access was achieved via a single transumbilical incision and a ""surgical glove port"" utilized as our preferred access device. With the pneumoperitoneum established, the relevant ileal loop was located using standard rigid instruments. For ileal resection, anastomosis, or enterotomy, the site of pathology was delivered and addressed extracorporeally. Result. The median (range) age of the patients was 42.5 (22-78) years, and the median body mass index was 22 (20.2-28) kg/m(2). Procedures included tru-cut biopsy of an ileal mesenteric mass, loop ileostomy and ileotomy for impacted gallstone extraction as well as ileal (n = 3) and ileocaecal resection (n = 4). Mean (range) incision length was 2.5 (2-5) cm. All convalescences were uncomplicated. Conclusions. These preliminary results show that SALS is an efficient and safe modality for the surgical management of ileal disease with all the advantages of minimal access surgery and without requiring a significant increase in theatre resource or cost or incurring extra patient morbidity.","Moftah, Mohamed; Burke, John; Narendra, Aaditya; Cahill, Ronan A",Minimally invasive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/697142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22530116/,77

140900,Comfort rules for face masks among healthcare workers during COVID-19 spread.,2021-04-02,"PURPOSE To investigate the prevalence of mental health conditions and burnout among practising optometrists in Australia. METHODS A cross-sectional survey of registered practising Australian optometrists was undertaken over a three-week period from mid-November 2019. The survey comprised three well-established mental health scales (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale [K10], Depression Anxiety Stress Scales [DASS-21] and Maslach Burnout Inventory [MBI]) and an open-ended question inviting comments. RESULTS Five hundred and five respondents completed the K10, representing 8.8% of registered optometrists in Australia; 466 completed all three scales. Prevalence of moderate to severe psychological distress (K10 ≥ 25) was 30.7% (95% CI 26.7%-34.7%), with similar findings for depression and anxiety (DASS-21). Prevalence of high burnout, as indicated by MBI-GS exhaustion was 56.1% (95% CI 51.7%-60.4%), cynicism 57.1% (95% CI 52.7%-61.5%) and professional efficacy 23.1% (95% CI 19.4%-26.8%). Optometrists aged ≤ 30 years were 3.5 times more likely to report moderate to severe psychological distress compared to optometrists aged >30 years (OR = 3.54, P < 0.001, 95% CI 2.38-5.25). The most frequently mentioned work-related issues concerned retail pressures, workload and career dissatisfaction. CONCLUSIONS The rates of mental health conditions and burnout reported by practising Australian optometrists were high compared with the general population and other health professionals. Younger age and burnout were significant risk factors for psychological distress. Interventions are required to address these issues, particularly for younger optometrists, and could include workplace modifications and building resilience to improve personal mental wellbeing and ensure patient safety.","Bentley, Sharon A; Black, Alex; Khawaja, Nigar; Fylan, Fiona; Griffiths, Amanda M; Wood, Joanne M",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians,https://doi.org/10.1111/opo.12823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33877691/,77
140990,The Key to Antibiotic Stewardship Is Combining Interventions.,2020-08-03,"Background Low bioavailability and poor permeability of the blood-brain barrier are problematic when delivering therapeutic agents and particularly anti-human immunodeficiency virus therapy to the central nervous system. The intranasal route offers an alternative for central nervous system delivery. Cubosomes have been reported as helpful vehicles for intranasal delivery of therapeutics to enable brain targeting. Objective In this study, we aimed to develop the intranasal cubosomal thermogelling dispersion of saquinavir mesylate for central nervous system delivery. Methods The Box-Behnken design was applied to study the effect of monoolein, Poloxamer 407, and polyvinyl alcohol as independent factors and the particle size, entrapment efficiency, gelation temperature, and stability index as responses. The optimized cubosomes were evaluated using transmission electron microscopy, ex vivo permeation, and in vivo pharmacokinetics. Results The optimized formula consisting of monoolein (8.96%), Poloxamer 407 (17.45%), and polyvinyl alcohol (7.5%) was prepared and evaluated. Higher values for the steady-state flux, permeability coefficient, and enhancement factor were observed for the cubosomal thermogelling dispersion of saquinavir during ex vivo permeation in comparison with an aqueous suspension of saquinavir. From the pharmacokinetic profile, the relative bioavailability for the intranasal optimized formula was approximately 12-fold higher when compared with oral aqueous suspension and 2.5-fold greater when compared to the intranasal aqueous suspension of saquinavir. Conclusion Overall, the saquinavir-loaded cubosomal thermogelling formulation is promising for central nervous system delivery by intranasal administration.","Hosny, Khaled M",International journal of nanomedicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s261855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764940/,77

The objective of the current study was to determine whether recent oncologic treatment is associated with a higher risk of death among patients with carcinoma who are hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS Data regarding 248 consecutive patients with carcinoma who were hospitalized with COVID-19 were collected retrospectively from 33 hospitals in Hubei Province, China, from January 1, 2020, to March 25, 2020. The follow-up cutoff date was July 22, 2020. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with a higher risk of death. RESULTS Of the 248 patients enrolled, the median age was 63 years and 128 patients (52%) were male. On admission, 147 patients (59%) did not undergo recent oncologic treatment, whereas 32 patients (13%), 25 patients (10%), 12 patients (5%), and 10 patients (4%), respectively, underwent chemotherapy, surgery, targeted therapy, and radiotherapy. At the time of last follow-up, 51 patients (21%) were critically ill during hospitalization, 40 of whom had died. Compared with patients without receipt of recent oncologic treatment, the mortality rate of patients who recently received oncologic treatment was significantly higher (24.8% vs 10.2%; hazard ratio, 2.010 [95% CI, 1.079-3.747; P = .027]). After controlling for confounders, recent receipt of chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 7.495; 95% CI, 1.398-34.187 [P = .015]), surgery (OR, 8.239; 95% CI, 1.637-41.955 [P = .012]), and radiotherapy (OR, 15.213; 95% CI, 2.091-110.691 [P = .007]) were identified as independently associated with a higher risk of death. CONCLUSIONS The results of the current study demonstrated a possible association between recent receipt of oncologic treatment and a higher risk of death among patients with carcinoma who are hospitalized with COVID-19.","Song, Kehan; Gong, Hongyun; Xu, Bin; Dong, Xiaorong; Li, Linjun; Hu, Weidong; Wang, Qun; Xie, Zhibin; Rao, Zhiguo; Luo, Zhiguo; Chu, Qian; Li, Feng; Wang, Jie",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33136293/,77

We generated a unique dataset of 81,643 APCs, including monocytes and rare dendritic cell (DC) subsets. We uncovered multi-process defects in antiviral immune defence in specific APCs from patients with severe disease: (1) increased pro-apoptotic pathways in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs, key effectors of antiviral immunity), (2) a decrease of the innate sensors TLR9 and DHX36 in pDCs and CLEC9a+ DCs, respectively, (3) downregulation of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes in monocyte subsets and (4) a decrease of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-related genes and MHC class II transactivator activity in cDC1c+ DCs, suggesting viral inhibition of antigen presentation. These novel mechanisms may explain patient aggravation and suggest strategies to restore the defective immune defence.","Saichi, Melissa; Ladjemi, Maha Zohra; Korniotis, Sarantis; Rousseau, Christophe; Ait Hamou, Zakaria; Massenet-Regad, Lucile; Amblard, Elise; Noel, Floriane; Marie, Yannick; Bouteiller, Delphine; Medvedovic, Jasna; Pène, Frédéric; Soumelis, Vassili",Nature cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-021-00681-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33972731/,77

METHODS A neuroradiologist and 2 stroke neurology fellows independently reviewed 100 prospectively collected single-phase and multiphase CTA scans from acute ischemic stroke patients with mild symptoms (NIH Stroke Scale score ≤5). The presence and location of a vascular occlusion(s) were documented. Interrater agreement single- and multiphase CTA was quantified using unweighted κ statistics. We assessed for any occlusions, anterior vs posterior occlusions, and pial vessel asymmetry. RESULTS Using multiphase CTA, the neuroradiologist detected 50 scans with anterior circulation occlusions and 15 scans with posterior circulation occlusions. Median reading time was 2 minutes per scan. Median reading time for the neurologists was 3 minutes per multiphase CTA scan. Interrater agreement was fair between the 2 neurologists and neuroradiologist when using single-phase CTA (κ = 0.45 and 0.32). Agreement improved minimally when stratified by anterior vs posterior circulation. When using multiphase CTA, agreement was high for detection of occlusion or asymmetry of pial vessels in the anterior circulation (κ = 0.80 and 0.84). CONCLUSIONS Multiphase CTA improves diagnostic accuracy in minor ischemic stroke for detection of anterior circulation intracranial occlusion. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class II evidence that multiphase CTA, compared to single-phase CTA, improves the interrater agreement between stroke neurology trainees and an expert neuroradiologist for detecting anterior circulation intracranial vascular occlusion in patients with minor acute ischemic strokes.","Yu, Amy Y X; Zerna, Charlotte; Assis, Zarina; Holodinsky, Jessalyn K; Randhawa, Privia A; Najm, Mohamed; Goyal, Mayank; Menon, Bijoy K; Demchuk, Andrew M; Coutts, Shelagh B; Hill, Michael D",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000002951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27385749/,77

METHODS A total of 94 patients scheduled for supratentorial craniotomy were enrolled. Patients received either lidocaine through an intravenous bolus (1.5 mg/kg) after induction followed by infusion at a rate of 2 mg/kg/h until the end of surgery or the same volume of normal saline. Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and bispectral index were recorded at different intraoperative time points. Patients were assessed for pain in the postoperative anesthesia care unit (PACU) by the numeric rating scale (NRS). Other complications including hypertension, tachycardia, dysphoria, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were reported. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the normal saline and lidocaine group for mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and bispectral index at any time point (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of hypertension, tachycardia, dysphoria, and PONV between groups (P>0.05). The incidence of mild pain (NRS between 1 and 3) after surgery in PACU was lower in lidocaine group than that in the normal saline group (P=0.014); the number of patients with an NRS pain score of 0 before leaving the PACU was significantly greater in the lidocaine group. No patient in either group had moderate or severe pain.

In many areas, COVID-19 has also either exacerbated already existing or created new inequalities in relation to specific parts of the population. Older individuals are one group in society that has been widely impacted, while social isolation/shielding measures have placed them in higher risk of loneliness, isolation, financial deprivation and mental health challenges, to name a few. This commentary reflects on such inequalities across four European nations (the United Kingdom (UK), Republic of Ireland, Finland, Spain) and draws attention to the critical role of Gerontological Social Work (GSW), while emphasizing the ways in which social work can intervene. First, we identify common concerns for the rights of older people that span across all four nations, and second, we identify significant roles for GSW practitioners at the individual, community and policy levels and conclude with a call for GSW in these four nations to be reimagined in a time of global crisis.","Pentaris, Panagiotis; Willis, Paul; Ray, Mo; Deusdad, Blanca; Lonbay, Sarah; Niemi, Mia; Donnelly, Sarah",Journal of gerontological social work,https://doi.org/10.1080/01634372.2020.1821143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32967591/,77
142746,Novel Algorithm for Automated Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter Measurement Using a Clustering Approach.,2020-08-22,"The relevance of right atrial pressure (RAP) as the backpressure for venous return (QVR) and mean systemic filling pressure as upstream pressure is controversial during dynamic changes of circulation. To examine the immediate response of QVR (sum of caval vein flows) to changes in RAP and pump function, we used a closed-chest, central cannulation, heart bypass porcine preparation (n = 10) with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Mean systemic filling pressure was determined by clamping extracorporeal membrane oxygenation tubing with open or closed arteriovenous shunt at euvolemia, volume expansion (9.75 ml/kg hydroxyethyl starch), and hypovolemia (bleeding 19.5 ml/kg after volume expansion). The responses of RAP and QVR were studied using variable pump speed at constant airway pressure (PAW) and constant pump speed at variable PAW Within each volume state, the immediate changes in QVR and RAP could be described with a single linear regression, regardless of whether RAP was altered by pump speed or PAW (r2 = 0.586-0.984). RAP was inversely proportional to pump speed from zero to maximum flow (r2 = 0.859-0.999). Changing PAW caused immediate, transient, directionally opposite changes in RAP and QVR (RAP: P ≤ 0.002 and QVR: P ≤ 0.001), where the initial response was proportional to the change in QVR driving pressure. Changes in PAW generated volume shifts into and out of the right atrium, but their effect on upstream pressure was negligible. Our findings support the concept that RAP acts as backpressure to QVR and that Guyton's model of circulatory equilibrium qualitatively predicts the dynamic response from changing RAP.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Venous return responds immediately to changes in right atrial pressure. Concomitant volume shifts within the systemic circulation due to an imbalance between cardiac output and venous return have negligible effects on mean systemic filling pressure. Guyton's model of circulatory equilibrium can qualitatively predict the resulting changes in dynamic conditions with right atrial pressure as backpressure to venous return.","Moller, Per W; Winkler, Bernhard; Hurni, Samuel; Heinisch, Paul Philipp; Bloch, Andreas; Sondergaard, Soren; Jakob, Stephan M; Takala, Jukka; Berger, David",American journal of physiology.

We hypothesized that increased pneumococcal load or augmented inflammatory cytokine production might lead to destructive pneumococcal lung disease. METHODS This study enrolled prospectively 0- to 18-year-old children with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia with pleural effusion admitted to 6 medical centers from March 2010 to April 2012. Children were diagnosed with pneumococcal empyema if the pleural fluid tested positive for quantitative pneumococcal (lytA) detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Pneumococcal empyema cases were further divided into 4 groups according to necrosis severity: (0) nonnecrosis, (1) mild necrosis, (2) cavitation and (3) bronchopleural fistula. Nasopharyngeal and pleural pneumococcal load, as well as levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8), Th1-(IL-2, IFN-γ), Th2-(IL-4, IL-10) and Th17-cytokines (IL-17), in the pleural fluid was measured. RESULTS Serotypes 19A and 3 accounted for 69.4% and 12.5%, respectively, of 72 cases of pneumococcal empyema. Pleural pneumococcal load was significantly higher in serotypes 19A and 3 infection than in the other strains causing infection (P = 0.006). There was a correlation between nasopharyngeal and pleural pneumococcal load (ρ = 0.35; P = 0.05). In multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis, pleural pneumococcal load (adjusted odds ratio: 1.79; 95% confidence interval: 1.03-3.06) and IL-8 (adjusted odds ratio: 2.64; 95% confidence interval: 1.21-5.75) were independent factors associated with the severity of lung necrosis.

143181,Prediction of response to endoscopic therapy of Barrett's dysplasia by using genetic biomarkers.,2014,"INTRODUCTION Intracranial infectious aneurysm (IIA) accounts for less than 5% of all intracranial aneurysms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of endovascular treatment for IIA. METHODS During a 14-year period, 15 patients (age range, 2-68 years; mean, 42.8 years) with 17 aneurysms were diagnosed with IIA and treated via an endovascular route at our institution. The IIA diagnosis was based on clinical and laboratory findings of infection, echocardiography results, and digital subtraction angiography that were collected retrospectively. All patients were clinically and radiologically followed. The modified Rankin scale was used to evaluate clinical outcome. RESULTS Among 15 patients, 12 presented with ruptured aneurysms (7 intraparenchymal hematoma, 4 subarachnoid hemorrhage, 1 subdural hematoma), 2 with cerebral infarcts, and 1 with pansinusitis and epidural abscess. All but one aneurysm were distally located in intracranial circulation, 14 were in anterior, and the remaining 3 were in posterior circulation. The final diagnosis was based on aneurysm morphology, location, and clinical laboratory findings. Endovascular treatment was scheduled initially for all IIAs; 13 of 17 IIAs underwent endovascular parent vessel occlusion, 3 underwent spontaneous parent vessel occlusion while waiting for intervention, and the remaining patient was treated by intrasaccular coil occlusion. There were no instances of perioperative neurological complications. Late clinical and radiological outcomes included absence of endovascular treatment related to mortality and aneurysm recurrence. CONCLUSION Endovascular treatment may be performed safely at the time of diagnosis for at least symptomatic IIAs under the protective effect of antibiotic treatment.","Esenkaya, Asim; Duzgun, Fatih; Cinar, Celal; Bozkaya, Halil; Eraslan, Cenk; Ozgiray, Erkin; Oran, Ismail",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-015-1633-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26700825/,77
143527,Comprehensive hospital-based regional survey of anaphylaxis in Japanese children: Time trends of triggers and adrenaline use.,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with poor prognosis after stroke. We assessed the effects of RD on outcomes and interaction with low- versus standard-dose alteplase in a post hoc subgroup analysis of the ENCHANTED (Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study). METHODS A total of 3220 thrombolysis-eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke (mean age, 66.5 years; 37.8% women) were randomly assigned to low-dose (0.6 mg/kg) or standard-dose (0.9 mg/kg) intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Six hundred and fifty-nine (19.8%) patients had moderate-to-severe RD (estimated glomerular filtration rate, <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2) at baseline. The impact of RD on death or disability (modified Rankin Scale scores, 2-6) at 90 days, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, was assessed in logistic regression models. RESULTS Compared with patients with normal renal function (>90 mL/min per 1.73 m2), those with severe RD (<30 mL/min per 1.73 m2) had increased mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.89-4.82; P=0.04 for trend); every 10 mL/min per 1.73 m2 lower estimated glomerular filtration rate was associated with an adjusted 9% increased odds of death from thrombolysis-treated acute ischemic stroke. There was no significant association with modified Rankin Scale scores 2 to 6 (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-1.70; P=0.81 for trend), modified Rankin Scale 3 to 6 (adjusted odds ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-2.01; P=0.44 for trend), or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, or any heterogeneity in comparative treatment effects between low-dose and standard-dose alteplase by RD grades. CONCLUSIONS RD is associated with increased mortality but not disability or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in thrombolysis-eligible and treated acute ischemic stroke patients. Uncertainty persists as to whether low-dose alteplase confers benefits over standard-dose alteplase in acute ischemic stroke patients with RD.

They are the largest RNA viruses, which genomes and encoded RNAs are known to fold into the highly-order structures that play essential roles in the viral replication and infectivity cycle. The recent outbreaks of new pathogenic coronaviruses steered researchers’ attention into the possibility of targeting their RNAs directly with novel RNA-specific drugs and therapeutic strategies. In this manuscript, we highlight the recent biochemical and biophysical methodological advancements that yielded more in-depth insight into the structural and functional composition of coronaviruses cis-acting RNA motifs. We discuss the complexity of these RNA regulatory elements, their intermolecular interactions, post-transcriptional regulation, and their potential as druggable targets.

Physical exercise has an important role in the preservation of the immune system, which is vital to prevent infections. To promote physical exercise and maintain a healthy status, recent studies have suggested general exercise routines to be implemented during the quarantine period. However, to improve the health-related physical fitness components, any specific prescription should include intensity, volume, duration, and mode. Controversy persists about which is the best intensity of physical activity, while performing exercise at a moderate intensity could bring important benefits to asymptomatic people. High intensity or unaccustomed exercise should be restricted for older people, and for people of all ages with chronic diseases or compromised immune system, obesity, or upper respiratory tract infection with limited symptoms. Besides, physical activity guidelines should be particular to each population group, giving special consideration to those vulnerable to COVID-19 who are much more likely to suffer more self-isolation. Therefore, the present study is to provide specific physical activity recommendations for different populations during this pandemic.","Baena Morales, Salvador; Tauler Riera, Pedro; Aguiló Pons, Antonio; García Taibo, Olalla",Nutricion hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.20960/nh.03363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33371695/,77

We have investigated the properties for image guidance using fiducial markers implanted through minimally invasive bronchoscopy. METHODS Two fiducial marker types were implanted endobronchially in 10 patients undergoing radical radiation treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (eight using Visicoil linear fiducial markers [IBA Dosimetry GmbH, Schwarzenbruck Germany] and two using superDimension and superLock two-band markers [Covidien Inc., Minneapolis, MN]). Patients underwent four-dimensional computed tomography imaging for treatment planning and after completion of treatment to investigate marker movement. As part of the image guidance assessment, megavolt electronic portal images (EPIs) were acquired in addition to kilovolt planar and CBCT (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) images. RESULTS In two of 10 patients (both receiving Visicoil markers), marker migration was observed before treatment. In patients with stable markers, both types were clearly visible in planar kilovolt imaging; however, in EPIs the markers could be detected only in selected beam directions in which bony interference was minimal. Diagnostic computed tomography scanning was able to demonstrate the markers with clarity, but significant starring artifacts were observed in CBCT. This was particularly problematic in patients with some lateral component of tumor motion during breathing. CONCLUSIONS The potential for fiducial migration must be considered and investigated if bronchoscopic implantation of fiducial markers is performed. The choice of marker is a compromise between trying to minimize CBCT artifacts while enabling visualization in EPI imaging, which is an ideal tool to verify gated radiotherapy delivery.","Jackson, Price; Steinfort, Daniel P; Kron, Tomas; Siva, Shankar",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2016.04.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27130830/,77

144385,Comment on 'The use of the EEG in measuring therapeutic drug action: focus on depression and antidepressants'.,2012,"Chinese medicine (CM) was extensively used to treat COVID-19 in China. We aimed to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of add-on semi-individualized CM during the outbreak. A retrospective cohort of 1788 adult confirmed COVID-19 patients were recruited from 2235 consecutive linked records retrieved from five hospitals in Wuhan during 15 January to 13 March 2020. The mortality of add-on semi-individualized CM users and non-users was compared by inverse probability weighted hazard ratio (HR) and by propensity score matching. Change of biomarkers was compared between groups, and the frequency of CMs used was analyzed. Subgroup analysis was performed to stratify disease severity and dose of CM exposure. The crude mortality was 3.8% in the semi-individualized CM user group and 17.0% among the non-users. Add-on CM was associated with a mortality reduction of 58% (HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.77, [Formula: see text] = 0.005) among all COVID-19 cases and 66% (HR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.76, [Formula: see text] = 0.009) among severe/critical COVID-19 cases demonstrating dose-dependent response, after inversely weighted with propensity score. The result was robust in various stratified, weighted, matched, adjusted and sensitivity analyses. Severe/critical patients that received add-on CM had a trend of stabilized D-dimer level after 3-7 days of admission when compared to baseline. Immunomodulating and anti-asthmatic CMs were most used. Add-on semi-individualized CM was associated with significantly reduced mortality, especially among severe/critical cases. Chinese medicine could be considered as an add-on regimen for trial use.","Shu, Zixin; Chang, Kai; Zhou, Yana; Peng, Chaoan; Li, Xugui; Cai, Wei; Wei, Li; Zheng, Qiguang; Tian, Haoyu; Xia, Jianan; Yang, Kuo; Wang, Ning; Liu, Jifen; Min, Xiaojun; Yan, Dengying; Sun, Jing; Wu, Huan; Li, Xiaomeng; Zheng, Yi; Yu, Zecong; Lu, Xi; Yang, Yuxia; Jia, Ting; Ji, Jinghui; Zou, Qunzheng; Wang, Yinyan; Xiao, Minzhong; Zhang, Qing; Xiong, Yajuan; Sun, Feng; Zhu, Qiang; Jiang, Xingxing; Wang, Guodong; Tang, Sydney Chi-Wai; Zhang, Junhua; Li, Xiuyang; Zhang, Nevin; Zhang, Boli; Tong, Xiaolin; Liu, Baoyan; Zhou, Xuezhong; Chan, Kam Wa; Li, Xiaodong",The American journal of Chinese medicine,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0192415x21500257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33683189/,77

We presented here a robust gene expression-based molecular classification of IDH wild-type diffuse LGG into two subtypes with distinct biological and clinical features. A discovery cohort of 49 IDH wild-type diffuse LGGs from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) was subjected to clustering and function analysis. 73 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to validate our findings. Consensus clustering of transcriptional data uncovered concordant classification of two robust and prognostically significant subtypes of IDH wild-type LGG. Sub1, associated with poorer outcomes, was characterized by significantly higher immune, cytolytic scores, M2 macrophages and up-regulation of immune exhaustion markers; while Sub2 who had elevated lymphocytes and plasma cells showed relatively favorable survival. Somatic alteration analysis revealed Sub1 showed more frequently deleted regions, such as locus of CDKN2A/CDKN2B, DMRTA1, C9orf53 and MTAP. Furthermore, we developed and validated a five-gene signature for better application of this acquired stratification. Our data demonstrate the biological and prognostic heterogeneity within IDH wild-type diffuse LGGs and deepen our molecular understanding of this tumor entity. This article is protected by copyright.

The study was a cross-sectional surveyperformed among 309 HCWs in a tertiaryhospital during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Data were collected through an anonymous, self-rated questionnaire, including demographic data, a 10-item COVID-19 stress questionnaire, Generic QOL Inventory-74, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Hierarchical regression was used to analyse the relationship between the study variables and the QOL. Among the 309 participants, resilience and active coping were positively correlated with the QOL (P<0.001), whereas, working in confirmed case wards, COVID-19 stress, and passive coping were negatively correlated with the QOL (P<0.001). Resilience and the active coping were negatively correlated with COVID-19 stress (P<0.001). Resilience, coping style,and COVID-19 stressaccounted for 32%, 13%, and 8% of the variance in predicting the Global QOL, respectively.

However, templates may affect interactions during the review and potentially inhibit patient-centred care. AIM To systematically review literature on the impact of LTC review templates on process and health outcomes, and the views of healthcare professionals and patients on using review templates in consultations. DESIGN AND SETTING Parallel qualitative and quantitative systematic reviews. METHOD Following Cochrane methodology, we searched nine databases (1995-2019; updated July 2020) for clinical trials and qualitative studies of LTC templates in healthcare settings. We performed duplicate selection, risk-of-bias assessment and data extraction. The quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted in parallel and findings synthesised narratively. RESULTS We included 12 qualitative and 14 quantitative studies (two studies reported both qualitative and quantitative data and were included in both analyses). Review templates were well used, but the only study to assess health outcomes showed no effect. Templates can improve documentation of key measures, and act as a reminder tool; however, this can restrict the review process, and risks prioritising healthcare professional agendas over patients. Templates may also limit opportunities to discuss individuals' concerns about living with their condition, and act as a barrier to providing patient-centred care. CONCLUSION Future research should evaluate health as well as process outcomes. The potential benefits of templates in improving documentation should be balanced against concerns that 'tick boxes' may override patient agendas unless templates are designed to promote patient-centred care.","Morrissey, Mary; Shepherd, Elizabeth; Kinley, Emma; McClatchey, Kirstie; Pinnock, Hilary",The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp.2020.0963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33690148/,77

We sought to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of patients who met DAWN criteria but underwent thrombectomy beyond 24 hours of TLKW. METHODS A retrospective review of endovascular thrombectomy databases at three comprehensive stroke centers was performed to identify all patients who received thrombectomy beyond 24 hours of TLKW and otherwise met the DAWN criteria. Baseline characteristics, efficacy, and safety outcomes were compared with patients in the DAWN trial intervention arm. RESULTS Twenty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. Rates of successful reperfusion (mTICI2b-3: 81% vs 84%, P=0.72), 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2, 43% vs 48%, P=0.68), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (5% vs 6%, P=0.87) were comparable across the two groups. CONCLUSION Thrombectomy appears to be safe and feasible in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to LVO meeting all DAWN trial criteria but treated beyond 24 hours of TLKW with outcomes comparable to patients in the DAWN trial intervention arm.

146056,"Brain AVMs: an endovascular, surgical, and radiosurgical update.",2014,"OBJECTIVE This study addresses a very important problem in Neurology, distinguishing tremor and ataxia using quantitative methods. Specifically, we aimed to quantitatively separate dysmetria, a cardinal sign of ataxia, from tremor in Essential Tremor (ET). METHODS In experiment 1, we compared nineteen participants diagnosed with ET undergoing thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS; ETDBS ) to 19 healthy controls (HC). We quantified tremor during postural tasks using accelerometry and dysmetria with fast, reverse-at-target goal-directed movements. To ensure that endpoint accuracy was unaffected by tremor, we quantified dysmetria in selected trials manifesting a smooth trajectory to the endpoint. Finally, we manipulated tremor amplitude by switching DBS ON and OFF to examine its effect on dysmetria. In experiment 2, we compared 10 ET participants (ET) with 10 HC to determine if we could identify and distinguish dysmetria from tremor in non-DBS ET. RESULTS Three findings suggest that we can quantify dysmetria independent of tremor in ET. First, ETDBS and ET exhibited greater dysmetria than HC and dysmetria did not correlate with tremor (R2 <0.01). Second, even for trials with tremor-free trajectories to the target, ET exhibited greater dysmetria than HC (p<0.01). Third, activating DBS reduced tremor (p<0.01) but had no effect on dysmetria (p>0.2). INTERPRETATION We demonstrate that dysmetria can be quantified independent of tremor using fast, reverse at target goal-directed movements. These results have important implications for the understanding of ET and other cerebellar and tremor disorders. Future research should examine the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying each symptom and characterize their independent contribution to disability. This article is protected by copyright.

This response can lead to enhanced or diminished protective immunity and altered immunopathology. Here, we discuss the nature of T-cell cross-reactivity and describe matrices of epitopes from different viruses eliciting cross-reactive CD8(+) T-cell responses. We examine the parameters of heterologous immunity mediated by these cross-reactive T cells during viral infections in mice and humans. We show that heterologous immunity can disrupt T-cell memory pools, alter the complexity of the T-cell repertoire, change patterns of T-cell immunodominance, lead to the selection of viral epitope-escape variants, alter the pathogenesis of viral infections, and, by virtue of the private specificity of T-cell repertoires within individuals, contribute to dramatic variations in viral disease. We propose that heterologous immunity is an important factor in resistance to and variations of human viral infections and that issues of heterologous immunity should be considered in the design of vaccines.","Welsh, Raymond M; Che, Jenny W; Brehm, Michael A; Selin, Liisa K",Immunological reviews,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0105-2896.2010.00897.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20536568/,77

147481,Retrospective review of efficacy of radiofrequency ablation for treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases from a Canadian perspective.,2014,"PURPOSE Although neglected by science for a long time, the sense of olfaction has received increasing attention from research areas including psychology, neuroscience, clinical medicine and nutrition. With the rise of psychophysical and neuroimaging re- search into olfaction, psychometric tools (e.g. questionnaires and scales) are the basis for the quantitative exploration of inter-in- dividual variability regarding olfactory related responses. The current systematic review is to summarize existing olfaction related questionnaires and/or scales. METHODS Peer-reviewed literature on scales and questionnaires related to perception of odors were searched from online databa- ses (PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO). Twenty-one articles that meet the following criteria were included in the review: ""hu- man species"", ""no physical odor stimuli"" and ""describing the original development of the tool"", and ""with specific focus on olfaction or odor related responses or behaviors"". The psychometric properties, advantages and possible disadvantages were discussed. RESULTS Existing psychometric measures focus on various aspects of olfactory related responses and behaviors, including af- fective experiences of odor perception, awareness and attitude towards olfaction, olfactory function and the quality of life change due to olfactory dysfunction, and the ability to create vivid mental odor images. While most of them have been tested to have good reliability and validity, some were relatively time-consuming due to the number of questionnaire items. Besides, although many measures have been used in clinical populations, few have provided information on the predictive validity regarding effecti- veness of clinical intervention on changes of certain responses or behaviors. SUMMARY The current review provides an overview of olfactory related questionnaires and scales, highlighting the emotional and affective impact of olfaction and the impact on quality of life due to olfactory dysfunction. With growing interest in olfaction as an important sense, the development and use of psychometrically sound measurements in conjunction with objective assess- ments will advance our understanding of human olfaction and olfactory dysfunction. The review provides a guide for researchers and clinicians alike to select olfactory scales suitable for olfactory research with different experimental purposes and specific samples.","Han, P; Su, T; Qin, M; Chen, H; Hummel, T",Rhinology,https://doi.org/10.4193/rhin20.291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078172/,77

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficiency of clinical criteria adopted to identify suspected cases of COVID-19 by the ED in PCU. METHODS All patients admitted to PCU between April and June 2020 from ED were included. The clinical criteria adopted to identify suspected COVID-19 cases were: being in contact with a suspected or confirmed case less than 14 days ago and / or presenting fever with no defined focus and / or respiratory symptoms not explained by oncological disease and / or suggestive image in radiological examination (if necessary). All suspected cases were submitted to deep nasal and throat swab for SARS COV-2 investigation by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Test, adopted as gold standard. Inpatients hospitalized by ED, without suspicion, and then diagnosed with COVID-19 within 10 days of hospitalization were considered as false-negative cases. RESULTS During the period, 327 patients were admitted from ED. Of these, 69 (21%) were considered suspects, of whom 34 (49%) tested positive for COVID-19. The sensitivity of the clinical criterion to identify suspected cases was 87%, specificity was 88%, positive predictive value was 49%, negative was 98% and accuracy was 88%. CONCLUSION The clinical criteria adopted to identify suspected cases of COVID-19 at ED proved to be efficient, with low risk of spreading in-hospital infection, avoiding unnecessary isolation of patients.","Sampaio, Simone Garruth Dos Santos Machado; Dias, Andréa Marins; de Freitas, Renata; Borsatto, Alessandra Zanei; Esteves, Elisa Maffioletti Furtunato Leocádio; de Oliveira, Lívia Costa",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120957310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32875819/,77
147574,Accelerating Teleneuropsychology Within Diverse Populations.,2020-11-07,"AIM Introduction: Intra-procedural rupture (IPR) of cerebral aneurysms is a serious complication of endovascular treatment (EVT) that is associated with high rate of mortality and poor outcomes. Therefore, it is important to identify the risk factors for aneurysmal IPR to improve patient outcomes. We evaluated the possible risk factors for aneurysmal IPR and discussed its management and outcomes for patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Methods: A total of 106 patients with cerebral aneurysm who have undergone EVT were included in this study, with a mean follow-up period of 17.2 months. Risk factors for IPR, such as the aneurysm's location, size and morphology, etc. were evaluated, and the chi-squared test was used for statistical analysis. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 15 months. RESULTS Results: Among all 106 patients who have undergone EVT, five (4.7%) had aneurysmal IPR as well as ruptured aneurysms with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Among those five patients, primary coiling was performed in three cases and balloon/stent-assisted coiling was performed in two cases, with complete occlusion of the aneurysmal sac achieved in four (4/5) patients. Clinical follow-up with the mRS scores of the patients revealed mortality in one patient (20%), favourable outcomes in three patients (60%) and unfavourable outcomes in one patient (20%). CONCLUSION Conclusion: Aneurysmal IPR is considered a rare but important complication of endovascular coiling that is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Several risk factors are significantly associated with IPR, such as small-sized aneurysm ( 3.5 mm), presence of bleb and parent vessel tortuosity. Acom location, irregular shape and past episode of SAH also increase the risk of IPR, but such association was found to be statistically insignificant in our study. Although IPR is considered a devastating complication, good clinical outcomes can be achieved with early detection and proper management using rapid aneurysmal coil packing and occlusion.","Singh, Deepak Kumar; Pathak, Vipul; Yadav, Kuldeep",Turkish neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.5137/1019-5149.jtn.32533-20.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34374972/,77

The purpose of this study was to survey patients with COVID-19 admitted to a local hospital. MATERIAL AND METHOD The data were retrieved from a prospective observational study of all patients admitted with COVID-19 to Bærum Hospital since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. RESULTS A total of 73 patients with COVID-19 admitted in the period 9 March 2020-7 May 2020 were included. The mean age was 67.9 years, and 43 patients (59 %) were men. The average number of days hospitalised was 10.1. Altogether 19 patients (26 %) had a very severe course of disease, and 14 (19 %) died during their stay in hospital. The mean age among the patients who died was 79.5 years. A total of 49 patients (67 %) had hypoxaemia and required oxygen therapy for an average of 10.1 days. Of these, 9 patients were given invasive respiratory support for a median 18 days. Symptoms of delirium occurred in 26 patients (36 %) and was the most frequent non-respiratory complication.

The goal of these analyses was to examine the prevalence and impact of comorbid chronic pain and cigarette smoking among PLWH. Participants included 3289 PLWH (83% male) who were recruited from five HIV clinics. As expected, the prevalence of smoking was higher among PLWH with chronic pain (41.9%), than PLWH without chronic pain (26.6%, p < .0001), and the prevalence of chronic pain was higher among current smokers (32.9%), than among former (23.6%) or never (17%) smokers (ps < .0001). PLWH who endorsed comorbid chronic pain and smoking (vs. nonsmokers without chronic pain) were more likely to report cocaine/crack and cannabis use, be prescribed long-term opioid therapy, and have virologic failure, even after controlling for relevant sociodemographic and substance-related variables (ps < .05). These results contribute to a growing empirical literature indicating that chronic pain and cigarette smoking frequently co-occur, and extend this work to a large sample of PLWH. Indeed, PLWH may benefit from interventions that are tailored to address bidirectional pain-smoking effects in the context of HIV.","LaRowe, Lisa R; Cleveland, John D; Long, Dustin M; Nahvi, Shadi; Cachay, Edward R; Christopoulos, Katerina A; Crane, Heidi M; Cropsey, Karen; Napravnik, Sonia; O'Cleirigh, Conall; Merlin, Jessica S; Ditre, Joseph W",AIDS care,https://doi.org/10.1080/09540121.2021.1883511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594924/,77

Under current circumstances, medical organizations encountered difficulties in organizing quarantine, purchasing disinfecting drugs, personal protective equipment and additional medical equipment, the need to introduce an emergency mode of work for employees, so there was a need to review and develop new rules for the work of medical workers during a coronavirus pandemic. Medicine is one of the progressive fields of scientific and entrepreneurial activity, making high demands on medical workers. Therefore, continuous training of doctors and medical personnel is caused by vital necessity, especially in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. Currently, the legislative level provides for the re-profiling of doctors of other specialties and the involvement of teachers and general medical organizations in the fight against coronavirus infection. In the face of the threat of the spread of coronavirus infection, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation, it was decided to transfer educational institutions to distance learning using educational technologies, which also requires great efforts on the part of doctors, as medical specialists need not only a large amount of theoretical knowledge , but also a sufficient number of practical skills. The article presents statistical and analytical data, the results of surveys of Russian doctors, expert estimates that allow us to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of educational programs and courses for the professional retraining of doctors in the context of a coronavirus pandemic.","Shkrumyak, A R; Kaminina, N N; Aksenova, E I","Problemy sotsial'noi gigieny, zdravookhraneniia i istorii meditsiny",https://doi.org/10.32687/0869-866x-2020-28-s1-851-856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32856837/,77

To gain insight about PIF, the authors examined the medical literature and that of two other helping professions. METHODS The authors conducted a scoping review and qualitative metasynthesis of PIF in medicine, nursing and counselling/psychology. For the scoping review, four databases were searched using a combination of keywords to identify empiric studies on PIF in trainees. After a two-step screening process, thematic analysis was used to conduct the metasynthesis on screened articles. RESULTS A total of 7451 titles and abstracts were screened; 92 studies were included in the scoping review. Saturation was reached in the qualitative metasynthesis after reviewing 29 articles. CONCLUSION The metasynthesis revealed three inter-related PIF themes across the helping professions: the importance of clinical experience, the role of trainees' expectations of what a helping professional is or should be, and the impact of broader professional culture and systems on PIF. Upon reflection, most striking was that only 10 of the 92 articles examined trainee's sociocultural data, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age and socio-economic status, in a robust way and included them in their analysis and interpretation. This raises the question of whether conceptions of PIF suffer from sociocultural bias, thereby disadvantaging trainees from diverse populations and preserving the status quo of an historically white, male medical culture.","Volpe, Rebecca L; Hopkins, Margaret; Haidet, Paul; Wolpaw, Daniel R; Adams, Nancy E",Medical education,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.13781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30656747/,77
149195,Pyrogen testing revisited on occasion of the 25th anniversary of the whole blood monocyte activation test.,2021,"Memory CD4 T cells specific for influenza virus are generated from natural infection and vaccination, persist long-term, and recognize determinants in seasonal and pandemic influenza virus strains. However, the protective potential of these long-lived influenza virus-specific memory CD4 T cells is not clear, including whether CD4 T-cell helper or effector functions are important in secondary antiviral responses. Here we demonstrate that memory CD4 T cells specific for H1N1 influenza virus directed protective responses to influenza virus challenge through intrinsic effector mechanisms, resulting in enhanced viral clearance, recovery from sublethal infection, and full protection from lethal challenge. Mice with influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA)-specific memory CD4 T cells or polyclonal influenza virus-specific memory CD4 T cells exhibited protection from influenza virus challenge that occurred in the presence of CD8-depleting antibodies in B-cell-deficient mice and when CD4 T cells were transferred into lymphocyte-deficient RAG2(-/-) mice. Moreover, the presence of memory CD4 T cells mobilized enhanced T-cell recruitment and immune responses in the lung. Neutralization of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production in vivo abrogated memory CD4 T-cell-mediated protection from influenza virus challenge by HA-specific memory T cells and heterosubtypic protection by polyclonal memory CD4 T cells. Our results indicate that memory CD4 T cells can direct enhanced protection from influenza virus infection through mobilization of immune effectors in the lung, independent of their helper functions. These findings have important implications for the generation of universal influenza vaccines by promoting long-lived protective CD4 T-cell responses.","Teijaro, John R; Verhoeven, David; Page, Carly A; Turner, Damian; Farber, Donna L",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01069-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20592069/,77

DESIGN Integrative literature review. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of the electronic databases CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and SveMed+ was conducted to identify empirical studies published until November 2016. Multiple search terms were used. Original empirical studies published in English and exploring undergraduate nursing students' experiences of simulation with standardized patients as preparation for mental health nursing practice were included. A search of reference lists and gray literature was also conducted. In total, 1677 studies were retrieved; the full texts of 78 were screened by 2 of the authors, and 6 studies reminded in the review. REVIEW METHODS The authors independently reviewed the studies in three stages by screening the titles, abstracts, and full texts, and the quality of the included studies was assessed in the final stage. Design-specific checklists were used for quality appraisal. The thematic synthesizing method was used to summarize the findings of the included studies. RESULTS The studies used four different research designs, both qualitative and quantitative. All studies scored fairly low in the quality appraisal. The five themes identified were enhanced confidence, clinical skills, anxiety regarding the unknown, demystification, and self-awareness. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study indicate that simulation with standardized patients could decrease students' anxiety level, shatter pre-assumptions, and increase self-confidence and self-awareness before entering clinical practice in mental health.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether sotagliflozin increased the prespecified efficacy outcome of days alive and out of the hospital (DAOH) in the SOLOIST-WHF trial. DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03521934). SETTING 306 sites in 32 countries. PARTICIPANTS 1222 patients with type 2 diabetes and reduced or preserved ejection fraction who were recently hospitalized for worsening heart failure. INTERVENTION 200 mg of sotagliflozin once daily (with a possible dose increase to 400 mg) or matching placebo. MEASUREMENTS The primary analysis included hospitalizations for any reason on the basis of investigator-reported incidence and duration of admissions after randomization. Days alive and out of the hospital and its converse (days dead and days in the hospital) were analyzed using prespecified Poisson regression models. RESULTS Although similar proportions of patients in the sotagliflozin and placebo groups were hospitalized at least once (38.5% vs. 41.4%), fewer patients in the sotagliflozin group were hospitalized more than once (16.3% vs. 22.1%). There were 64 and 76 deaths in the sotagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. The DAOH rate in the sotagliflozin group was 3% higher than in the placebo group (rate ratio [RR], 1.03 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.06]; P = 0.027). This difference was primarily driven by a reduction in the rate of days dead (RR, 0.71 [CI, 0.52 to 0.99]; P = 0.041) rather than by a reduction in the rate of days hospitalized for any cause. For every 100 days of follow-up, patients in the sotagliflozin group were alive and out of the hospital for 3% or 2.9 more days than those in the placebo group (91.8 vs. 88.9 days); this difference reflected a 2.6-day difference in days dead (6.3 vs. 8.9 days) and a 0.3-day difference in days in the hospital (1.9 vs. 2.2 days). LIMITATION Other than heart failure, the primary reason for each hospitalization was unspecified. CONCLUSION Sotagliflozin increased DAOH, a metric that may provide an additional patient-centered outcome to capture the totality of disease burden. Future studies are needed to quantify the consequences of increasing DAOH in terms of health economics and patient quality of life.

150104,The Reply.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Overweight and obesity in children and adolescents are major public health challenges affecting quality of life and representing important risk factors in the development of non-communicable diseases. School environments provide great possibilities for the primary prevention of overweight and obesity and different school-based nutrition interventions are available. However, existing research on school-based nutrition interventions has important limitations and no network meta-analysis (NMA) has been performed yet to compare all available interventions. Therefore, the present research project aims to investigate the impact of different nutrition interventions in the school setting by comparing and ranking them using NMA methodology. METHODS/DESIGN A systematic literature search will be performed in 11 electronic databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ERIC, PsycINFO, CAB Abstracts, Campbell Library, BiblioMap EPPI, Australian Education Index, Joanna Briggs Institute Evidence-Based Practice Database and Practice-based Evidence in Nutrition Database). Parallel or cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs) meeting the following criteria will be included: (1) generally healthy school students aged 4-18 years, (2) school-based intervention with ≥ 1 nutrition component, and (3) assessed anthropometric (overweight/obesity risk, body weight change, weight Z-score, [standardized] body mass index, body fat, waist circumference) and/or diet-quality measures (daily intake of fruits and vegetables, fat, and sugar-sweetened beverages). Random effects pairwise and NMA will be performed for these outcomes and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) estimated (P-score). Where possible, component NMA (CNMA) will be used additionally. Subgroup analyses are carried out for intervention duration, gender, age of school students, socioeconomic status, and geographical location, and sensitivity analyses by excluding high risk of bias RCTs. DISCUSSION This systematic review and NMA will be the first to both directly and indirectly compare and rank different school-based nutrition interventions for the primary prevention of overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence. Our analyses will provide important insights about the effects of the different interventions and show which are the most promising. The results of our study can help inform the design of new studies and will be of value to anyone interested in developing successful, evidence-based nutrition interventions in school settings.

However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, circumstances have become anything but normal and predictable, thus putting employees' sense of occupational calling to the test. In this study, we investigate the possibility that occupational calling fluctuates across days during situations of crisis, and we identify antecedents and consequence of such fluctuations. To test our model, we conducted a daily diary study of 66 nurses working in intensive care units over 5 consecutive work days in a specialized Wuhan hospital that only admitted confirmed COVID-19 patients during the peak of the pandemic in China. We found that the daily number of code blue events (i.e., cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts with the primary goal of patient revival) was positively related to daily occupational calling for nurses. Moreover, individual differences in prosocial motivation predicted the average level and variability of occupational calling over the 5 days, which subsequently related to the nurses' job performance. Our study sheds light on how occupational calling enables people with the needed occupational knowledge and skills to function effectively in crisis situations.

The device is then inserted through the trocar, and the mesh is pushed out by the inner rod and applied. The folded mesh extrudes smoothly pubis side to lateral side along the inguinal curve. It reinforces the area without any contamination and expands in a manner that makes it easy for the surgeon to place and fix the mesh. Our device allows mesh to be applied smoothly, comfortably, and economically, and it may reduce the risk of infection.","Nakase, Yuen; Nakamura, Kei; Sougawa, Akira; Nagata, Tomoyuki; Mochizuki, Satoshi; Kitai, Shouzo; Inaba, Seishirou",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29869843/,77

Since December 2019, the world is facing a pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that results in a syndrome known as COVID-19. Several studies were conducted to implement antiviral drug therapy, until the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Numerous scientific investigations have considered some nutraceuticals as an additional treatment of COVID-19 patients to improve their clinical picture. In this review, we would like to emphasize the studies conducted to date about this issue and try to understand whether the use of nutraceuticals as a supplementary therapy to COVID-19 may be a valid and viable avenue. Based on the results obtained so far, quercetin, astaxanthin, luteolin, glycyrrhizin, lactoferrin, hesperidin and curcumin have shown encouraging data suggesting their use to prevent and counteract the symptoms of this pandemic infection.","Alesci, Alessio; Aragona, Marialuisa; Cicero, Nicola; Lauriano, Eugenia Rita",Natural product research,https://doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2021.1914032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33949266/,77

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has affected the normal diagnosis and treatment services in oral medical institutions across the country. Delay of non-emergency dental service will have a potential impact on the experience, cognition, treatment and rehabilitation of patients with oral diseases. Through literature review, this paper reviewed the oral psychosomatic diseases closely related to patients' psychological state, such as oral mucosal disease, temporomandibular joint disease, bruxism, periodontal disease and so on. It was believed that these patients might be more susceptible to the impact of stress events, and dental specialists should pay more attention to them. At the same time, this paper analyzes the possible psychological stress symptoms of patients with different oral diseases, and puts forward suggestions for remote consultation and emergency treatment of dentists. From the perspective of social role, dentists not only played the role of expert in dental home professional guidance, but also played the role of psychological counseling for patients.","Qu, X; Zhou, X D",Zhonghua kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Zhonghua kouqiang yixue zazhi = Chinese journal of stomatology,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112144-20200213-00053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32086886/,77
150731,Nil effects of μ-rhythm phase-dependent burst-rTMS on cortical excitability in humans: A resting-state EEG and TMS-EEG study.,2018,"BACKGROUND Stroke (S), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD) are chronic neurological diseases that are a challange for public health and represent a real social problem. Physical activity (PA) improves functional performance, reduces various symptoms in PD and MS, in stroke- reduced neurological impairment of patients and provides a chance for independence. One of the main obstacles in successful rehabilitation is patients' movement passivity. The reason might be the psychological aspects, in particular fear of movement-kinesiophobia. Aim: To determine how many patients with S, MS, and PD suffer from kinsiophobia and what factors influence this process. METHODS Fifty patients after stroke, eighty one MS patients and sixty one PD patients were consecutively recruited from hospital and outpatients clinics. The sociodemographic data, self- assesment of fitness, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) and The Modified Baecke Questionnarie for Older Adults for physical activity were collected. A score >37 was considered to indicate a high level of kinesiophobia according to the TSK. RESULTS High level of kinesiophobia was shown in 66.67% of the subjects. TSK medians in particular illnesses were above the cut-off score and amounted: S-42.50 points; MS-38 points; PD-42.00 points. Regression showed 15% of fluctuation of variance (R2 = 0.1498; p < 0.0001), where regression factor showed: for mobility self-assessment: b = -0.2137 and for the age b = 0.0065. CONCLUSIONS Kinesiophobia among the patients suffering from S, MS and PD concerns most of the subjects. Predictors of kinesiophobia are: limitations connected with functioning and age. The meaning of kinesiophobia in neurological disorders requires further research.","Wasiuk-Zowada, Dagmara; Knapik, Andrzej; Szefler-Derela, Justyna; Brzęk, Anna; Krzystanek, Ewa",Diagnostics,https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11050796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33924856/,77
150737,Canadian blood collectors do the right thing: a view from the outside.,2020-02-05,"Background: Large contiguous gene deletions at the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 9 result in the complex multi-organ condition chromosome 9p deletion syndrome. A range of clinical features can result from these deletions with the most common being facial dysmorphisms and neurological impairment. Congenital hyperinsulinism is a rarely reported feature of the syndrome with the genetic mechanism for the dysregulated insulin secretion being unknown. Methods: We studied the clinical and genetic characteristics of 12 individuals with chromosome 9p deletions who had a history of neonatal hypoglycaemia. Using off-target reads generated from targeted next-generation sequencing of the genes known to cause hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (n=9), or microarray analysis (n=3), we mapped the minimal shared deleted region on chromosome 9 in this cohort. Targeted sequencing was performed in three patients to search for a recessive mutation unmasked by the deletion. Results: In 10/12 patients with hypoglycaemia, hyperinsulinism was confirmed biochemically. A range of extra-pancreatic features were also reported in these patients consistent with the diagnosis of the Chromosome 9p deletion syndrome. The minimal deleted region was mapped to 7.2 Mb, encompassing 38 protein-coding genes. In silico analysis of these genes highlighted SMARCA2 and RFX3 as potential candidates for the hypoglycaemia. Targeted sequencing performed on three of the patients did not identify a second disease-causing variant within the minimal deleted region. Conclusions: This study identifies 9p deletions as an important cause of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and increases the number of cases reported with 9p deletions and hypoglycaemia to 15 making this a more common feature of the syndrome than previously appreciated. Whilst the precise genetic mechanism of the dysregulated insulin secretion could not be determined in these patients, mapping the deletion breakpoints highlighted potential candidate genes for hypoglycaemia within the deleted region.","Banerjee, Indraneel; Senniappan, Senthil; Laver, Thomas W; Caswell, Richard; Zenker, Martin; Mohnike, Klaus; Cheetham, Tim; Wakeling, Matthew N; Ismail, Dunia; Lennerz, Belinda; Splitt, Miranda; Berberoğlu, Merih; Empting, Susann; Wabitsch, Martin; Pötzsch, Simone; Shah, Pratik; Siklar, Zeynep; Verge, Charles F; Weedon, Michael N; Ellard, Sian; Hussain, Khalid; Flanagan, Sarah E",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15465.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832699/,77

METHODS All consecutive patients with lacrimal gland carcinoma treated from January 1998 through December 2018 were included. Log-rank tests and univariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to study risk factors and survival. RESULTS Overall, 55 patients were included in this study, and 5 patients were excluded from the survival analysis. Median age was 46 years (range: 10-76). 43 patients (78%) had adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). 31 patients (56%) had T2 disease at presentation. 28 patients (51%) underwent orbital exenteration with or without adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiation, 26 (47%) underwent eye-sparing surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiation, and 1 received palliative chemoradiation. 11 patients (22%) experienced local recurrence; 14 (29%) experienced distant metastasis. Five- and 10-year local-recurrence-free survival rates were 0.71 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.88), and 5- and 10-year distant-metastasis-free survival rates were 0.67 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.85) and 0.49 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.81), respectively. There was no significant difference in risks of local recurrence, distant metastasis or DSS between ACC patients who had orbital exenteration and those who had eye-sparing surgery. Perineural invasion was negatively associated with local-recurrence-free survival (p=0.02). Among patients with ACC, basaloid/solid histologic type was associated with significantly worse DSS than non-basaloid/solid histologic type (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS For lacrimal gland carcinoma, orbital exenteration with adjuvant therapy and eye-sparing surgery with adjuvant therapy are associated with similar recurrence outcomes. Eye-sparing surgery is associated with better DSS. Perineural invasion is a risk factor for local recurrence. ACC with basaloid/solid subtype correlates with worse DSS.","Ford, Joshua Richard; Rubin, Maria Laura; Frank, Steven Jay; Ning, Jing; Debnam, James Matthew; Bell, Diana; El-Naggar, Adel; Ferrarotto, Renata; Esmaeli, Bita",The British journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-316142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680839/,77

151732,Different dendritic domains of the GnRH neuron underlie the pulse and surge modes of GnRH secretion in female mice.,2020-07-09,"Infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) have significant mortality and long-term morbidity. Only 60-70% survive and usually those in high-volume centres. The current Task Force, therefore, has convened experts to evaluate the current literature and make recommendations on both the antenatal and post-natal management of CDH. The incidence of CDH varies from 1.7 to 5.7 per 10,000 live-born infants depending on the study population. Antenatal ultrasound scanning is routine and increasingly complemented by the use of magnetic resonance imaging. For isolated CDH, antenatal interventions should be considered, but the techniques need vigorous evaluation. After birth, management protocols are often used and have improved outcome in nonrandomised studies, but immediate intubation at birth and gentle ventilation are important. Pulmonary hypertension is common and its optimal management is crucial as its severity predicts the outcome. Usually, surgery is delayed to allow optimal medical stabilisation. The role of minimal invasive post-natal surgery remains to be further defined. There are differences in opinion about whether extracorporeal membrane oxygenation improves outcome. Survivors of CDH can have a high incidence of comorbidities; thus, multidisciplinary follow-up is recommended. Multicentre international trials are necessary to optimise the antenatal and post-natal management of CDH patients.","Kotecha, S; Barbato, A; Bush, A; Claus, F; Davenport, M; Delacourt, C; Deprest, J; Eber, E; Frenckner, B; Greenough, A; Nicholson, A G; Antón-Pacheco, J L; Midulla, F",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00066511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22034651/,77

We propose a first principles account of the script construct that integrates its different uses in the behavioral and social sciences. We begin by reviewing the recent literature that uses the script construct. We then examine the main mathematical and computational features of active inference. Finally, we leverage the resources of active inference to offer a formal model of scripts. Our integrative model accounts for the dual nature of scripts (as internal, psychological schema used by agents to make sense of event types and as constitutive behavioral categories that make up the social order) and also for the stronger and weaker conceptions of the construct (which do and do not relate to explicit action sequences, respectively).","Albarracin, Mahault; Constant, Axel; Friston, Karl J; Ramstead, Maxwell James D",Frontiers in psychology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.585493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34354621/,77

Additionally, there are no standardized methods to detect Acinetobacter spp. colonization. METHODS An outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) was identified at a Utah skilled nursing facility with a ventilator unit (vSNF). An investigation was conducted to identify transmission modes in order to control spread of CRAB. Culture-based methods were used to identify patient colonization and environmental contamination in the facility. RESULTS Of the 47 patients screened, OXA-23-producing CRAB were detected in 10 patients (21%), with 7 patients (15%) having been transferred from out-of-state facilities. Of patients who screened positive, 60% did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of active infection by chart review. A total of 38 environmental samples were collected and CRAB was recovered from 37% of those samples. Whole genome sequencing analyses of patient and environmental isolates suggested repeated CRAB introduction into the facility and highlighted the role of shared equipment in transmission. CONCLUSION The investigation demonstrated this vSNF was an important reservoir for CRAB in the community and highlights the need for improved surveillance, strengthened infection control and inter-facility communication within and across states.","Smith, Amanda R; Vowles, Maureen; Horth, Roberta Z; Smith, Lori; Rider, Linda; Wagner, Jennifer M; Sangster, Anna; Young, Erin L; Schuckel, Hailey; Stewart, James; Gruninger, Randon J; Rossi, Alessandro; Oakeson, Kelly F; Nakashima, Allyn K",American journal of infection control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.11.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217512/,77

METHODS All patients with carcinoid HD that underwent cardiac CT, either preoperatively or for assessment of coronary arteries, between Apr-2006 and Dec-2019 at the Royal Free Hospital, UK, were reviewed. RESULTS Of 32 patients with carcinoid HD, 29 (91%) had heart valve involvement. Abnormalities of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves were present in all patients, affecting all three leaflets in 23/26 (89%) unoperated patients for both valves. The aortic valve was affected in 4/29 (14%) patients and the mitral valve in 5/29 (17%). Left heart valves were affected in 6/29 (21%) patients. One patient (1/29; 3%) had all four valves affected. Severe changes with significant valvular regurgitation were seen in ≥75% of patients with tricuspid, pulmonary, and aortic valve abnormalities. Three patients had carcinoid myocardial metastases (3/32; 9%) and one patient had constrictive pericarditis (1/32; 3%). Ten patients had surgery of whom four (40%) had invasive coronary angiography preoperatively. Ten patients had a patent foramen ovale. Cardiac CT allowed an accurate assessment of damage to different leaflets/cusps, particularly of the pulmonary valve, where visualization with echocardiography was often (3/8; 38%) incomplete. CONCLUSION Cardiac CT is a powerful tool for assessment of cardiac valve abnormalities, coronary arteries and the spatial relationship of coronary arteries with myocardial metastasis in patients with carcinoid HD, and should form part of multimodal imaging of this complex pathology.","Davar, Joseph; Lazoura, Olga; Caplin, Martyn E; Toumpanakis, Christos",Journal of cardiovascular computed tomography,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcct.2020.08.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004299/,77

DESIGN Life cycle assessment was used to determine environmental impacts of PPE distributed to health and social care in England during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The base scenario assumed all products were single-use and disposed of via clinical waste. Scenario modelling was used to determine the effect of environmental mitigation strategies: (1) eliminating international travel during supply; (2) eliminating glove use; (3) reusing gowns and face shields; and (4) maximal recycling. SETTING Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, UK. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The carbon footprint of PPE distributed during the study period totalled 106,478 tonnes CO2e, with greatest contributions from gloves, aprons, face shields and Type IIR surgical masks. The estimated damage to human health was 239 DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), impact on ecosystems was 0.47 species.year (loss of local species per year), and impact on resource depletion was costed at US $12.7m (GBP £9.3m). Scenario modelling indicated UK manufacture would have reduced the carbon footprint by 12%, eliminating gloves by 45%, reusing gowns and gloves by 10% and maximal recycling by 35%. RESULTS A combination of strategies may have reduced the carbon footprint by 75% compared with the base scenario, and saved an estimated 183 DALYS, 0.34 species.year and US $7.4m (GBP £5.4m) due to resource depletion. CONCLUSION The environmental impact of PPE is large and could be reduced through domestic manufacture, rationalising glove use, using reusables where possible and optimising waste management.","Rizan, Chantelle; Reed, Malcolm; Bhutta, Mahmood F",Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/01410768211001583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33726611/,77

Notably, due to both its high infective and pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause a severe sometimes fatal respiratory disease. A specific vaccine, which relies on the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 structural protein-derived antigenic peptides, is indispensable for restraining the spread and reducing the mortality of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infections activate cytototxic, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, as well as natural killer, B, helper T, and regulatory T cells, thus further stimulating innate and antigen-specific immune responses. Nevertheless, many immune effector cells cause hyperinflammation and pulmonary immunopathology by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1A, MIP1B, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, IL-17, and IL-18, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, and induced protein 10. Interestingly, related products derived from SARS-CoV-2 are likely to trigger immune evasion. Therefore, investigating SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccines, blocking immunopathology, and prohibiting immune evasion are urgently required for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we emphatically illuminated the development of a SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccine based on the analysis of epitopes, also expounding the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine release syndrome. Furthermore, we comprehensively discussed SARS-CoV-2-associated immune evasion and lung immunopathology. Lastly, potential therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 were explored.","Tan, Yuan; Tang, Faqin",Medicinal research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/med.21756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33185926/,77

OBJECTIVES We aimed to study the patterns of natural disaster-related traumatic injuries and fatalities across the United States from 2014 to 2019 and to provide recommendations that can serve to mitigate the impact these natural disasters have on trauma patient morbidity and mortality. METHODS A retrospective analysis of the National Safety Council (2014-2019) of natural disaster-related injuries and fatalities was conducted. Descriptive statistics and independent-samples t tests were performed, with significance defined as p < .05. RESULTS Floods produced significantly more mean fatalities per year than tornadoes (118 vs. 33; 95% CI [32.0, 139.0]), wildfires (118 vs. 43, 95% CI [24.8, 155.6]), hurricanes (118 vs. 13, 95% CI [51.5, 159.2]), and tropical storms (118 vs. 15, 95% CI [48.8, 158.2]). Tornadoes produced significantly more mean injuries per year than floods (528 vs. 43, 95% CI [255.9, 715.8]), wildfires (528 vs. 69, 95% CI [227.1, 691.2]), hurricanes (528 vs. 26, 95% CI [270.1, 734.2]), and tropical storms (528 vs. 4, 95% CI [295.9, 753.5]). Southern states experienced greater disaster-related morbidity and mortality over the 6-year study period than other regions with 2,752 injuries and 771 fatalities. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of traumatic injuries and fatalities related to certain natural disasters in the United States has significantly increased from 2014 to 2019.

155764,Cerebral microbleeds: where are we now?,2014,"BACKGROUND The intravenous anesthetic propofol is a gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor agonist. Propofol promotes analgesia by depressing nociceptive transmission in peripheral neurons, antagonizing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and activating gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors in dorsal root ganglion receptor cells. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether intraoperative propofol causes clinically meaningful postoperative analgesia. We therefore tested the hypothesis that patients anesthetized with sevoflurane require a greater quantity of postoperative opioids (from the end of surgery until the next postoperative morning) than those anesthetized with propofol. METHODS With Institutional Review Board and EudraCT Number approval (2009-011038-82) and patients' informed consent, ninety patients scheduled for open vein stripping were randomized to either sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia at the Medical University of Vienna General Hospital and the Danube Hospital, the largest regional hospital in Vienna. Pain was treated with bolus piritramide and patient-controlled morphine hydrochloride. The primary outcome was total opioid use from the end of surgery until the first postoperative morning. For the initial four postoperative hours and on the first postoperative morning, a blinded investigator recorded pain scores on an 11-point Likert verbal response scale. RESULTS The median [interquartile range] morphine sulfate equivalents were 9.8 [4-19] mg in the sevoflurane group and 10 [6-20] mg in the propofol group. Sevoflurane was not superior to propofol on postoperative opioid consumption, giving a ratio of means of 0.91 (95% interim-adjusted confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 2.45; P = 0.74). Additionally, no difference in pain scores was found over time between the two groups, with a mean difference on an 11-point scale of 0.20 (95% interim-adjusted CI, -0.36 to 0.73; P = 0.31). CONCLUSION Intraoperative sevoflurane did not reduce postoperative analgesia. This finding is consistent with the results in most previous reports. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00712517.","Windpassinger, Marita; Plattner, Olga; Gemeiner, Jana; Böhler, Kornelia; Luntzer, Robert; Klimscha, Walter; Yang, Dongsheng; Mascha, Edward J; Sessler, Daniel I",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-016-0728-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27638296/,77

However, current evidence regarding the effect of IPC and NO in extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation remains lacking. Fifteen female swine (body weight 45 kg) underwent veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) implantation; cardiac arrest-ventricular fibrillation was induced by rapid ventricular pacing. After 20 min of cardiac arrest, blood flow was restored by increasing the ECMO flow rate to 4.5 L/min. The animals (five per group) were then randomly assigned to receive IPC (three cycles of 3 min ischemia and reperfusion), NO (80 ppm via oxygenator), or mild hypothermia (HT; 33.0°C). Cerebral oximetry and aortic blood pressure were monitored continuously. After 90 min of reperfusion, blood samples were drawn for the measurement of troponin I, myoglobin, creatine-phosphokinase, alanine aminotransferase, neuron-specific enolase, cystatin C, and reactive oxygen metabolite (ROM) levels. Significantly higher blood pressure and cerebral oxygen saturation values were observed in the HT group compared with the IPC and NO groups (P < 0.05). The levels of troponin I, myoglobin, creatine phosphokinase, and alanine aminotransferase were significantly lower in the HT group (P < 0.05); levels of neuron-specific enolase, cystatin C, and ROM were not significantly different. IPC and NO were comparable in all monitored parameters. The results of the present study indicate that IPC and NO administration are not superior interventions to HT for the maintenance of blood pressure, cerebral oxygenation, organ protection, and suppression of oxidative stress following extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","Psotova, Hana; Ostadal, Petr; Mlcek, Mikulas; Kruger, Andreas; Janotka, Marek; Vondrakova, Dagmar; Svoboda, Tomas; Hrachovina, Matej; Taborsky, Ludek; Dudkova, Vlasta; Strunina, Svitlana; Kittnar, Otomar; Neuzil, Petr",Artificial organs,https://doi.org/10.1111/aor.12556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26412075/,77

156794,Measuring R0.,2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) respiratory viral panel (RVP) testing is often used in evaluation of pediatric cancer patients with febrile neutropenia (FN), but correlation with adverse outcomes has not been well characterized. PROCEDURE A retrospective cohort of all children ages 0-21 years with cancer admitted to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta for FN from January 2013 to June 2016 was identified. Patient demographic and clinical variables such as age, RVP results, length of stay (LOS), and deaths were abstracted. Relationship between RVP testing and positivity and LOS, highest temperature (Tmax), hypotension and intensive care unit (ICU) admission were compared using Wilcoxon rank sums, chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests adjusting for age, sex, bacteremia, and diagnosis. RESULTS The 404 patients identified had 787 total FN admissions. RVPs were sent in 38% of admissions and were positive in 59%. Patients with RVPs sent were younger (median 5.5 vs 8.0 years, P < .0001) with higher Tmax (39.2° vs 39.1°, P = .016). The most common virus identified was rhinovirus/Enterovirus (61%). There were no significant differences in highest temperature or lowest blood pressure based on RVP positivity. Patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to have RVPs sent (odds ratio [OR] = 3.19, P < .002); however, neither having RVP testing nor RVP positivity were significantly associated with increased LOS or death. Coinfection with bacteremia and a respiratory virus was identified in 9.1% of patients. CONCLUSIONS These data raise the question of the utility of sending potentially costly RVP testing as RVP positivity during febrile neutropenia does not impact LOS, degree of hypotension, or ICU admission.","Shinn, Kaitlin; Wetzel, Martha; DeGroote, Nicholas P; Keller, Frank; Briones, Michael; Felker, James; Castellino, Sharon; Miller, Tamara P",Pediatric blood & cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.28570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32881268/,77

156993,First vaccines targeting 'cruise ship virus' sail into clinical trials.,2013,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic surgery has long been the treatment of choice for recurrent or bilateral hernias, and for unilateral hernias when the patient does not want to undergo open surgery. Each laparoscopic incision or trocar presents risks for hemorrhage, organ injury, incisional hernia, and poor cosmetic outcome. For this reason, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is being increasingly used to treat a variety of conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of SILS for total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair of hernias in the largest series performed to date. PATIENTS AND METHODS During the period from June to September 2009, 23 consecutive patients underwent SILS for TEP repair of inguinal hernias. SILS was performed under general anesthesia, with the use of a single access port device and articulating as well as standard laparoscopic instruments. Demographic and clinical data, intraoperative findings, and postoperative course were recorded. RESULTS In the 23 patients (mean age 48.4 y; 18 males and 5 females), a total of 27 hernias were repaired. Unilateral hernias were present in 19 patients and bilateral hernias in four. Of the unilateral hernias, 11 were on the right and 8 on the left. Indirect hernias occurred in 15 patients, direct hernias in 7 patients, and a direct+indirect hernia was seen in 1 patient. All hernias were repaired successfully with SILS except in 1 patient. In this patient, due to the large size of the hernia and the presence of adhesions, the procedure was converted to a standard laparoscopic TEP repair. Mean operative times for unilateral and bilateral hernias were 48.4 minutes (range: 32-62 min) and 96.7 minutes (range: 85-120 min), respectively. None of the patients experienced intraoperative or postoperative complications. Mean hospital stay was 1.17 days. CONCLUSIONS The use of SILS for TEP repair of hernias provides excellent cosmetic results, and articulating instruments seem to be useful for this procedure.","Surgit, Onder","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e3181d848c3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20393339/,77
157012,Decreasing Resource Utilization Using Standardized Clinical Assessment and Management Plans (SCAMPs).,2019,"Predisposition to food allergies may reflect a type 2 immune response (IR) bias in neonates due to the intrauterine environment required to maintain pregnancy. The hygiene hypothesis states that lack of early environmental stimulus leading to inappropriate development and bias in IR may also contribute. Here, the ability of heat-killed Escherichia coli, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or muramyl dipeptide (MDP) to alter IR bias and subsequent allergic response in neonatal pigs was investigated. Three groups of three litters of pigs (12 pigs/litter) were given intramuscular injections of E. coli, LPS, MDP, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (control) and subsequently sensitized to the egg white allergen ovomucoid using an established protocol. To evaluate change in IR bias, immunoglobulin isotype-associated antibody activity (AbA), concentrations of type 1 and 2 and proinflammatory cytokines released from mitogen-stimulated blood mononuclear cells, and the percentage of T-regulatory cells (T-regs) in blood were measured. Clinical signs of allergy were assessed after oral challenge with egg white. The greatest effect on IR bias was observed in MDP-treated pigs, which had a type 2-biased phenotype by isotype-specific AbA, cytokine production, and a low proportion of T-regs. LPS-treated pigs had decreased type 1- and type 2-associated AbA. E. coli-treated pigs displayed increased response to Ovm as AbA and had more balanced cytokine profiles, as well as the highest proportion of T-regs. Accordingly, pigs treated with MDP were more susceptible to allergy than PBS controls, while pigs treated with LPS were less susceptible. Treatment with E. coli did not significantly alter the frequency of clinical signs.","Schmied, Julie; Rupa, Prithy; Garvie, Sarah; Wilkie, Bruce",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://doi.org/10.1128/cvi.00555-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23081818/,77

However, EMA and EMI have yet to be fully embraced in the field of stroke rehabilitation. Our objective is to provide a theoretically based perspective for the combined and synergistic use of EMA and EMI to promote person-centered, recovery-based durable changes in functional movement behaviors of stroke survivors. Research abounds for non-stroke populations with emerging evidence for the benefits of using real-time data capture techniques (i.e. EMA) coupled with EMI to better customize the content and timing of interventions to the inherent fluctuations in state and context that encompass the target behavior. We review existing EMA and EMI literature broadly in behavioral medicine and psychological science to identify how real-time repeated sampling technology has been used in the context of stroke rehabilitation and to delineate the pros and cons of this approach in general with non-stroke populations. We propose a coupled EMA and EMI strategy be used in conjunction with existing stroke recovery and rehabilitation practices. There is tremendous potential to effectively personalize recovery-promoting interventions to achieve durable behavior change, and importantly, shift the focus of rehabilitation practice from the health-care provider and clinical environment to the individual and their lived experience in the home and community.","Demers, Marika; Winstein, Carolee J",Topics in stroke rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1080/10749357.2020.1856557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33272137/,77

This analysis focuses on preprocedural imaging, patient handling and referral, as well as on different treatment modalities in mechanical recanalization. METHODS Data for this study were from observational registry study in 12 stroke centers in Germany and Austria with online assessment of prespecified variables concerning endovascular stroke therapy. RESULTS Data from 734 patients undergoing EVT were analyzed. Preferred imaging modality prior to EVT was CT (83 %) and CTA (78 %). In 95 %, EVT was performed under general anesthesia. In 55 % of patients, a combination of intravenous (IV) thrombolysis and EVT was used, followed by pure EVT (25 %), intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis plus EVT (13 %) and IV + IA thrombolysis plus EVT (7 %). Intrahospital time delay until start of EVT was 91 and 99 min in anterior and vertebrobasilar circulation stroke, respectively. Average duration of EVT was 60 min. Overall thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 2/3 recanalization rate was 85 %. Stent retrievers were used in 75 %, being associated with higher recanalization rates than non-stent retrievers. Hemorrhagic complications (symptomatic and asymptomatic) occurred in 12 %. Overall vessel occlusion time was approximately 60 min longer in patients being referred from a primary care hospital for EVT. CONCLUSION This study gives an overview of procedure-related factors in current EVT practice. It gives estimates on preprocedural imaging modalities, periprocedural handling, and treatment combinations used for EVT. Patient referral for EVT from primary care hospitals is associated with longer vessel occlusion times.","Singer, Oliver C; Haring, Hans-Peter; Trenkler, Johannes; Nolte, Christian H; Bohner, Georg; Neumann-Haefelin, Tobias; Hofmann, Erich; Reich, Arno; Wiesmann, Martin; Niederkorn, Kurt; Deutschmann, Hannes; Bussmeyer, Matthias; Mpotsaris, Anastasios; Stoll, Anett; Bormann, Albrecht; Petzold, Gabor C; Urbach, Horst; Jander, Sebastian; Turowski, Bernd; Weimar, Christian; Schlamann, Marc; Gröschel, Klaus; Boor, Stephan; Berkefeld, Joachim",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-013-1219-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23811957/,77

160883,Use of ROC analysis and machine learning with an independent dose calculation system reduces number of physical dose measurements required for patient-specific quality assurance.,2020-11-13,"The World Health Organization (WHO) living guideline on drugs to prevent COVID-19 has recently advised that ongoing trials evaluating hydroxychloroquine in chemoprophylaxis should stop. The WHO guideline cites ""high certainty"" evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis does not reduce mortality and does not reduce hospital admission, and ""moderate certainty"" evidence of poor tolerability because of a significantly increased rate of adverse events leading to drug discontinuation. Yet there is no such evidence. In the three pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis RCTs evaluated in the guideline there were no deaths and only two COVID-19-related hospital admissions, and there was a mistake in the analysis of the number of discontinuations (after correction there is no longer a statistically significant difference between those taking the drug and the controls). Guidelines on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 should be based on sufficient verified evidence, understanding of the disease process, sound statistical analysis and interpretation, and an appreciation of global needs. The WHO living guideline on the prevention of COVID-19 should retract the advice to stop research on hydroxychloroquine chemoprophylaxis, should correct its errors, and should revise its guidance.","Schilling, William Hk; Callery, James J; Chandna, Arjun; Hamers, Raph L; Watson, James A; White, Nicholas J",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16741.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34395925/,77
160950,It's all a matter of time.,2020,INTRODUCTION We investigated the impact of unidirectional barbed suture (UBS) for vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA) during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. METHODS The polyglyconate UBS V-Loc 180 was used for VUA during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in 30 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with organ-confined prostate cancer between January and October 2012. The operative and postoperative parameters were then compared with those of 30 consecutive patients who had previously undergone the same procedure but with the monofilament poliglecaprone suture Monocryl. All procedures were performed by the same experienced surgeon. RESULTS VUA time was significantly shorter in the V-Loc group (13.2 ± 2.3 min) than in the Monocryl group (19.1 ± 3.3 min) (P < 0.001). The V-Loc group required significantly more stitches than the Monocryl group (11.4 ± 1.3 vs 10.6 ± 1.6 stitches; P = 0.031). The percentage of patients who required no more than one pad per day at 3 months postoperatively was significantly higher in the V-Loc group (63.3%) than in the Monocryl group (23.3%) (P = 0.020). No significant differences in other perioperative parameters were observed between the two groups. CONCLUSION Using UBS prevents suture slippage and enables tieless anastomosis. VUA using a UBS may relieve surgeon stress because a rapid and secure anastomosis is achievable.,"Takeda, Toshikazu; Miyajima, Akira; Kaneko, Gou; Hasegawa, Masanori; Kikuchi, Eiji; Oya, Mototsugu",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861205/,77

The knowledge about the role of socioeconomic factors to explain these differences is limited. We investigate the relationship between socioeconomic indicators at group level and epidemiological data for all notified cases of COVID-19 and related hospitalisations among the 23 largest immigrant groups in Norway. METHODS We used data on all notified COVID-19 cases in Norway up to 15 November 2020, and associated hospitalisations, from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases and the emergency preparedness register at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. We report notified COVID-19 cases and associated hospitalisation rates per 100,000 and their correlation to income, education, unemployment, crowded housing and years of residency at the group level. RESULTS Crowded housing and low income at a group level were correlated with rates of both notified cases of COVID-19 (Pearson`s correlation coefficient 0.77 and 0.52) and related hospitalisations (0.72, 0.50). In addition, low educational level and unemployment were correlated with a high number of notified cases. CONCLUSIONS Immigrant groups living in disadvantaged socioeconomic positions are important to target with preventive measures for COVID-19. This must include targeted interventions for low-income families living in overcrowded households.","Kjøllesdal, Marte; Skyrud, Katrine; Gele, Abdi; Arnesen, Trude; Kløvstad, Hilde; Diaz, Esperanza; Indseth, Thor",Scandinavian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211015860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983088/,77

METHODS Between March 2000 and December 2015, patients who underwent unilateral breast reconstructions using abdomen-based flaps were retrospectively evaluated. Outcomes variables evaluated included the flap-used weight, flap-used/flap-harvested percentage, flap-used/specimen percentage, complication rates, revision procedures, and quality of life using the Breast-Q questionnaires. RESULTS A total of 415 patients with a mean age of 45.3 ± 8.2 years underwent 418 abdomen-based flaps. The overall success rate was 98.8%, with 99.1% and 97.9% of patients included in the normal BMI and overweight groups, respectively (p = 0.36). The mean flap-used weight and flap-used/flap-harvested values of 461 ± 132.1 g and 82.2 ± 11.6%, respectively, in the normal BMI group were statistically different from values of 610 ± 148.9 g and 71.4 ± 14.1% in the overweight group (both p < 0.01). The mean flap-used/specimen percentage was 118.5 ± 32.9 and 111.7 ± 36.6 in the normal BMI and overweight groups, respectively (p = 0.26).

Nations are assessing ways to reopen businesses while trying to balance health care risks and economic fallouts. Strategies involving antibody testing have been proposed before phased reopening of the economy. Therefore, assessing the sensitivity and specificity of antibody tests for symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients remains paramount to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks. The antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 detect the presence of IgA, IgM, or IgG antibodies produced by B cells. There are four major types of antibody tests: rapid diagnostic tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, neutralization assays, and chemiluminescent immunoassays. Currently, there is no standard antibody test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during or after exposure or infection. The antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 have a low specificity within the first week of exposure and increase in the second and third weeks. The current data on antibody tests have several limitations in quality and the presence of bias. Specifically, many antibody tests have a high false-negative rate and a high risk of bias for participant selection, application of index tests, reference standard used, and flow and timing for antibody tests that may incorrectly report the accuracy of COVID-19 antibody tests. In this review, we summarize the current methods, sensitivity/specificity, and gaps in knowledge concerning COVID-19 antibody testing.","Kopel, Jonathan; Goyal, Hemant; Perisetti, Abhilash",Proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1080/08998280.2020.1829261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33456148/,77

The concern with ""healthy"" eating was accentuated in this context and food norms were developed as an orientation strategy related to eating habits. The scope of this article is to carry out a critical and comparative analysis of four food guidelines published in Brazil and Spain in this period, based on three principles: concepts regarding healthy eating; the place attributed to the multidimensionality of the act of eating; and the relevance of intersectionality. Comparison of the documents was conducted using a qualitative approach based on discourse analysis. The documents feature differences in terms of the format and content of the recommendations, but the discursive construction of all the guidelines is normative and reproduces a fundamentally biomedical perspective centered on nutrients and on individual responsibility, without taking into consideration the multidimensionality of the act of eating and the specificities of the micro- and macrosocial contexts. The analysis also reveals the need to include the intersectional dimensions of gender, race, ethnicity and class into the proposed recommendations.","Verthein, Ursula Peres; Gaspar, Maria Clara de Moraes Prata",Ciencia & saude coletiva,https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232021264.39522020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886771/,77
161770,Effect of coronaphobia on smoking habits.,2020-12-07,"BACKGROUND Elective aortic root replacement (ARR), or the Bentall procedure, is associated with significant mortality and complications. Recent studies have shown that high procedure volume has an inverse association with postoperative mortality. The outcomes of patients undergoing elective/urgent ARR by a single, high-volume surgical team were assessed in this study. METHODS Patients undergoing nonemergency, elective/urgent ARR for non-Marfan aortic root dilatation, from October 2005 to March 2011, were studied. Valve-preserving procedures, extra-anatomic bypass, and arch and descending aortic repairs were excluded. Patient demographics, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were collected prospectively. Surgical techniques included central cannulation and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at 35°C. Following aneurysm excision, a composite valve-conduit reconstruction with coronary button reimplantation was performed. Tissue glue, Teflon pledgets, and blood products were seldom used. Patients were followed locally at 8 weeks, 6 months, and annually thereafter with echocardiography and computed tomographic (CT) scanning. RESULTS From October 2005 to March 2011, 163 ARRs were performed. Of these, 131 (80%) were isolated first time procedures (four in pregnant women), six were redo (4%), and in 26 (16%) ARR was combined with concomitant valve or coronary artery revascularization procedures. Median age was 63 years (range 19-84). Median cross-clamp and CPB times were 73 (range 69-87) and 86 minutes (range 85-126), respectively. There was one in-hospital death (mortality = 0.6%), one patient underwent resternotomy for bleeding, two required hemofiltration, and there were no strokes. Median hospital stay was 6 days (range 5-11). Median follow-up was 2.9 years (range 6 months-4.3 years) with 100% freedom from reoperation. There was no late distal ascending aorta/arch dilatation. There were two late deaths (1.2%) due to pneumonia and stroke. CONCLUSIONS High-volume surgery, with minimal use of hemostatic adjuncts and sustained follow-up, leads to excellent outcomes, with low morbidity and mortality following ARR.","Soppa, Gopal; Abdulkareem, Nada; Smelt, Jeremy; Van Besouw, Jean-Pierre; Jahangiri, Marjan",Aorta,https://doi.org/10.12945/j.aorta.2013.13.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26798670/,77

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the incidence of HBoV infection in children with RTD; to analyze the clinical features of HBoV infection; and to clinically compare HBoV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infections. STUDY DESIGN A prospective 1-year study was conducted in children <5 years of age hospitalized with RTD and in asymptomatic control children. RESULTS Human bocavirus was detected in 55 (10.8%) of the 507 children tested and in none of the 68 asymptomatic control children (P = 0.01). About 80% of these infections occurred between November and March. Coinfection with another virus was observed in 22 (40%) of the HBoV-positive children. HBoV viral load was significantly higher in samples from children with HBoV monoinfection than in those with coinfection. Subsequent detection of HBoV more than 2 months after the initial detection could be documented in 3 children. Clinical features associated with HBoV infection were similar to those observed with either RSV or HMPV infections, but HBoV infections were less severe than RSV infections. CONCLUSIONS The difference observed in HBoV prevalence between children with RTD and controls provides support for a role of this virus in RTD. The frequent associations of HBoV with other respiratory viruses might be explained by the persistence of HBoV in the respiratory tract. The significance of HBoV viral load in nasopharyngeal secretions as a marker of pathogenicity merits further investigation.","Brieu, Nathalie; Guyon, Gaël; Rodière, Michel; Segondy, Michel; Foulongne, Vincent",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31817acfaa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18833027/,77

In this report, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells can be expanded from convalescent donors, and recognize immunodominant viral epitopes in conserved regions of membrane, spike, and nucleocapsid. Following in vitro expansion using a GMP-compliant methodology (designed to allow the rapid translation of this novel SARS-CoV-2 T-cell therapy to the clinic), membrane, spike, and nucleocapsid peptides elicited IFN-γ production, in 27 (59%), 12 (26%), and 10 (22%) convalescent donors (respectively), as well as in 2 of 15 unexposed controls. We identified multiple polyfunctional CD4-restricted T-cell epitopes within a highly conserved region of membrane protein, which induced polyfunctional T cell responses, which may be critical for the development of effective vaccine and T cell therapies. Hence, our study shows that SARS-CoV-2 directed T-cell immunotherapy targeting structural proteins, most importantly membrane protein, should be feasible for the prevention or early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised patients with blood disorders or after bone marrow transplantation to achieve anti-viral control while mitigating uncontrolled inflammation.","Keller, Michael D; Harris, Katherine M; Jensen-Wachspress, Mariah A; Kankate, Vaishnavi; Lang, Haili; Lazarski, Christopher Andrew; Durkee-Shock, Jessica Rose; Lee, Ping-Hsien; Chaudhry, Kajal; Webber, Kathleen; Datar, Anushree; Terpilowski, Madeline; Reynolds, Emily K; Stevenson, Eva; Val, Stephanie; Shancer, Zoe; Zhang, Nan; Ulrey, Robert; Ekanem, Uduak-Obong; Stanojevic, Maja; Geiger, Ashley Elizabeth; Liang, Hua; Hoq, Fahmida; Abraham, Allistair A; Hanley, Patrick J; Cruz, Conrad Russell Y; Ferrer, Kathleen; Dropulic, Lesia; Gangler, Krista; Burbelo, Peter D; Jones, R Brad; Cohen, Jeffrey I; Bollard, Catherine M",Blood,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2020008488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33104167/,77

The surveillance strategy was mainly based on Sanger sequencing of a Spike coding region that allows the simultaneous identification of signature mutations associated with worldwide circulating variants. In addition, whole SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained from 456 samples. The main variants found were Gamma, Lambda and Alpha, and to a lesser extent, Zeta and Epsilon. Whereas Gamma dominated in different regions of the country, both Gamma and Lambda prevailed in the most populated area, the metropolitan region of Buenos Aires (MABA), although showing a heterogeneous distribution along this region. This cost-effective surveillance protocol allowed for a rapid response in a limited access to resources scenario, added information on the expansion of the Lambda variant in South America and contributed to the implementation of public health measures to control the disease spread in Argentina.","Torres, C.; Mojsiejczuk, L.; Acuna, D.; Alexay, S.; Amadio, A.; Aulicino, P.; Debat, H.; Fernandez, F.; Goya, S.; Konig, G.; Nabaes Jodar, M.; Pianciola, L.; Bengoa, S.; Cacciahue, M.; Camussone, C.; Dus Santos, M.

The data was collected by an online questionnaire distributed through social media. The trait-anxiety was assessed using the “General Anxiety questionnaire of Spielberger” (STAI-Y-B) and the “Ways of coping checklist revised (WCC-R) questionnaire” identified three types of coping (problem-focused, emotion-focused and social-support seeking).ResultsParticipants were 135 HCP (71 males and 64 females) and aged from 24 to 61 years old (average age 31.98 years;SD 6.59 years). Of HCP involved in the study, 61.5% were single, 36.3% were married and 2.2% were divorced. Seventy-two of them had a trait-anxious. As a coping style, 85.2% of participants used problem-focused style, 88.9% of them used emotion-focused style and 63% of them used social support seeking style. The analysis of WCC-R showed that anxious HCP used emotion-focused coping more than non anxious HCP (p= 0.028). However, there was no significant difference in problem-focused or social support seeking coping styles and presence of trait-anxiety.ConclusionsIn our study, we find that the most anxious Tunisian HCP focused on emotions strategies.

166925,Erratum,2021,"A network of myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal in the corpus of the stomach serves as its “pacemaker”, continuously generating a ca. 0.05 Hz electrical slow wave, which is transmitted to the brain chiefly by vagal afferents. A recent study combining resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) with concurrent surface electrogastrography (EGG), with cutaneous electrodes placed on the epigastrium, found 12 brain regions with activity that was significantly phase-locked with this gastric basal electrical rhythm. Therefore, we asked whether fluctuations in brain resting state networks (RSNs), estimated using a spatial independent component analysis (ICA) approach, might be synchronized with the stomach. In the present study, in order to determine whether any RSNs are phase-locked with the gastric rhythm, an individual participant underwent 22 scanning sessions; in each, two 15-minute runs of concurrent EGG and rsfMRI data were acquired. EGG data from three sessions had weak gastric signals and were excluded; the other 19 sessions yielded a total of 9.5 hours of data. The rsfMRI data were analyzed using group ICA; RSN time courses were estimated using dual regression; for each run, the phase-locking value (PLV) was computed between each RSN and the gastric signal. To assess statistical significance, PLVs from all pairs of “mismatched” data (EGG and rsfMRI data acquired on different days) were used as surrogate data to generate a null distribution for each RSN. Of a total of 18 RSNs, three were found to be significantly phase-locked with the basal gastric rhythm, namely, a cerebellar network, a dorsal somatosensory-motor network, and a default mode network. Disruptions to the gut-brain axis, which sustains interoceptive feedback between the central nervous system and the viscera, are thought to be involved in various disorders; manifestation of the infra-slow rhythm of the stomach in brain rsfMRI data could be useful for studies in clinical populations.","Choe, Ann S.; Tang, Bohao; Smith, Kimberly R.; Honari, Hamed; Lindquist, Martin A.; Caffo, Brian S.; Pekar, James J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.06.328054,77

An online telemedicine web-based technology can help to overcome this situation. This paper presents an online telemedicine system that helps to promote collaboration between doctors, hospitals, and patients. The system allows doctors to serve patients from remote areas. The system also allows both doctors and patients to communicate through video calls or text messages. Patients using the system can store information about their health, search for doctors, and consult medical professionals using text messages and video calls. Doctors can also register to serve patients, but they must ensure authenticity through registration. Doctors can write blogs, provide prescriptions, and can view the medical history of the patient. Hospitals can assign doctors in the respective departments. The system is tested in a lab environment. The system is fast and reliable with a user-friendly interface, enhancing telemedicine services countrywide for people with online access.","Antor, M. B.; Jamil, Ahms Mamtaz M.; Khan, M.

168279,Probiotic-based vaccines may provide effective protection against COVID-19 acute respiratory disease,2021,"Recent innovations in mobile technologies are playing an important and vital role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. While mobile apps’ functionality plays a crucial role in tackling the COVID-19 spread, it is also raising concerns about the associated privacy risks that users may face. Recent research studies have showed various technological measures on mobile applications that lack consideration of privacy risks in their data practices. For example, security vulnerabilities in COVID-19 apps can be exploited and therefore also pose privacy violations. In this paper, we focus on recent and newly developed COVID-19 apps and consider their threat landscape. Our objective was to identify security vulnerabilities that can lead to user-level privacy risks. We also formalize our approach by measuring the level of risk associated with assets and services that attackers may be targeting to capture during the exploitation. We utilized baseline risk assessment criteria within the scope of three specific security vulnerabilities that often exists in COVID-19 applications namely credential leaks, insecure communication, and HTTP request libraries. We present a proof of concept implementation for risk assessment of COVID-19 apps that can be utilized to evaluate privacy risk by the impact of assets and threat likelihood. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Sharma, T.; Dyer, H.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts an interdisciplinary approach by drawing upon Agamben's concepts of the state of exception, bare life and biosecurity to understand the purposes of the decrees issued by the Italian government and data provided to the citizens in the “daily bulletin” on the crisis by the Civil Protection Department. Findings: Accounting data provided essential contributions to the government's strategy that sought to spread disquiet and uncertainty in the population to ensure compliance with the strict rules in place, thereby sustaining the management of the country under a state of exception. Social implications: The study draws attention to the way in which accounting provides justification for measures that are promoted as provisional but which have enduring effects, most importantly the ability of governments in the future to suspend the rights of individuals. It shows how accounting can influence people's behaviour and contribute to the development of a permanent state of exception that significantly increases government prerogatives. Originality/value: The work contributes to the literature on accounting and emergencies by studying the use of accounting information as a subtle means to ensure support for extreme government actions and ultimately as a political tool that promotes biosecurity as a new government paradigm. © 2021, Valerio Antonelli, Michele Bigoni, Warwick Funnell and Emanuela Mattia Cafaro.","Antonelli, V.; Bigoni, M.; Funnell, W.; Cafaro, E.

170669,Journey of Limonene as an Antimicrobial Agent,2021,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), triggers the innate immune system, leading in severe cases, an excessive immune response, which can lead to high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines promoting a “cytokine storm”. To modulate this exaggerated inflammatory response, several clinical trials with already approved and well-known therapeutic agents that inhibit the inflammatory response, are being carried out. However, none of these drugs seems to achieve the desired results when treating COVID19. Colchicine, a drug often used in the management of patients with Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), is one of the several drugs that are being currently tested for efficacy in COVID19 due to its anti-inflammatory effects. Objectives: To analyze association between colchicine prescription and COVID19-related hospital admissions in patients with Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). Methods: Patients attending a rheumatology outpatient clinic from a tertiary care center in Madrid, Spain, from 1st September 2019 to 29th February 2020 were included. Patients were assigned as exposed or unexposed based on whether they were prescribed with colchicine in their last visit to the clinic during the 6 months before the start of the observation period. Treatment changes during the observation period were also considered. The primary outcome was COVID19-related hospital admissions occurring between March 1st and May 20th, 2020. Secondary outcome included COVID19-related mortality. Several weighting techniques for data balancing, based and non-based on the propensity score, followed by Cox regressions were performed to estimate the association of colchicine prescription on both outcomes. Results: 9,379 patients entered in the study, with 406 and 9,002 exposed and unexposed follow-up periods, respectively. Generalized Boosted Models (GBM) and Empirical Balancing Calibration Weighting (EBCW) methods showed the best balance for COVID19-related hospital admissions. Colchicine prescription did not show a statistically significant association after covariable balancing (p-value = 0.195 and 0.059 for GBM and EBCW, respectively). Regarding mortality, the low number of events prevented a success variable balancing and analysis. Conclusion: Colchicine prescription does not play a significant protective or risk role in RMD patients regarding COVID19-related hospital admissions. Our observations could support the maintenance of colchicine prescription in those patients already being treated, as it is not associated with a worse prognosis.","Álvarez, M.

We have identified applications that address challenges posed by COVID-19 at different scales, including: molecular, by identifying new or existing drugs for treatment;clinical, by supporting diagnosis and evaluating prognosis based on medical imaging and non-invasive measures;and societal, by tracking both the epidemic and the accompanying infodemic using multiple data sources. We also review datasets, tools, and resources needed to facilitate Artificial Intelligence research, and discuss strategic considerations related to the operational implementation of multidisciplinary partnerships and open science.

Recent traffic emission changes under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have been estimated using emerging non-fuel consumption data, such as human mobility data that tech companies reported as AD, due to the unavailability of timely fuel statistics. The use of such unconventional activity data (UAD) might allow us to provide emission estimates in near-real time;however, the errors and uncertainties associated with such estimates are expected to be larger than those of common FFCO2 inventory estimates, and thus should be provided along with a thorough evaluation/validation of the methodology and the resulting estimates. Here, we show the impact of COVID-19 on traffic CO2 emissions over the first six months of 2020 in Japan. We calculated CO2 monthly emissions using fuel consumption data and assessed the emission changes relative to 2019. Regardless of Japan’s soft approach to COVID-19, traffic emissions significantly declined by 23.8% during the state of emergency in Japan (April–May). We also compared relative emission changes among different estimates available. Our analysis suggests that UAD-based emission estimates during April and May could be biased by −19.6% to 12.6%. We also used traffic count data for examining the performance of UAD as a proxy for traffic and/or CO2 emissions. We found the assumed proportional relationship between traffic changes and CO2 emissions was not enough for estimating emissions with accuracy, and moreover, the traffic-based approach failed to capture emission seasonality. Our study highlighted the challenges and difficulties in repurposing data, especially ones with limited traceability/reproducibility, for modeling human activities and assessing the impact on the environment, and the importance of a thorough error and uncertainty assessment before using these data in policy applications.","Oda, Tomohiro Haga Chihiro Hosomi Kotaro Matsui Takanori Bun Rostyslav",Environmental Research Letters,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac109d,77

As this technology becomes deeply rooted in people’s lives, understanding the interplay between this way and personal travel is becoming increasingly important for planners. Using travel diary data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data for structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, it revealed the interaction between e-shopping and shopping trips and the factors that affect this bidirectional relationship. Results show that e-shopping motivates shopping trips, and in-store shopping inhibits online shopping. It can be obtained that the increase of one standard deviation of e-shopping will increase the shopping trip by 0.17 standard deviation. When shopping trips increase by one standard deviation, e-shopping behavior also decreases by 0.12 standard deviation. The results also demonstrated that e-shopping and shopping travel behavior is heterogeneous across a variety of exogenous factors such as personal attributes, household characteristics, geography, travel distance/duration, and travel mode. Identifying the interaction may help formulate better transportation policies and lay the foundation for travel demand management strategies to reduce the stress on the transportation system and meet individual travel needs.","Xue, Chenlei Wu Qunqi Sun Maopeng Bai Pengxia Chen Yang",Complexity,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8247158,77
173285,Physiotherapy service provision in a specialist adult cystic fibrosis service: a pre-post design study with the inclusion of an allied health assistant.,2020-11-18,"Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health systems postponed routine screening and care to conserve resources and reduce patient exposure. As a result, several studies have shown a decline in the diagnosis of new cancer cases, a process that relies heavily on the use of screening tools and modalities. The Washington D.C. area is home to a heterogeneous patient population and one of the highest income gaps in the United States. Patterns in healthcare inequality in the area mirror these disparities. This study aims to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer diagnosis rates compared to prior years and analyze whether vulnerable populations in the D.C. area were disproportionately affected. Methods: Data was collected from the George Washington University (GWU) Cancer Registry. The study population included patients age 18 and up residing in D.C., Maryland or Virginia who were diagnosed with any cancer at the GWU Health System within the following date ranges: April 1 to September 30 of 2018, 2019, 2020 and September 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020. Data collected included age at diagnosis, race, ethnicity, cancer site, stage at diagnosis, and patient zip code as a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES). Median income by zip code was labeled as low, middle or high. Chi square analysis was used to compare changes in each of these demographic and SES categories between each time frame. Results: There were 372 new cancer diagnoses during the COVID-19 period, April 1 2020 to September 30 2020. During this time period in 2018 and 2019, there were 525 and 539 new cancer diagnoses, respectively. Immediately prior to the COVID-19 period, September 1 2019 to February 29 2020, there were 588 new cancer diagnoses. Patterns of cancer type, age at diagnosis, sex, clinical stage, pathological stage and SES did not significantly differ between the COVID-19 period and any other time period (p > 0.05 for all categories). However, ethnicity did change significantly with a slight increase in the number of Hispanic patients diagnosed during the COVID-19 period as compared to the 2018 and 2019 time periods (p = 0.041) and the September 2019 to February 2020 time period (p = 0.0005). Conclusions: Through this retrospective analysis, we observed a decrease in new cancer diagnoses during the COVID-19 period with no significant differences in patient age, sex, cancer type, cancer stage or SES. There was a slight increase in cancer diagnoses among Hispanic patients during the COVID-19 period. These results suggest that most groups were equally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to cancer diagnosis. However, this may be specific to the region we studied and limited by the population size and our means of collecting data about patient SES. Further studies comparing early and late impacts of COVID-19 on cancer care will be important to identify specific communities for targeted outreach and intervention.","Fabrikant, M.

This pandemic has made people much more aware about the severity of virus transmission in public areas. This prompts society to be much more aware of the need to maintain a clean environment. The purpose of this paper is to present the design principles of an Autonomous Indoor Cleaning Robot (AICR) developed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in indoor environments such as small shops and office settings. Its main purpose is to proactively disinfect the air and maintain a clean breathing environment by actively targeting populated areas with the use of a vision system, using Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) technology. Currently there are other air disinfection products on the market also making use of a combination of a High-Efficiency Particulate Absorbing (HEPA) air purifier and Ultra Violet (UV) light to kill airborne viruses like the Coronavirus. However, all of these are stationary with lack of intelligence machines that have to be kept or manually wheeled from room to room. The device proposed in the paper is a fully autonomous air purifying device capable of going to certain critical regions of the indoor environment to disinfect the air in that area without any human interaction. The stationary purifiers should be much more powerful covering a larger area which makes them very expensive. In contrast, the developed autonomous air purifier needs much less power consumption compared to static purifiers, with the advantage of intelligently and dynamically learning the status of the room using the information captured from the occupancy, itself, and the environment. © 2021 IEEE","Narang, M.; Rana, M.; Patel, J.; D'Souza, S.; Onyechie, P.; Berry, C.; Tayefeh, M.; Barari, A.","14th IEEE International Conference on Industry Applications, INDUSCON 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/induscon51756.2021.9529813,77

The first major SARS-CoV-2 variant carries a D614G substitution in the spike (S-D614G) that has been associated with altered conformation, enhanced ACE2 binding, and increased infectivity and transmission. In this report, we used mass spectrometry techniques to characterize and compare the N-glycosylation of the wild type (S-614D) or variant (S-614G) SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins prepared under identical conditions. The data showed that half of the N-glycosylation sequons changed their distribution of glycans in the S-614G variant. The S-614G variant showed a decrease in the relative abundance of complex-type glycans (up to 45%) and an increase in oligomannose glycans (up to 33%) on all altered sequons. These changes led to a reduction in the overall complexity of the total N-glycosylation profile.

175815,White matter myelination during early infancy is explained by spatial gradients and myelin content at birth,2021-08-23,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein, specifically its receptor binding domain (RBD), has emerged as a promising target for generation of neutralizing antibodies. Although the RBD peptide subunit is easily manufactured and highly stable, RBD-based subunit vaccines have been hampered by its poor inherent immunogenicity. We hypothesize that this limitation can be overcome by sustained co-administration alongside a potent and optimized adjuvant. The innate immune second messenger, cGAMP, holds promise as it activates the potent anti-viral STING pathway, but has exhibited poor performance as a therapeutic due to its nonspecific pharmacodynamic profiles when administered systemically and its poor pharmacokinetics arising from rapid excretion and degradation by its hydrolase ENPP1. To overcome these limitations, we sought to mimic the natural scenario of viral infections by creating an artificial immunological niche that enables slow release of cGAMP and the RBD antigen. Specifically, we co-encapsulated cGAMP and RBD in an injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel system. This cGAMP-adjuvanted hydrogel vaccine elicited more potent, durable, and broad antibody responses and improved neutralization than both dose-matched bolus controls and a hydrogel-based vaccine lacking cGAMP. The cGAMP-adjuvanted hydrogel platform developed is suitable for delivery of other antigens and may provide enhanced immunity against a broad range of pathogens.","Gale, Emily C.; Lahey, Lauren J.; Böhnert, Volker; Powell, Abigail E.; Ou, Ben S.; Carozza, Jacqueline A.; Li, Lingyin; Appel, Eric A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.03.451025,77

However, it is uncertain what the vaccination rate will look like after students, faculty, and staff return to campus. To help inform university-reopening policies, we collected survey data on social contact patterns and developed an agent-based model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in university settings. In this paper, we aim to identify the immunity threshold that, if exceeded, would lead to a relatively safe on-campus experience for the university population. With relaxed non-pharmaceutical interventions, we estimated that immunity in at least 60% of the university population is needed for safe university reopening. Still, attention needs to be paid to extreme events that could lead to huge infection size spikes. At an immune level of 60%, continuing non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing masks, could lead to an 89% reduction in the maximum cumulative infection, which reflects the possible non-negligible infection size from extreme events.","Yang, Q.; Gruenbacher, D.

We present a generic optimization problem to solve the optimal testing strategy that set differentiated testing rates on local and migrant populations based on their travel history, relative severity of the epidemic in their origin regions, and whether or not they have COVID-related symptoms. Our optimization problem minimizes the total number of tests that are needed to contain the virus spread assuming a Susceptible-Infected-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) transmission dynamics. We provide a complete characterization of the set of optimal testing strategies, and propose a simple greedy algorithm for computing an optimal strategy. We also study the comparative statics of the optimal strategy with respect to several key parameters related to the social distancing policy and epidemic transmission.

Based on a qualitative content analysis of central European university students’ responses, the aim of this study is to discuss their reflections on the use of digital media in foreign language classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The key method of this qualitative study includes focus group interviews. The results reveal both advantages and disadvantages of online foreign language teaching and their impact on students’ second language (L2) acquisition. The positive aspects involve satisfaction with being able to study a foreign language from the comfort from their homes, avoidance of commuting to school, ample opportunities to review the learning material, or improvement of listening skills. On the contrary, the negative aspects included a striking lack of social contact in the form of face-to-face classes, absence of collaboration between the teacher and students and between the students themselves in order to share and build on their knowledge and experience, health issues associated with a frequent exposure to technologies, or a lack of possibility to develop speaking skills. In conclusion, the authors of this study provide several implications for teaching practice, technology experts, and other stakeholders, which must be considered very seriously, as they represent the opinion of the users of online learning. © 2021 by the authors.

There is a perception that the needs of residents have increased, but evidence is limited. We investigated changes in health and functioning of care home residents over two decades in England and Wales. Methods We conducted a repeated cross-sectional analysis over a 24-year period (1992-2016), using data from three longitudinal studies, the Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS) I and II and English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). To adjust for ageing of respondents over time results are presented for the 75-84 age group. Results Analysis of 2,280 observations from 1,745 care home residents demonstrated increases in severe disability (difficulty in at least two from washing, dressing and toileting). The prevalence of severe disability increased from 63% in 1992 to 87% in 2014 (subsequent fall in 2016 although wide confidence intervals). The prevalence of complex multimorbidity (problems in at least three out of six body systems) increased within studies over time, from 33% to 54% in CFAS I/II between 1992 and 2012, and 26% to 54% in ELSA between 2006 and 2016. Conclusion Over two decades, there has been an increase in disability and the complexity of health problems amongst care home residents in England and Wales. A rise in support needs for residents places increasing demands on care home staff and health professionals. This is an important concern for policymakers when considering the impact of COVID-19 infection in care homes.","Barker, R. O.; Hanratty, B.; Kingston, A.; Ramsay, S.; Matthews, F.

183169,Authors’ Response,2020-12-16,"Relevance. During the pandemic and large-scale vaccination against COVID-19, studies of the effect of various types of vaccines on human reproductive function have become particularly important. Vaccination may have a negative impact on the reproductive organs and tissues due to the development of an autoimmune process involving the gonads. Currently, there are some studies on the effect of vaccination against coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV2 on the male and female reproductive function. The absence of a negative effect of vaccination on spermatogenesis in men has already been demonstrated in the results of three studies. Objective. To evaluate the effect of the Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) vaccine on spermatogenesis and the level of antiphospholipid antibodies in men. Materials and methods. The prospective study included 45 men who were vaccinated against COVID-19 with Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V). The criteria for inclusion in the study were the age from 18 to 55 years, the absence of a previous history of COVID-19, a negative RT-PCR result in SARS-CoV-2 testing, negative SARS-CoV-2 IgG results prior to vaccination, and the absence of severe somatic diseases. The patients were examined twice: immediately before vaccination and 90 days after the first dose was injected. We evaluated spermogram parameters, determined the levels of FSH, LH, TSH and total testosterone, and analyzed blood for IgM and IgG antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) to cardiolipin (aCL), β2-glycoprotein-1 (aß2-GP1), annexin V (aAnV), phosphatidylserine (aPS), as well as IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using enzyme immunoassay. Results. There were no significant changes in the parameters of spermogram and hormone levels before and after vaccination;men with moderate impairment of spermatogenesis (oligoasteno-and/or teratozoospermia) did not show considerable changes either. The level of aPL after vaccination did not increase compared to the baseline level. Besides, there was no correlation between the dynamics of the level of antisperm antibodies, aPL and spermogram parameters. These findings indirectly indicate that there are no changes in the reproductive function associated with this autoimmune factor after vaccination in men. Conclusion. This is one of the first studies that has revealed the effect of the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine on spermatogenesis, hormonal profile and aPL level in men. The obtained results demonstrate that the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine does not have a negative effect on the reproductive function in men.","Drapkina, Y.; Dolgushina, N. V.; Shatylko, T. V.; Nikolaeva, M.

LMICs have significant experience implementing vaccination campaigns to respond to epidemic threats but are often hindered by chronic health system challenges. We sought to identify transferable lessons for COVID-19 vaccination from the rollout of three vaccines that targeted adult groups in Africa and South America: MenAfriVac (meningitis A); 17D (yellow fever); and rVSV-ZEBOV (Ebola virus disease). Methods: We conducted a rapid literature review and 24 semi-structured interviews with technical experts who had direct implementation experience with the selected vaccines in Africa and South America. We identified barriers, enablers, and key lessons from the literature and from participants' experiences. Interview data were analysed thematically according to seven implementation domains. Results: Participants highlighted multiple components of vaccination campaigns that are instrumental for achieving high coverage. Community engagement is an essential and effective tool, requiring dedicated time, funding and workforce. Involving local health workers is a key enabler, as is collaborating with community leaders to map social groups and tailor vaccination strategies to their needs. Vaccination team recruitment and training strategies need to be enhanced to support vaccination campaigns. Although recognised as challenging, integrating vaccination campaigns with other routine health services can be highly beneficial if well planned and coordinated across health programmes and with communities. Conclusion: As supplies of COVID-19 vaccines become available to LMICs, countries need to prepare to efficiently roll out the vaccine, encourage uptake among eligible groups, and respond to potential community concerns. Lessons from the implementation of these three vaccines that targeted adults in LMICs can be used to inform best practice for COVID-19 and other epidemic vaccination campaigns.","Collins, J.; Westerveld, R.; Nelson, K.

The present study is a performance comparison of forced convection solar drying of ginger against open sun drying with and without dehumidification of air stream using liquid calcium chloride as desiccant at air flow rates of 0.153 kg/s and 0.077 kg/s. Using the dryer, fresh ginger having initial moisture content of greater than 80% is reduced to nearly 10% using liquid desiccant at the flow rate of 0.153 kg/s taking 13 hours less compared to open sun drying while it is 9 hours less without using desiccant. At a flow rate of 0.077 kg/s, moisture content is reduced to nearly 20% with saving of 11 and 6 hours, respectively.

In 2016, the waste management company of Venice established a new door to door garbage collection system to prevent the accumulation of rubbish in the streets and limit the trophic resources available for the species. The study provides an up-to-date estimate of the urban population of yellow-legged gulls, using Distance Sampling method. We also studied the effect of the new system on the species by comparing the population estimate before and after the change and by analysing the trend of individuals collected in the old town by the service of wildlife recovery during 2010-2018. Results estimate 440 breeding pairs (95s% confidence interval: 326-593) in June 2018 and show a 34% decrease of breeding pairs in 2018 with respect to 2017, as well as a decrease in number of 1-year birds and pulli collected by wildlife recovery service starting from 2016, year of the policy implementation. Our data did not show a significant decrease in the overall number of individuals, suggesting the new policy has a stronger effect on the breeding success of the species than on adult survival.

In this blinded randomized clinical trial (EudraCT 2021-002348-57) we compare the efficacy and safety of an additional booster vaccination with a vector versus mRNA vaccine in non-seroconverted patients. We assigned 60 patients under rituximab treatment, who did not seroconvert after their primary mRNA vaccination with either BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna), to receive a third dose, either using the same mRNA or the vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca). Patients were stratified according to the presence of peripheral B-cells. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in the SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion rate between vector (heterologous) and mRNA (homologous) vaccinated patients by week four. Key secondary endpoints included the overall seroconversion and cellular immune response; safety was assessed at weeks one and four. Seroconversion rates at week four were comparable between vector (6/27 patients, 22%) and mRNA (9/28, 32%) vaccine (p=0.6). Overall, 27% of patients seroconverted; specific T-cell responses were observed in 20/20 (100%) vector versus 13/16 (81%) mRNA vaccinated patients. Newly induced humoral and/or cellular responses occurred in 9/11 (82%) patients. No serious adverse events, related to immunization, were observed.

The gold standard for confirming COVID-19 infection is through Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The lack of sufficient RT-PCR testing capacity, false negative results of RT-PCR, time to get back the results and other logistical constraints enabled the epidemic to continue to spread albeit interventions like regional or complete country lockdowns. Therefore, chest radiographs such as CT and X-ray can be used to supplement PCR in combating the virus from spreading. In this work, we focus on proposing a deep learning tool that can be used by radiologists or healthcare professionals to diagnose COVID-19 cases in a quick and accurate manner. However, the lack of a publicly available dataset of X-ray and CT images makes the design of such AI tools a challenging task. To this end, this study aims to build a comprehensive dataset of X-rays and CT scan images from multiple sources as well as provides a simple but an effective COVID-19 detection technique using deep learning and transfer learning algorithms. In this vein, a simple convolution neural network (CNN) and modified pre-trained AlexNet model are applied on the prepared X-rays and CT scan images.

Study eligibility criteria, participants and exposures: Eligible studies were those conducted among adult hospital inpatients, measured exposure to individual antibiotics or antibiotic classes, included a comparison group, and measured the occurrence of HCFA CDI as an outcome. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: The Newcastle Ottawa Scale for the Assessment of Quality was used to appraise study quality. To assess the association between each antibiotic class and HACDI, a pooled random effects meta-analysis was undertaken. Metaregression and sub-group analysis was used to investigate study characteristics identified a priori as potential sources of heterogeneity. Results: Carbapenems, and 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporin antibiotics remain most strongly associated with HCFA CDI, with cases more than twice as likely to have recent exposure to these antibiotics prior to developing CDI. Modest associations were observed for fluoroquinolones clindamycin, and betalactamase inhibitor combination penicillin antibiotics. Limitations: Individual study effect sizes were variable and heterogeneity was observed for most antibiotic classes. Availability of a single reviewer to select, extract and critically appraise the studies. Conclusions: This review provides the most up to date synthesis of evidence in relation to the risk of HCFA CDI associated with exposure to specific antibiotic classes. Studies were predominantly conducted in North America or Europe and more studies outside of these settings are needed.","Slimings, C.; Riley, T.

184278,Facts and ideas from anywhere.,2016,"Deinbollia onanae (Sapindaceae-Litchi clade) is here formally named and characterised as a new species to science, previously known as Deinbollia sp. 2. Cameroon has the highest species-diversity and species endemism known in this African-Western Indian Ocean genus of 42 species. Deinbollia onanae is an infrequent tree species known from five locations in surviving islands of montane (or upper submontane) forest along the line of the Cameroon Highlands. It is here assessed as Endangered according to the IUCN 2012 standard, threatened mainly by clearance of forest for agriculture. The majority of tree species characteristic of montane forest (above 2000 m alt.) in the Cameroon Highlands are also widespread in East African mountains (i.e. are Afromontane). Deinbollia onanae is one of only a very small number of species that are endemic (globally restricted to) the mountain range. It is postulated that this new species is in a sister relationship with Deinbollia oreophila, which is a frequent species of a lower (submontane) altitudinal band of the same range. It is further postulated that seed dispersal is or was by frugivorous birds, potentially turacos, alternatively by primates such as Preuss s monkey.","Cheek, Martin; Onana, Jean Michel",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.24.353680,77

During the 2009-10 influenza season, pregnant women were at increased risk for severe disease and mortality from influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1) pandemic virus infection. Anticipating this risk, both the inactivated trivalent seasonal and monovalent pH1N1 vaccinations were recommended for pregnant women. To estimate state-specific seasonal and pH1N1 influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women, CDC analyzed data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). This report provides estimates from 29 states and New York City (NYC) for women who had live births during September 2009-May 2010. Median state coverage was 47.1% for seasonal and 40.4% for pH1N1 influenza vaccination. Overall, women who reported that a health-care provider offered them influenza vaccination or told them to get it during their pregnancy were more likely to be vaccinated than those without an offer or recommendation (prevalence ratio [PR] = 5.2 for seasonal, and PR = 14.4 for pH1N1). Substantial variation across areas was observed for prevalence of a provider offer or recommendation during pregnancy and for influenza vaccination. These findings highlight the need for state-specific strategies that optimize provider involvement to increase influenza vaccination of pregnant women.",,MMWR.

Infectious virus isolated from acutely infected animals, designated JHM-OMp1, was inoculated IC into a second group of monkeys. In this report we describe observations on the acutely infected animals and those surviving the acute infection were sacrificed at later times post-infection. Results from dual in situ hybridization/immunohistochemistry screening of tissues show that astrocytes are target cells in white matter lesions during acute infection. In animals sacrificed 150 days post-infection, areas of demyelinated gliotic lesions, prominent in the spinal cord, were seen throughout the neuraxis. No virus products were detected in these late-infection lesions.","Murray, R S; Cai, G Y; Soike, K F; Cabirac, G F",Journal of neurovirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9147824/,77

189170,[Ichthyosis vulgaris].,2020-04-20,"Herpesvirus glycoproteins play dominant roles in the initiation of infection of target cells in culture and thus may also influence viral tropism in vivo. Whereas the relative contribution of several nonessential glycoproteins to neurovirulence and neurotropism of Pseudorabies virus (PrV), an alphaherpesvirus which causes Aujeszky's disease in pigs, has recently been uncovered in studies using viral deletion mutants, the importance of essential glycoproteins is more difficult to assess. We isolated an infectious PrV mutant, PrV-9112C2, which lacks the gene encoding the essential PrV glycoprotein B (gB) but stably carries in its genome and expresses the homologous gene of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) (A. Kopp and T. C. Mettenleiter, J. Virol. 66:2754-2762, 1992). Apart from exhibiting a slight delay in penetration kinetics, PrV-9112C2 was similar in its growth characteristics in cell culture to wild-type PrV. To analyze the effect of the exchange of these homologous glycoproteins in PrV's natural host, swine, 4-week-old piglets were intranasally infected with 10(6) PFU of either wild-type PrV strain Kaplan (PrV-Ka), PrV-9112C2, or PrV-9112C2R, in which the PrV gB gene was reinserted instead of the BHV-1 gB gene. Animals infected with PrV-Ka and PrV-9112C2R showed a similar course of disease, i.e., high fever, marked respiratory symptoms but minimal neurological disorders, and excretion of high amounts of virus. All animals survived the infection. In contrast, animals infected with PrV-9112C2 showed no respiratory symptoms and developed only mild fever. However, on day 5 after infection, all piglets developed severe central nervous system (CNS) symptoms leading to death within 48 to 72 h. Detailed histological analyses showed that PrV-9112C2R infected all regions of the nasal mucosa and subsequently spread to the CNS preferentially by the trigeminal route. In contrast, PrV-9112C2 primarily infected the olfactory epithelium and spread via the olfactory route. In the CNS, more viral antigen and significantly more pronounced histological changes resulting in more severe encephalitis were found after PrV-9112C2 infection. Thus, our results demonstrate that replacement of PrV gB by the homologous BHV-1 glycoprotein resulted in a dramatic increase in neurovirulence combined with an alteration in the route of neuroinvasion, indicating that the essential gB is involved in determining neurotropism and neurovirulence of PrV.","Gerdts, V; Beyer, J; Lomniczi, B; Mettenleiter, T C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10623744/,77

Therefore, this study aimed to summarize the outcomes of COVID-19 patients in the ICU following endotracheal intubation and provide a clinical reference for the high-risk procedure. From February 1 to February 18, 2020, we enrolled 59 critically ill COVID-19 patients who received emergency endotracheal intubation in the ICUs of Tongji Hospital. We recorded demographic information, laboratory parameters, comorbidities, changes in vital signs pre- and post-intubation, the airway grade, intubation success rate using three types of laryngoscopes, and the experience of intubators. Follow-up evaluations were performed for all proceduralists to monitor nosocomial infections. The majority of the patients requiring intubation were elderly and had at least one comorbidity. Of the patients, 86.4% developed hypoxia before intubation. The first and second attempts of successful endotracheal intubation with the Macintosh laryngoscope (70.0% and 83.3%), Airtraq videolaryngoscope (93.5% and 80%), and UE videolaryngoscope (88.9% and 100%) were performed. Notably, SpO2 <93% and hypotension were observed 3 min after intubation in 32.2% and 39% patients, respectively. With the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), no nosocomial infections were observed among proceduralists. Full PPE increased the occurrence of fogging on goggles and myopia glasses. Overall, a higher success rate of intubation was achieved by senior intubators using a videolaryngoscope. Although inconvenient, appropriate ensembles of PPE could prevent nosocomial infections.","Zheng, Hongbo; Li, Shiyong; Sun, Rao; Yang, Hui; Chi, Xiaohui; Chen, Mingbing; Xu, Li; Deng, Qingzhu; Li, Xinhua; Yu, Jie; Wan, Li; Luo, Ailin",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33194062/,77
189554,Performance measures for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: A European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy quality improvement initiative.,2016,"OBJECTIVES A significant percentage of confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, and the viral sequence was detectable in the stool of most patients. At present, the knowledge of the pathology of the digestive system in SARS patients is limited. Because a resurgence of the SARS epidemic is constantly possible, there is an urgent need to understand the involvement of the digestive system in this new disease. METHODS We performed seven SARS autopsies in which samples of alimentary tract and digestive glands were examined with routine pathology, electron microscopy (EM), in situ hybridization (ISH), immunohistochemistry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS The main histopathological finding was atrophy of the mucosal lymphoid tissue. A few mucosal epithelial cells and lymphocytes in the intestine were positively stained for coronavirus with ISH. SARS-coronavirus (CoV)-like particles were found in the mucosal epithelial cells under EM and mild focal inflammation was detected in the alimentary tract. One patient who experienced severe diarrhea had pseudomembranous enteritis of the ileum. Fatty degeneration and central lobular necrosis were observed in the liver. No evidence of direct viral infection was found in the esophagus, the stomach, the salivary gland, the liver, or the pancreas. CONCLUSIONS In addition to the lungs, the gastrointestinal tract is another target of SARS-CoV infection, as the intestinal epithelial cells and mucosal lymphoid tissue are infected. The findings provide possible explanations for the gastrointestinal symptoms and the presence of virus in the stool of SARS patients.","Shi, Xueying; Gong, Encong; Gao, Dongxia; Zhang, Bo; Zheng, Jie; Gao, Zifen; Zhong, Yanfeng; Zou, Wanzhong; Wu, Bingquan; Fang, Weigang; Liao, Songlin; Wang, Shenglan; Xie, Zhigang; Lu, Min; Hou, Lin; Zhong, Haohao; Shao, Hongquan; Li, Ning; Liu, Congrong; Pei, Fei; Yang, Jingping; Wang, Yuping; Han, Zhihui; Shi, Xiaohong; Zhang, Qianying; You, Jiangfeng; Zhu, Xiang; Gu, Jiang",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15654797/,77

Faced with this situation, the objective of the work was to promote good prevention practices against COVID-19 in the general population to avoid the collapse of the public health system. METHODS An exploratory review on prevention measures against COVID-19 was carried out in the databases Elsevier, Pubmed, Wiley, Scopus, Scielo and, in general, in academic Google, to obtain gray information. RESULTS The role of seven individual protection and prevention measures and barriers to stop the advance of community infections by COVID-19 were described and analyzed. Studies showed that the use of preventive measures can play a critical role in containing the pandemic. However, they can also provide a false security of protection, predisposing to neglect the correct use and handling of all containment measures. CONCLUSIONS Given the drastic rise in infections and deaths from COVID-19 in Latin America, it becomes necessary to continue with biosecurity campaigns so that citizens are clear that prevention is an integrated process and that the use of one measure does not replace another.","Romero-Saritama, José Miguel; Simaluiza, Janneth; Fernandez, Heriberto",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833213/,77

This study aimed to discern their association with severity of illness and mortality in tertiary setup of Delhi, India. Methods Retrospective data of hospitalised COVID-19 patients over 3 months (end March to June 2020) were evaluated for symptom profile, blood investigations and chest radiograph data and classified according to COVID-19 severity and as survivors and non-survivors. Results Average age (n=182) was 46.1 years, male to female ratio 1.4:1. Fever (51.1%), cough (49.4%) and breathlessness (48.3%) were the commonest symptoms, and frequency of all the three increased with severity of COVID-19. Fever duration, leucocytosis, neutrophilia, elevated blood urea, transaminitis and higher Brixia score on chest X-ray were also more in severe COVID-19 compared to mild and moderate categories. Higher age, more comorbidities, fever, breathlessness and chest pain; longer duration of fever, leucocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, elevated serum urea, creatinine, transaminases and hyperglycemia, and higher radiographic Brixia score were observed in non-survivors compared to survivors.

There is well-defined electron density for three to five saccharides in all five complexes and a striking conformational difference between two linear pentasaccharides with the same composition but different linkage [alpha(2-->6) or alpha(2-->3)] at the terminal sialic acid. The bound position of the terminal sialic acid (NeuAc) is the same in all five complexes and is identical to that reported previously from the study of mono- and trisaccharides. The two oligosaccharides with NeuAc alpha(2-->6)Gal linkages and GlcNAc at the third position have a folded conformation with the GlcNAc doubled back to contact the sialic acid. The pentasaccharide with a terminal NeuAc alpha(2-->3)Gal linkage and GlcNAc at the third position has an extended (not folded) conformation and exits from the opposite side of the binding site than the alpha(2-->6)-linked molecule of the same composition. The difference between the conformation of the pentasaccharide with a 2,6 linkage and the trisaccharide 2,6-sialyllactose suggests that 2,6-sialyllactose is not, as previously believed, an appropriate analog of natural influenza A virus receptors.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the golden standard. Yet, conversion to open cholecystectomy is necessary in some patients. However, conversion maybe associated with increased complications and operation time. MATERIAL AND METHODS The files of 1224 patients patients underwent scheduled elective cholecystectomy were reviewed in a retrospective cohort study. The files of patients who underwent open cholecystectomy operations during the same period were also examined. The demographic data, medical history, operation notes and reasons of conversion were evaluated. RESULTS The total number of patients who were initiated a laparoscopic operation but converted to open cholecystectomy was 28 (2.28%). A total of 89 patients underwent open cholecystectomy including converted cases. In the regression analysis age, adhesions, edema in the gallbladder, bleeding, previous scar tissue were found to be significantly related to conversion, while sex and higher BMI were not.

192132,Remdesivir (Veklury) for COVID-19.,2020-11-30,"Enveloped viruses mature by budding at cellular membranes. It has been generally thought that this process is driven by interactions between the viral transmembrane proteins and the internal virion components (core, capsid, or nucleocapsid). This model was particularly applicable to alphaviruses, which require both spike proteins and a nucleocapsid for budding. However, genetic studies have clearly shown that the retrovirus core protein, i.e., the Gag protein, is able to form enveloped particles by itself. Also, budding of negative-strand RNA viruses (rhabdoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses) seems to be accomplished mainly by internal components, most probably the matrix protein, since the spike proteins are not absolutely required for budding of these viruses either. In contrast, budding of coronavirus particles can occur in the absence of the nucleocapsid and appears to require two membrane proteins only. Biochemical and structural data suggest that the proteins, which play a key role in budding, drive this process by forming a three-dimensional (cage-like) protein lattice at the surface of or within the membrane. Similarly, recent electron microscopic studies revealed that the alphavirus spike proteins are also engaged in extensive lateral interactions, forming a dense protein shell at the outer surface of the viral envelope. On the basis of these data, we propose that the budding of enveloped viruses in general is governed by lateral interactions between peripheral or integral membrane proteins. This new concept also provides answers to the question of how viral and cellular membrane proteins are sorted during budding. In addition, it has implications for the mechanism by which the virion is uncoated during virus entry.","Garoff, H; Hewson, R; Opstelten, D J",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9841669/,77
192493,In brief: Myocarditis with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.,2021-07-26,"Different groups have observed retrovirus particle (RVP) production in cell cultures from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). This in vitro production appeared relatively specific for MS versus healthy controls, but was likely to be enhanced or activated by infectious triggers such as Herpesviruses (e.g. HSV, EBV). Independent molecular analysis of retroviral RNA associated with RVP revealed two different genetic families of endogenous retroviral elements (HERV): MSRV/HERV-W and RGH/HERV-H. Interestingly, these sequences were detected by mutually exclusive primers in RT - PCR amplifications. Surprisingly, these two HERV families both contain an ancestral proviral copy inserted in chromosome 7q21-22 region at about 1 kb of distance of each other. Another HERV-W proviral sequence is located within a T-cell alpha-delta receptor (TCR) gene in chromosome 14q11.2 region. Interestingly, these two regions correspond to genetic loci previously identified as potentially associated with 'multigenic' susceptibility to MS and TCR alpha chain genetic determinants have been reported to be statistically associated with MS. A plausible role for infectious agents triggering a co-activation of the chromosome 7q HERV tandem (replicative retrovirus and/or other virus and/or intracellular bacteria) and, eventually, other HERV copies, is discussed. The role of particular HERV polymorphism and the production of pathogenic molecules (gliotoxin and superantigen) possibly associated with retroviral expression are also evoked. An integrative concept of pathogenic 'chain-reaction' in MS involving several step-specific pathogenic 'agents' and 'products' somewhat interacting with particular genetic elements would federate most partial data obtained on MS, including retroviral expression.","Perron, H; Perin, J P; Rieger, F; Alliel, P M",Journal of neurovirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10871789/,77

Today there is some evidence suggesting that good health is inversely related to income inequality. After the economic reforms initiated in the early 1980s, China experienced one of the fastest-growing income inequalities in the world. The state of China in the 1990s is focussed on and possible effects of provincial income inequality on individual health status are explored. METHODS A multilevel regression model is used to analyse the data collected in 1991, 1993 and 1997 from nine provinces included in the China Health and Nutrition Survey. The effects of provincial Gini coefficients on self-rated health in each year are evaluated by two logistic regressions estimating the odds ratios of reporting poor or fair health. The patterns of this effect are compared among the survey years and also among different demographic groups. RESULTS The analyses show an independent effect of income inequality on self-reported health after adjusting for individual and household variables. Furthermore, the effect of income distribution is not attenuated when household income and provincial gross domestic product per capita are included in the model. The results show that there is an increased risk of about 10-15% on average for fair or poor health for people living in provinces with greater income inequalities compared with provinces with modest income inequalities. CONCLUSIONS In China, societal income inequality appears to be an important determinant of population health during 1991-7.","Pei, X; Rodriguez, E",Journal of epidemiology and community health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17108303/,77

Antigenic and genomic characterizations of the virus (isolate NC99) were based on serological comparison with other avian and mammalian coronaviruses and sequence analysis of the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene. Indirect fluorescent-antibody assay procedures and virus neutralization assays demonstrated a close antigenic relationship with bovine coronavirus (BCV) and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (mammalian group 2 coronaviruses). Using previously described BCV primers, the N protein gene of isolate NC99 was amplified by a reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) procedure. The RT-PCR product was cloned into pUC19 and sequenced; the complete N protein of NC99 (446 amino acids) was then compared with published N protein sequences of other avian and mammalian coronaviruses. A high degree of identity (89.0 to 90.1%) was observed between the N protein sequence of NC99 and published sequences of BCV (Mebus and F15 strains) and human coronavirus (strain OC43); only limited identity (<25%) was observed with group 1 and group 3 coronaviruses. Based on these findings, the virus has been tentatively identified as equine coronavirus (ECV).

To determine the significance of the SARS-CoV group-specific ORFs in virus replication in vitro and in mice, we systematically deleted five of the eight group-specific ORFs, ORF3a, OF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF7b, and characterized recombinant virus replication and gene expression in vitro. Deletion of the group-specific ORFs of SARS-CoV, either alone or in various combinations, did not dramatically influence replication efficiency in cell culture or in the levels of viral RNA synthesis. The greatest reduction in virus growth was noted following ORF3a deletion. SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein does not encode a rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER)/Golgi retention signal, and it has been suggested that ORF3a interacts with and targets S glycoprotein retention in the rER/Golgi apparatus. Deletion of ORF3a did not alter subcellular localization of the S glycoprotein from distinct punctuate localization in the rER/Golgi apparatus. These data suggest that ORF3a plays little role in the targeting of S localization in the rER/Golgi apparatus. In addition, insertion of the 29-bp deletion fusing ORF8a/b into the single ORF8, noted in early-stage SARS-CoV human and civet cat isolates, had little if any impact on in vitro growth or RNA synthesis. All recombinant viruses replicated to wild-type levels in the murine model, suggesting that either the group-specific ORFs play little role in in vivo replication efficiency or that the mouse model is not of sufficient quality for discerning the role of the group-specific ORFs in disease origin and development.","Yount, Boyd; Roberts, Rhonda S; Sims, Amy C; Deming, Damon; Frieman, Matthew B; Sparks, Jennifer; Denison, Mark R; Davis, Nancy; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16282490/,77

MATERIALS AND METHODS The root canal of 40 extracted human primary anterior teeth were cleaned, shaped and grouped into experimental (n = 30) and control (n = 10). The root canals of the positive (n = 5) and the negative control (n = 5) were irrigated for 3 minutes with 5 ml of 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or saline respectively. The canals in the experimental groups were irrigated for 3 minutes with 5 ml of 1 mg/ml ethanolic extract of S. persica (n = 15) or BioPure MTAD (n = 15) and then flushed with 2 ml of saline. The presence or absence of smear layer at the coronal and middle portion of each canal were examined under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). RESULTS A significant difference (p = 0.004) in smear layer removal between S. persica and MTAD at the middle third of the canal was observed. MTAD solution was as effective as 17% EDTA in removing the smear layer. CONCLUSION MTAD was significantly more effective in smear layer removal than S. persica solution at the middle third of the canal wall. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Both tested irrigant solutions have the ability to remove the intracanal smear from primary root dentin following cleaning and shaping of the root canal and could be an alternative to EDTA.","Balto, Hanan; Salama, Fouad; Al-Mofareh, Sultan; Al-Yahya, Faisal",The journal of contemporary dental practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26057916/,77

OBJECTIVES To evaluate different prostheses used in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in terms of biocompatibility, postoperative complications, recurrence rate and quality of life, so that all the features could lead us to the ""ideal"" mesh. MATERIAL AND METHOD Randomized controlled trials, reviews, prospective and retrospective studies, retrospective cross-sectional and experimental studies on animals published between 2000 and 2016 were analysed with respect to several features of a mesh: biocompatibility, postoperative complications, recurrence rate and quality of life. OUTCOMES The most common comparison is between heavy-weight and light-weight mesh used in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Experimental studies try to discover the ""ideal"" prosthesis, which could provide improved biocompatibility, low postoperative complications, decreased recurrence rate and good quality of life. The most commonly used mesh that meats the characteristics of an ""ideal"" prosthesis is a light-weight monofilament macroporous polypropylene mesh, with a minimum tensile strength >16 N/cm², measuring 10x15 cm. CONCLUSIONS Published data show that the ""ideal"" prosthesis used in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair has not been discovered yet. Regarding heavy- or light-weight meshes, there is no significant effect on recurrence, acute or chronic pain, incidence of seroma or return to daily activity and quality of life (1).","Trandafir, Alexandra Florina; Popa, Dorin Eugen; Vasile, Danut",Maedica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29218068/,77

Several national disaster plans, including that of Belgium, focus on maximal treatment at home with senior medical students supporting frontline care. To evaluate the knowledge and preparedness of Belgian senior medical students, an e-mail survey of senior medical students (last two years of education) attending Flemish universities was conducted. A total of 243 students (30%) replied. Only 21.8% of them were aware of the possibility of being involved in this planning. A total of 77.4% estimated H5N1 to be a possible threat to national health. Seventy percent of respondents reacted positively towards the idea of being involved in implementing primary care, and only 9.5% were absolutely opposed to the idea. A total of 82.3% would care for pandemic patients if necessary, but only 41.2% would do so if these patients were children. Only 18.9% estimated themselves to be sufficiently educated regarding H5N1. Ninety-one percent were convinced that care for H5N1-influenza patients should be incorporated into their regular curriculum. Several antiviral products were reported by the students to be efficient for treating H5N1, but only 34.6% correctly chose oseltamavir and/or zanamavir and 35.4% replied ""I don't know"". A total of 95.5% correctly answered that the regular influenza vaccination doesn't protect against H5N1. The risk for human-to-human transmission was rated to be small by 50.6% (none 21%, high 27.6%). The human infection risk was rated to be small by 74.1% (none 1.6%, high 23%).

Cytokine production, chemokine secretion, and immune cell infiltration into the central nervous system are critical to control viral replication during acute infection. Despite potent antiviral T-lymphocyte activity, sterile immunity is not achieved, and MHV chronically persists within oligodendrocytes. Continued infiltration and activation of the immune system, a result of the lingering viral antigen and RNA within oligodendrocytes, lead directly to the development of an immune-mediated demyelination that bears remarkable similarities, both clinically and histologically, to the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. MHV offers a unique model system for studying host defense during acute viral infection and immune-mediated demyelination during chronic infection.","Lane, Thomas E; Hosking, Martin P",Critical reviews in immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20370625/,77

Up to 9 days past infection, no differences were seen between immunologically competent and immuno-deficient animals in terms of onset and progression of neurological disease. However, in the latter animals neurological symptoms were dominated by signs of encephalitis instead of paralytic disease as usually seen in immunocompetent animals. Nevertheless, despite high titers of infectious virus in the CNS of immunodeficient animals only mild histopathological changes were noticeable. In contrast, infectious virus in the CNS of immunologically competent animals was below the detection limit of the assay. Paralytic disease and tissue destruction were T lymphocyte mediated because gamma-irradiated rats that were reconstituted by CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocyte enriched cells in the absence of B lymphocytes revealed an earlier onset of clinical symptoms and a more rapid deterioration of their clinical state compared to fully competent animals. Whereas in CD4+ T cell reconstituted animals infectious virus was moderately reduced and tissue destruction as well as inflammatory changes in the CNS were focal, in CD8+ T cell reconstituted animals vacuolizing white matter inflammation was diffuse without reduction of infectious virus in brain tissue. From the presented data we conclude that in the acute stage of JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis of Lewis rats: (i) tissue destruction and paralytic clinical symptomatology are mainly T cell-mediated; (ii) CD4+ T lymphocytes can directly contribute to reduction of viral load in the brain and (iii) only coordinated action of both, the T and the B cell compartment enables animals to survive the infection and recover from disease.","Schwender, S; Hein, A; Imrich, H; Czub, S; Dörries, R",Journal of neurovirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10414515/,77

These can be subdivided roughly into two categories: 'first line defence', consisting of the non-specific, innate immune system, and 'adaptive immune response', acquired over time following virus infection or vaccination. During evolution, viruses have developed numerous, and often very ingenious, strategies to counteract efficient recognition of virions or virus-infected cells by both innate and adaptive immunity. This review will focus on the different strategies that viruses use to avoid recognition by one of the components of the immune system: the complement system. Complement evasion is of particular importance for viruses, since complement activation is a crucial component of innate immunity (alternative and mannan-binding lectin activation pathway) as well as of adaptive immunity (classical, antibody-dependent complement activation).","Favoreel, Herman W; Van de Walle, Gerlinde R; Nauwynck, Hans J; Pensaert, Maurice B",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12533696/,77

In order to evaluate disease as a contributing factor to the declines, health assessments of these two sea otter populations were conducted by evaluating hematologic and/or serum biochemical values and exposure to six marine and terrestrial pathogens using blood collected during ongoing studies from 1995 through 2000. Samples from 72 free-ranging Alaskan, 78 free-ranging southern, and (for pathogen exposure only) 41 debilitated southern sea otters in rehabilitation facilities were evaluated and compared to investigate regional differences. Serum chemistry and hematology values did not indicate a specific disease process as a cause for the declines. Statistically significant differences were found between free-ranging adult southern and Alaskan population mean serum levels of creatinine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, calcium, cholesterol, creatinine, glucose, phosphorous, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, and sodium. These were likely due to varying parasite loads, contaminant exposures, and physiologic or nutrition statuses. No free-ranging sea otters had signs of disease at capture, and prevalences of exposure to calicivirus, Brucella spp., and Leptospira spp. were low. The high prevalence (35%) of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in free-ranging southern sea otters, lack of antibodies to this parasite in Alaskan sea otters, and the pathogen's propensity to cause mortality in southern sea otters suggests that this parasite may be important to sea otter population dynamics in California but not in Alaska. The evidence for exposure to pathogens of public health importance (e.g., Leptospira spp., T. gondii) in the southern sea otter population, and the naïveté of both populations to other pathogens (e.g., morbillivirus and Coccidiodes immitis) may have important implications for their management and recovery.","Hanni, Krista D; Mazet, Jonna A K; Gulland, Frances M D; Estes, James; Staedler, Michelle; Murray, Michael J; Miller, Melissa; Jessup, David A",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14733279/,77

A severe recurrent infection developed, typified by viral persistence and acute lymphopenia, with waves of enhanced viral replication coinciding with fever, weight loss, and depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Our combined observations suggest a model for FIP pathogenesis in which virus-induced T-cell depletion and the antiviral T-cell response are opposing forces and in which the efficacy of early T-cell responses critically determines the outcome of the infection. Rising amounts of viral RNA in the blood, consistently seen in animals with end-stage FIP, indicate that progression to fatal disease is the direct consequence of a loss of immune control, resulting in unchecked viral replication. The pathogenic phenomena described here likely bear relevance to other severe coronavirus infections, in particular severe acute respiratory syndrome, for which multiphasic disease progression and acute T-cell lymphopenia have also been reported. Experimental FIP presents a relevant, safe, and well-defined model to study coronavirus-mediated immunosuppression and should provide an attractive and convenient system for in vivo testing of anticoronaviral drugs.","de Groot-Mijnes, Jolanda D F; van Dun, Jessica M; van der Most, Robbert G; de Groot, Raoul J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15613332/,77

The ability of C. albicans to adhere to host surfaces is positively correlated with its pathogenicity. We prepared a polyclonal anti-Candida albicans antibody in chicken egg yolk (anti-C. albicans IgY) and investigated its in vitro effectiveness in preventing C. albicans adherence and biofilm formation. Anti-C. albicans IgY significantly reduced the adherence of C. albicans SC5314 to human oral epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. The same effect was also observed in other Candida spp. including C. albicans serotype A and B. Further, the IgY inhibited biofilm formation of C. albicans in medium without serum, but the inhibition was slightly restored in medium conditioned with 10% serum. The data indicate that anti-C. albicans IgY cross-reacted with various Candida spp. and may have a protective effect against oral candidiasis and reduce the dissemination of Candida spp. This effect may be due to the blocking of the binding of Candida spp. to the host cells. However, the blocking did not play a role when Candida formed a germ tube in the presence of serum. Therefore, anti-C. albicans IgY may be considered as a prophylactic immunotherapy or possibly an adjunctive antifungal therapy under limited conditions.","Fujibayashi, Taisuke; Nakamura, Moriyuki; Tominaga, Akira; Satoh, Norifumi; Kawarai, Taketo; Narisawa, Naoki; Shinozuka, Osamu; Watanabe, Haruo; Yamazaki, Tsuneyoshi; Senpuku, Hidenobu",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19762981/,77

These measures included extreme restrictions on those who would normally accompany patients to the hospital, screening for SARS, and protective attire for hospital staff, including masks, face shields, goggles, gloves and gowns. At Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children (HSC), patients could only be accompanied or visited by one person, often only in patients' rooms. For the first four weeks, patients and their designated parent had to wear masks in almost all areas of the hospital. Staff wore masks (and other appropriate protective clothing) whenever in contact with patients and in many patient care areas.

Considerable progress has been made since SARS in addressing these limitations, including the creation of the new Public Health Agency of Canada. A remaining contentious question is whether there is a need for new federal emergency public health powers. Approaches to public health problems are best handled through collaborative processes, recognizing the critical importance of the local public health response. Nevertheless, this paper argues that a legislative back-up plan must be available to the federal government in the event that collaborative relationships break down. At the minimum, legislation should give the federal government the authority to have guaranteed access to surveillance data during a public health emergency. The legislation should also consider providing the federal government with the authority to devote the nation's resources to the management of an emergency at its earliest stages. However, any legislative approach must be combined with the development of appropriate capacity at the national level to ensure that new powers can be adequately utilized and that required funding reaches public health officials at other levels of government.","Wilson, Kumanan",Healthcare policy = Politiques de sante,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19305702/,77

Limited data show serious complications of COVID-19 infection and pregnancy. Severe adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes such as preterm delivery, intensive care unit admission, and neonatal and intrauterine death have been reported. Our knowledge of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, disease progression, and clinical course of COVID-19 is continually changing as more information and evidence emerge. The present case adds further insights on COVID-19 and anesthesia considerations for patients undergoing cesarean delivery. In this case report, we describe a successful spinal anesthetic in a pregnant woman with confirmed COVID-19. To prepare for the likelihood of caring for women during labor and cesarean delivery, anesthesia professionals must know how to provide safe, patient-centered care and how to protect every member of the obstetric team from exposure to the virus. In addition, it is paramount that our profession shares our experiences and practices to help guide our multidisciplinary approach in delivering the best care possible to these women.","Harenberg, Jennifer L; Church, Robert; Tubog, Tito D",AANA journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33944772/,77

The origin and function of the subgenomic negative-strand RNAs is controversial. In this report we demonstrate that the synthesis and molar ratios of subgenomic negative strands are similar in alternative host cells, suggesting that these RNAs function as important mediators of positive-strand synthesis. Using kinetic labeling experiments, we show that the full-length and subgenomic-length replicative form RNAs rapidly accumulate and then saturate with label, suggesting that the subgenomic-length negative strands are the principal mediators of positive-strand synthesis. Using cycloheximide, which preferentially inhibits negative-strand and to a lesser extent positive-strand synthesis, we demonstrate that cycloheximide treatment equally inhibits full-length and subgenomic-length negative-strand synthesis. Importantly, following treatment, previously transcribed negative strands remain in transcriptionally active complexes even in the absence of new negative-strand synthesis. These findings indicate that the subgenomic-length negative strands are the principal templates of positive-strand synthesis during MHV infection.","Baric, R S; Yount, B",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10756015/,77

Expression of MHV structural proteins by recombinant vaccinia viruses showed that expression of MHV E protein induced apoptosis in DBT cells, whereas expression of other MHV structural proteins, including S protein, M protein, N protein, and hemagglutinin-esterase protein, failed to induce apoptosis. MHV E protein-mediated apoptosis was suppressed by a high level of Bcl-2 oncogene expression. Our data showed that MHV E protein is a multifunctional protein; in addition to its known function in coronavirus envelope formation, it also induces apoptosis.","An, S; Chen, C J; Yu, X; Leibowitz, J L; Makino, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10438879/,77

200356,Breathless,2021,"Replication by many positive-strand RNA viruses includes genomic RNA amplification and subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA) transcription. For brome mosaic virus (BMV), both processes occur in virus-induced, membrane-associated compartments, require BMV replication factors 1a and 2a, and use negative-strand RNA3 as a template for genomic RNA3 and sgRNA syntheses. To begin elucidating their relations, we examined the interaction of RNA3 replication and sgRNA transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing 1a and 2a, which support the full RNA3 replication cycle. Blocking sgRNA transcription stimulated RNA3 replication by up to 350%, implying that sgRNA transcription inhibits RNA3 replication. Such inhibition was independent of the sgRNA-encoded coat protein and operated in cis. We further found that sgRNA transcription inhibited RNA3 replication at a step or steps after negative-strand RNA3 synthesis, implying competition with positive-strand RNA3 synthesis for negative-strand RNA3 templates, viral replication factors, or common host components. Consistent with this, sgRNA transcription was stimulated by up to 400% when mutations inhibiting positive-strand RNA3 synthesis were introduced into the RNA3 5'-untranslated region. Thus, BMV subgenomic and genomic RNA syntheses mutually interfered with each other, apparently by competition for one or more common factors. In plant protoplasts replicating all three BMV genomic RNAs, mutations blocking sgRNA transcription often had lesser effects on RNA3 accumulation, possibly because RNA3 also competed with RNA1 and RNA2 replication templates and because any increase in RNA3 replication at the expense of RNA1 and RNA2 would be self-limited by decreased 1a and 2a expression from RNA1 and RNA2.","Grdzelishvili, Valery Z; Garcia-Ruiz, Hernan; Watanabe, Tokiko; Ahlquist, Paul",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15650170/,77

Health care workers are among those most at risk of contracting the virus. In the fight against the coronavirus, nurses play a critical role. Still, most social media platforms demonstrate that nurses fear that their health is not being prioritized. The purpose of this study is to investigate nurses' experiences through analyzing the main themes shared on Instagram by nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast with highly structured research, the current paper highlights nurses' natural language use in describing their experiences during the first months of the outbreak in their workplace. Instagram captions were utilized as a data source. Leximancer was utilized for the content analysis of nurses' narratives towards their coronavirus experience. We sought to accomplish three research objectives: the first was to identify the main themes in the descriptions of nurses' experiences shared via their social media, specifically Instagram; then, to determine the relationships among concepts, and finally, to give useful implications based on the findings. The current study uses a qualitative (i.e., narratives) approach to analyze the main components of the nurses' experiences during the pandemic. The Leximancer software analysis revealed nine major textual themes and the relationships among these themes. In order of the relative importance, the themes were ""patients"", ""coronavirus"", ""exhaustion"", ""family"", ""hospital"", ""personal protective equipment"" (PPE), ""shift"", ""fear"", and ""uncertainty"".

This paper proposed a concept to set the boundary on spreading of this disease among the medic people, who are directly exposed to the COVID-19 patient. To reduce their risk to be infected, we have designed the theoretical model of the medic robot to provide medical services to the confirmed case patient. This paper explains the deployment and execution of assigned work of medic robot for patient carrying, delivering food, medications and handling the emergency health services. The medic robots are divided into various group based on their works. The COVID-19 area is considered as a multi-robot environment, where multiple medic robots will work simultaneously. To achieve the multi-robot cooperation and collision avoidance we have implemented the simplest reinforcement learning approach i.e. the Q-learning approach. We have compared the result with respect to the improved-Q-learning approach. A comparative analysis based on parameters like simplicity, objective, deployed robot category and cooperation has been done with some other approaches mentioned in the literature. For simplicity as well as the time and space complexity purpose the results reveal that Q-learning approach is a better consideration.

We collected 1664 posts and 10,805 comments from the Facebook pages of the Macao government from 1 January to 31 October 2020. Using word frequency and content analysis, the results suggest that the engagement was relatively low at the beginning and then surged in the acute stage, with a decreasing trend in the chronic stage. Information about public health measures maintained their engagement in all stages, whereas the engagement of other information was dropping over time. Government social media can be used for increasing vigilance and awareness in the prodromal stage; disseminating information and increasing transparency in the acute stage; and focusing on mental health support and recovery policies in the chronic stage. Additionally, it can be a tool for controlling rumors, providing regular updates and fostering community cohesion in public health crises.","Pang, Patrick Cheong-Iao; Cai, Qixin; Jiang, Wenjing; Chan, Kin Sun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,77

Use of the Shannon information entropy, constructed from an intermolecular orientational spatial distribution function, to drive a search for crystal structures via enhanced molecular dynamics can be an efficient way to map out a landscape of putative polymorphs. Here, the Shannon entropy is used to generate a set of collective variables for differentiating polymorphs of a 1:1 cocrystal of resorcinol and urea. We show that driven adiabatic free energy dynamics, a particular enhanced-sampling approach, combined with these entropy variables, can transform the stable phase into alternate polymorphs. Density functional theory calculations confirm that a structure obtained from the enhanced molecular dynamics is stable at pressures above 1 GPa. We thus show that enhanced sampling should be considered an integral component of crystal structure searching protocols for systems with multiple independent molecules.","Song, Hongxing; Vogt-Maranto, Leslie; Wiscons, Ren; Matzger, Adam J; Tuckerman, Mark E",J Phys Chem Lett,,77

213598,Aerosol formation due to a dental procedure: insights leading to the transmission of diseases to the environment,2021,"Background: The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been responsible for the devastation of hundreds of thousands of lives directly and has caused disruptions globally. Vulnerable populations, specifically those suffering from serious mental illness and homelessness, are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection resulting in medical complications and psychiatric destabilization. In addition, mental health has become increasingly relevant throughout the country given the psychological distress people have been facing due to the spread of COVID-19 and the toll of a more restricted way of living. Although the healthcare industry has quickly integrated novel ways of treating patients with mental illness with technological advances, these technologies are not applicable to different populations equally. There is a clear disparity that is represented within the public county health systems, which leads to a widening gap between those who receive adequate treatment for mental illness and those who do not. Aims: The aims of this paper were to provide a commentary on the benefits of technology-based psychiatric and psychological interventions based off experience in a public health system and based off a relevant, thorough literature review. In addition, we aim to highlight the importance of accessibility of these interventions for vulnerable populations and provide recommendations for integrating these services expeditiously. Methods: Literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar. Conclusions: Based off data collected from experience in a public health system and literature review, we conclude that although the COVID-19 pandemic has initiated significant innovation to integrate technology for psychiatric care, this innovation is not equally accessible for vulnerable populations suffering from mental health disorders. Within a public county health system, there are barriers with providing mental healthcare to vulnerable populations. These barriers, which are applicable throughout the United States, serve as a rationale for the need of innovative solutions for the integration of these services in not only emergency situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in daily non-emergent operations to sufficiently address the needs for those needing mental healthcare.","Ojha, Rashi; Syed, Saba",Internet Interv.,,77

214294,Pemphigoid nodularis: An infrequent variant responding to rituximab,2020,"Thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and over a decade after its reunification, the European Union (EU) is experiencing increasingly more challenges toward its unity. The EU has experienced a number of crises in the early 2000s, the breakaway of one of its members in 2019, and is challenged by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The latter crisis exhibits, on the one hand, the need for social coherence and unified policies, and on the other, has prompted the physical closure of borders, and divergent responses by domestic political elite. One such reaction—the adopted strengthening of power for Hungary’s Prime Minister—has prompted an international outcry and re-heated the debate of the democratic backtracking of some of the new EU member-states. Analyzing the process of European Enlargement and the changing sentiments about European Integration in a number of East European countries, this symposium brings to the fore important questions about the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe. Although there is a general consensus that both the East and the West have benefited and continue to benefit from their reunion, it is nevertheless the case that the quick assimilation of liberal values has led to policies seen as threatening the liberal democracy model of the EU that we need to address in order to preserve the stability of the Union.","Rashkova, Ekaterina R.",Eur.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a series of patients scheduled for digestive endoscopy at the Hospital Santa Caterina. Salt. (Girona). METHODS: Descriptive study of a series of cases of patients scheduled for endoscopy during the month of May 2020, when endoscopic activity was resumed after the peak of the pandemic, following SCD, SEED, AEG and ESGE recommendations. We examined nasopharyngeal samples 48-72 hours before the appointment, by RT-PCR, in all patients. RNA extraction was performed using the kits: Qiagen®-adapted, BiosSprint®96-DNA-Blood-Kit (384). For amplification-detection of SARS-CoV-2, methods recommended by the WHO and the CDC were followed. RESULTS: 110 asymptomatic patients without close contact with a positive case in the previous 14 days were scheduled; 105 (96.4%) were negative and five (4.5%) were positive. Two patients developed respiratory symptoms after diagnosis (presymptomatic) and three remained asymptomatic. Allfive5 patients were autochthonous cases with no history of travel or residence in another city or country associated with high prevalence of infection. Four cases were women aged 60-81 years. The N gene was detected in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in patients scheduled for digestive endoscopy. Given the risk of transmission to professionals, we consider it advisable to perform SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR 48-72 hours before the examination in situations of high incidence in the population.","Pamplona, Javier; Solano, Rubén; Ramírez, Manel; Durandez, Rosa; Mohamed, Fatimetu; Pardo, Laura; Sàbat, Miriam",Gastroenterol. hepatol.

The experience of distance church life"" in April-June 2020 has shown that both the mediatization of Orthodoxy and the development of Orthodox segment of the internet reached a fundamentally new stage. The author examines this stage using the concept of participatory culture introduced by Henry Jenkins and the cultural studies approaches based on the categories of interactivity and immersion. The shared experience of online worship over a span of several months and the degree of participants co-presence and emotional involvement point to a new level of mediatization that entailed the production and consumption of textual, audio and video content in the course of vertical and horizontal communication. This experience also showed the active development of participatory practices, including the strengthening of interactivity of worship, the unprecedented intensity of immersion, and the prospects of substantial changes in the liturgical life driven by digitalization. © 2021 Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.

218665,Recurring Themes,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted many people's lives. This study examined changes in subjective wellbeing between December 2019 and May 2020 and how stress appraisals and coping strategies relate to individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the pandemic. Data were collected at 4 time points from 979 individuals in Germany. Results showed that, on average, life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect did not change significantly between December 2019 and March 2020 but decreased between March and May 2020. Across the latter timespan, individual differences in life satisfaction were positively related to controllability appraisals, active coping, and positive reframing, and negatively related to threat and centrality appraisals and planning. Positive affect was positively related to challenge and controllable-by-self appraisals, active coping, using emotional support, and religion, and negatively related to threat appraisal and humor. Negative affect was positively related to threat and centrality appraisals, denial, substance use, and self-blame, and negatively related to controllability appraisals and emotional support. Contrary to expectations, the effects of stress appraisals and coping strategies on changes in subjective wellbeing were small and mostly nonsignificant. These findings imply that the COVID-19 pandemic represents not only a major medical and economic crisis, but also has a psychological dimension, as it can be associated with declines in key facets of people's subjective wellbeing. Psychological practitioners should address potential declines in subjective wellbeing with their clients and attempt to enhance clients' general capability to use functional stress appraisals and effective coping strategies.

219837,Individual differences and their implications for color perception,2019,"Immune memory is a defining characteristic of adaptive immunity, but recent work has shown that the activation of innate immunity can also improve responsiveness in subsequent exposures. This has been coined ""trained immunity"" and diverges with the perception that the innate immune system is primitive, non-specific, and reacts to novel and recurrent antigen exposures similarly. The ""exposome"" is the cumulative exposures (diet, exercise, environmental exposure, vaccination, genetics, etc.) an individual has experienced and provides a mechanism for the establishment of immune training or immunotolerance. It is becoming increasingly clear that trained immunity constitutes a delicate balance between the dose, duration, and order of exposures. Upon innate stimuli, trained immunity or tolerance is shaped by epigenetic and metabolic changes that alter hematopoietic stem cell lineage commitment and responses to infection. Due to the immunomodulatory role of the exposome, understanding innate immune training is critical for understanding why some individuals exhibit protective phenotypes while closely related individuals may experience immunotolerant effects (e.g., the order of exposure can result in completely divergent immune responses). Research on the exposome and trained immunity may be leveraged to identify key factors for improving vaccination development, altering inflammatory disease development, and introducing potential new prophylactic treatments, especially for diseases such as COVID-19, which is currently a major health issue for the world. Furthermore, continued exposome research may prevent many deleterious effects caused by immunotolerance that frequently result in host morbidity or mortality.","Adams, Kevin; Weber, K Scott; Johnson, Steven M",Int. j. mol. sci.

220743,March On - Diversity in the Face of Adversity,2020,"The air transport crisis, caused by the Covid Pandemic, not only forced the limiting of air traffic operations, but also, the verification existing air traffic forecasts. This time can be used for an in-depth look at the existing procedures at the airport, namely the procedures for performing aircraft take-off operations. After the renewed increase in air traffic, the problem of proper positioning of aircraft for take-off will reappear. The capacity problem at airports will return as air traffic increases. Capacity is a parameter that determines the traffic capacity of an airport, expressed as the theoretical maximum number of air operations that the airport is able to handle per unit of time. This parameter may also result from the seasonality of air traffic both throughout the year and changes over single days or even hours. Achieving a certain capacity may require the expansion of airport infrastructure or more efficient management of airport operations. An undesirable effect of increasing air traffic are delays related to airport capacity. The existing queue of aircraft waiting for take-off operations at the runway threshold, could be due to poor management and queuing of aircraft or insufficient airport infrastructure. It is possible to eliminate the queue phenomenon, at the runway threshold, through better sequencing of aircraft push-outs. This makes it possible to determine the order of the take-off of aircraft, already at the stage of push-out. The aim of the article is to present the possibility of a more effective use of the aircraft pushback sequence, increasing the capacity of the airport maneuvering area. The proposed algorithm sequencing of aircraft to taxi in order to minimize delays associated with deviations from the flight plan, the taxiway of the stand to the runway threshold, thereby reducing emissions into the atmosphere. The algorithm is based on the A-CDM project, which unites airports to exchange information necessary to better use the capacity of these airports.","Kwasiborska, A.",Acta Polytechnica Hungarica,,77

Rickettsial infections may be first evident as an exanthem with eschars as a key finding. In contrast, eschars and necrotic lesions can be seen in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Both illnesses share a similar mechanism of infecting endothelial cells resulting in vasculopathy. Rickettsia parkeri and Rickettsia 364D are both characterized by eschars unlike Rickettsia rickettsii. Other eschar causing rickettsioses such as Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia africae, and Orientia tsutsugamushi are commonly diagnosed in people from or having traveled through endemic areas. While there is no consensus on treatment for COVID-19, rickettsioses are treatable. Due to possibly serious consequences of delayed treatment, doxycycline should be administered given an eschar-presenting patient's travel history and sufficient suspicion of vector exposure. The proliferation of COVID-19 cases has rendered it critical to differentiate between the two, both of which may have overlapping vasculopathic cutaneous findings.

The study aimed to find out the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms were among HCWs, as well as the factors related to these mental health issues. Methods We conducted an online survey of HCWs employed in Dhaka city from June 6 to July 6, 2020. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder, the depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. The related factors of anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms were identified using three regression models. Results This research included responses from 294 HCWs (mean± standard deviation age: 28.86±5.5 years;43.5% were female). Anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms were found in 20.7%, 26.5%, and 44.2% of HCWs, respectively. The variable financial difficulties was commonly found as an associated factor for anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms. Female HCWs were more prone to mental health symptoms and insomnia compared to male HCWs (Adjusted odds ratio- AOR=2.20, 95% CI=1.27 – 3.79). The depression symptoms among HCWs were found to be a factor for insomnia (AOR=6.321, 95% CI= 3.158 – 12.650). Conclusion In the current pandemic, the high prevalence of mental health symptoms among HCWs indicates that this occupational group being associated with increased mental distress. Increasing financial support for HCWs and providing support to female workers in care facilities could help to alleviate the burden of mental illness. Supportive, training, and educational strategies, particularly through knowledge and communication platforms, could be recommended to the care facilities, which can reduce the burden of mental health symptoms among HCWs.","Ali, Mohammad Uddin Zakir Ahsan Nawara Faiza Haque Muhammad Zahirul Bairagee Monisha Khan Sabbir Ahmed Hossain Ahmed",Heliyon,,77

We aimed to describe clinical and serological characteristics of children with HBoV hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infection and to evaluate whether differences occur between HBoV alone and in co-infection. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data from 60 children (median age of 6.2 months, range 0.6–70.9) hospitalized for acute respiratory symptoms, with HBoV detected from a respiratory sample, using a reverse transcriptase-PCR for 14 respiratory viruses (including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus A and B, human coronavirus OC43, 229E, NL-63 and HUK1, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus1–3, and human metapneumovirus). Results: HBoV was detected alone in 29 (48.3%) patients, while in co-infection with other viruses in 31 patients (51.7%), with a peak between December and January. Among the 60 patients, 34 were bronchiolitis, 19 wheezing, 3 pneumonia, 2 upper respiratory tract infection, and 2 whooping cough. Seven children (11.6%) required admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for respiratory failure. No differences was observed in age, family history for atopy and/or asthma, clinical presentations, chest X-ray, or laboratory findings in children with HBoV alone vs. multiple viral detection. RSV was the most frequently co-detected virus (61.3%). When compared with HBoV detection alone, the co-detection of RSV and HBoV was associated with male sex (P = 0.013), younger age (P = 0.01), and lower blood neutrophil count (P = 0.032). Conclusions: HBoV can be detected alone and in co-infection respiratory samples of children with an acute respiratory tract infection. A cause–effect relationship between HBoV and respiratory infection is not clear, so further studies are needed to clarify this point.","Petrarca, Laura; Nenna, Raffaella; Frassanito, Antonella; Pierangeli, Alessandra; Di Mattia, Greta; Scagnolari, Carolina; Midulla, Fabio",World J.

Over the past 2.8 million years, humans and tools have co-evolved. However, in the last century, technology is introduced at a rate that exceeds human evolution. The proliferation of computers and, more recently, robots, introduces new cognitive demands, as the human is required to be a monitor rather than a direct controller. The usage of robots and artificial intelligence is only expected to increase, and the present COVID-19 pandemic may prove to be catalytic in this regard. One way to improve overall system performance is to 'adapt the human to the machine' via task procedures, operator training, operator selection, a Procrustean mandate. Using classic research examples, we demonstrate that Procrustean methods can improve performance only to a limited extent. For a viable future, therefore, technology must adapt to the human, which underwrites the necessity of human factors science.

The ongoing pandemic is a global public health concern due to its sagacious impacts on environmental sustainability, social responsibility and people's quality of life. This study primarily focuses on analysing the impact of COVID-19 (COV) on the environmental awareness (EA), sustainable consumption (SC) and social responsibility (SR). Additionally, we aspire to investigate the impact of demographics of generations and religion on the proposed nexus in this study. The data was collected from 700 participants of different age groups and religious backgrounds in Malaysia, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to analyse this data and test the hypotheses. The findings indicate that COVID-19 has a significantly positive impact on EA, SC and SR, and the generations and religiosity moderate the relationship between COVID-19 and its impact on sustainable behaviours. This study contributes to analyse the difference in the perception of EA, SC and SR among the people that eventually will stimulate the scientific reasoning among the governments, policymakers and scientists to develop a holistic framework to combat unprecedented event such as COVID-19 and ensure the authentication of sustainable environment and exceptional quality of life.

It could reinforce a rising tide of nationalism and anti-immigrant sentiment, protectionist sentiment within labor-market policy debates, and a K-shaped recovery in migration patterns. © The Author(s), 2021.

228979,Enhancing COVID-19 Vaccines Acceptance: Results from a Survey on Vaccine Hesitancy in Northern Italy,2021,"Objective: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) posed an unprecedented challenge to healthcare communities worldwide. While emerging evidence suggests several neurological complications from COVID-19, it remains unclear if patients with neurological disorders are more vulnerable to COVID-19 Background: Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that dementia is possibly a risk factor for COVID-19, and we noted higher hospitalization and mortality from COVID-19 in patients with dementia/neurodegenerative disorders. Design/Methods: A matched control cohort, without a known neurological disorder, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 after January 20th, 2020, was used for comparisons. One-to-one propensity score matching was done for baseline characteristics and other comorbid conditions. 16,301/6,709,355 (0.24%) patients with neurological disorders developed COVID-19. After 1:1 propensity matching, 13,166 patients were included each in the study and the control cohort. Results: Among the subgroups, patients with previous strokes had higher ICU admission rate, patients with neuromuscular and sleep disorders had higher risk of intubation, and patients with neurodegenerative disorders (dementia) had higher risk of mortality. Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with headaches, multiple sclerosis, and movement disorders were similar to matching controls. Clinical outcome of COVID-19 varied between different neurological disorders. Patients with neuromuscular disorders can have respiratory symptoms, and about 45% of patients with sleep disorders have obstructive sleep apnea, and they were more likely to be intubated, which is consistent with previous reports. Living in nursing homes, inability to properly adhere to healthcare policies, and advanced directives with do not resuscitate order may have led to increased death in this cohort Conclusions: In this study, we could not assess the disease severity of COVID-19, and results are based on reported data. Despite limitations, this study showed that patients with some neurological conditions, particularly dementia, are possibly more vulnerable to COVID-19.","Tommee, C. G.; Onteddu, S.

The virus, which causes an acute respiratory disease in persons, spreads rapidly and is now threatening more than 150 countries around the world. One of the essential procedures that patients with COVID-19 need is an accurate and rapid screening process. In this research, utilizing the features of deep learning methods, we present a method for detecting COVID-19 and a screening model that uses pulmonary computed tomography images to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from healthy cases. In this study, 256 cases (128 COVID-19, 128 normal) are used to detect COVID-19 early. Real cases of 51 external COVID-19 images are also taken from Iraqi hospitals and used to validate the proposed method.

229956,Biomarkers of Browning in Cold Exposed Siberian Adults,2020,"BackgroundLow- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are increasingly adopting low-cost Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapid antigen tests to meet the high demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Whilst testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current gold standard, its widespread use in LMICs is limited by high costs, turnaround times and is not readily available in most places. COVID-19 antigen tests (Ag-RDT) provide a suitable alternative due to their low cost, rapid turnaround time and easy to set up and use. This study aimed to assess the field performance of the NowCheck COVID-19 antigen kit (Ag-RDT) as a point of care test (POCT) in select healthcare facilities in western Kenya. MethodsWe conducted a prospective multi-facility field evaluation study of the NowCheck COVID-19 rapid antigen test (Ag-RDT) compared to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (RT-PCR). After obtaining informed consent, trained laboratory technicians collected two pairs of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs, both antigen and RT-PCR testing, first for Ag-RDT and next for RT-PCR. We performed Ag-RDTs on-site and shared the results with both the study participants and their healthcare providers within 15-30 minutes. We carried out all RT-PCR tests in a central referral laboratory. The turnaround time for RT-PCR results was typically 24-48 hours. We captured the results of both methods using an electronic digital application. FindingsBetween December 2020 and March 2021, we enrolled 997 participants who met the Kenyan Ministry of Health COVID-19 case definition. The median age of study participants was 39 years (range one to 80 years), with 54% male. Ag-RDT had a sensitivity of 84.5% (76.0-90.8) and a specificity of 94.4% (95% CI: 92.7-95.8) with an accuracy of 94.2% (92.5-95.6) when a cycle threshold value (Ct value) of [≤]35 was used. The highest sensitivity of 87.7% (77.2-94.5) was observed in samples with Ct values [≤] 30 and the highest specificity of 97.5% (96.2-98.5) at Ct value of <40. InterpretationThe NowCheck COVID-19 Ag-RDT showed good performance in field evaluation in multiple healthcare facilities in a developing country. The sensitivity of the kit exceeded the minimum recommended cut-off of 80% as recommended by WHO1. The high specificity of this kit at 94.4% at Ct values [≤]33 and 97.5% at Ct values <40 matched that of real-time PCR, making it a good rule-out test for symptomatic patients with COVID-19-like symptoms. The faster turnaround time to results, lower cost, simple analytical steps requiring no equipment or infrastructure makes antigen testing an attractive field-screening method to meet the high demand for COVID-19 testing.

232297,Immunization funding across 28 European countries,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Five months after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Brazil, the country has the second highest number of cases in the world. Without any scientifically proven drug or vaccine available combined with COVID-19's high transmissivity, slowing down the spread of the infection is a challenge. In an attempt to save the economy, the Brazilian government is slowly beginning to allow non-essential services to reopen for in-person customers. METHODS: In this study, we analyze, based on data analysis and statistics, how other countries evolve and under which conditions they decided to resume normal activity. In addition, due to the heterogeneity of Brazil, we explore Brazilian data of COVID-19 from the State Health Secretaries to evaluate the situation of the pandemic within the states. RESULTS: Results show that while other countries have flattened their curves and present low numbers of active cases, Brazil continues to see an increase in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, a number of important states are easing restrictions despite a high percentage of confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: All analyses show that Brazil is not ready for reopening, and the premature easing of restrictions may increase the number of COVID-19-related deaths and cause the collapse of the public health system.","Neiva, Mariane Barros; Carvalho, Isabelle; Costa Filho, Etevaldo Dos Santos; Barbosa-Junior, Francisco; Bernardi, Filipe Andrade; Sanches, Tiago Lara Michelin; Oliveira, Lariza Laura de; Lima, Vinicius Costa; Miyoshi, Newton Shydeo Brandão; Alves, Domingos",Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,,77

While everyone wishes for an end to this national tragedy, the authors believe a new normal must be defined for the postpandemic period.In the postpandemic period, policies that were once labeled radical and impossible will be urgent and necessary. Examples of such policies include providing universal health care, dismantling the structures that propagate racism and injustice, and reinvesting in public health. Previous research by the authors has shown that their medical student colleagues recognize that it is their responsibility to address policies that harm patients and to support reforms at the scale the authors propose. This commitment to a better future is reflected in the widespread mobilization of medical students seen across the United States.

239201,Prelims,2021,"BACKGROUND: Contact tracing apps are an essential component of an effective COVID-19 testing strategy to counteract the spread of the pandemic and thereby avoid overburdening the health care system. As the adoption rates in several regions are undesirable, governments must increase the acceptance of COVID-19 tracing apps in these times of uncertainty. OBJECTIVE: Building on the Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT), this study aims to investigate how uncertainty reduction measures foster the adoption of COVID-19 tracing apps and how their use affects the perception of different risks. METHODS: Representative survey data were gathered at two measurement points (before and after the app's release) and analyzed by performing covariance-based structural equation modeling (n=1003). RESULTS: We found that uncertainty reduction measures in the form of the transparency dimensions disclosure and accuracy, as well as social influence and trust in government, foster the adoption process. The use of the COVID-19 tracing app in turn reduced the perceived privacy and performance risks but did not reduce social risks and health-related COVID-19 concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the mass adoption of health care technology and URT research by integrating interactive communication measures and transparency as a multidimensional concept to reduce different types of uncertainty over time. Furthermore, our results help to derive communication strategies to promote the mass adoption of COVID-19 tracing apps, thus detecting infection chains and allowing intelligent COVID-19 testing.","Oldeweme, Andreas; Märtins, Julian; Westmattelmann, Daniel; Schewe, Gerhard",J Med Internet Res,,77
241434,CON: COVID-19 will not result in increased antimicrobial resistance prevalence,2020,"A proactive approach to raise awareness while preventing misinformation is a modern-day challenge in all domains including healthcare. Such awareness and sensitization approaches to prevention and containment are important components of a strong healthcare system, especially in the times of outbreaks such as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. However, there is a fine balance between continuous awareness-raising by providing new information and the risk of misinformation. In this work, we address this gap by creating a life-long learning application that delivers authentic information to users in Hindi, the most widely used local language in India. It does this by matching sources of verified and authentic information such as the WHO reports against daily news by using machine learning and natural language processing. It delivers the narrated content in Hindi by using state-of-the-art text to speech engines. Finally, the approach allows user input for continuous improvement of news feed relevance on a daily basis. We demonstrate a focused application of this approach for Water, Sanitation, Hygiene as it is critical in the containment of the currently raging Covid-19 pandemic through the WashKaro android application. Thirteen combinations of pre-processing strategies, word-embeddings, and similarity metrics were evaluated by eight human users via calculation of agreement statistics. The best performing combination achieved a Cohen's Kappa of 0.54 and was deployed in the WashKaro application back-end. Interventional studies for evaluating the effectiveness of the WashKaro application for preventing WASH-related diseases are planned to be carried out in the Mohalla clinics that provided 3.5 Million consults in 2019 in Delhi, India. Additionally, the application also features human-curated and vetted information to reach out to the community as audio-visual content in local languages.","Pandey, Rohan; Gautam, Vaibhav; Bhagat, Kanav; Sethi, Tavpritesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07074v1.pdf,77
241779,Beyond kinetic harm and towards a dynamic conceptualization of cyberterrorism,2020-12-16,"Due to the spread of COVID 2019, the Italian government imposed a lockdown on the national territory. Initially, citizens were required to stay at home and not to mix with others outside of their household (Phase 1); eventually, some of these restrictions were lifted (Phase 2). To investigate the impact of lockdown on emotional and binge eating, an online survey was conducted to compare measures of self-reported physical (BMI), psychological (Alexithymia), affective (anxiety, stress, and depression) and social (income, workload) state during Phase 1 and Phase 2. Data from 365 Italian residents showed that increased emotional eating was predicted by higher depression, anxiety, quality of personal relationships, and quality of life, while the increase of bingeing was predicted by higher stress. Moreover, we showed that higher alexithymia scores were associated by increased emotional eating and higher BMI scores were associated with both increased emotional eating and binge eating. Finally, we found that from Phase 1 to Phase 2 binge and emotional eating decreased. These data provide evidence of the negative effects of isolation and lockdown on emotional wellbeing, and, relatedly, on eating behaviour.","Cecchetto, Cinzia; Aiello, Marilena; Gentili, Claudio; Ionta, Silvio; Osimo, Sofia Adelaide",Appetite,,77

However, there are still no effective drugs to treat lung injury and fibrosis. In this study, we report the generation of clinical-grade human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived immunity- and matrix-regulatory cells (IMRCs) produced under good manufacturing practice requirements, that can treat lung injury and fibrosis in vivo. We generate IMRCs by sequentially differentiating hESCs with serum-free reagents. IMRCs possess a unique gene expression profile distinct from that of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), such as higher expression levels of proliferative, immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic genes. Moreover, intravenous delivery of IMRCs inhibits both pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mouse models of lung injury, and significantly improves the survival rate of the recipient mice in a dose-dependent manner, likely through paracrine regulatory mechanisms. IMRCs are superior to both primary UCMSCs and the FDA-approved drug pirfenidone, with an excellent efficacy and safety profile in mice and monkeys. In light of public health crises involving pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, our findings suggest that IMRCs are ready for clinical trials on lung disorders.","Wu, Jun; Song, Dingyun; Li, Zhongwen; Guo, Baojie; Xiao, Yani; Liu, Wenjing; Liang, Lingmin; Feng, Chunjing; Gao, Tingting; Chen, Yanxia; Li, Ying; Wang, Zai; Wen, Jianyan; Yang, Shengnan; Liu, Peipei; Wang, Lei; Wang, Yukai; Peng, Liang; Stacey, Glyn Nigel; Hu, Zheng; Feng, Guihai; Li, Wei; Huo, Yan; Jin, Ronghua; Shyh-Chang, Ng; Zhou, Qi; Wang, Liu; Hu, Baoyang; Dai, Huaping; Hao, Jie",Cell Res,,77

Following study selection, study characteristics and effect measures were tabulated, and data were synthesized by using vote counting. Meta-analysis was not possible because of high variation in risk factors, outcomes and effect measures. Risk of bias of each study was assessed and the certainty of evidence was appraised according to the GRADE methodology. RESULTS: Out of 2605 references, 33 observational studies were selected and the identified risk and protective factors were categorized in ten thematic categories. Most of these studies (n = 23) were performed during the SARS outbreak, seven during the current COVID-19 pandemic and three during the MERS outbreak. The level of disease exposure and health fear were significantly associated with worse mental health outcomes. There was evidence that clear communication and support from the organization, social support and personal sense of control are protective factors. The evidence was of very low certainty, because of risk of bias and imprecision. CONCLUSION: Safeguarding mental health of health care workers during infectious disease outbreaks should not be treated as a separate mental health intervention strategy, but could benefit from a protective approach. This study suggests that embedding mental health support in a safe and efficient working environment which promotes collegial social support and personal sense of control could help to maximize resilience of health care workers. Low quality cross-sectional studies currently provide the best possible evidence, and further research is warranted to confirm causality.","De Brier, Niels; Stroobants, Stijn; Vandekerckhove, Philippe; De Buck, Emmy",PLoS One,,77

METHODS: We conducted an observational study from 28 June to 11 August 2020, enrolling patients admitted to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh, with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST-segment elevation MI who did not meet WHO criteria for suspected COVID-19. Samples were collected by nasopharyngeal swab to test for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. We followed up patients at 3 months (13 weeks) postadmission to record adverse cardiovascular outcomes: all-cause death, new MI, heart failure and new percutaneous coronary intervention or stent thrombosis. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: We enrolled 280 patients with MI, 79% male, mean age 54.5±11.8 years, 140 of whom were diagnosed with STEMI. We found 36 (13%) to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 1 with influenza. There was no significant difference between mortality rate observed among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients compared with non-infected (5 (14%) vs 26 (11%); p=0.564). A numerically shorter median time to a recurrent cardiovascular event was recorded among SARS-CoV-2 infected compared with non-infected patients (21 days, IQR: 8-46 vs 27 days, IQR: 7-44; p=0.378). CONCLUSION: We found a substantial rate of occult SARS-CoV-2 infection in the studied cohort, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may precipitate MI. Asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 admitted with MI may contribute to disease transmission and warrants widespread testing of hospital admissions.","Akhtar, Zubair; Chowdhury, Fahmida; Aleem, Mohammad Abdul; Ghosh, Probir Kumar; Rahman, Mahmudur; Rahman, Mustafizur; Hossain, Mohammad Enayet; Sumiya, Mariya Kibtiya; Islam, A K M Monwarul; Uddin, Mir Jamal; MacIntyre, C Raina; Cajander, Sara; Frobert, Ole",,,77

247883,Chinese Novel Coronavirus outbreak makes its way to United States,2020,"First recognized in December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. To date, the most utilized definition of 'most at risk' for COVID19 morbidity and mortality has focused on biological susceptibility to the virus. This paper argues that this dominant biomedical definition has neglected the 'fundamental social causes' of disease, constraining the effectiveness of prevention and mitigation measures; and exacerbating COVID19 morbidity and mortality for population groups living in marginalizing circumstances. It is clear - even at this early stage of the pandemic - that inequitable social conditions lead to both more infections and worse outcomes. Expanding the definition of 'most at risk' to include social factors is critical to implementing equitable interventions and saving lives. Prioritizing populations with social conditions is necessary for more effective control of the epidemic in its next phase; and should become standard in the planning for, and prevention and mitigation of all health conditions. Reversing disparities and health inequities is only possible through an expansion of our 'most-at-risk' definition to also include social factors.","Afifi, Rima A; Novak, Nicole; Gilbert, Paul A; Pauly, Bernadette; Abdulrahim, Sawsan; Rashid, Sabina Faiz; Ortega, Fernando; Ferrand, Rashida A",Prev Med,,77
248235,Virtual Music Therapy: Developing New Approaches to Service Delivery,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the public's perception of telemedicine surgical consultations, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: With rapid expansion and uptake of telemedicine during the pandemic, many have posited that virtual visits will endure even as in-person visits are reinstated. The public's perception of telemedicine for an initial surgical consultation has not been previously studied. METHODS: A 43-question survey assessed respondents' attitudes toward telemedicine for initial consultations with surgeons, both in the context of COVID-19 and during ""normal circumstances."" Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowd-sourcing marketplace. RESULTS: Based on 1827 analyzable responses, we found that a majority (86%) of respondents reported being satisfied (either extremely or somewhat) with telemedicine encounters. Interestingly, preference for in-person versus virtual surgical consultation reflected access to care, with preference for telemedicine decreasing from 72% to 33% when COVID-related social distancing ends. Preferences for virtual visits decreased with increasing complexity of the surgical intervention, even during the pandemic. A majority felt that ""establishing trust and comfort"" was best accomplished in person, and the vast majority felt it was important to meet their surgeons prior to the day of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The public views telemedicine as an acceptable substitute for in-person visits, especially during the pandemic. However, it appears that an in-person interaction is still preferred when possible for surgical consultations. If telemedicine services are to persist beyond social distancing, further exploration of its impact on the patient-surgeon relationship will be needed.","Sorensen, Meredith J; Bessen, Sarah; Danford, Julia; Fleischer, Christina; Wong, Sandra L",Ann. surg,,77

In fact, an interplay between PD and epilepsy has been of interest for many years. An emerging hypothesis is that inflammation could link both diseases. OBJECTIVE: Considering Bearing in mind the experience of our group in the field of Ca2+/cAMP signalling pathways, this article discussed, beyond inflammation, the role of these signalling pathways in theis link between PD and epilepsy. METHODS: Publications involving Ca2+/cAMPsignalling pathways, PD, and epilepsy (alone or combined) were collected by searching PubMed and EMBASE. RESULTS: The comprehension of the interplay between PD and epilepsy could improve the drug therapy. In addition, a Ca2+signallingsignaling dyshomeostasis due to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an emerging and rapidly evolving situation, has been reported. CONCLUSION: Thus, this article also discussed debated recent findings about of therapeutics involving Ca2+ channel blockers for preventing Ca2+signallingsignaling dyshomeostasis due to COVID-19, including the correlation among COVID-19, epilepsy, and PD.","Bergantin, Leandro Bueno",Current neurovascular research (Online),,77

250702,Plant-based vaccines and antibodies to combat COVID-19: current status and prospects,2020,"An expanded myeloid cell compartment is a hallmark of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, data regarding myeloid cell expansion have been collected in Europe, where the mortality rate by COVID-19 is greater than those in other regions including Japan. Thus, characteristics of COVID-19-induced myeloid cell subsets remain largely unknown in the regions with low mortality rates. Here, we analyzed cellular dynamics of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) subsets and examined whether any of them correlate with disease severity and prognosis, using blood samples from Japanese COVID-19 patients. We observed that polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs, but not other MDSC subsets, transiently expanded in severe cases but not in mild or moderate cases. Contrary to previous studies in Europe, this subset selectively expanded in survivors of severe cases and subsided before discharge, but such transient expansion was not observed in non-survivors in Japanese cohort. Analysis of plasma cytokine/chemokine levels revealed positive correlation of PMN-MDSC frequencies with interleukin 8 (IL-8) levels prior to the cell expansion, indicating the involvement of IL-8 on recruitment of PMN-MDSCs to peripheral blood following the onset of severe COVID-19. Thus, our data indicates that transient expansion of the PMN-MDSC subset results in improved clinical outcome. Thus, this myeloid cell subset may be a predictor of prognosis in cases of severe COVID-19 in Japan.","Takano, Tomohiro; Matsumura, Takayuki; Adachi, Yu; Terahara, Kazutaka; Moriyama, Saya; Onodera, Taishi; Nishiyama, Ayae; Kawana-Tachikawa, Ai; Miki, Shoji; Hosoya-Nakayama, Kaori; Nakamura-Hoshi, Midori; Seki, Sayuri; Tachikawa, Natsuo; Yoshimura, Yukihiro; Miyata, Nobuyuki; Horiuchi, Hiroshi; Sasaki, Hiroaki; Miyazaki, Kazuhito; Kinoshita, Noriko; Sudo, Tsutomu; Akiyama, Yutaro; Sato, Rubuna; Suzuki, Tadaki; Matano, Tetsuro; Takahashi, Yoshimasa",Int. immunol,,77

However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of transcriptional bursting kinetics (burst size and frequency) in mammalian cells remains elusive. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the intrinsic noise and mRNA levels for elucidating the transcriptional bursting kinetics in mouse embryonic stem cells. Informatics analyses and functional assays revealed that transcriptional bursting kinetics was regulated by a combination of promoter- and gene body-binding proteins, including the polycomb repressive complex 2 and transcription elongation factors. Furthermore, large-scale CRISPR-Cas9-based screening identified that the Akt/MAPK signaling pathway regulated bursting kinetics by modulating transcription elongation efficiency. These results uncovered the key molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional bursting and cell-to-cell gene expression noise in mammalian cells.","Ochiai, Hiroshi; Hayashi, Tetsutaro; Umeda, Mana; Yoshimura, Mika; Harada, Akihito; Shimizu, Yukiko; Nakano, Kenta; Saitoh, Noriko; Liu, Zhe; Yamamoto, Takashi; Okamura, Tadashi; Ohkawa, Yasuyuki; Kimura, Hiroshi; Nikaido, Itoshi",Sci.

Health and safety protection via working time regulations based on ergonomics evidence obviously is not a prominent approach in the FRG.Practical Relevance: A reorientation towards health and safety approaches taking ergonomics evidence into due account is required in the FRG.","Nachreiner, Friedhelm",Z Arbeitswiss,,77

260552,Correction to Lancet Neurol 2021; 20: 437-47,2021,"The reports suggesting a beneficial effect of nicotine on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity may encourage smoking. We aimed to analyze tweets on COVID-19 and smoking coming from casual Twitter users and Twitter accounts representing the tobacco industry. We collected tweets on COVID-19 and smoking from January 1 to May 1, 2020, using Twitter application programming interface. We analyzed sentiment, likes, or retweet to followers ratios, and the posts coming from the casual users to find pieces of news that could affect the discourse. Tweets coming from industry were analyzed manually. We analyzed n = 33,890 tweets on COVID-19 and smoking. The sentiment of tweets was negative, hitting a nadir in mid-March, but became less negative in April when preprints suggesting benefits from smoking on COVID-19 were released. Similar trends were observed for the ratios of likes or retweets to followers. We found 58 messages from the tobacco industry concerning COVID-19. Twenty-two (37.9 percent) mentioned the efforts of tobacco companies to support the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Two tweets included Food and Drug Administration statements that there is no evidence that vaping increases the risk of COVID-19. The occurrence of preprints suggesting benefits of smoking in COVID-19 might increase sentiment and reactions to tweets on tobacco products and the virus. The authors of potentially controversial articles should restrain from the promotion of their results before the completion of the peer-review process. Twitter presents a convenient tool to monitor e-discourse during a health crisis. The research community should monitor the tobacco industry's social media.","Kaminski, Mikolaj; Muth, Agnieszka; Bogdanski, Pawel",Cyberpsychology behav. soc. netw. (Print),,77

262558,Statistical analysis and characteristics of hospital medical waste under novel Coronavirus outbreak,2020,"AIMS: Our objective was to determine the ventricular arrhythmia burden in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) patients during COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicentre, observational, cohort study over a 100-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA, we assessed ventricular arrhythmias in ICD patients from 20 centres in 13 states, via remote monitoring. Comparison was via a 100-day control period (late 2019) and seasonal control period (early 2019). The primary outcome was the impact of COVID-19 on ventricular arrhythmia burden. The secondary outcome was correlation with COVID-19 incidence. During the COVID-19 period, 5963 ICD patients underwent remote monitoring, with 16 942 episodes of treated ventricular arrhythmias (2.8 events per 100 patient-days). Ventricular arrhythmia burden progressively declined during COVID-19 (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with ventricular arrhythmias amongst the high COVID-19 incidence states was significantly reduced compared with those in low incidence states [odds ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.69, P < 0.001]. Comparing patients remotely monitored during both COVID-19 and control periods (n = 2458), significantly fewer ventricular arrhythmias occurred during COVID-19 [incident rate ratio (IRR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.58-0.79, P < 0.001]. This difference persisted when comparing the 1719 patients monitored during both the COVID-19 and seasonal control periods (IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56-0.85, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, there was a 32% reduction in ventricular arrhythmias needing device therapies, coinciding with measures of social isolation. There was a 39% reduction in the proportion of patients with ventricular arrhythmias in states with higher COVID-19 incidence. These findings highlight the potential role of real-life stressors in ventricular arrhythmia burden in individuals with ICDs.

263909,Quantitative anatomy mimicking slice phantoms,2021,"Background: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is infrequent in children and shows a mortality rate of around 0.08%. This study aims to explore international differences in the pediatric mortality rate. Methods: We analyzed several countries with populations over 5 million that report disaggregated data of COVID-19 deaths by quinquennial or decennial age groups. Data were extracted from COVID-19 cases and deaths by age database, National Ministeries of Health, and the World Health Organization. Results: We included 23 countries in the analysis. Pediatric mortality varied from 0 to 12.1 deaths per million children of the corresponding age group, with the highest rate in Peru. In most countries, deaths were more frequent in the 0-4-year-old age group, except for Brazil. The pediatric/general COVID-19 mortality showed a great variation and ranged from 0% (Republic of Korea) to 10.4% (India). Pediatric and pediatric/general COVID mortality correlates strongly with 2018 neonatal mortality (r = 0.77, p < 0.001; and r = 0.88, p < 0.001, respectively), while shows a moderate or no correlation (r = 0.47, p = 0.02; and r = 0.19, p = 0.38, respectively) with COVID-19 mortality in the general population. Conclusions: International heterogeneity in pediatric COVID-19 mortality importantly parallels historical neonatal mortality. Neonatal mortality is a well-known index of the quality of a country's health system, which points to the importance of social determinants of health in pediatric COVID-19 mortality disparities. This issue should be further explored.","González-García, Nadia; Miranda-Lora, América L; Garduño-Espinosa, Juan; Granados-Riverón, Javier T; Méndez-Galván, Jorge F; Nieto-Zermeño, Jaime; Castilla-Peón, Ma Fernanda",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,77

265422,Hope-We Are Seeing a Light at the End of the Tunnel,2021,"BACKGROUND: In the wake of the adverse situation we are currently facing globally due to the coronavirus pandemic outbreak, it is normal to feel stressed, confused, and scared but what is abnormal is to turn this to panic. Phobias are more pronounced than fears. They develop when a person has an exaggerated or unrealistic sense of danger that may be evolved to experience panic attacks. AIM: Our objective was to identify the prevalence of most common phobias as well as panic disorder (PD) due to the coronavirus pandemic among Egyptian primary schoolchildren and their determinants. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2015 schoolchildren from 3 to 6 grades in three governorates of Egypt. Seven types of phobias were investigated: Agoraphobia, phobias from darkness, animal, untreatable illness (mainly coronavirus), insects, height, and social phobia. The child’s self-reported PD symptoms were assessed using DSM-IV with psychiatric diagnoses. RESULTS: Almost two-thirds of the surveyed primary schoolchildren have phobias of the low score (&lt;9) versus one-third who had high phobias score (61.% vs. 35%, respectively) with highly significant difference (p &lt; 0.001). The most prevalent phobias were from heights (66.5%) followed by darkness (60.0%). The important predictors of phobias were: Being a male child, living in an urban area, and studying at governmental school at fifth or sixth-grade residence. The prevalence of PD due to the corona epidemic is very high, it is reported by almost half of the surveyed primary schoolchildren. Fear of losing any of their family members, especially grandparents, was reported to be the highest PD symptom (97%). CONCLUSION: Phobia from heights and darkness was the most common. The prevalence of PD due to the coronavirus epidemic is reported to be very high. Calming down children who might be experienced with a phobia that is triggering their PD is recommended.","Metwally, A.

265526,Outcomes following emergency colorectal cancer presentation in the elderly,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Accurate measurement of compliance with COVID-19 guidance is important for public health policy and communications. Responses to surveys, however, are susceptible to psychological biases, including framing effects and social desirability. Our aim was to measure the effects of these biases on estimates of compliance with public health guidance (eg, hand-washing, social distancing). DESIGN: We conducted two online experiments (n=1800) and varied whether questions were framed positively or negatively (eg, 'I always wash my hands ' vs 'I don't always wash my hands '). We also varied the degree to which anonymity was assured, via a 'list' experiment. RESULTS: Reported compliance, despite being generally high, was reduced by negatively framing questions and increasing anonymity using a list experiment technique. Effect sizes were large: compliance estimates diminished by up to 17% points and 10% points, respectively. CONCLUSION: Estimates of compliance with COVID-19 guidance vary substantially with how the question is asked. Standard tracking surveys tend to pose questions in ways that lead to higher estimates than alternative approaches. Experimental tests of these surveys offer public health officials greater insight into the range of likely compliance estimates to better inform policy and communications.","Timmons, Shane; McGinnity, Frances; Belton, Cameron; Barjaková, Martina; Lunn, Peter",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,77
266237,Tribute to health workers in China: A group of respectable population during the outbreak of the COVID-19,2020,"Although several pharmacological agents are under investigation to be repurposed as therapeutic against COVID-19, not much success has been achieved yet. So, the search for an effective and active option for the treatment of COVID-19 is still a big challenge. The Spike protein (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and Main protease (Mpro) are considered to be the primary therapeutic drug target for COVID-19. In this study we have screened the drugbank compound library against the Main Protease. But our search was not limited to just Mpro. Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2, have also acquired unique mutations. These mutations within the active site of these target proteins may be an important factor hindering effective drug candidate development. In the present study we identified important active site mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Y54C, N142S, T190I and A191V). Further the drugbank database was computationally screened against Mpro and the selected mutants. Finally, we came up with the common molecules effective against the wild type (WT) and all the selected Mpro. The study found Imiglitazar, was found to be the most active compound against the wild type of Mpro. While PF-03715455 (Y54C), Salvianolic acid A (N142S and T190I), and Montelukast (A191V) were found to be most active against the other selected mutants. It was also found that some other compounds such as Acteoside, 4-Amino-N- {4-[2-(2,6-Dimethyl-Phenoxy)-Acetylamino]-3-Hydroxy-1-Isobutyl-5-Phenyl-Pentyl}-Benzamide, PF-00610355, 4-Amino-N-4-[2-(2,6-Dimethyl-Phenoxy)-Acetylamino]-3-Hydroxy-1-Isobutyl-5-Phenyl-Pentyl}-Benzamide and Atorvastatin were showing high efficacy against the WT as well as other selected mutants. We believe that these molecules will provide a better and effective option for the treatment of COVID-19 clinical manifestations.","Sharma, T.; Abohashrh, M.; Baig, M. H.; Dong, J. J.; Alam, M.

In response to the state of emergency imposed by COVID-19, Jordanian universities switched to the online learning model as an alternative to traditional face-to-face education. The researchers designed a questionnaire that consists of two main sections; the first section included demographic information including gender, level/year, age, and cumulative average (GPA). The second section comprised five main constructs: (1) use of digital tools (mobile phone, laptop, i-pad) before and after COVID-19, (2) sleeping habits before and after COVID-19, (3) social interaction, (4) psychological state, and (5) academic performance. The researchers contacted different instructors teaching compulsory courses at four public and private universities and asked them to distribute the electronic questionnaire. Using the snowball sampling method, the questionnaire was delivered to students studying at the selected universities, and a total of 775 responses were received. The data were analyzed according to Likert's five-point scale, where frequencies and percentages were calculated. The data will be useful for researchers interested in studying the relationship between the e-learning model and psychosomatic disorders.

The usefulness of extenuative actions is extremely reliant on society's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward pandemic control. Objective: This study aimed to explore the awareness, attitudes, and practices of the general Pakistani population to COVID-19. Methods: From June 13, 2020, until June 30, 2020, a cross-sectional online KAP survey was conducted among the Pakistani public. For data collection, a validated self-administered questionnaire was used. The survey instrument consisted of six demographic characteristics, 14 items on knowledge, four on attitudes, and six items on practices, modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Results: The present study included 2,307 participants, 58.3% males and 41.7% of females. The majority (86.7%) sought information from social media (SM) and television, 95% had good practices, 89.9% had positive attitudes, and two-thirds (67.4%) of the respondents had adequate knowledge. The students and people from younger age groups had more positive attitudes compared with others. Highly educated w with other groups (p < 0.001). In logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio indicated that the private job was negatively associated, and high monthly income was positively associated with adequate knowledge (OR = 0.595). Old age was the predictor of negative attitude, and high school degrees and master's degrees were associated with good practice scores. Conclusion: The Pakistani general population has an overall positive attitude and proactive practices against COVID-19, but their knowledge is inadequate. The most important source of information was SM, followed by television. These are playing a crucial role in educating the Pakistani public.","Rehman, Rehana; Jawed, Shireen; Ali, Rabiya; Noreen, Khola; Baig, Mukhtiar; Baig, Javaria",Front Public Health,,77

Here, we describe the necessary precautions in the form of clinical questions and answers (Q&A) regarding the safe deployment of gastrointestinal endoscopy in such situations while protecting endoscopy staff and patients from infection. Non-urgent endoscopy should be postponed. The risk of infection in patients should be evaluated in advance by questionnaire and body temperature. The health of staff must be checked every day. Decisions to employ endoscopy should be based on the institutional conditions and aims of endoscopy. All endoscopic staff need to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). The endoscope and other devices should be cleaned and disinfected after procedures in accordance with the relevant guidelines. Optimal management of the endoscopy unit is required. Endoscopy for infected patients or those with suspected infection demands exceptional caution. When a patient who undergoes endoscopy is later found to have COVID-19, the members of staff involved are considered exposed to the virus and must not work for at least 14 days if their PPE is considered insufficient. When PPE resources are limited, some equipment may be used continuously throughout a shift as long as it is not contaminated.

274535,The 8th Symposium on Global Cancer Research: Recognizing Creativity and Collaboration to Support Global Cancer Research and Control,2020,"Laparoscopy is a procedure that ultimately reduces hospital stay time and speeds up post-operative recovery. It is mainly performed in high-income countries but its implementation in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is increasing. However, no aggregate data exist regarding the outcomes of this procedure in resource-limited settings. We retrospectively reviewed all cases of laparoscopy recorded from January 2007 to March 2017 at the Department of Surgery of Beira to assess the related outcomes. Moreover, we performed a systematic review of the laparoscopic practices and outcomes in low-income countries. Data from the Department of Surgery of Beira identified 363 laparoscopic procedures, mainly relating to gynecological diseases, cholelithiasis, and appendicectomy with only a 1.6% complication rate (6 cases) and a 1.9% conversion rate (7 cases) to open surgery. The systematic review showed a pooled risk of overall complications significantly lower in laparoscopic vs. open appendicectomy (OR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.19-0.97; I2 = 85.7%) and a significantly lower risk of infection (OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.43-0.65; I2 = 0.00%). The pooled SMD in operation duration in laparoscopic vs. open appendectomy was 0.58 (95% CI -0.00; 1.15; I2 = 96.52), while the pooled SMD in hospitalization days was -1.35 (95% CI -1.87; -0.82; I2 = 96.41). Laparoscopy is an expensive procedure to adopt as it requires new equipment and specialized trained health workers. However, it could reduce post-operative costs and complications, especially in terms of infections. It is crucial to increase its accessibility, acceptability, and quality particularly in LMICs, especially during this COVID-19 era when the reduction of patient hospitalization is essential.","Pizzol, Damiano; Trott, Mike; Grabovac, Igor; Antunes, Mario; Colangelo, Anna Claudia; Ippoliti, Simona; Ilie, Cristian Petre; Carrie, Anne; Veronese, Nicola; Smith, Lee",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,77

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 created an increased demand for isolation beds and nursing workforce globally. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of bed capacity, bed occupancy and nursing workforce data from the isolation units of a tertiary hospital in Singapore from 23 January 2020 to 31 May 2020. R v4.0.1 and Tidyverse 1.3.0 library were used for data cleaning and plotly 4.9.2.1 library for data visualization. RESULTS: In January to March 2020, isolation bed capacity was low (=<203 beds). A sharp increase in bed capacity was seen from 195 to 487 beds during 25 March to 29 April 2020, after which it plateaued. Bed occupancy remained lower than bed capacity throughout January to May 2020. After 16 April 2020, we experienced a shortage of 1.1 to 70.2 nurses in isolation wards. Due to low occupancy rates, nurse:patient ratio remained acceptable (minimum nurse:patient ratio = 0.26). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 caused drastic changes in isolation bed capacity and nursing workforce requirements. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Building a model to predict nursing workforce requirements during pandemic surges may be helpful for planning and adequate staffing.","Fan, Esther Monica Peijin; Nguyen, Ngoc Hoang Long; Ang, Shin Yuh; Aloweni, Fazila; Goh, Hui Qi Ivy; Quek, Li Ting; Ayre, Tracy Carol; Pourghaderi, Ahmad Reza; Lam, Shao Wei; Ong, Eng Hock Marcus",J. nurs. manag,,77
279064,Letter to editor,2021,"Policy-makers require data-driven tools to assess the spread of COVID-19 and inform the public of their risk of infection on an ongoing basis. We propose a rigorous hybrid model-and-data-driven approach to risk scoring based on a time-varying SIR epidemic model that ultimately yields a simplified color-coded risk level for each community. The risk score $\Gamma_t$ that we propose is proportional to the probability of someone currently healthy getting infected in the next 24 hours. We show how this risk score can be estimated using another useful metric of infection spread, $R_t$, the time-varying average reproduction number which indicates the average number of individuals an infected person would infect in turn. The proposed approach also allows for quantification of uncertainty in the estimates of $R_t$ and $\Gamma_t$ in the form of confidence intervals. Code and data from our effort have been open-sourced and are being applied to assess and communicate the risk of infection in the City and County of Los Angeles.","Kiamari, Mehrdad; Ramachandran, Gowri; Nguyen, Quynh; Pereira, Eva; Holm, Jeanne; Krishnamachari, Bhaskar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08140v1.pdf,77
279066,A review on various aspect of COVID-19,2020,"During New Zealand's first outbreak in early 2020 the Southern Region had the highest per capita SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was initially limited by a narrow case definition and limited laboratory capacity, and cases may have been missed. Our objectives were to evaluate the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid assay, alongside spike-based assays, and to determine the frequency of antibodies among PCR-confirmed and probable cases, and higher risk individuals in the Southern Region of New Zealand. Pre-pandemic sera (n=300) were used to establish assay specificity and sera from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (n=78) to establish sensitivity. For prevalence analysis, all samples (n=1214) were tested on the Abbott assay, and all PCR-confirmed cases (n=78), probable cases (n=9), and higher risk individuals with 'grey-zone' (n=14) or positive results (n=11) were tested on four additional SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. The median time from infection onset to serum collection for PCR-confirmed cases was 14 weeks (range 11-17 weeks). The Abbott assay demonstrated a specificity of 99.7% (95% CI 98.2-99.99%) and a sensitivity of 76.9% (95% CI 66.0-85.7%). Spike-based assays demonstrated superior sensitivity ranging 89.7-94.9%. Nine previously undiagnosed sero-positive individuals were identified, and all had epidemiological risk factors. Spike-based assays demonstrated higher sensitivity than the Abbott IgG assay, likely due to temporal differences in antibody persistence. No unexpected SARS-CoV-2 infections were found in the Southern Region of New Zealand, supporting the elimination status of the country at the time this study was conducted.","Craigie, Alyson; McGregor, Reuben; Whitcombe, Alana L; Carlton, Lauren; Harte, David; Sutherland, Michelle; Parry, Matthew; Smit, Erasmus; McAuliffe, Gary; Ussher, James; Moreland, Nicole J; Jack, Susan; Upton, Arlo",Pathology,,77

The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors for subsequent SLE development in childhood ITP. METHODS: The medical records of childhood ITP patients aged under 15 years in a major tertiary care center in Southern Thailand were retrospectively reviewed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative probability of subsequent SLE development after ITP. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for SLE development. RESULTS: A total of 473 childhood ITP cases were included in the study. During a mean follow-up time of 6.1 ± 6.7 years, the prevalence of subsequent SLE development was 2.96%. Older age at ITP diagnosis (odds ratio [OR]: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.07-1.45) and chronic ITP (OR: 24.67, 95% CI: 3.14-100.0) were independent risk factors. The cumulative probabilities of subsequently developing SLE at 5 and 10 years after diagnosis of ITP were 3.8% (95% CI: 1.4-6.2) and 6.5% (95% CI: 2.9-9.8), respectively. CONCLUSION: Older age at ITP diagnosis and chronic ITP were risk factors for subsequent SLE developed in childhood ITP.","Kittivisuit, Sirinthip; Vachvanichsanong, Prayong; McNeil, Edward; Chotsampancharoen, Thirachit",Pediatr Blood Cancer,,77
279210,Progress in research on the S protein as the target of COVID-19 vaccines,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), started in 2019 in China and quickly spread into a global pandemic. Nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is highly conserved and the most abundant protein in coronaviruses and thus a potential target for both vaccine and point-of-care diagnostics. N Protein has been suggested in the literature as having post-translational modifications (PTMs), and accurately defining these PTMs is critical for its potential use in medicine. Reports of phosphorylation of N protein have failed to provide detailed site-specific information. We have performed comprehensive glycomics, glycoproteomics and proteomics experiments on two different N protein preparations. Both were expressed in HEK293 cells, one was in-house expressed and purified without a signal peptide sequence and the other was commercially produced with a signal peptide channeling it through the secretory pathway. Our results show completely different PTMs on the two N protein preparations. The commercial product contained extensive N- and O-linked glycosylation, as well as O-phosphorylation on site Thr393. Conversely, the native N Protein model had O-phosphorylation at Ser176 and no glycosylation, highlighting the importance of knowing the provenance of any commercial protein to be used for scientific or clinical studies. Recent studies have indicated that N protein can serve as an important diagnostic marker for coronavirus disease and as a major immunogen by priming protective immune responses. Thus, detailed structural characterization of N protein may provide useful insights for understanding the roles of PTMs on viral pathogenesis, vaccine design and development point-of-care diagnostics.","Supekar, Nitin T; Shajahan, Asif; Gleinich, Anne S; Rouhani, Daniel S; Heiss, Christian; Chapla, Digantkumar Gopaldas; Moremen, Kelley W; Azadi, Parastoo",Glycobiology,,77

METHODS: A retrospective study of COVID-19 patients at the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were conducted, with serial assessments including lung volumes (TLC), spirometry (FVC, FEV1), lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO),respiratory muscle strength, 6-min walking distance (6MWD) and high resolution CT being collected at 30 days after discharged. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients completed the serial assessments. There were 40 non-severe cases and 17 severe cases. Thirty-one patients (54.3%) had abnormal CT findings. Abnormalities were detected in the pulmonary function tests in 43 (75.4%) of the patients. Six (10.5%), 5(8.7%), 25(43.8%) 7(12.3%), and 30 (52.6%) patients had FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, TLC, and DLCO values less than 80% of predicted values, respectively. 28 (49.1%) and 13 (22.8%) patients had PImax and PEmax values less than 80% of the corresponding predicted values. Compared with non-severe cases, severe patients showed higher incidence of DLCO impairment (75.6%vs42.5%, p = 0.019), higher lung total severity score (TSS) and R20, and significantly lower percentage of predicted TLC and 6MWD. No significant correlation between TSS and pulmonary function parameters was found during follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: Impaired diffusing-capacity, lower respiratory muscle strength, and lung imaging abnormalities were detected in more than half of the COVID-19 patients in early convalescence phase.

This study aimed to measure the level of mental health of the Malaysian public approximately 2 months after the pandemic's onset. Between 12 May and 5 September 2020, an anonymous online survey was conducted. The target group included all members of the Malaysian population aged 18 years and above. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to assess mental health. There were increased depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms throughout the study period, with the depression rates showing the greatest increase. During the end of the data collection period (4 August-5 September 2020), there were high percentages of reported depressive (59.2%) and anxiety (55.1%) symptoms compared with stress (30.6%) symptoms. Perceived health status was the strongest significant predictor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Individuals with a poorer health perception had higher odds of developing depression (odds ratio [OR] = 5.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.81-8.47) and anxiety (OR = 3.50; 95%CI 2.37-5.17) compared with those with a higher health perception.

286973,Towards Wearable and Implantable Continuous Drug Monitoring: A Review,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Recently, an additional trigeminothalamic tract - the dorsal trigeminothalamic tract - has been described in human brainstems by our group next to the known ventral trigeminothalamic tract. As various elements of the trigeminal system are known to be organised in a somatotopic fashion, the question arose whether the fibres within the trigeminal root show specific distributions patterns in their contribution to the ventral trigeminothalamic tract and dorsal trigeminothalamic tract specifically. METHODS: This study investigated the arrangement of the fibres in the trigeminal root by combining various imaging methods in the pons of 11 post-mortem specimens. The pons were investigated by polarised light imaging (PLI) (n = 4; to quantify fibre orientation; 100 µm interslice distance), histochemical staining methods (n = 3; to visualise the internal myeloarchitecture; 60 µm) and ultra-high field, post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n = 4; for tractography; 500 µm interslice distance). RESULTS: This study shows that the fibres, from the point where the trigeminal root enters the brainstem, are distinctly arranged by their contribution to the ventral trigeminothalamic tract and dorsal trigeminothalamic tract. This finding is supported by both post-mortem, ultra-high dMRI and different light microscopy techniques. CONCLUSION: The data from this study suggest that the fibres in the superior half of the root contribute mainly to the ventral trigeminothalamic tract, whereas the fibres in the inferior half mainly contribute to the dorsal trigeminothalamic tract. Such a somatotopic organisation could possibly create new insights into the anatomical origin of trigeminal neuralgia and the clinical relevance of this somatotopic organisation should therefore be further explored.","Guberinic, Alis; Souverein, Veerle; Volkers, Ruben; van Cappellen van Walsum, Anne-Marie; Vissers, Kris Cp; Mollink, Jeroen; Henssen, Dylan Jha",Cephalalgia,,77

METHODS: A retrospective observational study was carried out on 1991 semen samples collected between November 23, 2019 and July 23, 2020 (a period covering COVID-19 lock-down in China) from 781 sperm donor candidates at University-affiliated Sichuan Provincial Human Sperm Bank. Multivariate mixed-effects regression models were constructed to investigate the relationship between pollution exposure, windows of susceptibility, and semen quality, while controlling for biographic and meteorologic confounders. RESULT(S): The results indicated multiple windows of susceptibility for semen quality, especially sperm motility, due to ambient pollution exposure. Exposure to particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10), O3 and NO2 during late stages of spermatogenesis appeared to have weak but positive association with semen quality. Exposure to CO late in sperm development appeared to have inverse relationship with sperm movement parameters. Exposure to SO2 appeared to influence semen quality throughout spermatogenesis. CONCLUSION(S): Potential windows of susceptibility for semen quality varied depending on air pollutants. Sperm motility was sensitive to pollution exposure. Findings from current study further elucidate the importance of sensitive periods during spermatogenesis and provide new evidence for the determinants of male fertility.","Yang, Tingting; Deng, Li; Sun, Boyu; Zhang, Shifu; Xian, Yang; Xiao, Xiao; Zhan, Yu; Xu, Kehui; Buonocore, Johnathan J; Tang, Ya; Li, Fuping; Qiu, Yang",Environ Res,,77

To address this issue, we developed Proactive Integrated Care (Proactive iCare), a healthcare delivery model that couples integrated care with remote monitoring. Methods: We conducted a prospective, quasi-randomized clinical trial in 511 patients with advanced COPD or a recent COPD exacerbation, to test whether Proactive iCare impacts patient-centered outcomes and healthcare utilization. Patients were allocated to Proactive iCare (n = 352) or Usual Care (n = 159), and were examined for changes in quality of life using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), symptoms, guideline-based care, and healthcare utilization. Findings: Proactive iCare improved total SGRQ by 7 - 9 units (p < 0.0001), symptom SGRQ by 9 units (p < 0.0001), activity SGRQ by 6 - 7 units (p < 0.001) and impact SGRQ by 7 - 11 units (p < 0.0001) at 3, 6 and 9 months compared with Usual Care. Proactive iCare increased the 6-minute walk distance by 40 m (p < 0.001), reduced annual COPD-related urgent office visits by 76 visits per 100 subjects (p < 0.0001), identified unreported exacerbations, and decreased smoking (p = 0.01). Proactive iCare also improved symptoms, the BODE index and oxygen titration (p < 0.05). Mortality in the Proactive iCare group (1.1%) was not significantly different than mortality in the Usual Care group (3.8%; p = 0.08).

However, there is limited data on the long-term symptom persistence and mental health of critical and noncritical COVID-19 patients. Understanding these long-term effects can help healthcare workers provide better and targeted care for their patients. This prospective follow-up survey included 35 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and managed at our academic hospital from March 25,2020 to November 3, 2020. The survey evaluated for persistent post-acute COVID-19 symptoms and COVID-19 related mental health issues or stigma. Demographics, inflammatory markers, diagnostics, and therapy given were also recorded and descriptive analysis performed. In this study, patients were diagnosed 40 to 264 days prior to analysis. Patients comprised of 46.2% females, average of 4 comorbidities, and median age of 64 years old. Over a third of patients were tested in the outpatient setting, while the rest were diagnosed on admission. Of the one-third of patients requiring ICU care, 85.7% of the patients reported persistent symptoms post-discharge. Of the patients with persistent symptoms, dyspnea (57.1%), fatigue (53.6%), headache (35.7%), and loss of smell/taste (17.9%) were common. Patients with persistent symptoms more often required more COVID therapeutics and had higher oxygen requirements and inflammatory markers. Age or time since diagnosis was similar between the two groups. Overall, almost one-third of patients felt worse with people's attitudes towards COVID-19 and felt they were treated differently in the hospital with 15.4% feeling guilty about their diagnosis. Anxiety was reported in 76.9% of all patients, including 20.5% of those without symptoms. Most reported concerns for anxiety were personal health (46%), spreading COVID-19 to others (60%), and reinfection (17%). Anxiety from being isolated was alleviated in 46% of patients with a provider explanation with 18% of patients felt a negative impact from being in isolation. Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of patients reported a negative impact due to the no-visitor policy. Amongst those with persistent symptoms, common comorbidities were obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, malignancy history, and chronic lung disorders. More COVID therapeutic use, higher inflammatory markers and higher level of oxygen therapy were associated with persistent symptoms, correlating with more severe disease. Anxiety was common in both groups of patients with predominant worries of personal health and spreading COVID-19 to others. We need to consider the mental health impact on all COVID-19 patients even in those with quick recovery due to the stigmatizing nature of this infection.","Lee, S.; Balobaid, A.; Lastinger, A.; Reece, R.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,77

Then, using the financial ratios of the first six months of 2019, which is the period before COVID-19, and the financial ratios of the first six months of 2020, which is the period after COVID-19, the average changes of the manufacturing sector as a whole and on a sectoral basis were calculated with weighted arithmetic average, taking into account the asset sizes of the companies. Then, to determine whether there was a difference between the two periods in terms of financial rates, the Wilcoxon Sign test was also used. When the changes in the financial ratio means of the two periods and the revenues of the firms were examined, it was observed that a significant change was observed in the manufacturing sector in terms of ""Liquidity Ratios"", while a negative change was observed in terms of ""Profitability Ratios"". In addition, the research results indicate that while the pandemic negatively affected the Main Metal Industry and the Textile, Clothing and Leather Industry, companies in other sectors were affected differently according to the characteristics of the pandemic period. While it was observed that companies producing products such as pharmaceuticals, disinfectants, basic food and packaging, whose demand increased during the pandemic period, were positively affected, it was observed that companies producing other products were negatively affected in line with the general results.","Yamp,; Uuml,; Cel, Serkan Durak amp; Iacute,; smail,",Muhasebe ve Finansman Dergisi,,77
291767,Telephone,2020,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated telehealth to deliver psychiatric services. Continuation of psychiatric services for individuals with high clinical acuity was critical. This study examined attendance to rapidly deployed telehealth services for psychiatrically high-risk individuals receiving intensive outpatient program (IOP), primarily group-based psychotherapy services for adults and adolescents by race/ethnicity, insurance, and clinical treatment program within a large hospital-based outpatient psychiatric setting. Methods: Chi-square tests compared whether attendance rates for telehealth versus in-person IOP services varied by population group, race, insurance, and clinical program, using observational data of adolescent and adult patients treated between October 1, 2019, and July 31, 2020. Results: Appointment attendance increased for telehealth versus in-person services for adolescents (&#967;2 (df = 1) = 27.49, p < 0.0001) and adults (&#967;2 (df = 1) = 434.37, p < 0.0001). For adults, increased appointment attendance for telehealth was observed across insurance type (Medicaid: +11.5%; Medicare: +13.79%; Commercial: +6.94%), race/ethnicity (+6.23% to +15.76% across groups), and for IOP groups across all five diagnostic treatment programs (between 7.59% and 15.9% increases across groups). Adolescent results were mixed; increased appointment attendance for telehealth was observed among commercially insured youth (+7.11%), but no differences were observed for Medicaid-insured youth. Non-Hispanic white youth had increased attendance for telehealth (+8.38%) and no differences were observed for non-Hispanic black youth. Decreases were found in telehealth attendance for Hispanic/Latinx youth (-13.49%). Discussion: Rapidly deployed telehealth increased attendance to intensive services for psychiatrically high-risk individuals, particularly among adults and for adolescents with commercial insurance and non-Hispanic white youth. Trends among racial/ethnic and Medicaid-insured youth warrant further investigation regarding the potential for special challenges or vulnerabilities and advocacy needs. Findings highlight telehealth as an important tool in supporting availability of services for individuals with high levels of psychiatric acuity, particularly for group-based services, during the pandemic.","Childs, Amber W; Bacon, Sandra M; Klingensmith, Katherine; Li, Luming; Unger, Adam; Wing, Angelina M; Fortunati, Frank",Telemed. j. e. health,,77

Because of this, we have to make sure that the benefits we get from investing in treatment A are large enough to justify the benefits forgone from not investing in the next best alternative, treatment B. There has been an increase in spending and reallocation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic that may have been warranted given the urgency of the situation. However, these actions do not bypass the opportunity cost principle although they can appear to in the short term, since spending increases cannot continue indefinitely and there are patient groups who lose out when resources are redirected to pandemic services. Therefore, policy-makers must consider who bears the cost of the displaced healthcare resources. Failure to do so runs a risk of reducing overall population health while disproportionally worsening health in socially disadvantaged groups. We give the example of ethnic minorities in England who already had the worst health and, due to structural injustices, were hardest hit by the pandemic and may stand to lose the most when services are reallocated to meet the resource demands of the crisis. How can we prevent this form of health inequity? Our proposal is forward-looking: we suggest that the government should invest our resources wisely while taking issues of equity into account-that is, introduce cost-equity analysis.","Roadevin, Cristina; Hill, Harry",J. med. ethics,,77

295470,Ancillary benefits of seasonal influenza vaccination in middle-income countries,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is a global pandemic with higher mortality and morbidity than any other virus in the last 100 years. Without public health surveillance, policy makers cannot know where and how the disease is accelerating, decelerating, and shifting. Unfortunately, existing models of COVID-19 contagion rely on parameters such as the basic reproduction number and use static statistical methods that do not capture all the relevant dynamics needed for surveillance. Existing surveillance methods use data that are subject to significant measurement error and other contaminants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide a proof of concept of the creation of surveillance metrics that correct for measurement error and data contamination to determine when it is safe to ease pandemic restrictions. We applied state-of-the-art statistical modeling to existing internet data to derive the best available estimates of the state-level dynamics of COVID-19 infection in the United States. METHODS: Dynamic panel data (DPD) models were estimated with the Arellano-Bond estimator using the generalized method of moments. This statistical technique enables control of various deficiencies in a data set. The validity of the model and statistical technique was tested. RESULTS: A Wald chi-square test of the explanatory power of the statistical approach indicated that it is valid (&#967;210=1489.84, P<.001), and a Sargan chi-square test indicated that the model identification is valid (&#967;2946=935.52, P=.59). The 7-day persistence rate for the week of June 27 to July 3 was 0.5188 (P<.001), meaning that every 10,000 new cases in the prior week were associated with 5188 cases 7 days later. For the week of July 4 to 10, the 7-day persistence rate increased by 0.2691 (P=.003), indicating that every 10,000 new cases in the prior week were associated with 7879 new cases 7 days later. Applied to the reported number of cases, these results indicate an increase of almost 100 additional new cases per day per state for the week of July 4-10. This signifies an increase in the reproduction parameter in the contagion models and corroborates the hypothesis that economic reopening without applying best public health practices is associated with a resurgence of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: DPD models successfully correct for measurement error and data contamination and are useful to derive surveillance metrics. The opening of America involves two certainties: the country will be COVID-19-free only when there is an effective vaccine, and the ""social"" end of the pandemic will occur before the ""medical"" end. Therefore, improved surveillance metrics are needed to inform leaders of how to open sections of the United States more safely. DPD models can inform this reopening in combination with the extraction of COVID-19 data from existing websites.","Oehmke, James Francis; Oehmke, Theresa B; Singh, Lauren Nadya; Post, Lori Ann",J Med Internet Res,,77
295592,Leading laboratory testing through a viralpandemic,2020,"Objectives: Social distancing under the COVID-19 pandemic has restricted access to community services for older adults with neurocognitive disorder (NCD) and their caregivers. Telehealth is a viable alternative to face-to-face service delivery. Telephone calls alone, however, may be insufficient. Here, we evaluated whether supplementary telehealth via video-conferencing platforms could bring additional benefits to care-recipient with NCD and their spousal caregivers at home. Participants: Sixty older adults NCD-and-caregiver dyads were recruited through an activity center. Design, Intervention: The impact of additional services delivered to both care-recipient and caregiver through video conference (n = 30) was compared with telehealth targeted at caregivers by telephone only (n = 30), over 4 weeks in a pretest-post-test design. Interviews and questionnaires were conducted at baseline and study's end. Measurements, Results: Supplementary telemedicine had averted the deterioration in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment evident in the telephone-only group (etap2 = 0.50). It also reversed the falling trend in quality of life observed in the telephone only group (QoL-AD, etap2 = 0.23). Varying degrees of improvements in physical and mental health (Short-Form 36 v2), perceived burden (Zarit Burden Interview Scale) and self-efficacy (Revised Caregiving Self-Efficacy Scale) were observed among caregivers in the video-conferencing group, which were absent in the telephone-only group (etap2 = 0.23-0.51). Conclusion: Telemedicine by video conference was associated with improved resilience and wellbeing to both people with NCD and their caregivers at home. The benefits were visible already after 4 weeks and unmatched by telephone alone. Video conference as the modus operandi of telehmedicine beyond the context of pandemic-related social distancing should be considered.

We hypothesized that combining drugs with independent mechanisms of action could result in synergy against SARS-CoV-2, thus generating better antiviral efficacy. Using in silico approaches, we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and then tested them in vitro. Sixteen synergistic and eight antagonistic combinations were identified; among 16 synergistic cases, combinations of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug nitazoxanide with remdesivir, amodiaquine, or umifenovir were most notable, all exhibiting significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2 in a cell model. However, the combination of remdesivir and lysosomotropic drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, demonstrated strong antagonism. Overall, these results highlight the utility of drug repurposing and preclinical testing of drug combinations for discovering potential therapies to treat COVID-19.","Bobrowski, Tesia; Chen, Lu; Eastman, Richard T; Itkin, Zina; Shinn, Paul; Chen, Catherine Z; Guo, Hui; Zheng, Wei; Michael, Sam; Simeonov, Anton; Hall, Matthew D; Zakharov, Alexey V; Muratov, Eugene N",Mol Ther,,77

298316,Response to Letter to the Editor,2020,"The 2020 Olympic/Paralympic Games have been postponed to 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a model that integrated source-environment-receptor pathways to evaluate how preventive efforts can reduce the infection risk among spectators at the opening ceremony of Tokyo Olympic Games. We simulated viral loads of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emitted from infectors through talking/coughing/sneezing and modeled temporal environmental behaviors, including virus inactivation and transfer. We performed Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the expected number of newly infected individuals with and without preventive measures, yielding the crude probability of a spectator being an infector among the 60,000 people expected to attend the opening ceremony. Two indicators, i.e., the expected number of newly infected individuals and the newly infected individuals per infector entry, were proposed to demonstrate the extent of achievable infection risk reduction levels by implementing possible preventive measures. A no-prevention scenario produced 1.5-1.7 newly infected individuals per infector entry, whereas a combination of cooperative preventive measures by organizers and the spectators achieved a 99% risk reduction, corresponding to 0.009-0.012 newly infected individuals per infector entry. The expected number of newly infected individuals was calculated as 0.005 for the combination of cooperative preventive scenarios with the crude probability of a spectator being an infector of 1 × 10-5. Based on our estimates, a combination of cooperative preventions between organizers and spectators is required to prevent a viral spread at the Tokyo Olympic/Paralympic Games. Further, under the assumption that society accepts < 10 newly infected persons traced to events held during the entire Olympic/Paralympic Games, we propose a crude probability of infectors of < 5 × 10-5 as a benchmark for the suppression of the infection. This is the first study to develop a model that can assess the infection risk among spectators due to exposure pathways at a mass gathering event.","Murakami, Michio; Miura, Fuminari; Kitajima, Masaaki; Fujii, Kenkichi; Yasutaka, Tetsuo; Iwasaki, Yuichi; Ono, Kyoko; Shimazu, Yuzo; Sorano, Sumire; Okuda, Tomoaki; Ozaki, Akihiko; Katayama, Kotoe; Nishikawa, Yoshitaka; Kobashi, Yurie; Sawano, Toyoaki; Abe, Toshiki; Saito, Masaya M; Tsubokura, Masaharu; Naito, Wataru; Imoto, Seiya",Microb Risk Anal,,77

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a popular alignment method, but can fail on high-dimensional real-world data where the dimensions of aligned sequences are often unequal. In this paper, we show that exploiting the multiscale manifold latent structure of real-world data can yield improved alignment. We introduce a novel framework called Warping on Wavelets (WOW) that integrates DTW with a a multi-scale manifold learning framework called Diffusion Wavelets. We present a theoretical analysis of the WOW family of algorithms and show that it outperforms previous state of the art methods, such as canonical time warping (CTW) and manifold warping, on several real-world datasets.","Mahadevan, Sridhar; Rao, Anup; Theocharous, Georgios; Healey, Jennifer",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09222v1.pdf,77

301076,A Regal Rash,2021,"The occupational bioaerosols containing viruses, bacteria, fungi, microbial toxins and plant or animal particles, may evoke infectious, allergic or immunotoxic diseases which may co-exist as comorbidities with COVID-19 and exacerbate the course of disease. They include hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) caused mostly by bacteria, fungi, and particles containing animal proteins, and immunotoxic diseases such as organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS) and byssinosis, caused mostly by bacterial and fungal toxins. The two most probable scenarios of possible interrelations between these three comorbidities (CM) and COVID-19 are: 1) 'Triggering' - when infection with SARS-CoV-2 triggers severe CM after bioaerosol exposure; 2) 'Reverse triggering' when exposure to bioaerosol exacerbates a symptomless or mild course of COVID-19, and evokes a severe disease. The occupations mostly endangered by COVID-19 as the result of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 bioaerosol, or to other bioaerosols which may exacerbate this disease, include: health care workers, social workers, breeders of fur animals, slaughterhouse workers, workers engaged in the processing and selling of seafood, and probably also agricultural workers, mainly in the developing countries. The authors present a hypothesis for the origin of the present pandemic. It assumes that a mild form of the present SARS-CoV-2 that is supposedly circulating among the Chinese population in the eastern part of the country, mutated under the influence of as yet unknown factor(s) present in the Chinese seafood markets, probably component(s) of bioaerosols, into the virulent and highly contagious form, known as the present SARS-CoV-2, under a scenario similar to that the authors have named 'Reverse triggering'.","Dutkiewicz, Jacek; Mackiewicz, Barbara; Lemieszek, Marta Kinga",Ann Agric Environ Med,,77

304382,The Challenging and Amazing Field of Sports Cardiology,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Studies describe COVID-19 patient characteristics and outcomes across populations, but reports of variation across healthcare facilities are lacking. The objectives were to examine differences in COVID-19 patient volume and mortality across facilities, and understand whether facility variation in mortality was due primarily to differences in patient versus facility characteristics. DESIGN: Observational cohort study with multilevel mixed effects logistic regression modelling. SETTING: The Veterans Health Administration (VA) is the largest healthcare system in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME: All-cause mortality within 45 days after COVID-19 testing (March-May, follow-up through 16 July 2020). RESULTS: Among 13 510 patients with COVID-19, 3942 (29.2%) were admitted (2266/3942 (57.5%) ward; 1676/3942 (42.5%) intensive care unit (ICU)) and 679/3942 (17.2%) received mechanical ventilation. Marked heterogeneity was observed across facilities in median age (range: 34.3-83.9 years; facility mean: 64.7, SD 7.2 years); patient volume (range: 1-737 at 160 facilities; facility median: 48.5, IQR 14-105.5); hospital admissions (range: 1-286 at 133 facilities; facility median: 11, IQR 1-26.5); ICU caseload (range: 1-85 at 115 facilities; facility median: 4, IQR 0-12); and mechanical ventilation (range: 1-53 at 90 facilities; facility median: 1, IQR 0-5). Heterogeneity was also observed in facility mortality for all patients with COVID-19 (range: 0%-29.7%; facility median: 8.9%, IQR 2.4%-13.7%); inpatients (range: 0%-100%; facility median: 18.0%, IQR 5.6%-28.6%); ICU patients (range: 0%-100%; facility median: 28.6%, IQR 14.3%-50.0%); and mechanical ventilator patients (range: 0%-100%; facility median: 52.7%, IQR 33.3%-80.6%). The majority of variation in facility mortality was attributable to differences in patient characteristics (eg, age). CONCLUSIONS: Marked heterogeneity in COVID-19 patient volume, characteristics and mortality were observed across VA facilities nationwide. Differences in patient characteristics accounted for the majority of explained variation in mortality across sites. Variation in unadjusted COVID-19 mortality across facilities or nations should be considered with caution.","Bravata, Dawn M; Myers, Laura J; Perkins, Anthony J; Keyhani, Salomeh; Zhang, Ying; Zillich, Alan J; Dysangco, Andrew; Lindsey, Reese; Sharmitha, Dev; Myers, Jennifer; Austin, Charles; Sexson, Ali; Arling, Greg",BMJ Open,,77

309003,Operationalizing Framing to Support MultiperspectiveRecommendations of Opinion Pieces,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of children with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a difficult balance between hypercortisolism and hyperandrogenism. Biochemical monitoring of treatment is not well defined. OBJECTIVE: Cluster analysis of the urinary steroid metabolome obtained by targeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for treatment monitoring of children with CAH. METHODS: We evaluated 24-h urinary steroid metabolome analyses of 109 prepubertal children aged 7.0â¯±â¯1.6â¯years with classic CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency treated with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. 24-h urinary steroid metabolite excretions were transformed into CAH-specific z-scores. Subjects were divided into groups (metabotypes) by k-means clustering algorithm. Urinary steroid metabolome and clinical data of patients of each metabotype were analyzed. RESULTS: Four unique metabotypes were generated. Metabotype 1 (Nâ¯=â¯21 (19%)) revealed adequate metabolic control with low cortisol metabolites (mean: -0.57z) and suppressed androgen and 17&#945;-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) metabolites (-0.79z). Metabotype 2 (Nâ¯=â¯23 (21%)) showed overtreatment consisting of a constellation of elevated urinary cortisol metabolites (0.62z) and low metabolites of androgens and 17OHP (-0.75z). Metabotype 3 (Nâ¯=â¯32 (29%)) demonstrated undertreated patients with low cortisol metabolites (-0.69z) and elevated metabolites of androgens and 17OHP (0.50z). Metabotype 4 (Nâ¯=â¯33 (30%)) presented patients with treatment failure reflected by unsuppressed androgen- and 17OHP metabolites (0.71z) despite elevated urinary cortisol metabolites (0.39z). CONCLUSION: Metabotyping, which means grouping metabolically similar individuals, helps to monitor treatment of children with CAH using GC-MS urinary steroid metabolome analysis. This method allows classification in adequately-, over-, or undertreated children as well as identification of patients with treatment failure.","Kamrath, Clemens; Hartmann, Michaela F; Pons-Kühnemann, Jörn; Wudy, Stefan A",Metabolism,,77

Infodemiology metrics have been widely and successfully used to assess and forecast epidemics and outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: In light of the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that started in Wuhan, China in 2019, online search traffic data from Google are used to track the spread of the new coronavirus disease in Europe. METHODS: Time series from Google Trends from January to March 2020 on the Topic (Virus) of ""Coronavirus"" were retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide and in the European countries that have been affected the most: Italy (at national and regional level), Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Statistically significant correlations are observed between online interest and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Furthermore, a critical point, after which the Pearson correlation coefficient starts declining (even if it is still statistically significant) was identified, indicating that this method is most efficient in regions or countries that have not yet peaked in COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: In the past, infodemiology metrics in general and data from Google Trends in particular have been shown to be useful in tracking and forecasting outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics as, for example, in the cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola, measles, and Zika. With the COVID-19 pandemic still in the beginning stages, it is essential to explore and combine new methods of disease surveillance to assist with the preparedness of health care systems at the regional level.","Mavragani, Amaryllis",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,77
309835,The External Validity of Combinatorial Samples and Populations,2021-08-09,"Although vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are under development, the antigen epitopes on the virus and their immunogenicity are poorly understood. Here, we simulate the 3D structures and predict the B cell epitopes on the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using structure-based approaches and validate epitope immunogenicity by immunizing mice. Almost all 33 predicted epitopes effectively induce antibody production, six of these are immunodominant epitopes in individuals, and 23 are conserved within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat coronavirus RaTG13. We find that the immunodominant epitopes of individuals with domestic (China) SARS-CoV-2 are different from those of individuals with imported (Europe) SARS-CoV-2, which may be caused by mutations on the S (G614D) and N proteins. Importantly, we find several epitopes on the S protein that elicit neutralizing antibodies against D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2, which can contribute to vaccine design against coronaviruses.","Lu, Shuai; Xie, Xi-Xiu; Zhao, Lei; Wang, Bin; Zhu, Jie; Yang, Ting-Rui; Yang, Guang-Wen; Ji, Mei; Lv, Cui-Ping; Xue, Jian; Dai, Er-Hei; Fu, Xi-Ming; Liu, Dong-Qun; Zhang, Lun; Hou, Sheng-Jie; Yu, Xiao-Lin; Wang, Yu-Ling; Gao, Hui-Xia; Shi, Xue-Han; Ke, Chang-Wen; Ke, Bi-Xia; Jiang, Chun-Guo; Liu, Rui-Tian",Cell Rep,,77

Methods: United States adults (N = 1607) completed a health-related questionnaire during COVID-19 and associated shelter-in-place. We categorized respondents into 4 groups of SWF at the time of the pandemic: ""Never,"" ""< 1x a week,"" ""1x a week,"" or ""> 1x a week."" Results: The proportion of adults never weighing increased during the pandemic (15% to 25%), whereas the proportion of those weighing < 1x week went down (41% to 29%). Higher SWF was significantly associated with changes in energy expenditure including increased total physical activity (PA), lower likelihood of decreases in vigorous, moderate, and walking PA, and a lower likelihood of sitting more. More frequent self-weighing also was associated statistically with lower likelihood of keeping unhealthy eating behaviors the same. Conversely, there was no significant difference in changes in alcohol, caffeine, takeout, fruit or vegetable consumption, and television viewing among SWF groups. Conclusion: SWF decreased during the pandemic in the lower 2 SWF categories. Higher SWF was associated with fewer negative changes in health behaviors, especially related to PA.","Cooper, Jamie A; vanDellen, Michelle; Bhutani, Surabhi",Am J Health Behav,,77

However, clinicians often feel reluctant to trust AI-based models because of its black-box characteristic and lack of proper explainability. This paper proposes an explainable attention transfer classification model based on the knowledge distillation network structure to automatically differentiate COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia (CAP) from healthy lungs with radiographic imaging. The proposed network structure can be divided into teacher network and student network based on the attention transfer direction. Firstly, the teacher network extracts global features and concentrates on the infection regions to generate attention maps. We propose a deformable attention module (DAM) to strengthen infection regions response and suppress noise in irrelevant regions with expanded reception field. Moreover, combining essential information in original input, attention knowledge transfers from teacher network to student network via an image fusion module. Trained with teacher network jointly, the student branch with weighted dense connectivity can focus on irregularly shaped lesion regions to learn discriminative features and improve network performance. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on public chest X-ray and CT imaging datasets. The proposed architecture achieves state-of-art performance and improves the AI-based model's explainable ability by attention map, severity assessment, and prediction confidence.","Shi, Wenqi; Tong, Li; Zhu, Yuanda; Wang, May Dongmei",IEEE j. biomed. health inform.

However, children with risk factors such as chronic lung disease and immunosuppression have higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. We report a case of a 27-week-gestation extremely premature infant born to a mother with COVID-19 infection. The infant, initially treated for surfactant deficiency, developed worsening hypoxic respiratory failure on the fifth day of life requiring escalating ventilatory support, an elevated level of C-reactive protein, thrombocytopenia, and an elevated level of d-dimer. The infant was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from Day 1 to Day 42 of his life. The infant responded to a seven-day course of dexamethasone with a gradually decreasing oxygen requirement and could be extubated to non-invasive ventilation by the end of the fifth week after birth. The infant is currently on home oxygen by nasal cannula. Prolonged shedding of the virus may be a unique feature of the disease in premature infants. Extreme prematurity, immature lungs, and an immunocompromised status may predispose these infants to severe respiratory failure and a prolonged clinical course. Instituting appropriate COVID-19 protocols to prevent the spread of the disease in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is of utmost importance. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may have implications in the management of extremely premature infants in the NICU.","Kumar, Vasantha H.

317420,An unconventional view of COVID-19 T cell immunity,2020,"Goal: The SARS-CoV-2 viral infection could cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, disturbing the regular breathing and leading to continuous coughing. Automatic respiration monitoring systems could provide the necessary metrics and warnings for timely intervention, especially for those with mild symptoms. Current respiration detection systems are expensive and too obtrusive for any large-scale deployment. Thus, a low-cost pervasive ambient sensor is proposed. Methods: We will posit a barometer on the working desk and develop a novel signal processing algorithm with a sparsity-based filter to remove the similar-frequency noise. Three modes (coughing, breathing and others) will be conducted to detect coughing and estimate different respiration rates. Results: The proposed system achieved 97.33% accuracy of cough detection and 98.98% specificity of respiration rate estimation. Conclusions: This system could be used as an effective screening tool for detecting subjects suffering from COVID-19 symptoms and enable large scale monitoring of patients diagnosed with or recovering.","Chen, Xiaoshuai Jiang Shuo Li Zeyu Lo Benny",IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology,,77

This is a descriptive and retrospective electronic chart review. We obtained data from the UCSF eConsult and Smart Referral program manager. The medical system provided institution-wide statistics. Three authors reviewed and categorized gynecologic eConsults for the last fiscal year. The senior author resolved conflicts in coding. The eConsult program manager provided billing information and provider reimbursement. A total of 548 eConsults were submitted to the gynecology service between July 2017 and June 2020 (4.5% of institutional eConsult volume). Ninety-five percent of the eConsults were completed by a senior specialist within our department. Abnormal pap smear management, abnormal uterine bleeding, and contraception questions were the most common queries. Over half (59.3%) of all inquiries were answered on the same day as they were received, with an average of 9% declined. Gynecology was the 10th largest eConsult provider at our institution in 2020. The present investigation describes one large university-based experience with eConsults in gynecology. Results demonstrate that eConsults permit appropriate, efficient triaging of time-sensitive conditions affecting patients especially in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. eConsult services provide the potential to improve access, interdisciplinary communication, and patient and provider satisfaction.","Corbetta-Rastelli, Chiara M; Morgan, Tamandra K; Homaifar, Nazaneen; Deangelis, Lisa; Autry, Amy M",J Med Syst,,77

METHODS: We included all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had completed hospitalization between March 10, 2020 and April 10, 2020 with follow-up through April 20, 2020. Patients who received TCB in addition to standard of care within 48 h of admission were matched in a 1:2 fashion to a similar cohort who received standard of care alone. Clinical outcomes were compared between matched groups. The primary outcome was de-escalation in oxygen therapy. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital death, septic shock, and acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring hemodialysis. RESULTS: Out of 77 patients who received TCB in addition to standard of care, 34% (n = 26) received TCB within 48 h of admission. One-to-two propensity matching identified 20 versus 40 patients in the TCB and no-TCB treatment arms. In the TCB group, an improvement in oxygenation was observed in 80% (n = 16) of the patients by 7 days post TCB administration. After matching, there was no difference in clinical outcomes between TCB and no-TCB patients. In-hospital death: 10% versus 8%; p = .823, septic shock: 10% versus 11%, p = .912, AKI requiring hemodialysis (10% vs. 13%; p = .734). CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with TCB in patients admitted for COVID-19 led to an improvement in their oxygen status during hospitalization.

The main references for this graphic tale are the movies El ángel exterminador (1962) and Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie (1972), both written and directed by Luís Buñuel. The movies, immersed in a surrealist atmosphere created by the relationships between the characters, bring elements to the script that were observed at the Diamond Princess, such as people held up in a location by an ""invisible force,"" a sense of broken communication, and the spread of misleading information.

321514,Hand Hygiene Practices and the Risk of Human Coronavirus Infections in a UK Community Cohort [version 1;peer review: awaiting peer review],2020,"BACKGROUND: Quinones are reactive to proteins containing cysteine residues and the main protease in Covid-19 contains an active site that includes Cys145. Embelin, a quinone natural product, is known to have antiviral activity against influenza and hepatitis B. Preliminary studies by our group also indicate its ability to inhibit HSV-1 in cultured cells. METHODS: Docking and DFT methods applied to the protease target. RESULTS: a mechanism for this inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease is described, specifically due to formation of a covalent bond between S(Cys145) and an embelin C(carbonyl). This is assisted by two protein amino acids (1) N(imidazole-His41) which is able to capture H[S(Cys145)] and (2) HN(His163), which donates a proton to embelin O(carbonyl) forming an OH moiety that results in inhibition of the viral protease. A similar process is also seen with the anti-inflammatory drugs methyl prednisolone and dexamethasone, used for Covid-19 patients. Methyl prednisolone and dexamethasone are methide quinones, and possess only one carbonyl moiety, instead of two for embelin. Additional consideration was given to another natural product, emodin, recently patented against Covid-19, as well as some therapeutic quinones, vitamin K, suspected to be involved in Covid-19 action, and coenzyme Q10. All show structural similarities with embelin, dexamethasone and methyl prednisolone results. CONCLUSIONS: Our data on embelin and related quinones indicate that these natural compounds may represent a feasible, strategic tool against Covid-19.","Caruso, Francesco; Rossi, Miriam; Pedersen, Jens Z; Incerpi, Sandra",J Infect Public Health,,77

METHODS: From August 2019 to January 2020, we conducted 11 telephone interviews with 18 participants representing state and local health departments and community health centers that responded to US measles outbreaks in 2017-19, with a focus on outbreaks among insular communities. We conducted qualitative, thematic coding to identify and characterize key operational challenges and lessons identified by the interviewees. RESULTS: We categorized principal insights into 5 topic areas: scale of the response, vaccination operations, exclusion policies, community engagement, and countering anti-vaccine efforts. These topics address resource-intensive aspects of these outbreak responses, including personnel demands; guidance needed to support response operations and reduce transmission, such as excluding exposed or at-risk individuals from public spaces; operational challenges and barriers to vaccination and other response activities; and effectively engaging and educating affected populations, particularly with respect to insular and vulnerable communities. CONCLUSIONS: Measles outbreak responses are resource intensive, which can quickly overwhelm existing public health capacities. Early and effective coordination with trusted leaders and organizations in affected communities, including to provide vaccination capacity and facilitate community engagement, can promote efficient response operations. The firsthand experiences of public health and healthcare personnel who responded to measles outbreaks, including among insular communities, provide evidence-based operational lessons that can inform future preparedness and response operations for outbreaks of highly transmissible diseases.","Martin, Elena K; Shearer, Matthew P; Trotochaud, Marc; Nuzzo, Jennifer B",BMC Public Health,,77

323110,FDA Authorizes Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes an illness known as COVID-19, which has been declared a global pandemic with over 2 million confirmed cases and 137,000 deaths in 185 countries and regions at the time of writing (16 April 2020), over a quarter of these cases being in the United States. In the absence of a vaccine, or an approved effective therapeutic, there is an intense interest in repositioning available drugs or designing small molecule antivirals. In this context, in silico modelling has proven to be an invaluable tool. An important target is the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), involved in processing translated viral proteins. Peptidomimetic &#945;-ketoamides represent prototypical inhibitors of Mpro. A recent attempt at designing a compound with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties has resulted in the synthesis and evaluation of the &#945;-ketoamide 13b analogue. Here, we performed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to further characterize the interaction of &#945;-ketoamide 13b with the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We included the widely used antibiotic, amoxicillin, for comparison. Our findings indicate that &#945;-ketoamide 13b binds more tightly (predicted GlideScore = -8.7 and -9.2â¯kcal/mol for protomers A and B, respectively), to the protease active site compared to amoxicillin (-5.0 and -4.8â¯kcal/mol). Further, molecular dynamics simulations highlight the stability of the interaction of the &#945;-ketoamide 13b ligand with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (&#916;G = -25.2 and -22.3â¯kcal/mol for protomers A and B). In contrast, amoxicillin interacts unfavourably with the protease (&#916;G = +32.8â¯kcal/mol for protomer A), with unbinding events observed in several independent simulations. Overall, our findings are consistent with those previously observed, and highlight the need to further explore the &#945;-ketoamides as potential antivirals for this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Liang, Julia; Pitsillou, Eleni; Karagiannis, Chris; Darmawan, Kevion K; Ng, Ken; Hung, Andrew; Karagiannis, Tom C",Comput Biol Chem,,77

323463,Perspectives on the construction of forensic autopsy laboratories designed to handle infectious diseases,2020,"PURPOSE: We estimate the association between forgetfulness to take medications as prescribed and polypharmacy and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among a cohort of patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia or both in Greece during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A telephone survey of 1018 randomly selected adults was conducted in Greece in June 2020. Participants were included in the survey, if they (a) had a diagnosis of hypertension, dyslipidemia or both and (b) were on prescription treatment for these conditions. HRQoL was calculated using the short form (SF) -12 Patient Questionnaire. A multivariable generalized linear regression model (GLM) was used to estimate the association between forgetfulness and polypharmacy and HRQoL, controlling for sociodemographic and health-related covariates. RESULTS: Overall, 351 respondents met the inclusion criteria, of whom 28 did not fully complete the questionnaire (response rate: 92%, n = 323). Of those, 37% were diagnosed with hypertension only, 28% with dyslipidemia only, and 35% with both. Most reported good to average physical (64.1%) and mental health (48.6%). Overall, 25% indicated that they sometimes forget to take their prescribed medications, and 12% took two or more pills multiple times daily. Total HRQoL score was 68.9% (s.d. = 18.0%). About 10% of participants reported paying less attention to their healthcare condition during the pandemic. Estimates of multivariable analyses indicated a negative association between forgetfulness (- 9%, adjusted ß: - 0.047, 95% confidence interval - 0.089 to - 0.005, p = 0.029), taking two or more pills multiple times daily compared to one pill once a day (- 16%, adjusted ß: - 0.068, 95% confidence interval - 0.129 to - 0.008, p = 0.028) and total HRQoL. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that among adult patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia or both in Greece, those who forget to take their medications and those with more complex treatment regimens had lower HRQoL. Such patients merit special attention and require targeted approaches by healthcare providers to improve treatment compliance and health outcomes.","Souliotis, Kyriakos; Giannouchos, Theodoros V; Golna, Chistina; Liberopoulos, Evangelos",Qual. life res,,77

Given the sudden infection from and extensive dispersion of COVID-19 and the absence of specific drugs, those infected are in danger if they are not treated in time. Consequently, COVID-19 has become an important factor influencing adolescents' mental health. The purpose of this study is to explore the intervention effect of the integration model on the negative emotions of adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Adolescents were randomly selected from five middle schools in Zhejiang Province of China from May 2020 to July 2020. First, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, and Psychological Well-Being Scale were used for measurement. Then, 72 patients with moderate and severe anxiety symptoms were chosen as the research objects, and the intervention and comparison time was determined to be eight weeks. The subjects were randomly divided into the experiment group (35 members) and the control group (34 members). The integration model was employed on the experiment group. RESULTS: Grade, physical condition, and sleep time are important factors influencing the anxiety level of adolescents during the COVID-19 period, and the anxiety risk of adolescents is higher during their third year of junior high school. After the intervention, the SAS score of the experiment group is lower than that of the control group, and the decrease in the SAS score is higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). Moreover, the positive emotion score of the experiment group is higher than that of the control group, and the negative emotion score of the former is lower than that of the latter. The variances in the positive and negative emotion scores are higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). The variance in the overall well-being index is also greater in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The intervention using the integrated model can significantly reduce negative emotions such as anxiety, increase positive emotions, and improve the overall well-being of adolescents during the epidemic period.","Chen, Jun; Sang, Guoqiang; Zhang, Yu; Jiang, Aifeng",Psychiatr Danub,,77

While factors affecting the use of online learning are diverse and have been studied by models of use and acceptance of technology, this cross-sectional study explores the factors unique to the current emergency situation that influence students' use and acceptance of emergency online learning. Moreover, it proposes a model to predict a student's cognitive engagement in Mexico, Peru, Turkey, and the USA. This is a quantitative study with an exploratory and descriptive scope and cross-sectional design. Data was collected from 1009 students from the four countries, who completed surveys anonymously. The factors analyzed were attitude, affect, and motivation, perceived behavioral control (ease of use, self-efficacy, and accessibility), and cognitive engagement. The data was analyzed using descriptive, correlation, and regression analysis. The predictive model shows that students' attitude toward online learning impacts their cognitive engagement in Mexico, Peru, and the USA. Furthermore, self-efficacy is a significant moderator for cognitive engagement in all four countries. The model also shows that each country has different determinants for cognitive engagement. Understanding the factors that affect the use of emergency online learning is essential for the success and/or achievement of its maximum benefits in situations like a global pandemic. Limitations of this study have been identified as use of convenience sampling, and an inability to explore factors related to instruction and system attributes. Professors who did not teach online learning lacked knowledge about online educational strategies and used the technological resources that were immediately available to them. Therefore, research that explores the use of instructional strategies and the use of technological systems during emergency online learning is necessary. This study includes suggestions to incorporate open educational resources that use microlearning and emphasizes the importance of student self-efficacy; because it was predictor of cognitive engagement in all four countries. Faculty and higher education institutions can and should develop strategies to increase students' sense of self-efficacy.","Aguilera-Hermida, A Patricia; Quiroga-Garza, Angélica; Gómez-Mendoza, Sanjuana; Del Río Villanueva, Carmen Amalia; Avolio Alecchi, Beatrice; Avci, Dilek",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,77

Recently, many reports have described cases of symptomatic microbleeds, and there may also have been a case of computed tomography- negative intracerebral hemorrhage. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 70-year-old female patient who had a history of lacunar infarction and severe small vessel disease developed dysarthria. On brain non-contrast computed tomography there was no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. However, brain magnetic resonance imaging performed at 3âhours after the initial computed tomography showed cerebral hemorrhage. DIAGNOSES: The diagnosis was computed tomography-negative intracerebral hemorrhage. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with cilostazole 100âmg twice a day with blood pressure management. OUTCOMES: The dysarthria was fully recovered within 5 days and the patient did not suffer recurrent stroke symptoms over the following 2 years. LESSONS: In patients with underlying severe small vessel disease and microbleeds, there could be computed tomography-negative hemorrhage and susceptibility weighted magnetic resonance image could be needed. More attention is required before applying thrombolysis therapy because there is a possibility of cerebral hemorrhage in those patients.","Han, Jinhee; Yang, Harin; Bae, Jeong Hoon; Kim, Hyun Young; Kim, Young Seo",Medicine (Baltimore),,77

The analysis of available clinical data and SARS-CoV-2 infection markers underlined the main pathogenic process in COVID-19 is cytokine storm and inflammation. That led us to suggest that the most important pathogenic feature of SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 is oxidative stress and cellular damage stimulated by iron, a source of Fenton reaction and its product hydroxyl radical (â¢OH), the most reactive ROS with t1/2-10-9s.

Globally, more than 14.6 M people have been diagnosed and more than 595 K deaths are reported. Currently, no effective vaccine or drugs are available to combat COVID-19. Therefore, the whole world is looking for new drug candidates that can treat the COVID-19. In this study, we conducted a virtual screening of natural compounds using a deep-learning method. A deep-learning algorithm was used for the predictive modeling of a CHEMBL3927 dataset of inhibitors of Main protease (Mpro). Several predictive models were developed and evaluated based on R2, MAE MSE, RMSE, and Loss. The best model with R2=0.83, MAE = 1.06, MSE = 1.5, RMSE = 1.2, and loss = 1.5 was deployed on the Selleck database containing 1611 natural compounds for virtual screening. The model predicted 500 hits showing the value score between 6.9 and 3.8. The screened compounds were further enriched by molecular docking resulting in 39 compounds based on comparison with the reference (X77). Out of them, only four compounds were found to be drug-like and three were non-toxic. The complexes of compounds and Mpro were finally subjected to Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation for 100 ns. The MMPBSA result showed that two compounds Palmatine and Sauchinone formed very stable complex with Mpro and had free energy of -71.47 kJ mol-1 and -71.68 kJ mol-1 respectively as compared to X77 (-69.58 kJ mol-1).

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed. All women aged up to 24 years, who delivered between April 25, 2020, and June 24, 2020, at Women's Hospital, University of Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil were considered. The ENG-implant or other contraceptive methods were offered prior to hospital discharge. The participants were split into two groups: (1) those who chose the ENG-implant and (2) those that refused the implant. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: 151 women were included, with 76.2% selecting the ENG-implant. The average age was 19.5 years; 73.2% of pregnancies were unplanned, 32.5% already had a previous pregnancy, 74% were single, and 75.5% were not in full time education. Further, 70.5% had previously used contraceptives, with 89.1% unsatisfied with their previous method that opted for the ENG-implant (P = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Offering the ENG-implant to youths during the immediate postnatal period is evidence-based care, and contraceptive provision is an essential health promotion tool, even during a pandemic. Thinking quickly about public policies in times of crisis is important to guarantee sexual and reproductive rights.","Barbieri, Mariane Massaini; Herculano, Thuany Bento; Dantas Silva, Amanda; Bahamondes, Luis; Juliato, Cassia Raquel Teatin; Surita, Fernanda Garanhani",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,,77

337199,Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo - The Supreme Court and Pandemic Controls,2021,"On social media and in everyday life, people are often exposed to misinformation. Decades of research have shown that exposure to misinformation can have significant impacts on people's thoughts, actions, and memories. During global pandemics like COVID-19, people are likely exposed to heightened quantities of misinformation as they search for and are exposed to copious amounts of information about the disease and its effects. This media environment, with an abundance of both accurate and inaccurate information, is often called an ""infodemic."" In the current essay, we discuss the consequences of exposure to misinformation during this infodemic, particularly in the domain of memory. We review existing research demonstrating how inaccurate, postevent information impacts a person's memory for a previously witnessed event. We discuss various factors that strengthen the impact of misinformation, including repetition and whether the misinformation is consistent with people's pre-existing attitudes or beliefs. We conclude by describing how social media companies and individual users can help prevent the spread of misinformation and the ways in which cognitive science research can inform these approaches.","Greenspan, Rachel Leigh; Loftus, Elizabeth F",,,77

Taking the case of Covid-19 in the UK, we explore how voters? assessments of the government?s handling of the economy and health were affected by four events: the first UK Covid-19 death;the national lockdown;Boris Johnson?s hospitalisation;and Cummings? scandal. Using a large representative weekly survey in the last year totalling over around 30?000 respondents, our results show that Labour voters had the worst assessments of government handling. The first death deteriorated perceptions of government handling of health among both Labour and Conservative voters, while Boris Johnson?s hospitalisation improved perceptions among most voters. Lockdown improved the perception of health handling but at the cost of more negative perceptions of its handling of the economy. The Cummings scandal had a negative effect on perceptions of government handling of economy but surprisingly improved perceptions of its handling of health.","Vlandas, Tim Klymak Margaryta",Swiss Political Science Review,,77

We surveyed 904 patients receiving injections at 5 centres in France regarding their feelings toward anti-VEGF injections. The mean age was 77.4 years, and the injections were performed mostly for age related macular degeneration (72%). Half of the patients had previously received>10 injections, 35.6% had received 3-10 injections, and 14.2% had received<3 injections. The mean (SD) stress score was 4.2 [on a scale from 1-10 (0=least stressful, 10=extremely stressful)]. Most patients (70%) reported low to moderate stress (score &#8804;5). The number of previous injections did not influence stress scores. Paradoxically, 61.2% of patients reported finding injections to be less stressful over time. Most patients found injections to be less traumatic than expected (64%) or just as they had anticipated (25%). Most patients (88%) were not bothered by the presence of other patients in the waiting room. Most patients (78.8%) preferred to be injected quickly before they had time to feel stressed about the procedure. Injections were generally well accepted; most patients would prefer to maintain their current schedule of injections and their current vision (55.7%), or would be willing to have more frequent injections for better vision (39.5%). Our results suggest that stress appears to be more related to the patient's psychological make-up than to the treatment experience or the number of injections received.","Gualino, V; Fourmaux, E; Grenet, T; Zerbib, J; Wolff, B",,,77

341738,Highlights from the American Transplant Congress 2020,2020,"BACKGROUND: Substantial concern exists regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use behaviors. This is especially true for subpopulations like young men who have sex with men and young transgender women (YMSM-YTW) who report higher rates of substance use. This study examines changes in prevalence and frequency of marijuana and non-marijuana drug use among YMSM-YTW following the onset of the pandemic. METHOD: Data for this analysis (n = 458 participants, 1356 observations) come from an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of YMSM-YTW. A series of Bayesian multilevel models were used to examine change in prevalence and frequency of use for marijuana and non-marijuana drugs. RESULTS: Results indicated no systematic change in prevalence or frequency of marijuana use. However, a decrease in non-marijuana drug use was observed (OR = 0.60, 95 % CrI: [0.37, 0.94]) following the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, a small increase in the frequency of non-marijuana drug use was observed (OR = 1.79, 95 % CrI: [1.02, 3.21]) among individuals who used these substances. CONCLUSIONS: These findings concur with a small number of studies identifying a decrease in drug use prevalence but increase in frequency among those who continue to use drugs. Despite the protective effect of lower drug use prevalence, higher frequency of use may lead to additional negative health outcomes of drug use, particularly among groups facing multiple health challenges such as YMSM-YTW. However, the pandemic likely has a unique impact on substance use behaviors across subpopulations.","Janulis, Patrick; Newcomb, Michael E; Mustanski, Brian",Drug Alcohol Depend,,77

344778,Adverse drug reactions and interactions: first reports and special situations,2020,"Halogen bonding is studied in different structures consisting of halogenated guanine DNA bases, including the Hoogsteen guanine-guanine base pair, two different types of guanine ribbons (R-I and R-II) consisting of two or three monomers, and guanine quartets. In the halogenated base pairs (except the Cl-base pair, which has a very non-planar structure with no halogen bonds) and R-I ribbons (except the At trimer), the potential N-Xâ¢â¢â¢O interaction is sacrificed to optimise the N-Xâ¢â¢â¢N halogen bond. In the At trimer, the astatines originally bonded to N1 in the halogen bond donating guanines have moved to the adjacent O6 atom, enabling O-Atâ¢â¢â¢N, N-Atâ¢â¢â¢O, and N-Atâ¢â¢â¢At halogen bonds. The brominated and chlorinated R-II trimers contain two N-Xâ¢â¢â¢N and two N-Xâ¢â¢â¢O halogen bonds, whereas in the iodinated and astatinated trimers, one of the N-Xâ¢â¢â¢N halogen bonds is lost. The corresponding R-II dimers keep the same halogen bond patterns. The G-quartets display a rich diversity of symmetries and halogen bond patterns, including N-Xâ¢â¢â¢N, N-Xâ¢â¢â¢O, N-Xâ¢â¢â¢X, O-Xâ¢â¢â¢X, and O-Xâ¢â¢â¢O halogen bonds (the latter two facilitated by the transfer of halogens from N1 to O6). In general, halogenation decreases the stability of the structures. However, the stability increases with the increasing atomic number of the halogen, and the At-doped R-I trimer and the three most stable At-doped quartets are more stable than their hydrogenated counterparts. Significant deviations from linearity are found for some of the halogen bonds (with halogen bond angles around 150°).","Thornton, Nicholas J; van Mourik, Tanja",,,77
345339,Immune response and possible therapeutics in COVID-19,2020,"Importance: The COVID-19 pandemic led to sharp declines in cancer screening. However, the total deficit in screening in the US associated with the pandemic and the differential impact on individuals in different geographic regions and by socioeconomic status (SES) index have yet to be fully characterized. Objectives: To quantify the screening rates for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in different geographic regions and for individuals in different SES index quartiles and estimate the overall cancer screening deficit in 2020 across the US population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study uses the HealthCore Integrated Research Database, which comprises single-payer administrative claims data and enrollment information covering approximately 60 million people in Medicare Advantage and commercial health plans from across geographically diverse regions of the US. Participants were individuals in the database in January through July of 2018, 2019, and 2020 without diagnosis of the cancer of interest prior to the analytic index month. Exposures: Analytic index month and year. Main Outcomes and Measures: Receipt of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer screening. Results: Screening for all 3 cancers declined sharply in March through May of 2020 compared with 2019, with the sharpest decline in April (breast, -90.8%; colorectal, -79.3%; prostate, -63.4%) and near complete recovery of monthly screening rates by July for breast and prostate cancers. The absolute deficit across the US population in screening associated with the COVID-19 pandemic was estimated to be 3.9 million (breast), 3.8 million (colorectal), and 1.6 million (prostate). Geographic differences were observed: the Northeast experienced the sharpest declines in screening, while the West had a slower recovery compared with the Midwest and South. For example, percentage change in breast cancer screening rate (2020 vs 2019) for the month of April ranged from -87.3% (95% CI, -87.9% to -86.7%) in the West to -94.5% (95% CI, -94.9% to -94.1%) in the Northeast (decline). For the month of July, it ranged from -0.3% (95% CI, -2.1% to 1.5%) in the Midwest to -10.6% (-12.6% to -8.4%) in the West (recovery). By SES, the largest screening decline was observed in individuals in the highest SES index quartile, leading to a narrowing in the disparity in cancer screening by SES in 2020. For example, prostate cancer screening rates per 100â¯000 enrollees for individuals in the lowest and highest SES index quartiles, respectively, were 3525 (95% CI, 3444 to 3607) and 4329 (95% CI, 4271 to 4386) in April 2019 compared with 1535 (95% CI, 1480 to 1589) and 1338 (95% CI, 1306 to 1370) in April 2020. Multivariable analysis showed that telehealth use was associated with higher cancer screening. Conclusions and Relevance: Public health efforts are needed to address the large cancer screening deficit associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including increased use of screening modalities that do not require a procedure.","Chen, Ronald C; Haynes, Kevin; Du, Simo; Barron, John; Katz, Aaron J",JAMA Oncol,,77

It is a highly contagious disease, which elicits high levels of fear amongst the world population and is considered a threat to the world economy. As a response to this pandemic, international governments have devised unconventional measures to guard the health of their citizenry. Among these are the “new normal” country lockdown that mandates working from home, home-schooling of children, and physical/social distancing from friends and family. For the majority, this has resulted in momentary job loss and loneliness, and other psychological illnesses. Hence millions are frightened, depressed and panic easily as a result of the tension due to the uncertainty, which interferes with their job performance, livelihoods, international trade and the world economy. If not mitigated, this is likely to cause physical health deterioration, with severe mental illness being the outcome. To reduce mental health illnesses during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence suggests prioritising regular participation in physical activity and exercise across lifespan. It is also important for medical experts who specialise in the care and management of mental health to recognise physical activity and exercise as a medicine that can ameliorate some mental illnesses and their associated risk factors. © 2021 Onagbiye et al.","Onagbiye, S.

The sample comprised 189 healthcare workers (M = 33.06 ± 6.92), who were treating patients with COVID-19 in a pandemic hospital in Turkey. Ninety-one participants were males and 98 females. Participants completed measures of perceived coronavirus risk, coronavirus fear, mental well-being and parental coronavirus anxiety. Parental Coronavirus Anxiety Scale had a one-factor structure, with satisfactory reliability. Main findings showed that coronavirus fear mediated the relationship between coronavirus risk and parental coronavirus anxiety. Mental well-being moderated the effect of coronavirus risk on parental coronavirus anxiety. The mediation effect of coronavirus fear was moderated by mental well-being. These findings explain why and when mental well-being-based interventions could be effective in reducing perceived coronavirus risk, fear and parental coronavirus anxiety about their children.","Yildirim, Murat; Özaslan, Ahmet; Arslan, Gökmen",Psychol Health Med,,77
350130,Restoring confidence in vaccines in the COVID-19 era,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is general consensus that hand hygiene is the most effective way to prevent healthcare-associated infections. However, low rates of compliance amongst healthcare workers have been reported globally. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has further emphasized the need for global improvement in hand hygiene compliance by healthcare workers. AIM: This comprehensive systematic review provides an up-to-date compilation of clinical trials, reported between 2014 and 2020, assessing hand hygiene interventions in order to inform healthcare leaders and practitioners regarding approaches to reduce healthcare-associated infections using hand hygiene. METHODS: CINAHL, Cochrane, EMbase, Medline, PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical trials published between March 2014 and December 2020 on the topic of hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers. In total, 332 papers were identified from these searches, of which 57 studies met the inclusion criteria. FINDINGS: Forty-five of the 57 studies (79%) included in this review were conducted in Asia, Europe and the USA. The large majority of these clinical trials were conducted in acute care facilities, including hospital wards and intensive care facilities. Nurses represented the largest group of healthcare workers studied (44 studies, 77%), followed by physicians (41 studies, 72%). Thirty-six studies (63%) adopted the World Health Organization's multi-modal framework or a variation of this framework, and many of them recorded hand hygiene opportunities at each of the 'Five Moments'. However, recording of hand hygiene technique was not common. CONCLUSION: Both single intervention and multi-modal hand hygiene strategies can achieve modest-to-moderate improvements in hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers.","Clancy, C; Delungahawatta, T; Dunne, C P",J Hosp Infect,,77

354613,"The COVID-19 Vaccines: Recent Development, Challenges and Prospects",2021,"BACKGROUND: Older people are at increased risk of adverse health events because of reduced physical activity. There is concern that activity levels are further reduced in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as many older people are practicing physical and social distancing to minimize transmission. Mobile health (mHealth) and eHealth technologies may offer a means by which older people can engage in physical activity while physically distancing. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the evidence for mHealth or eHealth technology in the promotion of physical activity among older people aged 50 years or older. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of reviews using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We searched for systematic reviews published in the English language in 3 electronic databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, and Scopus. Two reviewers used predefined inclusion criteria to select relevant reviews and extracted data on review characteristics and intervention effectiveness. Two independent raters assessed review quality using the AMSTAR-2 tool. RESULTS: Titles and abstracts (n=472) were screened, and 14 full-text reviews were assessed for eligibility. Initially, we included 5 reviews but excluded 1 from the narrative as it was judged to be of critically low quality. Three reviews concluded that mHealth or eHealth interventions were effective in increasing physical activity. One review found that the evidence was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: There is low to moderate evidence that interventions delivered via mHealth or eHealth approaches may be effective in increasing physical activity in older adults in the short term. Components of successful interventions include self-monitoring, incorporation of theory and behavior change techniques, and social and professional support.","McGarrigle, Lisa; Todd, Chris",J Med Internet Res,,77

355059,The Editor's note. First taking the log out of our own eyes,2021,"BACKGROUND: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a toll on the world's health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic, and psychological well-being of humanity. Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (""corona,"" ""2019-nCov,"" and ""COVID-19""), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. RESULTS: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). CONCLUSIONS: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news.","Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa; Alhuwail, Dari; Househ, Mowafa; Hamdi, Mounir; Shah, Zubair",J Med Internet Res,,77

METHODS: Clinical characteristics of the patient was reviewed. Genomic DNA of the child was subjected to whole exome sequencing. RESULTS: Genetic testing has confirmed the diagnosis of congenital IAD by identification of compound heterozygous variants of the TBX19 gene, which included a pathogenic nonsense c.535C>T (p.R179X) variant inherited from his father and a novel missense c.298C>T (p.R100C) variant inherited from his mother. CONCLUSION: Congenital IAD due to variants of the TBX19 gene is a rare autosomal recessive disease. It is characterized by low plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels but normal levels of other pituitary hormones. Delayed diagnosis may lead to severe early-onset adrenal failure and wrong treatment which may result in neonatal mortality. Hydrocortisone replacement is effective. Detection of pathogenic variant of TBX19 gene is the key to diagnosis.","Wu, Shengnan; Chen, Qiong; Shen, Linghua; Wei, Haiyan; Chen, Yongxing",Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,,77
355716,Potential roles of medicinal plants for the treatment of viral diseases focusing on COVID-19: A review,2021,"On September 1, 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled for the playing of the national anthem arguing that he was ?not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,? noting that ?this is bigger than football and it would be selfish to look the other way There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder ? Kaepernick received a tremendous amount of backlash for this action, and many White fans/media pundits accused him of disrespecting the flag and U S military This act took place during the very contentious presidential election in the United States between eventual winner Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton During this election, the Trump campaign mobilized discourses of White nationalism, and even employed alt-right member Steve Bannon as Trump?s chief advisor for a period The Trump campaign capitalized on a set of White backlash politics that had been growing since the 1990s, and the reactions to Kaepernick?s protest cannot be separated from this larger context In this article, we critically read internet memes of Colin Kaepernick to gain insight into the relationship between race, gender, and the nation during the rise of Donald Trump to the U S presidency",,Journal of Sport and Social Issues,,77

356461,"Telerheumatology: before, during, and after a global pandemic",2021,"With the arrival of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the scientific academia, as well as policymakers, are striving to conceive solutions as an attempt to contain the spreading of contagion. Among the adopted measures, severe lockdown restrictions were issued to avoid the diffusion of the virus in an uncontrolled way through public spaces. It can be deduced from recent literature that the primary route of transmission is via aerosols, produced mainly in poorly ventilated interior areas where infected people spend a lot of time with other people. Concerning contagion rates, accumulated incidence or number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19, Spain, and Italy have reached very high levels. In this framework, a regression analysis to assess the feasibility of the indoor ventilation measures established in Spain and Italy, with respect to the European framework, is here presented. To this aim, ten cases of housing typology were and analyzed. The results show that the measures established in the applicable regulations to prevent and control the risk of contagion by aerosols are not adequate to guarantee a healthy environment indoors. The current Italian guidelines are more restrictive than in Spain, yet the ventilation levels are still insufficient in times of pandemic.","Lepore, Ester; Benito, Patricia Aguilera; Ramírez, Carolina Piña; Viccione, Giacomo",Sustain Cities Soc,,77

Due to this serious situation, it is extremely important to assess the prevalence and possible predictors of psychological distress in front-line, anti-epidemic medical staff. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through the use of the network crowdsourcing platform (which provides functions equivalent to Amazon Mechanical Turk) in Jilin, China. A total of 725 Jilin medical staff who had returned from Wuhan participated in the survey. The collected data included demographics and psychological responses to COVID-19, and the following tests were used to measure the data: (I) the Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS) was used to measure the types and levels of social support that were received by the medical staff; (II) the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SASRQ) was used to evaluate anxiety and dissociation symptoms in the aftermath of traumatic events; (III) the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure sleep quality; and (IV) the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) was used to evaluate nonspecific psychological distress. The &#967;2 test, Kruskal-Wallis test, ANOVA test and binary logistic regression were used to identify the factors that were correlated with psychological distress. RESULTS: In our study, 475 (65.5%) participants reported low psychological distress, and 72 (10%) participants reported high psychological distress. The results of the binary logistic regression analysis identified that the performance of physical activity in Wuhan (ß=-0.585; P<0.001; OR =0.557) and years of work experience (in contrast to approximately 0-5 years, approximately 6-15 years: ß=-1.258; P=0.008; OR =0.284, >15 years: ß=-0.562; P=0.016; OR =0.570) were protective factors for the possibility of having a mental disorder, whereas a high PSQI score (ß=0.106; P=0.024; OR =1.112) and a high SASRQ score (ß=0.242; P<0.001; OR =1.274) were risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The high psychological distress (10%) of Jilin medical staff who returned from the front-line areas of Wuhan was higher than that in other studies. Medical staff with less physical activity and work experience in Wuhan, as well as high PSQI and SASRQ scores, had higher psychological distress.","Wang, Han; Yao, Nan; Guo, Yinpei; Pan, Yingan; Sun, Mengzi; Yan, Shoumeng; Wang, Changcong; Zhao, Hantong; Li, Bo",Ann Palliat Med,,77

Methods: We characterized the epidemiological features and spread dynamics of COVID-19 in Niger, quantified the effective reproduction number (Rt ), evaluated the impact of public health control measures, and estimated the disease burden. Results: As of 4 July 2020, COVID-19 has affected 29 communes of Niger with 1093 confirmed cases, among whom 741 (67.8%) were males. Of them 89 cases died, resulting in a case fatality rate (CFR) of 8.1%. Both attack rates and CFRs were increased with age (P < 0.0001). Health care workers accounted for 12.8% cases. Among the reported cases, 39.3% were isolated and treated at home, and 42.3% were asymptomatic. 74.6% cases were clustered in Niamey, the capital of Niger. The Rt fluctuated in correlation to control measures at different outbreak stages. After the authorities initiated the national response and implemented the strictest control measures, Rt quickly dropped to below the epidemic threshold (<1), and maintained low level afterward. The national disability-adjusted life years attributable to COVID-19 was 1267.38 years in total, of which years of life lost accounted for over 99.1%. Conclusions: Classic public health control measures such as prohibition of public gatherings, travelling ban, contact tracing, and isolation and quarantine at home, are proved to be effective to contain the outbreak in Niger, and provide guidance for controlling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in LDCs.","Tchole, Ali Issakou Malam; Li, Zhen-Wei; Wei, Jia-Te; Ye, Run-Ze; Wang, Wen-Jing; Du, Wan-Yu; Wang, Hai-Tao; Yin, Chao-Nan; Ji, Xiao-Kang; Xue, Fu-Zhong; Bachir, Alassan Maman; Zhao, Lin; Cao, Wu-Chun",J Glob Health,,77

Should he opt out of the care of these patients or does his duty to care override other considerations? SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Older adults and those with serious medical conditions are at much greater risk for severe disease and death from Covid-19 infection. As a practicing frontline surgeon in a high risk group, the hospital offered the author, and other health care providers at high risk, the option to opt out of the care Covid-19 suspected or infected patients before an anticipated surge. What should the surgeon and other health care providers do? This is a question many are asking and having to answer. METHODS: In this article, the author describes how difficult the situation of having any choice at all was and then how difficult it was to arrive at a decision. The duty to care and its limits, as well as obligations to society, family, co-workers, and to self, are examined. The author considers how he and others can contribute in other ways to patients and providers. CONCLUSION: The author arrives at a morally permissible and a rational decision to opt out. Health care workers at high risk can contribute in other ways to patients and providers. It still may not feel right.","Hanto, Douglas W",Ann. surg,,77

The Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccine Announcement Reduced Political Trust (preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: the ability to implement effective preventive and control measures is rooted in public health surveillance to promptly identify and isolate contagious patients OBJECTIVES: to describe some organizational aspects and resources involved in the control of COVID-19 pandemic DESIGN: observational cross sectional study SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: a survey of methods and tools adopted by the competent service (Prevention department) in the Local public health units (LHU) of the regional Health services has been performed in May 2020 The survey collected data related to activities carried out during the month of April 2020 on the surveillance system for collection of suspected cases, their virological ascertainment, the isolation procedures and contact-tracing activities by means of an online questionnaire filled in by the public health structure of the regional health system A convenience sample of Prevention departments was recruited RESULTS: in 44 Prevention departments of 14 Regions/Autonomous Provinces (caring for 40% of the population residing in Italy), different services were swiftly engaged in pandemic response Reports of suspected cases were about 3 times the number of confirmed cases in the same month Local reporting form was used in 46% of the LHUs while a regional form was available in 42% of the Departments (in 9/14 Regions) In one fourth the forms were not always used and 2% had no forms for the reporting of suspected cases Data were recorded in 52% of LHUs on local databases, while in 20% a regional database (in 7 Regions) had been created A proportion of 11% did not record the data for further elaboration The virological assessment with nasopharyngeal swabs out of the hospital setting was carried out on the average in 7 points in each LHU (median 5) and the average daily capacity was 350 (71 per 100,000) swabs The rate of subjects newly tested during the month of April was of 893 per 100,000 new people Data collected at the swabbing were recorded on a regional platform in 17 LHUs (39%) of 8 Regions In 7% LHUs only positive specimens were recorded electronically Local files were used in 27% LHUs The interview with confirmed cases was carried out with a local questionnaire in 52% LHUs, while 14% stated that a standardized form was not used The data collected about cases were recorded on a regional IT platform in 30% Departments (in 8 Regions) and in 41% data were registered only locally For each confirmed case in April, a median of 4 contacts were identified Only 13 (30%) Departments in 9 Regions have registered contact data on a regional database Ten Departments (23%) have only hard copies, while 56% recorded data on local databases About 5 health professionals for 100,000 resident population were involved in each LHU in each of the following activities as receiving reports of suspected cases, swabs collection, interviews of cases and contact identifications CONCLUSIONS: the pandemic required rapidly a great organizational effort and great flexibility to increase response capacity, which now must be strengthened and maintained Several different tools (forms and electronic files) have been developed in each LHU and used for the same surveillance operational processes with a loss in local efficiency The inhomogeneous data collection and recording is an obstacle for further analyses and risk identifications and is a missed opportunity for the advancement of our knowledge on pandemic epidemiology analysis In Italy, updating the pandemic response plans is the priority, at national, regional and local level, and the occasion to fill the gaps and to improve surveillance systems to the interruption of COVID-19 transmission","Salmaso, S.; Zambri, F.; Renzi, M.; Giusti, A.",Epidemiologia e Prevenzione,,77
362365,Use of Natural Compounds as a potential therapeutic agent against COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic will have long-term consequences due to social and economic disruption. This study aimed to understand the contextual, media, and economic factors associated with anticipated mental health consequences from the COVID-19 pandemic among Americans. A nationally representative survey of 1001 respondents was conducted in April 2020. Chi-square tests and logistic regressions examined anticipated emotional or psychological effects on respondents or members of their households should social distancing measures continue. Specific analyses focused on: 1) COVID-19 experience - knowing someone or being infected; living in a state with a high death rate; or state social distancing policies; 2) media exposure - source of coronavirus information and time spent on coronavirus news; and 3) economics - current economic effects; and anticipated long-term financial effects. 41% of respondents anticipated mental health consequences. Living in a state with a greater COVID-19 death rate (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.10, 2.72) and anticipating long-term financial difficulties (OR 2.98; 95% CI 1.93, 4.60) were both associated with greater likelihood of anticipated mental health consequences. Those whose primary news source was television, as opposed to print or online, were almost 50% less likely to anticipate mental health challenges (OR 0.52 CI 0.33, 0.81), while those who reported spending two or more hours daily on COVID-19 news were 90% more likely (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.27, 2.85). Aspects of community health, media consumption, and economic impacts influence anticipated poor mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting each domain is relevant to interventions to address the consequences.","Piltch-Loeb, Rachael; Merdjanoff, Alexis; Meltzer, Gabriella",Prev Med,,77

364158,A review on human body fluids for the diagnosis of viral infections: scope for rapid detection of COVID-19,2021,"Debates within urban studies concerning the relationship between urbanisation and infectious disease focus on issues of urban population growth, density, migration and connectivity. However, an effective long-term risk and wellbeing agenda, without which the threat of future pandemics cannot be mitigated, must also take account of demographic forces and changes as critical drivers of transmission and mortality risk within and beyond cities. A better understanding of the dynamics of fertility, mortality and changing age structures ? key determinants of urban decline/growth in addition to migration ? provides the foundation upon which healthier cities and a healthy global urban system can be developed. The study of how basic demographic attributes and trends are distributed in space and how they interact with risks, including those of infectious disease, must be incorporated as a priority into a post-COVID-19 urban public health agenda. This perspective concurs with recent debates in urban studies emphasising the demographic drivers of urban change. Moreover, it raises critical questions about the microbial and environmental emphasis of much research on the interface of urban health and governance.","Duminy, James",Urban Studies,,77
366170,The Pleasurability of Scratching an Itch Amongst Different Pruritic Conditions,2020,"Humans have evolved perceptual acuity toward environmental cues heuristically associated with communicable disease that elicits an aversion. One heuristic cue that humans utilize to infer contamination threat is ingroup-outgroup status, with prejudices arising toward outgroup members due to potential novel pathogen exposure. The current study sought to investigate how disease responses in the US population have been modulated by the COVID-19 pandemic, given its origins in China, an outgroup population. We predicted that participants expressing heightened perceived vulnerability to disease and greater levels of conservatism would report higher levels of aversion towards targets not wearing a mask, particularly among Asian targets, given the association of COVID-19 with Asian populations. Results indicate that conservative individuals were more comfortable with both Asian and White targets if they were not wearing a mask, particularly male targets. We contextualize these findings by identifying how mask-wearing during the pandemic could be more communicative of one's coalitional affiliation rather than a protective health measure for more conservative persons.","Boykin, Kaitlyn; Brown, Mitch; Macchione, Alicia L; Drea, Kelsey M; Sacco, Donald F",Evol Psychol Sci,,77

DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University Hospital. PATIENT: Few days after the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, a 21-year-old woman experienced massive thrombosis in the deep and superficial cerebral veins together with seizures, neurologic focal deficit, and thrombocytopenia. In the neurointensive care unit, her condition worsened despite early decompressive craniectomy. She developed bilateral segmental pulmonary embolism, left hepatic, and left external iliac venous thrombosis. INTERVENTION: Argatroban (0.5-2.2 µg/kg/min) and high-dose IV immunoglobulin (1 g/kg/d for 2 consecutive days) were initiated on day 6 after admission. With these therapies, there was a gradual resolution of multiple sites of venous thrombosis, and platelet count returned to normal. The patient left the ICU with full consciousness, expressive aphasia, and right hemiparesis. CONCLUSIONS: This case of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia shows that a good outcome can be obtained even with multiple and life-threatening venous thrombotic lesions. Argatroban and high-dose IV immunoglobulin along with management of severe cerebral venous thrombosis played a major role in this epilogue.","Bersinger, Samuel; Lagarde, Kevin; Marlu, Raphael; Pernod, Gilles; Payen, Jean-Francois",Crit. care med,,77
369066,Human IgG and IgA responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines,2021,"The sudden increase in the COVID-19 epidemic affected by novel coronavirus 2019 has jeopardized public health worldwide. Hence the necessities of a drug or therapeutic agent that heal SARS-CoV-2 infections are essential requirements. The viral genome encodes a large Polyprotein, further processed by the main protease/ 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like proteases (PLpro) into 16 nonstructural proteins to form a viral replication complex. These essential functions of 3CLpro and PLpro in virus duplication make these proteases a promising target for discovering potential therapeutic candidates and possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aimed to screen a unique set of protease inhibitors library against 3CLpro and PLpro of the SARS-CoV-2. A molecular docking study was performed using PyRx to reveal the binding affinity of the selected ligands and molecular dynamic simulations were executed to assess the three-dimensional stability of protein-ligand complexes. The pharmacodynamics parameters of the inhibitors were predicted using admetSAR. The top two ligands (Nafamostat and VR23) based on docking scores were selected for further studies. Selected ligands showed excellent pharmacokinetic properties with proper absorption, bioavailability and minimal toxicity. Due to the emerging and efficiency of remdesivir and dexamethasone in healing COVID-19 patients, ADMET properties of the selected ligands were thus compared with it. MD Simulation studies up to 100ns revealed the ligands' stability at the target proteins' binding site residues. Therefore, Nafamostat and VR23 may provide potential treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 infections by potentially inhibiting virus duplication though more research is warranted.","Bhowmik, Deep; Sharma, Ravi Datta; Prakash, Amresh; Kumar, Diwakar",J Mol Struct,,77

370149,COVID-19: searching for clues among other respiratory viruses,2020,"AIMS: The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become a global health concern. There are currently no effective treatment strategies and vaccines for the treatment or prevention of this fatal disease. The current study aims to determine promising treatment options for the COVID-19 through a computational drug repurposing approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we focus on differentially expressed genes (DEGs), detected in SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines including ""the primary human lung epithelial cell line NHBE"" and ""the transformed lung alveolar cell line A549"". Next, the identified DEGs are used in the connectivity map (CMap) analysis to identify similarly acting therapeutic candidates. Furthermore, to interpret lists of DEGs, pathway enrichment and protein network analysis are performed. Genes are categorized into easily interpretable pathways based on their biological functions, and overrepresentation of each pathway is tested in comparison to what is expected randomly. KEY FINDINGS: The results suggest the effectiveness of lansoprazole, folic acid, sulfamonomethoxine, tolnaftate, diclofenamide, halcinonide, saquinavir, metronidazole, ebselen, lidocaine and benzocaine, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors, and many other clinically approved drugs as potent drugs against COVID-19 outbreak. SIGNIFICANCE: Making new drugs remain a lengthy process, so the drug repurposing approach provides an insight into the therapeutics that might be helpful in this pandemic. In this study, pathway enrichment and protein network analysis are also performed, and the effectiveness of some drugs obtained from the CMap analysis has been investigated according to previous researches.","Mousavi, Seyedeh Zahra; Rahmanian, Mojdeh; Sami, Ashkan",Infect Genet Evol,,77

There are no efficacy data available regarding these patients with any of the available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We analyzed the humoral response following full vaccination with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) in 136 kidney transplant recipients, and compared it to 25 controls. In order to exclude prior exposure to the virus, only participants with negative serology to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were included. All controls developed a positive response to spike protein, while only 51 of 136 transplant recipients (37.5%) had positive serology (p < .001). Mean IgG anti-spike level was higher in the controls (31.05 [41.8] vs. 200.5 [65.1] AU/mL, study vs. control, respectively, p < .001). Variables associated with null humoral response were older age (odds ratio 1.66 [95% confidence interval 1.17-2.69]), high-dose corticosteroids in the last 12 months (1.3 [1.09-1.86]), maintenance with triple immunosuppression (1.43 [1.06-2.15]), and regimen that includes mycophenolate (1.47 [1.26-2.27]). There was a similar rate of side effects between controls and recipients, and no correlation was found between the presence of symptoms and seroconversion. Our findings suggest that most kidney transplant recipients remain at high risk for COVID-19 despite vaccination. Further studies regarding possible measures to increase recipient's response to vaccination are required.","Grupper, Ayelet; Rabinowich, Liane; Schwartz, Doron; Schwartz, Idit F; Ben-Yehoyada, Merav; Shashar, Moshe; Katchman, Eugene; Halperin, Tami; Turner, Dan; Goykhman, Yaacov; Shibolet, Oren; Levy, Sharon; Houri, Inbal; Baruch, Roni; Katchman, Helena",Am. j. transplant,,77

371008,"Low Vitamin D Status in a Cancer Patient Population from Franconia, Germany",2020,"It is well known in quantum mechanics that a large energy gap between a Hilbert subspace of specific interest and the remainder of the spectrum can suppress transitions from the quantum states inside the subspace to those outside due to additional couplings that mix these states, and thus approximately lead to a constrained dynamics within the subspace. While this statement has widely been used to approximate quantum dynamics in various contexts, a general and quantitative justification stays lacking. Here we establish an observable-based error bound for such a constrained-dynamics approximation in generic gapped quantum systems. This universal bound is a linear function of time that only involves the energy gap and coupling strength, provided that the latter is much smaller than the former. We demonstrate that either the intercept or the slope in the bound is asymptotically saturable by simple models. We generalize the result to quantum many-body systems with local interactions, for which the coupling strength diverges in the thermodynamic limit while the error is found to grow no faster than a power law t^{d+1} in d dimensions. Our work establishes a universal and rigorous result concerning nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.","Gong, Zongping; Yoshioka, Nobuyuki; Shibata, Naoyuki; Hamazaki, Ryusuke",Phys Rev Lett,,77

The exactly mechanism of such hypoxemia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not well described. It has been suggested that microthrombosis contributes to this mechanism, increasing pulmonary dead space. However, dead spaces would not be sensible to oxygen supplementation, and also, enlargement of pulmonary vessels it has been evidenced. Shunt mechanism by vasodilatation, instead, could explain decubitus dependence in oxygenation by blood redistribution as observed in these patients, and moreover, would be more sensible to oxygen supplementation than dead spaces. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 causes an intrapulmonary vascular dilatation (IPVD), determining a shunt mechanism by vasodilatation. We performed contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography to search IPVD shunt in patients with confirmed COVID-19, hospitalized in an intensive care unit. Ten patients were recruited; one patient was excluded due to low quality of echocardiographic image, and nine patients were included. IPVD was found in seven (78%) patients, with different grades, including patient with normal compliance and the one without invasive ventilation. We demonstrated that shunt by IPVD is present among patients with COVID-19, and this mechanism is probably implicated in significant hypoxemia observed.","Brito-Azevedo, Anderson; Pinto, Eduardo Costa; de Cata Preta Corrêa, Gabriel Angelo; Bouskela, Eliete",J. med. virol,,77

375986,COVID 19: a clue from innate immunity,2020,"Any data analysis, especially the data sets that may be changing often or in real-time, consists of at least three important synchronized components: i) figuring out what to infer (objectives), ii) analysis or computation of objectives, and iii) understanding of the results which may require drill-down and/or visualization. There is a lot of attention paid to the first two of the above components as part of research whereas the understanding as well as deriving actionable decisions is quite tricky. Visualization is an important step towards both understanding (even by non-experts) and inferring the actions that need to be taken. As an example, for Covid-19, knowing regions (say, at the county or state level) that have seen a spike or prone to a spike in cases in the near future may warrant additional actions with respect to gatherings, business opening hours, etc. This paper focuses on an extensible architecture for visualization of base as well as analyzed data. This paper proposes a modular architecture of a dashboard for user-interaction, visualization management, and complex analysis of base data. The contributions of this paper are: i) extensibility of the architecture providing flexibility to add additional analysis, visualizations, and user interactions without changing the workflow, ii) decoupling of the functional modules to ease and speedup development by different groups, and iii) address efficiency issues for display response time. This paper uses Multilayer Networks (or MLNs) for analysis. To showcase the above, we present the implementation of a visualization dashboard, termed CoWiz++ (for Covid Wizard), and elaborate on how web-based user interaction and display components are interfaced seamlessly with the back end modules.","Santra, Abhishek; Samant, Kunal; Memeti, Endrit; Karim, Enamul; Chakravarthy, Sharma",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05357v1.pdf,77
376075,Corrigendum,2020,"ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; no specific effective medication to treat the disease has been identified to date. We aimed to investigate the administered medications and intervention times for patients who completely recovered from COVID-19.This single-center, retrospective, observational study included 55 patients with COVID-19 who were transferred to Shenyang Sixth People's Hospital between January 20 and March 15, 2020. Data on demographics, symptoms, laboratory indicators, treatment processes, and clinical outcomes were collected. Administered drugs and intervention times were compared in 47 and 8 patients with mild and severe symptoms, respectively.All 55 patients recovered. Fifty-three patients (96.36%) received antiviral therapy, including 45 in the mild group (median treatment: 14 days; 17 received umifenovir) and all 8 severe-group patients (median treatment: 17.5 days; 4 received lopinavir/ritonavir). Twenty-nine patients (52.72%) were administered antibiotics, including 21 in the mild group (median treatment: 13.5 days; 15 received moxifloxacin) and all 8 in the severe group (median treatment: 9 days; 2 received linezolid). Moreover, 7 patients (12.72%) were treated with glucocorticoids and 9 (16.36%) with immunomodulators.Given the 100% recovery rate, early administration of antiviral drugs can be considered. Umifenovir may benefit patients with mild symptoms, while lopinavir/ritonavir may benefit those with severe symptoms. Prophylactic administration of common antibiotics may reduce the risk of co-infection. The use of glucocorticoids is usually not necessary. Randomized, double-blind, and controlled trials remain necessary for more accurate conclusions.","Fan, Lichao; Liu, Huan; Li, Na; Liu, Chang; Gu, Ye; Liu, Yongyu; Chen, Yu",Medicine (Baltimore),,77
376194,"Gastrointestinal Endoscopy during COVID: Do Some, Leave Most",2020,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is characterized by pneumonia, lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes and a cytokine storm. Several reports from around the world have identified obesity and severe obesity as one of the strongest risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Moreover, countries with greater obesity prevalence have a higher morbidity and mortality risk of developing serious outcomes from COVID-19. The understanding of how this increased susceptibility of the people with obesity to develop severe forms of the SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs is crucial for implementing appropriate public health and therapeutic strategies to avoid COVID-19 severe symptoms and complications in people living with obesity. We hypothesize here that increased ACE2 expression in adipose tissue displayed by people with obesity may increase SARS-CoV-2 infection and accessibility to this tissue. Individuals with obesity have increased white adipose tissue, which may act as a reservoir for a more extensive viral spread with increased shedding, immune activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine amplification. Here we discuss how obesity is related to a pro-inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation, increased SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry in adipose tissue and induction of hypercoagulopathy, leading people with obesity to develop severe forms of COVID-19 and also death. Taken together, it may be crucial to better explore the role of visceral adipose tissue in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and investigate the potential therapeutic effect of using specific target anti-inflammatories (canakinumab or anakinra for IL-1ß inhibition; anti-IL-6 antibodies for IL-6 inhibition), anticoagulant or anti-diabetic drugs in COVID-19 treatment of people with obesity. Defining the immunopathological changes in COVID-19 patients with obesity can provide prominent targets for drug discovery and clinical management improvement.","Pasquarelli-do-Nascimento, Gabriel; Braz-de-Melo, Heloísa Antoniella; Faria, Sara Socorro; Santos, Igor de Oliveira; Kobinger, Gary P; Magalhães, Kelly Grace",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,77

378281,We are forever changed—and not,2020,"BACKGROUND: As a priority group, healthcare personnel (HCP) will be key to success of COVID-19 vaccination programs. The purpose of this study was to assess HCP willingness to get vaccinated and identify specific concerns that would undermine vaccination efforts. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCP, including clinical and non-clinical staff, researchers, and trainees between November 23 rd ,2020 and December 5 th ,2020. The survey evaluated attitudes, beliefs and willingness to get vaccinated. RESULTS: A total of 5287 respondents had a mean age of 42.5 years (SD=13.56), and were 72.8% female (n=3842). Overall 57.5 % of individuals expressed intent to receive COVID-19 vaccine. 80.4% were physicians and scientists representing the largest group. 33.6% of registered nurses, 31.6% of allied health professionals, and 32% of master's level clinicians were unsure they would take the vaccine (p<.001). Respondents who were older, males, White, or Asian were more likely to get vaccinated compared to other groups. Vaccine safety, potential adverse events, efficacy and speed of vaccine development dominated concerns listed by participants. Fewer (54.0%) providers of direct care vs. non-care providers (62.4%), and 52.0% of those who had provided care for COVID-19 patients (vs. 60.6% of those who had not) indicated they would take the vaccine if offered (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that self-reported willingness to receive vaccination against COVID-19 differs by hospital roles, with physicians and research scientists showing the highest acceptance. These findings highlight important heterogeneity in personal attitudes among HCPs around COVID-19 vaccines and highlight a need for tailored communication strategies.","Shaw, Jana; Stewart, Telisa; Anderson, Kathryn B; Hanley, Samantha; Thomas, Stephen J; Salmon, Daniel A; Morley, Christopher",Clin. infect. dis,,77

This report brings forward the experience of this consortium, based on the real-world challenges which we encountered in testing patients and in supporting the recovery effort to reestablish the health care workplace. In coordination with the Greater New York Hospital Association and with the public health laboratory of New York State, this consortium communicated with state leadership to help inform public decision-making addressing the crisis. Through the length of the pandemic, the consortium has been a critical mechanism for sharing experience and best practices in dealing with issues including the following: instrument platforms, sample sources, test performance, pre- and post-analytical issues, supply chain, institutional testing capacity, pooled testing, biospecimen science, and research. The consortium also has been a mechanism for staying abreast of state and municipal policies and initiatives, and their impact on institutional and laboratory operations.

Statistical analysis was done on SPSS version 20. RESULTS: Age above 45 years, diabetes, hypertension, history of COVID contact were independent risk factors for COVID positivity. HCQ intake did not show an independent association. However, when adjusted for other risk factors, HCQ dose as per Government recommendations, 2-3, 4-5 and 6 or more weeks reduced the probability of COVID positivity by 34%, 48%, 72% respectively. COVID free median survival time was higher in non-diabetics, non-hypertensives, persons below 45 years, with no prior exposure to COVID case and those who took HCQ for more than 6 weeks With modeling extent of risk reduction under different scenarios of risk and HCQ intake was 1-65% . Major adverse events reported were GI disorder, palpitation, giddiness and 140 persons discontinued due to adverse events. LIMITATIONS: Limitation of self reporting by HCWs in online form, minimized by specified options,mandatory fields and telephonic verificationConclusion: The study examined individual risk factors including site variations and found that HCQ 800 mg loading followed by 400 mg weekly, dose for more than 2 weeks, reduced the risk of COVID-19, in HCWs, and is a useful option in low resource settings till vaccines are made accessible to all.

390856,Hermes,2020,"BACKGROUND: The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) includes multitarget stool DNA (mt-sDNA) testing as a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening option in average-risk individuals, but data on colonoscopy outcomes after positive mt-sDNA tests in community settings are needed. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate colonoscopy outcomes and quality following positive mt-sDNA in the population-based New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry. METHODS: We compared colonoscopy outcomes and quality between age-matched, sex-matched, and risk-matched patients from 30 endoscopy practices with and without a preceding positive mt-sDNA test. Main outcomes were colonoscopy findings of CRC, advanced noncancerous neoplasia, nonadvanced neoplasia, or normal examination. Quality measures included withdrawal time, bowel preparation quality, examination completion, and percentage of average-risk individuals with normal colonoscopies receiving a USPSTF-recommended 10 year rescreening interval. RESULTS: Individuals with positive mt-sDNA tests (N=306, average age 67.0 y; 61.8% female) were significantly more likely than colonoscopy-only patients (N=918, 66.2 y; 61.8% female) to have CRC (1.3% vs. 0.4%) or advanced noncancerous neoplasia (27.1% vs. 8.2%) (P<0.0001). Neoplasia was found in 68.0% of patients having colonoscopy after a positive mt-sDNA test, (positive predictive value, was 68.0%), versus 42.3% of patients with colonoscopy only (P<0.0001). No significant differences in colonoscopy quality measures were observed between cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Colonoscopy after a positive mt-sDNA test was more frequently associated with CRC and colorectal neoplasia than colonoscopy alone. Positive mt-sDNA tests can enrich the proportion of colonoscopies with clinically relevant findings. Follow-up recommendations suggest that endoscopists do not inappropriately shorten rescreening intervals in mt-sDNA-positive patients with normal colonoscopy.

391074,Is SARSCoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab still a gold standard in children?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Sudden public health restrictions can be difficult to comprehend for people with cognitive deficits. However, these are even more important for them to adhere to due to their increased levels of vulnerability, particularly to COVID-19. With a lack of previous evidence, we explored the understanding and changes in adherence to COVID-19 public health restrictions over time in people living with dementia (PLWD). METHODS: Unpaid carers and PLWD were interviewed over the phone in April 2020, shortly after the nationwide UK lockdown, with a proportion followed up from 24th June to 10th July. Participants were recruited via social care and third sector organisations across the UK, and via social media. FINDINGS: A total of 70 interviews (50 baseline, 20 follow-up) were completed with unpaid carers and PLWD. Five themes emerged: Confusion and limited comprehension; Frustration and burden; Putting oneself in danger; Adherence to restrictions in wider society; (Un) changed perceptions. Most carers reported limited to no understanding of the public health measures in PLWD, causing distress and frustration for both the carer and the PLWD. Due to the lack of understanding, some PLWD put themselves in dangerous situations without adhering to the restrictions. PLWD with cognitive capacity who participated understood the measures and adhered to these. DISCUSSION: In light of the new second wave of the pandemic, public health measures need to be simpler for PLWD to avoid unwilful non-adherence. Society also needs to be more adaptive to the needs of people with cognitive disabilities more widely, as blanket rules cause distress to the lives of those affected by dementia.","Giebel, Clarissa; Hanna, Kerry; Rajagopal, Manoj; Komuravelli, Aravind; Cannon, Jacqueline; Shenton, Justine; Eley, Ruth; Gaughan, Anna; Callaghan, Steve; Tetlow, Hilary; Limbert, Stan; Whittington, Rosie; Rogers, Carol; Ward, Kym; Shaw, Lisa; Butchard, Sarah; Gabbay, Mark",BMC Public Health,,77

391793,A timely update of global COVID-19 vaccine development,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has dramatically changed our world, country, communities, and families. There is controversy regarding risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. It has been suggested that asthma and allergy are not highly represented as comorbid conditions associated with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to extend our work in IL-13 biology to determine whether airway epithelial cell expression of 2 key mediators critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, namely, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), are modulated by IL-13. METHODS: We determined effects of IL-13 treatment on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in primary airway epithelial cells from participants with and without type 2 asthma obtained by bronchoscopy. We also examined expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in 2 data sets containing gene expression data from nasal and airway epithelial cells from children and adults with asthma and allergic rhinitis. RESULTS: IL-13 significantly reduced ACE2 and increased TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in airway epithelial cells. In 2 independent data sets, ACE2 expression was significantly reduced and TMPRSS2 expression was significantly increased in the nasal and airway epithelial cells in type 2 asthma and allergic rhinitis. ACE2 expression was significantly negatively associated with type 2 cytokines, whereas TMPRSS2 expression was significantly positively associated with type 2 cytokines. CONCLUSION: IL-13 modulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in airway epithelial cells in asthma and atopy. This deserves further study with regard to any effects that asthma and atopy may render in the setting of COVID-19 infection.","Kimura, Hiroki; Francisco, Dave; Conway, Michelle; Martinez, Fernando D; Vercelli, Donata; Polverino, Francesca; Billheimer, Dean; Kraft, Monica",J Allergy Clin Immunol,,77

In this paper, we present a deep theoretical analysis of threshold query evaluation and show that thresholds can be used to significantly improve the asymptotic bounds of state-of-the-art query evaluation algorithms. We also empirically show that threshold queries are significant in practice. In surprising contrast to conventional wisdom, we found important scenarios in real-world data sets in which users are interested in computing the results of queries up to a certain threshold, independent of a ranking function that orders the query results by importance.","Bonifati, Angela; Dumbrava, Stefania; Fletcher, George; Hidders, Jan; Hofer, Matthias; Martens, Wim; Murlak, Filip; Shinavier, Joshua; Staworko, Slawek; Tomaszuk, Dominik",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15703v1.pdf,77

This study uses data from an online discrete choice experiment with 1371 respondents to rigorously examine the factors shaping vaccine preference in the country. We find that vaccine efficacy, presence of side effects, protection duration, distance to vaccination centre and vaccination rates within social networks play a critical role in determining vaccine demand. We apply a non-parametric model to uncover the heterogeneity in the effects of these factors. We derive two novel insights from this analysis. First, even though, on average, domestically developed vaccines are preferred, around 30 percent of the sample favours foreign-developed vaccines. Second, the vaccine preference of around 15 percent of the sample is highly sensitive to the presence of side effects and vaccination uptake among their peer group. These results provide insights into the ongoing policy debate around vaccine adoption in India.","Bansal, Prateek; Raj, Alok; Shukla, Dhirendra Mani; Sunder, Naveen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07807v1.pdf,77

As one of the criteria of a variant of concern (VOC) is that it affects disease severity, the authors sought to understand whether the Alpha and Gamma VOCs are significantly different in these two parameters than the original wildtype of SARS-CoV-2, the most prevalent in relevant areas of Canada as of study initiation. Searches for studies were conducted in Scopus and PubMed, and located through following citations and receiving studies from daily literature scans. For the hospitalization outcome, effect ratios relative to original wildtype were included. For the symptomatic ratio, the ratio itself for each variant was used. Analysis of age-related effects was of particular value, as CAF members are primarily adults under the age of 60. The firmest conclusion of this review is that the Alpha VOC comes with a higher relative risk of hospitalization compared to the original wildtype, most likely above 1.4, while unlikely to be above 2, with the balance of evidence being that the relative risk is not significantly modified by age. The evidence for Gamma is more limited, but the odds ratio may be above 2, and potentially much greater than that, especially for those 20-39 years of age. For both VOCs reports on symptomatic ratio differed on whether there was an effect, as well as its potential direction.","Schroeder, Alexandra; MacLeod, Matthew R",,,77

We use a new estimator, the Augmented Synthetic Control Method (ASCM), that overcomes some limits of the standard Synthetic Control Method (SCM). The results are twofold. From a methodological point of view, the ASCM outperforms the SCM in that the latter cannot select a valid donor set, assigning all the weights to only one country (Spain) while placing zero weights to all the remaining. From an empirical point of view, we find strong evidence of the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in avoiding losses of human lives in Italy: conservative estimates indicate that for each human life actually lost, in the absence of lockdown there would have been on average other 1.15, the policy saved in total 20,400 human lives.","Cerqueti, Roy; Coppier, Raffaella; Girardi, Alessandro; Ventura, Marco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11901v1.pdf,77

This approach yields semi-quantitative results that depend on the proportion of the population already infected and vaccinated. We introduce the COVimpact software, which allows users to visualise estimated numbers of ICU admissions, deaths, and infections stratified by age class at the French departmental, regional, or national level caused by the wave. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by showing that for France, even with a 95% vaccination coverage, the current vaccine efficiency against the delta variant would make a large epidemic wave infecting 25% of the population difficult to sustain for the current hospital bed occupancy capacity. Overall, using the final epidemic wave size and ignoring detailed epidemiological dynamics yields valuable and practical insights to optimise public health response to epidemics.","Boennec, Corentin; Alizon, Samuel; Sofonea, Mircea T.",,,77

In March 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act,§ which appropriated $750 million for Head Start, equating to approximately $875 in CARES Act funds per enrolled child. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, most states required all schools (K-12) to close or transition to virtual learning. The Office of Head Start gave its local programs that remained open the flexibility to use CARES Act funds to implement CDC-recommended guidance (1) and other ancillary measures to provide in-person services in the early phases of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in April and May 2020, when many similar programs remained closed. Guidance included information on masks, other personal protective equipment, physical setup, supplies necessary for maintaining healthy environments and operations, and the need for additional staff members to ensure small class sizes. Head Start programs successfully implemented CDC-recommended mitigation strategies and supported other practices that helped to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission among children and staff members. CDC conducted a mixed-methods analysis to document these approaches and inform implementation of mitigation strategies in other child care settings. Implementing and monitoring adherence to recommended mitigation strategies reduces risk for COVID-19 transmission in child care settings. These approaches could be applied to other early care and education settings that remain open for in-person learning and potentially reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Coronado, Fátima; Blough, Sara; Bergeron, Deborah; Proia, Krista; Sauber-Schatz, Erin; Beltran, Marco; Rau, Katherine Troy; McMichael, Andria; Fortin, Tracye; Lackey, Mark; Rohs, Jovanna; Sparrow, Tracey; Baldwin, Grant",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,77

Examining the level of this cytokine along with other related factors can help to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease. In this cross-sectional study, 48 patients with COVID-19 whose disease was confirmed by swap testing were evaluated. The demographic information of the individuals, the symptoms of the disease, and the ward in which they were admitted were recorded. Blood samples were taken from patients to test for interleukin-6 levels by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA, Roche Diagnostics). Due to the lack of specific treatment protocols for patients and the use of supportive treatments based on meeting the nutritional needs for all patients, blood albumin levels and nutritional status of patients were also evaluated using Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) Form. Their calorie intake was assessed by calculating the number of calories received based on the type of nutrition and compared to the required amount calculated through the Harris-Benedict equation. 48 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infected patients were included in the study with the mean age of 46.4 ± 8.3 years. 21 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). There was no significant difference between the ICU admitted and patients admitted inward in terms of demographic characteristics, and history of previous diseases (p &gt; 0.05).

Responding to this, a weekly virtual coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) neurology multi-disciplinary meeting was established at the National Hospital, Queen Square, in early March 2020 in order to discuss and begin to understand neurological presentations in patients with suspected COVID-19-related neurological disorders. Detailed clinical and paraclinical data were collected from cases where the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed through RNA PCR, or where the diagnosis was probable/possible according to World Health Organization criteria. Of 43 patients, 29 were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and definite, eight probable and six possible. Five major categories emerged: (i) encephalopathies (n = 10) with delirium/psychosis and no distinct MRI or CSF abnormalities, and with 9/10 making a full or partial recovery with supportive care only; (ii) inflammatory CNS syndromes (n = 12) including encephalitis (n = 2, para- or post-infectious), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (n = 9), with haemorrhage in five, necrosis in one, and myelitis in two, and isolated myelitis (n = 1). Of these, 10 were treated with corticosteroids, and three of these patients also received intravenous immunoglobulin; one made a full recovery, 10 of 12 made a partial recovery, and one patient died; (iii) ischaemic strokes (n = 8) associated with a pro-thrombotic state (four with pulmonary thromboembolism), one of whom died; (iv) peripheral neurological disorders (n = 8), seven with Guillain-Barré syndrome, one with brachial plexopathy, six of eight making a partial and ongoing recovery; and (v) five patients with miscellaneous central disorders who did not fit these categories. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a wide spectrum of neurological syndromes affecting the whole neuraxis, including the cerebral vasculature and, in some cases, responding to immunotherapies. The high incidence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, particularly with haemorrhagic change, is striking. This complication was not related to the severity of the respiratory COVID-19 disease. Early recognition, investigation and management of COVID-19-related neurological disease is challenging.

404157,In brief: Myocarditis with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines,2021,"During March 2020, most European countries implemented lockdowns to restrict the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19 through their populations. These restrictions had positive impacts for air quality due to a dramatic reduction of economic activity and atmospheric emissions. In this work, a machine learning approach was designed and implemented to analyze local air quality improvements during the COVID-19 lockdown in Graz, Austria. The machine learning approach was used as a robust alternative to simple, historical measurement comparisons for various individual pollutants. Concentrations of NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), PM10 (particulate matter), O3 (ozone) and Ox (total oxidant) were selected from five measurement sites in Graz and were set as target variables for random forest regression models to predict their expected values during the city's lockdown period. The true vs. expected difference is presented here as an indicator of true pollution during the lockdown. The machine learning models showed a high level of generalization for predicting the concentrations. Therefore, the approach was suitable for analyzing reductions in pollution concentrations. The analysis indicated that the city's average concentration reductions for the lockdown period were: -36.9 to -41.6%, and -6.6 to -14.2% for NO2 and PM10, respectively. However, an increase of 11.6-33.8% for O3 was estimated. The reduction in pollutant concentration, especially NO2 can be explained by significant drops in traffic-flows during the lockdown period (-51.6 to -43.9%). The results presented give a real-world example of what pollutant concentration reductions can be achieved by reducing traffic-flows and other economic activities.","Lovric, Mario; Pavlovic, Kristina; Vukovic, Matej; Grange, Stuart K; Haberl, Michael; Kern, Roman",Environ Pollut,,77

Applying a social?ecological systems lens, we identified eight priority points for intervention (leverage points) and five overarching strategic actions and priority interventions (levers), which appear to be key to societal transformation The eight leverage points are: (1) Visions of a good life, (2) Total consumption and waste, (3) Latent values of responsibility, (4) Inequalities, (5) Justice and inclusion in conservation, (6) Externalities from trade and other telecouplings, (7) Responsible technology, innovation and investment, and (8) Education and knowledge generation and sharing The five intertwined levers can be applied across the eight leverage points and more broadly These include: (A) Incentives and capacity building, (B) Coordination across sectors and jurisdictions, (C) Pre-emptive action, (D) Adaptive decision-making and (E) Environmental law and implementation The levers and leverage points are all non-substitutable, and each enables others, likely leading to synergistic benefits Transformative change towards sustainable pathways requires more than a simple scaling-up of sustainability initiatives?it entails addressing these levers and leverage points to change the fabric of legal, political, economic and other social systems These levers and leverage points build upon those approved within the Global Assessment's Summary for Policymakers, with the aim of enabling leaders in government, business, civil society and academia to spark transformative changes towards a more just and sustainable world A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article",,People and Nature,,77

407658,P09. Single blue dye technique for sentinel lymph node biopsy during the COVID pandemic,2021,"Rationale: Patients with COVID-19 critical illness are at high risk for multiorgan dysfunction, most commonly acute kidney injury (AKI). We sought to characterize the rates of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in patients with COVID-19 ARDS as a function of coexisting AKI. Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of all patients with severe COVID-19 infection, admitted to ICU level of care between 3/1/2020 and 6/1/2020, and we obtained patient data through the Research Patient Data Registry. We excluded patients who did not develop AKI, those who were admitted with a primary medical problem unrelated to coexisting COVID-19 infection, and those with end stage renal disease. We stratified patients into two cohorts: Those with AKI not requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) and AKI requiring RRT. All data collection was approved by the IRB at Mass General Brigham (IRB #2020P001674). All data was analyzed using Excel and R version 4.0.1 (2020-06-06) when comparing groups-medians and interquartile ranges are reported. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used during statistical analysis. Results: 272 patients were identified, of which 136 patients were excluded from further study due to reasons as above. Of the remaining 136 patients analyzed, all developed AKI as per AKIN criteria, and we identified those who did not require RRT (100), and those who were initiated on RRT (36). Median age was 66 ± 9.75, and 57 ± 7.12, respectively. 38% (38/100) and 27.7% (10/36) were female, respectively. Complications investigated included non-cerebrovascular hemorrhage (17% vs. 38.88%, p 0.014), cerebrovascular hemorrhage (4% vs. 16.66%, p 0.033), thromboembolic phenomena (24% vs 38.8%, p 0.136) and overall ICU Mortality (48% vs 38.8%, p 0.45). Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 ARDS and associated AKI had a high number of hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications. There is a higher incidence of hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications in the AKI-RRT group, with CVA-and non-CVAhemorrhagic complications being statistically significant. Overall ICU mortality was apparently lower in the AKIRRT group, without reaching statistical significance. Our data highlight a clinically most relevant topic, defining COVID-19 patients with AKI as a high-risk population for thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications, and underlining the importance of careful decisions regarding prophylactic anticoagulant strategies.","Lakshman, S.; Ahmad, I.; Rahaghi, F.

408579,"Evolution, ayurveda, immunity, and preventive aspects for emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe complications of influenza in children are uncommon but may result in admission to hospital or an intensive care unit (ICU) and death. METHODS: Active prospective surveillance using the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit with monthly reporting by pediatricians of national demographic and clinical data on children with <15 years of age hospitalized with severe complications of laboratory-confirmed influenza during ten influenza seasons 2008-2017. RESULTS: Of 722 children notified, 613 had laboratory-confirmed influenza and at least one severe complication. Most (60%) were <5 years of age; 10% were <6 months, hence ineligible for vaccination. Almost half of all cases were admitted to ICU and 30 died. Most children were previously healthy: 40.3% had at least one underlying medical condition. Sixty-five different severe complications were reported; pneumonia was the most common, occurring in over half of all cases. Influenza A accounted for 68.6% hospitalizations; however, influenza B was more often associated with acute renal failure (P = 0.014), rhabdomyolysis (P = 0.019), myocarditis (P = 0.015), pericarditis (P = 0.013), and cardiomyopathy (P = 0.035). Children who died were more likely to be older (5-14 years), have underlying medical conditions, be admitted to ICU, and have encephalitis, acute renal failure, or myocarditis. Only 36.1% of all children reported received antiviral medications, and 8.5% were known to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza. CONCLUSIONS: Severe influenza complications cause morbidity and mortality in children, which may increase if coinfection with COVID-19 occurs in the 2020 season and beyond. Increased vaccination rates, even in healthy children, early diagnosis and timely antiviral treatment are needed to reduce severe complications and death.","Teutsch, Suzy M; Zurynski, Yvonne A; Nunez, Carlos; Lester-Smith, David; Festa, Marino; Booy, Robert; Elliott, Elizabeth J",Pediatr. infect. dis. j,,77
408860,Coronavirus in pregnancy. What we know so far?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome from patient samples is an important epidemiological tool for monitoring and responding to the pandemic, including the emergence of new mutations in specific communities. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from positive samples collected, along with epidemiological metadata, at a walk-up, rapid testing site in the Mission District of San Francisco, California during November 22-December 1, 2020 and January 10-29, 2021. Secondary household attack rates and mean sample viral load were estimated and compared across observed variants. RESULTS: A total of 12,124 tests were performed yielding 1,099 positives. From these, 928 high quality genomes were generated. Certain viral lineages bearing spike mutations, defined in part by L452R, S13I, and W152C, comprised 54.4% of the total sequences from January, compared to 15.7% in November. Household contacts exposed to the ""California"" or ""West Coast"" variants (B.1.427 and B.1.429) were at higher risk of infection compared to household contacts exposed to lineages lacking these variants (0.36 vs 0.29, RR=1.28; 95% CI:1.00-1.64). The reproductive number was estimated to be modestly higher than other lineages spreading in California during the second half of 2020. Viral loads were similar among persons infected with West Coast versus non-West Coast strains, as was the proportion of individuals with symptoms (60.9% vs 64.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in prevalence, relative household attack rates, and reproductive number are consistent with a modest transmissibility increase of the West Coast variants.","Peng, James; Liu, Jamin; Mann, Sabrina A; Mitchell, Anthea M; Laurie, Matthew T; Sunshine, Sara; Pilarowski, Genay; Ayscue, Patrick; Kistler, Amy; Vanaerschot, Manu; Li, Lucy M; McGeever, Aaron; Chow, Eric D; Marquez, Carina; Nakamura, Robert; Rubio, Luis; Chamie, Gabriel; Jones, Diane; Jacobo, Jon; Rojas, Susana; Rojas, Susy; Tulier-Laiwa, Valerie; Black, Douglas; Martinez, Jackie; Naso, Jamie; Schwab, Joshua; Petersen, Maya; Havlir, Diane; DeRisi, Joseph",Clin. infect. dis,,77

There is limited knowledge of whether SARS-CoV-2 is physically associated with human metalloproteins. Recently, high-confidence, experimentally supported protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins were reported. In this work, 58 metalloproteins among these human targets have been identified by a structure-based approach. This study reveals that most human metalloproteins interact with the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 orf8 protein, whose antibodies are one of the principal markers of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, this work provides sufficient evidence to conclude that Zn2+ plays an important role in the interplay between the novel coronavirus and humans. First, the content of Zn-binding proteins in the involved human metalloproteome is significantly higher than that of the other metal ions. Second, a molecular linkage between the identified human Zn-binding proteome with underlying medical conditions, that might increase the risk of severe illness from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been found. Likely perturbations of host cellular metal homeostasis by SARS-CoV-2 infection are highlighted.","Chasapis, Christos T; Georgiopoulou, Athanasia K; Perlepes, Spyros P; Bjørklund, Geir; Peana, Massimiliano",J Inorg Biochem,,77

CV2CoV is a second-generation mRNA vaccine with optimized non-coding regions and enhanced antigen expression. Here we report a head-to-head study of the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of CVnCoV and CV2CoV in nonhuman primates. We immunized 18 cynomolgus macaques with two doses of 12 ug of lipid nanoparticle formulated CVnCoV, CV2CoV, or sham (N=6/group). CV2CoV induced substantially higher binding and neutralizing antibodies, memory B cell responses, and T cell responses as compared with CVnCoV. CV2CoV also induced more potent neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including B.1.351 (beta), B.1.617.2 (delta), and C.37 (lambda). While CVnCoV provided partial protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, CV2CoV afforded robust protection with markedly lower viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Antibody responses correlated with protective efficacy. These data demonstrate that optimization of non-coding regions can greatly improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in nonhuman primates.","Gebre, Makda; Rauch, Susanne; Roth, Nicole; Yu, Jingyou; Chandrashekar, Abishek; Mercado, Noe; He, Xuan; Liu, Jinyan; McMahan, Katherine; Martinot, Amanda; Giffin, Tori; Hope, David; Patel, Shivani; Sellers, Daniel; Sanborn, Owen; Barrett, Julia; Liu, Xiaowen; Cole, Andrew; Pessaint, Laurent; Valentin, Daniel; Flinchbaugh, Zack; Yalley-Ogunro, Jake; Muench, Jeanne; Brown, Renita; Cook, Anthony; Teow, Elyse; Andersen, Hanne; Lewis, Mark G.; Mueller, Stefan; Petsch, Benjamin; Barouch, Dan H.",,,77
412331,Reopening Primary Schools during the Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 sanitary crisis has imposed a major reorganization of the health care system in France. Lockdown could be a factor in the emergence or deterioration of psychological disorders; it can be even more fragilizing during the specific period of adolescence. The « Maisons des Adolescents ¼ (Teenagers' Houses) had to urgently adjust their practices to provide continuity of care for adolescents suffering from physical or mental disorders. The « Maisons des Adolescents ¼ are pluridisciplinary care centres for adolescents and their families that provide assessments and services for medical, psychological, socio-educational, educational and legal needs. How did care continue for adolescents during lockdown? What adjustments occurred in the « Maisons des Adolescents ¼ during the health crisis? METHODS: This article presents the case of an adolescent who suffered a significant deterioration of her anorexia nervosa during confinement. Through this case, we describe the reorganization of care within the different units (consultations - day hospital - hospitalization unit) of a Parisian « Maison des Adolescents ¼ during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In this service, the rapid implementation of the telemedicine system in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic made possible provision of continuity in care for vulnerable adolescents and families. Based on the existing literature, we discuss the advantages and limitations of telemedicine and the practical issues for the future organization of care for adolescents. PERSPECTIVES: In contrast to pediatric medicine or child psychiatry, there is no protocol describing the application of telemedicine in adolescent medicine and psychiatry. There is an urgent need for further evaluation of the use of telemedicine for this population. This kind of research will improve knowledge about the effectiveness, acceptability and limitations of using a teleconsultation device in adolescent psychiatry in a crisis context. Certain remote care modalities implemented during the sanitary crisis could thus be maintained over time and become routine in the field of adolescent medicine and psychiatry.","Carretier, E; Guessoum, S B; Radjack, R; Mao, S-F; Minassian, S; Blanchet, C; Moro, M R; Lachal, J",Neuropsychiatr. enfance adolesc,,77

(Special Issue: Small natural and synthetic molecules for therapeutic use.),2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 1,250,000 deaths worldwide. With limited therapeutic options, proning nonintubated patients emerged as a safe and affordable intervention to manage hypoxemia. METHODS: A proning protocol to identify and prone eligible patients was implemented. Patients were encouraged to self-prone for 2-3 hours, 3 times daily. Investigators created educational materials for nurses and patients and developed a COVID-19-specific proning order within the electronic health record (EHR). Investigators completed an 800-person retrospective chart review to study the implementation of this protocol. RESULTS: From March 22, 2020, to June 5, 2020, 586 patients were admitted to the COVID-19 floor. Of these patients, 42.8% were eligible for proning. Common contraindications were lack of hypoxia, altered mental status, and fall risk. The proning protocol led to a significant improvement in provider awareness of patients appropriate for proning, increasing from 12% to 83%, as measured by placement of a proning order into the EHR. There was a significant improvement in all appropriate patients documented as proned, increasing from 18% to 45% of eligible patients. CONCLUSIONS: The creation of an effective hospital-wide proning protocol to address the exigencies of the COVID-19 pandemic is possible and may be accomplished in a short period of time.","D039,; Souza, Felicia R; Murray, John P; Tummala, Sandeep; Puello, Frances; Pavkovich, David S; Ash, Daniel; Kelly, Stephanie B H; Tyker, Albina; Anderson, Daniela; Francisco, Mary A; Pierce, Nicole L; Cerasale, Matthew T",J Healthc Qual,,77

Gender-Based Differences in the Host Immune Response to Coronaviruses,2020,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has caused over a million human deaths and massive global disruption. The viral infection may also represent a threat to our closest living relatives, nonhuman primates. The contact surface of the host cell receptor, ACE2, displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues modulate infection susceptibility. Infection studies have shown that some primate species develop COVID-19-like symptoms; however, the susceptibility of most primates is unknown. Here, we show that all apes and African and Asian monkeys (catarrhines), exhibit the same set of twelve key amino acid residues as human ACE2. Monkeys in the Americas, and some tarsiers, lemurs and lorisoids, differ at critical contact residues, and protein modeling predicts that these differences should greatly reduce SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity. Other lemurs are predicted to be closer to catarrhines in their susceptibility. Our study suggests that apes and African and Asian monkeys, and some lemurs, are likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Urgent actions have been undertaken to limit the exposure of great apes to humans, and similar efforts may be necessary for many other primate species.","Melin, Amanda D; Janiak, Mareike C; Marrone, Frank; Arora, Paramjit S; Higham, James P",Commun Biol,,77

420330,Age-related changes in the temporal processing of acoustical signals in the auditory cortex of rats,2020,"Despite considerable progress over the years, tuberculosis (TB) still remains the top cause of death among the infectious diseases and has devastating socio-economic consequences for people in low- and middle-income countries. To add to this, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened delivery of TB care across the globe. As a global community, we have committed to end the TB epidemic by 2030. The World Health Organization has framed a strategy to achieve this goal which consists of three pillars namely i) integrated patient-centred care and prevention, ii) bold policies and systems and iii) intensified research and innovation. An analysis of the performance of national tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) across the globe against the ten priority indicators recommended for monitoring the end TB strategy show that there are huge gaps at every step in the cascade of care of TB patients. In our view, these gaps reflect suboptimal implementation of existing strategies known to be efficacious and operational research (OR) is one of the best available tools to plug the gaps. In this paper, we define what operational research is and how it differs from other kinds of research. We also share our views and experiences about how operational research can be used by NTPs to identify implementation gaps and their reasons, and develop and test possible solutions - which are then integrated to make changes to policy and practice and eventually improve programme outcomes. OR can be defined as research into interventions, strategies and tools which produces practical useable knowledge that can be used to enhance the quality, coverage, effectiveness and efficiency of disease control programmes, health services or health systems in which the research is conducted. The key steps in integrating operational research in the NTPs include: i) securing political commitment reflected by inclusion of OR in the national strategic plans of NTPs and earmarked funding, ii) having a critical mass of dedicated and trained human resources in OR within the NTP, iii) setting research priorities and steering the direction of research in the country, iv) using output-oriented models of capacity building such as the Structured Operational Research Training Initiative (SORT IT) model and building communities of practice, v) harnessing existing capacity in the country by forging partnerships with academia, vi) NTP-led nationwide, multicentre OR studies, vii) providing access to anonymized patient and programme surveillance data, vii) creating a forum for evidence dissemination and fostering policy change and ix) monitoring and accountability. In conclusion, ending the TB epidemic will not be possible without new tools (diagnostics, drugs, vaccines) and a multi-sectoral response involving stakeholders beyond the health ministry, including private providers, patients and communities. However, timely conduct of operational research to fine-tune programme implementation and ensuring proper deployment of new tools will be equally crucial to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions and ultimately contribute towards ending TB.","Kumar, Ajay Mv; Harries, Anthony D; Satyanarayana, Srinath; Thekkur, Pruthu; Shewade, Hemant D; Zachariah, Rony",Indian J Tuberc,,77

421287,Note from the editors: Eurosurveillance contributor survey results,2020,"During the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Spain, we explored the individual and relational well-being of people confined together with their partners and/or children during the first 3 weeks of state-regulated lockdown. Adults 18 years or older (N = 407) completed an online survey that included demographic, household, and employment information along with standardized measures of psychological distress (State-Trait Anxiety and Beck Depression) and relationship functioning-either the Dyadic Adjustment Scale if there were no children in the household or a Basic Family Relations Evaluation Questionnaire (CERFB) measuring conjugal, parental, and coparental functions. Qualitative analyses of responses to an open-ended question about perceived changes in couple or family dynamics during lockdown revealed nine specific themes comprising two overarching categories: relational improvement and deterioration. The overall prevalence of improvement themes (61.7%) exceeded deterioration themes (41.0%), with increased (re)connection and conflict atmosphere cited most often. Quantitative analyses found elevated levels of state anxiety but not trait anxiety or depression during lockdown. Consistent with the qualitative results, couples having no children at home reported high levels of dyadic adjustment, but with children present CERFB parental functioning exceeded conjugal functioning, a pattern sometimes associated with child triangulation into adult conflicts. Although correlates of psychological distress (e.g., unemployment, perceived economic risk) were relatively stable across subgroups, predictors of relationship functioning varied substantially with household/parental status (e.g., telecommuting and employment facilitated conjugal functioning only for couples with children).","Günther-Bel, Cristina; Vilaregut, Anna; Carratala, Eduard; Torras-Garat, Sonia; Pérez-Testor, Carles",Fam Process,,77
421398,"Comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of COVID-19 blood, lung, and airway",2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global health emergency. A key feature of COVID-19 is dysregulated interferon-response. Type-I interferon (IFN-I) is one of the earliest antiviral innate immune responses following viral infection and plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, using a proteomics-based approach, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces delayed and dysregulated IFN-I signaling in Huh7 cells. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is able to inhibit RIG-I mediated IFN-beta production. Our results also confirm the recent findings that IFN-I pretreatment is able to reduce the susceptibility of Huh7 cells to SARS-CoV-2, but not post-treatment. Moreover, senescent Huh7 cells, in spite of showing accentuated IFN-I response were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the virus effectively inhibited IFIT1 in these cells. Finally, proteomic comparison between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV revealed a distinct differential regulatory signature of interferon-related proteins emphasizing that therapeutic strategies based on observations in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV should be used with caution. Our findings provide a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 regulation of cellular interferon response and a perspective on its use as a treatment. Investigation of different interferon-stimulated genes and their role in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis may direct novel antiviral strategies.","Chen, X.; Saccon, E.; Appelberg, K.

421722,Of Heroes and Cowards,2020,"Understanding human mobility dynamics among places provides fundamental knowledge regarding their interactive gravity, benefiting a wide range of applications in need of prior knowledge in human spatial interactions. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic uniquely highlights the need for monitoring and measuring fine-scale human spatial interactions. In response to the soaring needs of human mobility data under the pandemic, we developed an interactive geospatial web portal by extracting worldwide daily population flows from billions of geotagged tweets and United States (U.S.) population flows from SafeGraph mobility data. The web portal is named ODT (Origin-Destination-Time) Flow Explorer. At the core of the explorer is an ODT data cube coupled with a big data computing cluster to efficiently manage, query, and aggregate billions of OD flows at different spatial and temporal scales. Although the explorer is still in its early developing stage, the rapidly generated mobility flow data can benefit a wide range of domains that need timely access to the fine-grained human mobility records.

422020,Drug targets for corona virus: A systematic review,2020,"To discover new drugs to combat COVID-19, an understanding of the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is urgently needed. Here, for the first time, we report the crucial role of cathepsin L (CTSL) in patients with COVID-19. The circulating level of CTSL was elevated after SARS-CoV-2 infection and was positively correlated with disease course and severity. Correspondingly, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection increased CTSL expression in human cells in vitro and human ACE2 transgenic mice in vivo, while CTSL overexpression, in turn, enhanced pseudovirus infection in human cells. CTSL functionally cleaved the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and enhanced virus entry, as evidenced by CTSL overexpression and knockdown in vitro and application of CTSL inhibitor drugs in vivo. Furthermore, amantadine, a licensed anti-influenza drug, significantly inhibited CTSL activity after SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and prevented infection both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, CTSL is a promising target for new anti-COVID-19 drug development.","Zhao, Miao-Miao; Yang, Wei-Li; Yang, Fang-Yuan; Zhang, Li; Huang, Wei-Jin; Hou, Wei; Fan, Chang-Fa; Jin, Rong-Hua; Feng, Ying-Mei; Wang, You-Chun; Yang, Jin-Kui",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,77
422312,The Future is Bright,2021,"This paper brings a constitutional economics perspective to bear on the World Health Organization (WHO), the flagship United Nations intergovernmental health organisation, which is obligated by its Constitution to achieve 'the highest possible level of health' for the world's peoples. The WHO has in the seven decades of its existence used its formidable legislative powers only sparingly. It has been widely chided for being weak in regional coordination and unresponsive to transnational emergencies like the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016. In 2020, it found itself at the centre of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the middle of the Sino-American geopolitical tug-of-war. This paper traces the discordance between the Constitution's stated purposes and the actual track record of the WHO not back to its organisational culture nor to weak leadership but to the design of the Constitution itself. It analytically distinguishes the Constitution's expressive from its instrumental halves, and shows that, whilst the former embodies a 'constitutional moment' of international health solidarity right after the Second World War, the latter embodies a reserved and limited delegation from member-states that are jealous of their sovereignty.","Ip, Eric C",Health Econ Policy Law,,77
422374,Developmental Status of the Potential Vaccines for the Mitigation of the COVID-19 Pandemic and a Focus on the Effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA Vaccines,2021,"PURPOSE: Tinnitus and equilibrium disorders such as dizziness and vertigo have been reported by patients with COVID-19; however, they have been rarely investigated. The aim of this study was to study the prevalence of subjective tinnitus and dizziness in a sample of COVID-19 patients using an online 10-item close-ended questionnaire. METHODS: A multicentric study that included 15 Italian hospitals in different regions was conducted using an online 10-item close-ended questionnaire developed to identify the presence of tinnitus and balance disorders in patients with COVID-19 between May 5 and June 10, 2020. The questionnaire was administered to 185 patients in a period of > 30 - < 60 days after diagnosis of COVID-19; responses were recorded in an online Excel spreadsheet. The questionnaire was composed of three sections: (1) demographic information; (2) presence and characteristics of tinnitus and dizziness after COVID-19 diagnosis; (3) possible association with migraine. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (18.4%) reported equilibrium disorders after COVID-19 diagnosis. Of these, 32 patients reported dizziness (94.1%) and 2 (5.9%) reported acute vertigo attacks. Forty-three patients (23.2%) reported tinnitus; 14 (7.6%) reported both tinnitus and equilibrium disorders. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the presence of subjective otoneurological symptoms such as tinnitus and balance disorders can affect COVID-19 patients; further studies are necessary to investigate the prevalence and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these subjective symptoms in COVID-19 patients.","Viola, Pasquale; Ralli, Massimo; Pisani, Davide; Malanga, Donatella; Sculco, Domenico; Messina, Luigi; Laria, Carla; Aragona, Teodoro; Leopardi, Gianluca; Ursini, Francesco; Scarpa, Alfonso; Topazio, Davide; Cama, Antonia; Vespertini, Viviana; Quintieri, Francesco; Cosco, Lucio; Cunsolo, Elio Maria; Chiarella, Giuseppe",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,77
422450,Timing of Remdesivir for COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Covid-19 is a global pandemic that requires a global and integrated response of all national medical and healthcare systems. Covid-19 exposed the need for timely response and data sharing on fast spreading global pandemics. In this study, we investigate the scientific research response from the early stages of the pandemic, and we review key findings on how the early warning systems developed in previous epidemics responded to contain the virus. METHODS: We conducted data mining of scientific literature records from the Web of Science Core Collection, using the topics Covid-19, mortality, immunity, and vaccine. The individual records are analysed in isolation, and the analysis is compared with records on all Covid-19 research topics combined. The data records are analysed with commutable statistical methods, including R Studio's Bibliometrix package, and the Web of Science data mining tool. RESULTS: From historical analysis of scientific data records on viruses, pandemics and mortality, we identified that Chinese universities have not been leading on these topics historically. However, during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese universities are strongly dominating the research on these topics. Despite the current political and trade disputes, we found strong collaboration in Covid-19 research between the US and China. From the analysis on Covid-19 and immunity, we wanted to identify the relationship between different risk factors discussed in the news media. We identified a few clusters, containing references to exercise, inflammation, smoking, obesity and many additional factors. From the analysis on Covid-19 and vaccine, we discovered that although the USA is leading in volume of scientific research on Covid-19 vaccine, the leading 3 research institutions (Fudan, Melbourne, Oxford) are not based in the USA. Hence, it is difficult to predict which country would be first to produce a Covid-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: We analysed the conceptual structure maps with factorial analysis and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and identified multiple relationships between keywords, synonyms and concepts, related to Covid-19 mortality, immunity, and vaccine development. We present integrated and corelated knowledge from 276 records on Covid-19 and mortality, 71 records on Covid-19 and immunity, and 189 records on Covid-19 vaccine.","Radanliev, Petar; De Roure, David; Walton, Rob",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,77

423211,PRAC: blood clots or capillary leak syndrome with COVID-19 vaccines,2021,"This study reports a comprehensive empirical investigation of the nature and correlates of anti-mask attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accumulating evidence underscores the importance of facemasks, as worn by the general public, in limiting the spread of infection. Accordingly, mask wearing has become increasingly mandatory in public places such as stores and on public transit. Although the public has been generally adherent to mask wearing, a small but vocal group of individuals refuse to wear masks. Anti-mask protest rallies have occurred in many places throughout the world, sometimes erupting violently. Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between anti-mask attitudes and mask non-adherence and little is known about how such attitudes relate to one another or other factors (e.g., non-adherence to social distancing, anti-vaccination attitudes). To investigate these issues, the present study surveyed 2,078 adults from the US and Canada. Consistent with other surveys, we found that most (84%) people wore masks because of COVID-19. The 16% who did not wear masks scored higher on most measures of negative attitudes towards masks. Network analyses indicated that negative attitudes about masks formed an intercorrelated network, with the central nodes in the network being (a) beliefs that masks are ineffective in preventing COVID-19, and (b) psychological reactance (PR; i.e., an aversion to being forced to wear masks). These central nodes served as links, connecting the network of anti-masks attitudes to negative attitudes toward SARSCoV2 vaccination, beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, disregard for social distancing, and political conservatism. Findings regarding PR are important because, theoretically, PR is likely to strengthen other anti-masks attitudes (e.g., beliefs that masks are ineffective) because people with strong PR react with anger and counter-arguments when their beliefs are challenged, thereby leading to a strengthening of their anti-mask beliefs. Implications for improving mask adherence are discussed.","Taylor, Steven; Asmundson, Gordon J G",PLoS One,,77
423500,Talking to Patients about the Influenza Vaccine,2020,"At the end of 2020, the Italian Ministry of Health launched a national vaccination campaign to counteract the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aimed at appraising levels of knowledge about and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in a sample of Italian undergraduates during the first phase of the immunization plan. A web-based questionnaire was administered to students attending universities in Bari, Naples, and Rome during the period February–April 2021. Of the total of 3226 participants, 91.9% were keen to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. More than 80% gave correct answers to questions about COVID-19 vaccine administration, functioning, and effects on community health. However, only 63.8% identified the correct composition of the available vaccines. Knowledge was found to be related to sociodemographic features and COVID-19 vaccination acceptance (p &lt;0.05). COVID-19 vaccination acceptance was found to be related to having a previous vaccination against influenza (OR 3.806, CI 95% 1.181–12.267;p = 0.025) and knowledge (OR 4.759, CI 95% 2.106–10.753;p = 0.000). These results show a good level of awareness about COVID-19 vaccination in this population, which may indicate the effectiveness of communication strategies accompanying the COVID-19 immunization campaign in Italy.","Gallè, Francesca Sabella Elita Anna Roma Paolo De Giglio Osvalda Caggiano Giuseppina Tafuri Silvio Da Molin Giovanna Ferracuti Stefano Montagna Maria Teresa Liguori Giorgio Orsi Giovanni Battista Napoli Christian",Vaccines,,77

425064,Exploring antibody repurposing for COVID-19: beyond presumed roles of therapeutic antibodies,2021,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) have a high fatality rate likely due to a dysregulated immune response. Corticosteroids could attenuate this inappropriate response, although there are still some concerns regarding its use, timing, and dose. METHODS: This is a nationwide, prospective, multicenter, observational, cohort study in critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 admitted into Intensive Care Units (ICU) in Spain from 12th March to 29th June 2020. Using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting, we compared relevant outcomes between patients treated with early corticosteroids (before or within the first 48 h of ICU admission) with those who did not receive early corticosteroids (delayed group) or any corticosteroids at all (never group). Primary endpoint was ICU mortality. Secondary endpoints included 7-day mortality, ventilator-free days, and complications. RESULTS: A total of 691 patients out of 882 (78.3%) received corticosteroid during their hospital stay. Patients treated with early-corticosteroids (n = 485) had lower ICU mortality (30.3% vs. never 36.6% and delayed 44.2%) and lower 7-day mortality (7.2% vs. never 15.2%) compared to non-early treated patients. They also had higher number of ventilator-free days, less length of ICU stay, and less secondary infections than delayed treated patients. There were no differences in medical complications between groups. Of note, early use of moderate-to-high doses was associated with better outcomes than low dose regimens. CONCLUSION: Early use of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is associated with lower mortality than no or delayed use, and fewer complications than delayed use.","Monedero, Pablo; Gea, Alfredo; Castro, Pedro; Candela-Toha, Angel M; Hernández-Sanz, María L; Arruti, Egoitz; Villar, Jesús; Ferrando, Carlos",Crit Care,,77
425371,Long-Term Hyperglycemia Impairs Hormonal Balance and Induces Oxidative Damage in Ovaries of Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Wistar Rat,2020,"COVID-19 has become a major global public health burden, currently causing a rapidly growing number of infections and significant morbidity and mortality around the world. Early detection with fast and sensitive assays and timely intervention are crucial for interrupting the spread of the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Using a mismatch-tolerant amplification technique, we developed a simple, rapid, sensitive and visual reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on its N gene. The assay has a high specificity and sensitivity, and robust reproducibility, and its results can be monitored using a real-time PCR machine or visualized via colorimetric change from red to yellow. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay is 118.6 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA per 25 µL reaction. The reaction can be completed within 30 min for real-time fluorescence monitoring, or 40 min for visual detection when the template input is more than 200 copies per 25 µL reaction. To evaluate the viability of the assay, a comparison between the RT-LAMP and a commercial RT-qPCR assay was made using 56 clinical samples. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay showed perfect agreement in detection with the RT-qPCR assay. The newly-developed SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assay is a simple and rapid method for COVID-19 surveillance.","Lu, Renfei; Wu, Xiuming; Wan, Zhenzhou; Li, Yingxue; Jin, Xia; Zhang, Chiyu",,,77

Objective: To describe a modified technique for pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy for use in the COVID-19 era and present a case series of patients for whom the technique has been used. Design, Setting, and Participants: Observational case series of pediatric patients undergoing emergency or urgent airway procedures performed at a tertiary pediatric otolaryngology department in Australia. Procedures were completed between March 23 and April 9, 2020, with a median (range) follow-up of 24.5 (11-28) days. Exposures: Modified technique for microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, minimizing aerosolization of respiratory tract secretions. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was the feasibility of technique, which was measured by ability to perform microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with comparable success to the usual technique (ie, adequate examination of the patient for diagnostic procedures and ability to perform interventional procedures). Results: The technique was used successfully in 8 patients (median [range] age, 160 days [27 days to 2 years 6 months]); 5 patients were male, and 3 were female. Intervention was performed on 6 patients; 2 balloon dilations for subglottic stenosis, 2 injections of hyaluronic acid for type 1 clefts, and 2 cold-steel supraglottoplasties. No adverse events occurred. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series, feasibility of a modified technique for pediatric microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy was demonstrated. By reconsidering the surgical approach in light of specific COVID-19 infection risks, this technique may be associated with reduced spread of aerosolized respiratory secretions perioperatively and intraoperatively, but the technique and patient outcomes require further study.","Pollaers, Katherine; Herbert, Hayley; Vijayasekaran, Shyan",JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,77

The authors searched two electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science) to extract studies published before September 15 2020. Twenty studies explained recommendations, considerations, or best practices in return to play in football, and all of them were clustered into three groups: (1) training load management (n = 10), (2) medical recommendations (n = 9), and (3) recovery related issues (n = 5). The way to establish a progression in training process should be based on training load management and managing the number of stimuli per time. Following the studies, this training process should be divided into three phases: phase 1-physical distancing should be maintained; phases 2 and 3-group training should start. Medical considerations were clustered into different groups: general, pre- and post- training, during training, education, planning to return to competition, and suggestions for post confinement weeks. In particular, social issues, strict hygiene questions, and continuous PCR testing should be considered in return to play over football season. Finally, since a correlation has been found between high-intensive training loads and immunoglobulin A, nutritional and lifestyle recovery strategies should be performed. Moreover, since immunosuppression has been related to congested schedules (<72 h between matches), football federations should avoid this situation.","Rico-González, Markel; Pino-Ortega, José; Ardigò, Luca Paolo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,77

428812,Letter from the Editor,2021,"The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 disease in the French national population of dialysis patients, their course of illness and to identify the risk factors associated with mortality. Our study included all patients on dialysis recorded in the French REIN Registry in April 2020. Clinical characteristics at last follow-up and the evolution of COVID-19 illness severity over time were recorded for diagnosed cases (either suspicious clinical symptoms, characteristic signs on the chest scan or a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 1,621 infected patients were reported on the REIN registry from March 16th, 2020 to May 4th, 2020. Of these, 344 died. The prevalence of COVID-19 patients varied from less than 1% to 10% between regions. The probability of being a case was higher in males, patients with diabetes, those in need of assistance for transfer or treated at a self-care unit. Dialysis at home was associated with a lower probability of being infected as was being a smoker, a former smoker, having an active malignancy, or peripheral vascular disease. Mortality in diagnosed cases (21%) was associated with the same causes as in the general population. Higher age, hypoalbuminemia and the presence of an ischemic heart disease were statistically independently associated with a higher risk of death. Being treated at a selfcare unit was associated with a lower risk. Thus, our study showed a relatively low frequency of COVID-19 among dialysis patients contrary to what might have been assumed.","Couchoud, Cécile; Bayer, Florian; Ayav, Carole; Béchade, Clémence; Brunet, Philippe; Chantrel, François; Frimat, Luc; Galland, Roula; Hourmant, Maryvonne; Laurain, Emmanuelle; Lobbedez, Thierry; Mercadal, Lucile; Moranne, Olivier",Kidney Int,,77

429811,Training in neurology: Flexibility and adaptability of a neurology training program at the epicenter of COVID-19,2020,"The COVID-19 emergency has significantly transformed the working environment and job demands. Providing care was emotionally difficult for healthcare workers. Uncertainty, stigmatisation, and potentially exposing their families to infection were prominent themes for healthcare workers (HCWs) during the crisis, which first broke out in China at the end of 2019, and then in Italy in early 2020. This study examined the effects of stigma, job demands, and self-esteem, and the consequences of working as a ""frontline care provider"" with patients infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19). A correlational design study involved 260 healthcare workers (HCWs) working in a large hospital in southern Italy. The following questionnaires were administered: (1) the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), for assessing psychological and physical demands; (2) the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL) to measure the quality individuals feel in relation to their work as ""frontline care providers"", through three dimensions: compassion fatigue (CF), burnout (BO), and compassion satisfaction (CS); (3) the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, for evaluating individual self-esteem; (4) a self-administered multiple-choice questionnaire developed by See et al. about attitudes of discrimination, acceptance, and fear towards HCWs exposed to COVID-19. The findings suggest that stigma has a high impact on workers' outcomes. Stigma may influence worker compliance and can guide management communication strategies relating to pandemic risk for HCWs.","Ramaci, Tiziana; Barattucci, Massimiliano; Ledda, Caterina; Rapisarda, Venerando",Sustainability,,77

The precise identification of immune cell subsets in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and their correlation with COVID-19 disease severity are currently being unraveled. Herein, we employed iterative clustering and guide-gene selection 2 (ICGS2) as well as uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction computational algorithms to decipher the complex immune and cellular composition of BAL, using publicly available datasets from a total of 68,873 single cells derived from two healthy subjects, three patients with mild COVID-19, and five patients with severe COVID-19. Our analysis revealed the presence of neutrophils and macrophage cluster-1 as a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Among the identified gene signatures, IFITM2, IFITM1, H3F3B, SAT1, and S100A8 gene signatures were highly associated with neutrophils, while CCL8, CCL3, CCL2, KLF6, and SPP1 were associated with macrophage cluster-1 in severe-COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, although macrophages were also present in healthy subjects and patients with mild COVID-19, they had different gene signatures, indicative of interstitial and cluster-0 macrophage (i.e., FABP4, APOC1, APOE, C1QB, and NURP1). Additionally, MALAT1, NEAT1, and SNGH25 were downregulated in patients with mild and severe COVID-19. Interferon signaling, FCÎ³ receptor-mediated phagocytosis, IL17, and Tec kinase canonical pathways were enriched in patients with severe COVID-19, while PD-1 and PDL-1 pathways were suppressed. A number of upstream regulators (IFNG, PRL, TLR7, PRL, TGM2, TLR9, IL1B, TNF, NFkB, IL1A, STAT3, CCL5, and others) were also enriched in BAL cells from severe COVID-19-affected patients compared to those from patients with mild COVID-19. Further analyses revealed genes associated with the inflammatory response and chemotaxis of myeloid cells, phagocytes, and granulocytes, among the top activated functional categories in BAL from severe COVID-19-affected patients. Transcriptome data from another cohort of COVID-19-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) revealed the presence of several genes common to those found in BAL from patients with severe and mild COVID-19 (IFI27, IFITM3, IFI6, IFIT3, MX1, IFIT1, OASL, IFI30, OAS1) or to those seen only in BAL from severe-COVID-19 patients (S100A8, IFI44, IFI44L, CXCL8, CCR1, PLSCR1, EPSTI1, FPR1, OAS2, OAS3, IL1RN, TYMP, BCL2A1). Taken together, our data reveal the presence of neutrophils and macrophage cluster-1 as the main immune cell subsets associated with severe COVID-19 and identify their inflammatory and chemotactic gene signatures, also partially reflected systemically in the circulation, for possible diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.","Shaath, Hibah; Vishnubalaji, Radhakrishnan; Elkord, Eyad; Alajez, Nehad M",,,77

The purpose of this study was to explore the early clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 from a single centre. All patients underwent real-time reverse transcription PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. Demographic and clinical factors and laboratory data were reviewed and collected to evaluate for significant associations. RESULTS: The study included 541 patients with COVID-19. A total of 144 (26.6%) patients had a history of CVD. The mortality of patients with CVD reached 22.2%, which was higher than that of the overall population of this study (9.8%). Patients with CVD were also more likely to develop liver function abnormality, elevated blood creatinine and lactic dehydrogenase (p<0.05). Symptoms of sputum production were more common in patients with CVD (p=0.026). Lymphocytes, haemoglobin and albumin below the normal range were pervasive in the CVD group (p<0.05). The proportion of critically ill patients in the CVD group (27.8%) was significantly higher than that in the non-CVD group (8.8%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that CVD (OR: 2.735 (95% CI 1.495 to 5.003), p=0.001) was associated with critical COVID-19 condition, while patients with coronary heart disease were less likely to reach recovery standards (OR: 0.331 (95% CI 0.125 to 0.880), p=0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the high prevalence of CVD, a thorough CVD assessment at diagnosis and early intervention are recommended in COVID-19 patients with CVD. Patients with CVD are more vulnerable to deterioration.","Zhang, Jixiang; Lu, Shimin; Wang, Xiaoli; Jia, Xuemei; Li, Jiao; Lei, Hongbo; Liu, Zhengru; Liao, Fei; Ji, Mengyao; Lv, Xiaoguang; Kang, Jian; Tian, Shan; Ma, Jingjing; Wu, Dandan; Gong, Yang; Xu, Yu; Dong, Weiguo",Heart,,77

To investigate effects of COVID-related stress on food motivation, we recruited adults (N = 429; 272 F, 157 M) to complete an online survey via Amazon MTurk in May 2020. Current COVID-related stress, retrospective pre-COVID stress, and motivation in relation to individualized preferred foods from five categories (sweet snacks, fruit, savory snacks, vegetables, and fast food) were assessed. Food motivation measures included willingness to wait, willingness to expend low effort [finger taps], willingness to expend high effort [jumping jacks], and willingness to pay for hypothetical delivery of the food item. Food motivation for each food type was assessed using a novel instrument designed for brief assessment of multiple aspects of food motivation across multiple food types. Participants were willing to pay the most for fast food followed by sweet snacks, and willing to wait longer for sweet snacks relative to other food types. While fast food and sweets also generated the most willingness to expend high and low effort, willingness to expend low effort for fruit was similar to that for fast food and sweets, and willingness to expend high effort for fruit was comparable to that for fast food. Participants were least willing to pay or expend low effort for vegetables. Higher COVID-related stress levels were associated with willingness to expend more effort and pay more for food items. These data collected during the pandemic demonstrate that highly processed and sweet foods have high motivating value across multiple measures of motivation, and COVID-related stress increases food motivation across food categories. Interventions to mitigate stress and target the link between stress and overeating may help to limit the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on obesity.","Smith, Kimberly R; Jansen, Elena; Thapaliya, Gita; Aghababian, Anahys H; Chen, Liuyi; Sadler, Jennifer R; Carnell, Susan",Appetite,,77

433616,Notes from Rome 2019–20,2020,"A surgeon failed to heed his own misgivings on taking a family vacation cruise. Despite scrupulous hand-washing and antiseptic precautions with anything within reach, he contracts COVID-19. His anxiety increased as his condition became increasingly serious: uncontrollable dry coughing spells, spiking fevers, and his worst symptom, progressive dyspnea and chest pain. From what he knew about the disease, he feared admission to the intensive care unit, a step that portended a significantly worse prognosis. After a week-and-a-half of illness, misery, and fear, he began to improve: first, his fevers diminished, breathing came more easily, and coughing spells occurred less frequently, if still unpredictably. Now with his strength slowly returning, he contemplated returning to work but was frustrated when tests showed he was still shedding active virions. Under quarantine and with time to reflect, he cautions against complacency with regard to the infectiousness of COVID-19. His own denial led to the loss of his health and livelihood. At home but still separated from his wife and children in a basement bedroom, the bittersweet circumstances of his reunion with them is a reminder of the preciousness of life and love of family.","Stanford, Jon L",Am Surg,,77

ARDS is mediated, at least in part, by a dysregulated inflammatory response due to excessive levels of circulating cytokines, a condition known as the ""cytokine-storm syndrome."" Currently, there are FDA-approved therapies that attenuate the dysregulated inflammation that occurs in COVID-19 patients, such as dexamethasone or other corticosteroids and IL-6 inhibitors, including sarilumab, tocilizumab, and siltuximab. However, the efficacy of these treatments have been shown to be inconsistent. Compounds that activate the vagus nerve-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, such as the &#945;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, GTS-21, attenuate ARDS/inflammatory lung injury by decreasing the extracellular levels of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) in the airways and the circulation. It is possible that HMGB1 may be an important mediator of the ""cytokine-storm syndrome."" Notably, high plasma levels of HMGB1 have been reported in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19, and there is a significant negative correlation between HMGB1 plasma levels and clinical outcomes. Nicotine can activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, which attenuates the up-regulation and the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Therefore, we hypothesize that low molecular weight compounds that activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex, such as nicotine or GTS-21, may represent a potential therapeutic approach to attenuate the dysregulated inflammatory responses in patients with severe COVID-19.","Gauthier, Alex G; Lin, Mosi; Wu, Jiaqi; Kennedy, Thomas P; Daley, Lee-Anne; Ashby, Charles R; Mantell, Lin L",J Immunotoxicol,,77

435180,Assessing attitudes towards gorilla conservation via employee interviews,2020,"BACKGROUND: For the past few months, HMOs have faced crowded emergency rooms and insufficient hospital and intensive-care-unit beds, all from the worst pandemic of this century, COVID-19. METHODS: In a large HMO in Brazil, our approach was to allow treating physicians to prescribe antiviral medications immediately at presentation, and prednisone starting on day-6 of symptoms to treat pulmonary inflammation. We implemented this COVID-19 protocol for outpatients and studied 717 consecutive SARS-CoV-2-positive patients age 40 years or older presenting at our emergency rooms. RESULTS: Use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), prednisone or both significantly reduced hospitalization risk by 50-60%. Ivermectin, azithromycin and oseltamivir did not substantially reduce risk further. Hospitalization risk was doubled for people with type-2 diabetes or obesity, increased by two-thirds for people with heart disease, and by 75% for each decade of age over age 40. Similar magnitudes of reduced risk with HCQ and prednisone use were seen for mortality risk, though were not significant because of only 11 deaths among the 717 patients. No cardiac arrhythmias requiring medication termination were observed for any of the medications. CONCLUSIONS: This work adds to the growing literature of studies that have found substantial benefit for use of HCQ combined with other agents in the early outpatient treatment of COVID-19, and adds the possibility of steroid use to enhance treatment efficacy.","Szente Fonseca, Silvia Nunes; de Queiroz Sousa, Anastasio; Wolkoff, Alexandre Giandoni; Moreira, Marcelo Sampaio; Pinto, Bruno Castro; Valente Takeda, Christianne Fernandes; Rebouças, Eduardo; Vasconcellos Abdon, Ana Paula; Nascimento, Anderson L A; Risch, Harvey A",Travel Med Infect Dis,,77

Early detection of emotional feelings and their trends help implement timely intervention strategies. Given the limitations of medical diagnosis of early emotional change signs during the quarantine period, artificial intelligence models provide effective mechanisms in uncovering early signs, symptoms and escalating trends. Novelty of the approach presented herein is a multitask methodological framework of text data processing, implemented as a pipeline for meaningful emotion detection and analysis, based on the Plutchik/Ekman approach to emotion detection and trend detection. We present an evaluation of the framework and a pilot system. Results of confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework for topic trends and emotion detection of COVID-19 tweets. Our findings revealed Stay-At-Home restrictions result in people expressing on twitter both negative and positive emotional semantics. Semantic trends of safety issues related to staying at home rapidly decreased within the 28 days and also negative feelings related to friends dying and quarantined life increased in some days. These findings have potential to impact public health policy decisions through monitoring trends of emotional feelings of those who are quarantined. The framework presented here has potential to assist in such monitoring by using as an online emotion detection tool kit.","Jelodar, Hamed; Orji, Rita; Matwin, Stan; Weerasinghe, Swarna; Oyebode, Oladapo; Wang, Yongli",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06484v1.pdf,77
435472,"Sunlight sterilized, recyclable and super hydrophobic anti-COVID laser-induced graphene mask formulation for indelible usability",2021,"Rationale: The impact of COVID-19 has affected billions of people affecting nearly all domains of life, including patient's healthcare needs. Due to constrained dental services during lockdown, pediatric dental needs were severely compromised therefore, parental attitude and practices of maintaining child's oral hygiene impose significant impact on child's oral hygiene. Aim: This study aims to assess the attitude and practices of parents toward their children's oral health care during COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: The present cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 120 parents selected randomly from the outpatient department after obtaining informed consent. A structured questionnaire was used to assess attitude and practice of parents toward their child's oral hygiene during lockdown in COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The overall attitude and practice score of parents in maintaining their child's oral hygiene was low, with mean value of 2.36 ± 1.36 and 2.51 ± 1.50, respectively. 60.8% of parents reported the need of dental treatment for their child during the lockdown period whereas 50.8% parents contacted the dentist during this period; majority (37.5%) of which reported due to toothache. 68.3% of parents would like to visit nearby dental hospital for emergencies during lockdown period. Only 33.3% of parents took extra efforts to maintain their child's oral hygiene while 45% made dietary changes in their child's diet to prevent tooth decay. Conclusion: The overall attitude and practices of the parents were poor toward the oral health of their children during the lockdown period in COVID-19 pandemic. There is urgent need of increasing awareness among parents regarding the importance of maintaining their child's oral health. The inability to see the doctor should at least encourage better home practice measures for future. The concept of tele-dentistry is very new and will be the need of the coming modern times.","Goswami, Mridula; Grewal, Monika; Garg, Aditi",J Indian Soc Pedod Prev Dent,,77

What limits the potential of the use of peptides as drugs is their low bioavailability and enzymatic degradation in vivo. To overcome this limitation, the development of new molecules mimicking peptides is of great importance for the development of new biologically active molecules. Therefore, replacing the amide bond in a peptide with a heterocyclic bioisostere, such as the 1,2,3-triazole ring, can be considered an effective solution for the synthesis of biologically relevant peptidomimetics. These 1,2,3-triazoles may have an interesting biological activity, because they behave as rigid link units, which can mimic the electronic properties of amide bonds and show bioisosteric effects. Additionally, triazole can be used as a linker moiety to link peptides to other functional groups.","Agouram, Naima; El Hadrami, El Mestafa; Bentama, Abdeslem",Molecules (Basel),,77

Most (20,411) cases are from the state of Victoria. In response to rising infections and community transmission in July 2020, on August 2nd, several restrictions were imposed for the following 111 days, including an 8pm curfew, a travel restriction to 5 km from home, and closure of nonessential services. It is unknown how this affected people living with HIV (PLHIV), who already experience disproportionate levels of mental health issues, comorbidity, and stigma. An online survey was designed with HIV community-based organizations to investigate the impact of the pandemic on Victorian PLHIV. Participants were recruited voluntarily both through social media and Infectious Diseases clinics at participating hospitals. There were 153 respondents. Most were male (77%), aged between 30 and 60 years (77%), and Australian-born (63%). Forty-three percent, 31%, and 25% reported negative impacts upon personal relationships, employment, and income, respectively. HIV care continued with 95% and 98% being able to access their HIV provider and antiretroviral therapy (ART), respectively. Telehealth was used by 92% and was largely well received. PLHIV reported worry about physical health (68%), mental health (66%), finances (50%),z and accommodation (25%). Fifty percent of participants reported weight gain and 27% increased alcohol intake. This study demonstrated the widespread negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PLHIV in Victoria, although provision of HIV care and ART continued uninterrupted. This highlighted the importance of mental health support and social welfare programs during times of health care and societal strain.","Weerasuria, Mihiri; Ko, Christy; Ehm, Adam; O039,; Bryan, Jessica; McMahon, James; Woolley, Ian; Hoy, Jennifer; Lau, Jillian",AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,,77

446151,Prelims,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite the necessity, there is no reliable biomarker to predict disease severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. The currently published prediction models are not fully applicable to clinical use. OBJECTIVES: To identify predictive biomarkers of COVID-19 severity and to justify their threshold values for the stratification of the risk of deterioration that would require transferring to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: The study cohort (560 subjects) included all consecutive patients admitted to Dubai Mediclinic Parkview Hospital from February to May 2020 with COVID-19 confirmed by the PCR. The challenge of finding the cut-off thresholds was the unbalanced dataset (eg, the disproportion in the number of 72 patients admitted to ICU vs 488 non-severe cases). Therefore, we customised supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm in terms of threshold value used to predict worsening. RESULTS: With the default thresholds returned by the ML estimator, the performance of the models was low. It was improved by setting the cut-off level to the 25th percentile for lymphocyte count and the 75th percentile for other features. The study justified the following threshold values of the laboratory tests done on admission: lymphocyte count <2.59×109/L, and the upper levels for total bilirubin 11.9 µmol/L, alanine aminotransferase 43 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 32 U/L, D-dimer 0.7 mg/L, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 39.9 s, creatine kinase 247 U/L, C reactive protein (CRP) 14.3 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase 246 U/L, troponin 0.037 ng/mL, ferritin 498 ng/mL and fibrinogen 446 mg/dL.

DATA DESCRIPTION: A targeted survey was conducted online with rare disease individual or collaborative groups. The results of the survey highlight the challenges individual and collaborative groups are facing during this pandemic and help to identify what support should be put in place to enable them to sustain their much-valued service through these trialing times. Groups have experienced an increase in calls to their helplines as well as followers to their websites and social media feeds. Groups are no longer meeting in person and so online meetings, webinars and zoom chats have become a regular occurrence. Fundraising was highlighted as an area of concern for such groups.

This aim of this study was to determine the demographic details of patients with anosmia, prevalence of anosmia and the time taken for it to resolve in patients who are positive for COVID-19 and took treatment in our hospital. Cross Sectional Study. Patients with real time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) positive nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study. The study group was interviewed through telephonic calls and a questionnaire filled to see the development and regression of their symptoms. Of the study population of 1000, 742 patients had some sort of a smell disturbance. There was a positive correlation between the severity of the disease and history of smoking. The prevalence of smell disturbances among COVID-19 patients in our study was 74.2%. One important finding that we found out was that majority of the smokers had moderate disease. Most of the patients had complete recovery form smell disturbance in the due course of time. The mean time for resolution of smell disturbance was found to be 9.89 days. Anosmia and ageusia can represent the only symptomatology present in patients with COVID-19 and they are completely reversible and hence they can be used as early predictors of infection.

METHODS: Based on the suggestions of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies [8], health-care providers need to be trained to increase three components of resilience across the three levels of individual, team, and organization so that they can optimally manage their psychological responses to catastrophes. RESULTS: It seems that both targeted individual and organizational strategies are critical for the overall wellness of health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Health care workers experience high levels of burnout during the COVID-19, which warrants attention and support from health policy-makers and practitioners.

Logistic regression analysis was performed and the proportion of treatment effect explained by BMD in vertebral fracture risk was estimated. The results demonstrate that both total hip BMD T-score and change can be strong predictors of subsequent fracture risk, and that total hip BMD change explained 73%, while T-score explained 23%, of the treatment effect. In contrast, neither femoral neck BMD change nor T-score can predict the effect of denosumab on vertebral fracture risk. Furthermore, although lumbar spine BMD T-score was associated with vertebral fracture incidence, lumbar spine BMD change was inversely related to vertebral fracture risk. Because there was no relationship between lumbar spine BMD change and T-score at 24 months of denosumab treatment, and because there can be small undetectable vertebral deformities that may increase BMD values, these results suggest that lumbar spine BMD change is not a good surrogate for vertebral fracture risk assessment. It is suggested that both total hip BMD change and T-score can be good surrogates for predicting vertebral fracture risk in Japanese patients with osteoporosis under denosumab treatment.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00680953.","Okubo, Naoki; Matsui, Shigeyuki; Matsumoto, Toshio; Sugimoto, Toshitsugu; Hosoi, Takayuki; Osakabe, Taisuke; Watanabe, Ko; Takami, Hideo; Shiraki, Masataka; Nakamura, Toshitaka",Calcif. tissue int,,77

453260,The State of Melanoma: Emergent Challenges and Opportunities,2021,"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer are particularly vulnerable to stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing is critical for patients with cancer; however, it can also reduce their access to psychosocial coping resources. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore patient experiences to generate a model of how virtual mind-body programs can support the psychosocial well-being of patients with cancer. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study among patients (aged &#8805;18 years) who participated in a virtual mind-body program offered by a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program consisted of mind-body group therapy sessions of fitness, yoga, tai chi, dance therapy, music therapy, and meditation. Live integrative medicine clinicians held each session via Zoom videoconferencing for 30-45 minutes. In semistructured phone interviews (n=30), patients were asked about their overall impressions and perceptions of the benefits of the sessions, including impacts on stress and anxiety. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. RESULTS: Among the 30 participants (average age 64.5 years, SD 9.36, range 40-80, 29 female), three major themes were identified relating to experiences in the virtual mind-body program: (1) the sessions helped the patients maintain structured routines and motivated them to adhere to healthy behaviors; (2) the sessions enhanced coping with COVID-19-related-stressors, allowing patients to ""refocus"" and ""re-energize""; and (3) the sessions allowed patients to connect, fostering social relationships during a time of isolation. These themes informed the constructs of a novel behavioral-psychological-social coping model for patients with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual mind-body programming supported patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic through a behavioral-psychological-social coping model by enhancing psychological coping for external stressors, supporting adherence to motivation and health behaviors, and increasing social connection and camaraderie. These programs have potential to address the behavioral, psychological, and social challenges faced by patients with cancer during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The constructs of the conceptual model proposed in this study can inform future interventions to support isolated patients with cancer. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm the specific benefits of virtual mind-body programming for the psychosocial well-being and healthy behaviors of patients with cancer.","Emard, Nicholas; Lynch, Kathleen A; Liou, Kevin T; Atkinson, Thomas; Green, Angela K; Daly, Bobby; Trevino, Kelly; Mao, Jun J",JMIR Cancer,,77

MATERIAL AND METHODS A survey study was conducted among 120 front-line medical staff in the fight against COVID-19, of which 60 medical staff worked at the designated hospital (experimental group) and 60 medical staff worked at the non-designated hospital (control group). The Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) were used to assess mental status. Sleep status was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS SCL-90 scores of somatization, depression, anxiety, and terror were higher than normal in front-line medical staff at the designated hospital. The SAS (45.89±1.117), SDS (50.13±1.813), and PCL-C (50.13±1.813) scores in the experimental group were higher than the normal control group, and were significantly different from those in the control group on SDS and PCL-C scales (P<0.05). The total average PSQI of the experimental group was 16.07±3.761, indicating that the sleep quality was poor. Among them, participants with moderate insomnia reached 61.67%, and participants with severe insomnia reached 26.67%. CONCLUSIONS There are psychological symptoms and sleep symptoms in front-line medical staff who participate in the fight against COVID-19, and they affect each other. Hospitals should improve emergency management measures, strengthen psychological counseling for clinical front-line medical staff, strengthen exercise intervention, and improve their sleep quality and mental health.","Wu, Koulong; Wei, Xuemei",Med Sci Monit Basic Res,,77

Identifying contributing factors and learning their roles in the stigmatization process may help tackle the problem. This study quantitatively assessed the severity of stigmatization against three different groups of people: people from major COVID-19 outbreak sites, those who had been quarantined, and healthcare workers;explored the factors associated with stigmatization within the frameworks of self-categorization theory and core social motives;and proposed solutions to resolve stigma. The cross-sectional online survey was carried out between April 21 and May 7, 2020, using a convenience sample, which yielded 1,388 valid responses. Employing data analysis methods like multivariate linear regression and moderation analysis, this study yields some main findings: (1) those from major COVID-19 outbreak sites received the highest level of stigma;(2) factors most closely associated with stigmatization, in descending order, are objectification and epidemic proximity in an autonomic aspect and fear of contracting COVID-19 in a controllable aspect;and (3) superordinate categorization is a buffering moderator in objectification-stigmatization relationship. These findings are important for further understanding COVID-19-related stigma, and they can be utilized to develop strategies to fight against relevant discrimination and bias. Specifically, reinforcing superordinate categorization by cultivating common in-group identity, such as volunteering and donating for containment of the pandemic, could reduce objectification and, thus, alleviate stigma.","Chen, Y.; Jin, J.; Zhang, X.; Zhang, Q.; Dong, W.; Chen, C.",Frontiers in Psychology,,77

Clinical trials demonstrate high efficacy of mRNA based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in older adults but concerns about virus variant escape have not been well addressed. We have conducted an in-depth analysis of humoral and cellular immunity against an early-pandemic viral isolate and compared that to the P.1. (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants, as well to a B.1.595 SARS-CoV-2 isolate bearing Spike mutation E484Q, in <55 and >65 age cohorts of mRNA vaccine recipients. As reported, robust immunity required the second dose of vaccine. Older vaccine recipients exhibited an expected 3-5x reduction (but not a complete loss) in neutralizing antibody titers against both P.1. (Gamma) and the B.1.595 virus at the peak of the boosted response. However, older vaccinees manifest robust cellular immunity against early-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and more recent variants, which remained statistically comparable to the adult group. While the duration of these immune responses remains to be determined over longer periods of time, these results provide reasons for optimism regarding vaccine protection of older adults against SARS-CoV-2 variants and inform thinking about boost vaccination with variant vaccines. eTOC summaryVaccine responses are often diminished with aging, but we found strong responses to SARS-CoV-2 in older adults following mRNA vaccination. T cell responses were not diminished when confronted by SARS-CoV-2 variants. Neutralizing Ab were reduced but not more than those in adults.

457677,Correction to Lancet Haematol 2020; 7: e632-34,2020,"Resumen: El sistema renina angiotensina aldosterona (SRAA) es el principal regulador del volumen plasmático, manteniendo la homeostasis cardiovascular e hidrosalina. En la vía clásica, la enzima convertidora de angiotensina (ECA) genera Angiotensina II (AngII), de potente efecto inflamatorio y vasoconstrictor. Esta vía clásica es a su vez regulada por la ECA2, que convierte AngII a Ang 1-7, cuyas acciones vaso dilatadoras y antiinflamatorias dan balance a los efectos de AngII. La ECA2 se ha relacionado con la patogenia de infecciones respiratorias como el virus respiratorio sincicial y el síndrome respiratorio agudo grave por coronavirus (SARS-CoV y SARS-CoV-2). Estudios recientes han demostrado que la ECA2 corresponde al principal receptor del SARS-CoV-2, que en conjunto con otros receptores como la serin proteasa TMPRSS2, permiten la fijación, fusión y entrada del virus a la célula huésped. En animales infectados por SARS-CoV se produce una caída de la concentración tisular de ECA2 y Ang 1-7, con la consiguiente sobreexpresión de AngII, y sus efectos vasoconstrictores e inflamatorios. Experimentos con ECA2 recombinante han mostrado un efecto protector frente a la sobreexpresión del SRAA en animales infectados por SARS-CoV, efecto similar al demostrado con el uso de bloquea- dores del receptor de AngII, AT1. La evidencia sobre el rol protector de ECA2 parece respaldar las recomendaciones respecto a no suspender estos medicamentos en la infección SARS-CoV-2. En este artículo presentamos el conocimiento actual sobre el rol del SRAA en la infección por SARS-CoV, a partir de conceptos fisiopatológicos, bases moleculares, y evidencia experimental y clínica.","Cano, F.; Gajardo, M.; Freundlich, M.",Rev. chil. pediatr,,77

Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective, observational study using cross-sectional data for all 139 U.S. Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs). We used logistic regression analyses to identify factors that predicted whether a VAMC was in the top quartile of VA Video Connect (VVC) telehealth uptake for primary care and mental health care. Results: All 139 VAMCs increased their VVC uptake at least 2-fold early in the pandemic, with most increasing uptake between 5- and 10-fold. Pre-COVID-19, higher VVC uptake in primary care was weakly and positively associated with having more high-risk patients, negatively associated with having more long-distance patients, and positively associated with the prior fiscal year's VVC uptake. During COVID-19, the positive association with high-risk patients and the negative association with long-distance patients strengthened, while weaker broadband coverage was negatively associated with VVC uptake. For mental health care, having more long-distance patients was positively associated with higher VVC uptake pre-COVID-19, but this relationship reversed during COVID-19. Discussion: Despite the marked increase in VVC uptake early in the COVID-19 pandemic, significant VAMC-level variation indicates that VVC adoption was more difficult for some medical centers, particularly those with poorer broadband coverage and less prior VVC experience. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings highlight opportunities for medical centers, VA Central Office, and other federal entities to ensure equitable access to video telehealth.","Jacobs, Josephine; Ferguson, Jacqueline M; Van Campen, James; Yefimova, Maria; Greene, Liberty; Heyworth, Leonie; Zulman, Donna M",Telemed. j. e. health,,77

Several industries including transportation industry have been hard hit by the pandemic. As the virus is transmitted through close contact with infected people, number of outdoor trips has reduced causing roads and public transport to be less crowded than before. In order to develop transport-related policies for the post COVID-19 world, it is necessary to explore how the pandemic has affected the travel behavior pattern. This study explored the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on travel pattern and mode preferences in Pakistan using a questionnaire survey. The results showed significant shift in primary traveling purpose from work and studying to shopping during the pandemic. Number of trips performed for non-commuting purposes were also significantly different before and during the pandemic. A significant modal shift from motorbike to non-motorized modes of travel was found for distances less than 5 km. For longer distances, people shifted from public transport to private car. These findings suggest that past policies regarding different modes may be revisited in the post COVID-19 world. The statistical tests performed on the factors affecting mode choices indicated that the respondents put more priority on pandemic-related items such as infection concern, social distance, hand sanitizers' availability, and cleanliness, etc., during the pandemic.

A number of anti-viral drugs such as ribavirin, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, antibiotics such as azithromycin and doxycycline, and anti-parasite such as ivermectin have been recommended for COVID-19 treatment. In addition, sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence have been presented to use chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, Zn has the ability to enhance innate and adaptive immunity in the course of a viral infection. Besides, Zn supplement can favour COVID-19 treatment using those suggested and/or recommended drugs. Again, the effectiveness of Zn can be enhanced by using chloroquine as an ionophore while Zn inside the infected cell can stop SARS-CoV-2 replication. Given those benefits, this perspective paper describes how and why Zn could be given due consideration as a complement to the prescribed treatment of COVID-19.","Rahman, Mohammad Tariqur; Idid, Syed Zahir",Biol. trace elem. res,,77

467939,The role of primary and secondary bio-molecules in optical diagnosis of pandemic COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"The great majority of globally circulating pathogens go undetected, undermining patient care and hindering outbreak preparedness and response. To enable routine surveillance and comprehensive diagnostic applications, there is a need for detection technologies that can scale to test many samples1-3 while simultaneously testing for many pathogens4-6. Here, we develop Combinatorial Arrayed Reactions for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic acids (CARMEN), a platform for scalable, multiplexed pathogen detection. In the CARMEN platform, nanolitre droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents7 self-organize in a microwell array8 to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMEN-Cas13) enables robust testing of more than 4,500 crRNA-target pairs on a single array. Using CARMEN-Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. CARMEN-Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations. The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold. Scalable, highly multiplexed CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection shifts diagnostic and surveillance efforts from targeted testing of high-priority samples to comprehensive testing of large sample sets, greatly benefiting patients and public health9-11.","Ackerman, Cheri M; Myhrvold, Cameron; Thakku, Sri Gowtham; Freije, Catherine A; Metsky, Hayden C; Yang, David K; Ye, Simon H; Boehm, Chloe K; Kosoko-Thoroddsen, Tinna-Sólveig F; Kehe, Jared; Nguyen, Tien G; Carter, Amber; Kulesa, Anthony; Barnes, John R; Dugan, Vivien G; Hung, Deborah T; Blainey, Paul C; Sabeti, Pardis C",Nature,,77

The applications seek to overcome or adapt to the conditions and limitations of indigenous communities, caused by a series of bureaucratic administrative processes, and also seek to be complementary tools or support to the Virtual Education services that the Peruvian government has been promoting in the context of the COVID-19 Pandemic, and although classes continue to develop virtually through television, radio, software messaging services and electronic platforms, these media have been receiving a series of criticisms by parents and part of the education sector regarding the quality of service. Through the realization of two case studies, favorable results were achieved on the use and potentialities of supporting the educational social inclusion of indigenous children. Finally, a comparative table was made on the frequent problems, the new problems that have arisen in the context of COVID-19, and the scope and advantages of each of the mobile applications. At the same time, it is suggested that government strategies incorporate the use of interactive mobile self-learning applications as complementary mechanisms to current educational services, which should be contextualized to the geographic, cultural and linguistic environment of students, taking into account the limited telecommunications and electricity coverage of indigenous communities in Peru. © 2020 IEEE.","Yahuarcani, I.

Together, the human organism and the human microbiome work as a complex super-organism throughout the human life cycle. Microbiome science provides direct evidence and substantiation of the fundamental principles of homeopathy, including holism, psychosomatics, direction of cure, the Law of Similars, individuality and susceptibility, minimum dose, and homeostasis. Whilst many conventional (allopathic) medical treatments irreversibly damage the ecology of the microbiome and trigger chronic immune dysfunction and inflammation, the future sustainability of the entire field of medicine depends on the ability to recognize these inconvenient biological truths and to embrace a safer approach based on this evidence. Fortunately, one of the oldest forms of clinically verifiable, evidence-based, and ecologically sustainable medicine, that does not harm the microbiome, already exists in the form of homeopathy.","Whitmont, Ronald D",Homeopathy,,77
470829,Impact of US vaccination strategy on COVID-19 wave dynamics,2021,"Balancing common disease treatment and epidemic control is a key objective of medical supplies procurement in hospitals during a pandemic such as COVID-19. This problem can be formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem for simultaneously optimizing the effects of common disease treatment and epidemic control. However, due to the large number of supplies, difficulties in evaluating the effects, and the strict budget constraint, it is difficult for existing evolutionary multiobjective algorithms to efficiently approximate the Pareto front of the problem. In this paper, we present an approach that first transforms the original high-dimensional, constrained multiobjective optimization problem to a low-dimensional, unconstrained multiobjective optimization problem, and then evaluates each solution to the transformed problem by solving a set of simple single-objective optimization subproblems, such that the problem can be efficiently solved by existing evolutionary multiobjective algorithms. We applied the transform-and-divide evolutionary optimization approach to six hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, during the peak of COVID-19. Results showed that the proposed approach exhibits significantly better performance than that of directly solving the original problem. Our study has also shown that transform-and-divide evolutionary optimization based on problem-specific knowledge can be an efficient solution approach to many other complex problems and, therefore, enlarge the application field of evolutionary algorithms.","Zheng, Yu-Jun; Chen, Xin; Gan, Tie-Er; Zhang, Min-Xia; Sheng, Wei-Guo; Wang, Ling",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00395v1.pdf,77

471820,Exaggerating Harmful Drug Effects on the Brain Is Killing Black People,2020,"Droplet dispersion carrying viruses/bacteria in enclosed/crowded buses may induce transmissions of respiratory infectious diseases, but the influencing mechanisms have been rarely investigated. By conducting high-resolution CFD simulations, this paper investigates the evaporation and transport of solid-liquid mixed droplets (initial diameter 10 µm and 50 µm, solid to liquid ratio is 1:9) exhaled in a coach bus with 14 thermal manikins. Five air-conditioning supply directions and ambient relative humidity (RH = 35 % and 95 %) are considered. Results show that ventilation effectiveness, RH and initial droplet size significantly influence droplet transmissions in coach bus. 50 µm droplets tend to evaporate completely within 1.8 s and 7 s as RH = 35 % and 95 % respectively, while 0.2 s or less for 10 µm droplets. Thus 10 µm droplets diffuse farther with wider range than 50 µm droplets which tend to deposit more on surfaces. Droplet dispersion pattern differs due to various interactions of gravity, ventilation flows and the upward thermal body plume. The fractions of droplets suspended in air, deposited on wall surfaces are quantified. This study implies high RH, backward supply direction and passengers sitting at nonadjacent seats can effectively reduce infection risk of droplet transmission in buses. Besides taking masks, regular cleaning is also recommended since 85 %-100 % of droplets deposit on object surfaces.","Yang, Xia; Ou, Cuiyun; Yang, Hongyu; Liu, Li; Song, Tie; Kang, Min; Lin, Hualiang; Hang, Jian",J Hazard Mater,,77

Though nursing homes increasingly receive attention, the majority of people with cognitive decline and dementia live at home. We aimed to explore the psychosocial effects of corona measures in memory clinic (pre-)dementia patients and their caregivers. Methods: Between April 28th and July 13th 2020, n = 389 patients of Alzheimer center Amsterdam [n = 121 symptomatic (age = 69 ± 6, 33%F, MMSE = 23 ± 5), n = 268 cognitively normal (age = 66 ± 8, 40% F, MMSE = 29 ± 1)] completed a survey on psychosocial effects of the corona measures. Questions related to social isolation, worries for faster cognitive decline, behavioral problems and discontinuation of care. In addition, n = 147 caregivers of symptomatic patients completed a similar survey with additional questions on caregiver burden. Results: Social isolation was experienced by n = 42 (35%) symptomatic and n = 67 (25%) cognitively normal patients and two third of patients [n = 129 (66%); n = 58 (75%) symptomatic, n = 71 (61%) cognitively normal] reported that care was discontinued. Worries for faster cognitive decline were existed in symptomatic patients [n = 44 (44%)] and caregivers [n = 73 (53%)], but were also reported by a subgroup of cognitively normal patients [n = 27 (14%)]. Both patients [n = 56 (46%) symptomatic, n = 102 (38%) cognitively normal] and caregivers [n = 72 (48%)] reported an increase in psychological symptoms. More than three quarter of caregivers [n = 111(76%)] reported an increase in patients' behavioral problems. A higher caregiver burden was experienced by n = 69 (56%) of caregivers and n = 43 (29%) of them reported that a need for more support. Discontinuation of care (OR = 3.3 [1.3-7.9]), psychological (OR = 4.0 [1.6-9.9]) and behavioral problems (OR = 3.0 [1.0-9.0]) strongly related to experiencing a higher caregiver burden. Lastly, social isolation (OR = 3.2 [1.2-8.1]) and psychological symptoms (OR = 8.1 [2.8-23.7]) were red flags for worries for faster cognitive decline. Conclusion: Not only symptomatic patients, but also cognitively normal patients express worries for faster cognitive decline and psychological symptoms. Moreover, we identified patients who are at risk of adverse outcomes of the corona measures, i.e., discontinued care, social isolation, psychological and behavioral problems. This underlines the need for health care professionals to provide ways to warrant the continuation of care and support (informal) networks surrounding patients and caregivers to mitigate the higher risk of negative psychosocial effects.","van Maurik, Ingrid S; Bakker, Els D; van den Buuse, Susanne; Gillissen, Freek; van de Beek, Marleen; Lemstra, Evelien; Mank, Arenda; van den Bosch, Karlijn A; van Leeuwenstijn, Mardou; Bouwman, Femke H; Scheltens, Philip; van der Flier, Wiesje M",Front Psychiatry,,77

As of April 2020, these performance data had been aggregated and shared in regularly updated reports with other laboratories, Dutch government, public health organizations, and the public. This frequently updated overview of assay performance increased the efficiency of our national laboratory response, supporting laboratories in their choice and implementation of assays. Aggregated performance data for 47 immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 showed that none of the evaluated immunoassays that detect only IgM or IgA met the diagnostic criteria, indicating that they are not suitable for diagnosing acute infections. For the detection of IgG, only the Biozek Corona virus COVID rapid test, Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and Wantai SARS-CoV-2 antibody (Ab) ELISA met predefined performance criteria in hospitalized patients where samples were collected 14 days post-onset of symptoms (DPO), while for patients with mild or asymptomatic infections, only the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA met the predefined performance criteria if samples were collected 14 days postonset.

The extant studies have identified two distinct attitudes of consumers about food label information: one is its usefulness and the second elucidates the avoidance. Hence forth, the current study contributes to the extant literature while signifying both reasons which motivate consumers to read food labels and reasons which discourage consumers from consult food labels at the point of purchase. Moreover, the impact of subjective norms and self-efficacy for healthy packaged food intentions has also been examined for both before the emergence of COVID-19 and during the spread of COVID-19. The underpinning of the proposed model has been justified by the behavioral reasoning theory. The cross-sectional data of 14,455 students has was collected from 10 universities through Microsoft Teams and Zoom. AMOS 21 was employed for the final analysis. The results indicate that before COVID-19 the subjective norms and self-efficacy were not the stimulating factors for the selection of healthy packaged food. On the contrary, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the subjective norms and self-efficacy divulged a significant effect. Moreover, the reasons to consult food labels are positively significant whereas the reasons to avoid food labels have negatively affected the consumer, both before COVID-19 and during COVID-19 outbreak, while endorsing healthy packaged food. Conclusively, COVID-19 has been proved to be a deterrent for unhealthy packaged food lovers while being a blessing for healthy packaged food.","Zafar, Muhammad Zeeshan; Maqbool, Adnan; Cioca, Lucian-Ionel; Shah, Syed Ghulam Meran; Masud, Shahjahan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,77

In this article, we discuss the pathogenic consequences of the cytokine storm and its relationship with COVID-19 associated risk factors. The increased pro-inflammatory immune status in patients with risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, COPD) exacerbates the Cytokine-storm of COVID-19 into a 'Cytokine Super Cyclone'.

Additional circumstances unique to students affected their studies during the early stages of the pandemic, with changes in living and studying mid-semester. The current study aimed to investigate predictors of fear of COVID-19 in college students during this acute phase using cross-sectional and longitudinal samples. In total, 175 undergraduate students completed an online questionnaire in the spring 2020 semester following lockdown. A subset of 58 students completed a separate survey in fall 2019, which served as a baseline. For the cross-sectional sample, pre-COVID-19 and current living situations did not predict COVID-19 fears. However, a propensity to experience panic was significantly associated with greater COVID-19 fears. How students coped with the pandemic was not associated with COVID-19 fears, although a greater propensity to use denial as a coping style tended to be related to greater COVID-19 fears. In the longitudinal subsample, students showed decreased positive mood and social stress load while depressive mood increased after lockdown. Their preferred coping styles changed, utilizing more self-distraction and acceptance, and less self-blame and substance use. Findings reflect both positive and negative consequences of the pandemic. The unique changes in students' lifestyles will need to be met by tailored interventions.","Hasratian, Anni M; Nordberg, Hannah O; Meuret, Alicia E; Ritz, Thomas",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,77

485821,Leveraging systems biology for predicting modulators of inflammation in patients with COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: There are no publicly available national data on healthcare worker infections in Australia. It has been documented in many countries that healthcare workers (HCW) are at increased occupational risk of COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the burden of COVID-19 on Australia HCW and the health system by obtaining and organizing data on HCW infections, analyzing national HCW cases in regards to occupational risk and analyzing healthcare outbreak. METHODS: We searched government reports and websites and media reports to create a comprehensive line listing of Australian HCW infections and nosocomial outbreaks between January 25th and July 8th, 2020. A line list of HCW related COVID-19 reported cases was created and enhanced by matching data extracted from media reports of healthcare related COVID-19 relevant outbreaks and reports, using matching criteria. Rates of infections and odds ratios (ORs) for HCW were calculated per state, by comparing overall cases to HCW cases. To investigate the sources of infection amongst HCW, transmission data were collated and graphed to show distribution of sources. RESULTS: We identified 36 hospital outbreaks or HCW infection reports between January 25th and July 8th, 2020. According to our estimates, at least 536 HCW in Australia had been infected with COVID-19, comprising 6.03% of all reported infections. The rate of HCW infection was 90/100000 and of community infection 34/100,000. HCW were 2.69 times more likely to contract COVID-19 (95% CI 2.48 to 2.93; Pâ¯<â¯0.001). The timing of hospital outbreaks did not always correspond to community peaks. Where data were available, a total of 131 HCW across 21 outbreaks led to 1656 HCW being furloughed for quarantine. In one outbreak, one hospital was closed and 1200 HCW quarantined. CONCLUSION: The study shows that HCW were at nearly 3 times the risk of infection. Of concern, this nearly tripling of risk occurred during a period of low community prevalence suggesting failures at multiple hazard levels including PPE policies within the work environment. Even in a country with relatively good control of COVID-19, HCW are at greater risk of infection than the general community and nosocomial outbreaks can have substantial effects on workforce capacity by the quarantine of numerous HCW during an outbreak. The occurrence of hospital outbreaks even when community incidence was low highlights the high risk setting that hospitals present. Australia faced a resurgence of COVID-19 after the study period, with multiple hospital outbreaks. We recommend formal reporting of HCW infections, testing protocols for nosocomial outbreaks, cohorting of workforce to minimize the impact, and improved PPE guidelines to provide precautionary and optimal protection for HCW.","Quigley, Ashley L; Stone, Haley; Nguyen, Phi Yen; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; MacIntyre, C Raina",Int J Nurs Stud,,77

The aim of this global survey was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on surgical training and to develop a framework for recovery. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted. This was designed by a steering committee of medical educationalists and validated by a group of trainees before dissemination. RESULTS: A total of 608 responses were obtained from 34 countries and 15 specialties. The results demonstrated major disruption in all aspects of training. The impact was greatest for conferences (525 of 608) and hands-on courses (517 of 608), but less for inpatient care-related training (268 of 608). European trainees were significantly more likely to experience direct training disruption than trainees in Asia (odds ratio 0.15) or Australia (OR 0.10) (&#967;2 = 87.162, P < 0.001). Alternative training resources (webinars, 359 of 608; educational videos, 234 of 608) have emerged, although trainees expressed some dissatisfaction with them. The collective responses generated a four-pillar framework for training recovery that involved: guidance from training stakeholders with the involvement of trainees; prioritization of training, especially the roles of senior surgeons/trainers; provision of access to alternative/new teaching methods; and measures to address trainee anxiety. CONCLUSION: Training has been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The introduction of new teaching methods and a focus on training after the pandemic are imperative.","Yiasemidou, M; Tomlinson, J; Chetter, I; Shenkar, Biyani C",,,77

With tens of thousands of adults and children in more than 200 immigration detention centers across the United States, immigration detention centers are likely to experience COVID-19 outbreaks and add substantially to the population of those infected.Despite compelling evidence indicating a heightened risk of infection among detainees, state and federal governments have done little to protect the health of detained im-migrants. An evidence-based public health framework must guide the COVID-19 response in immigration detention centers.We draw on the hierarchy of controls framework to demonstrate how immigration detention centers are failing to implement even the least effective control strategies. Drawing on this framework and recent legal and medical advocacy efforts, we argue that safely releasing detainees from immigration detention centers into their communities is the most effective way to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in immigration detention settings. Failure to do so will result in infection and death among those detained and deepen existing health and social inequities. (Am J Public Health.

487243,Rapid Detection of COVID-19 Using MALDI-TOF-Based Serum Peptidome Profiling,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization created the Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) criteria in 2011 to monitor influenza (flu)-related hospitalization. Many studies have since used the SARI case definition as inclusion criteria for surveillance studies. We sought to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the SARI criteria for detecting ten different respiratory viruses in a Middle Eastern pediatric cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data for this study comes from a prospective acute respiratory surveillance study of hospitalized children <2 years in Amman, Jordan from March 16, 2010 to March 31, 2013. Participants were recruited if they had a fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Nasal and throat swabs were obtained and tested by real-time RT-PCR for eleven viruses. Subjects meeting SARI criteria were determined post-hoc. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the SARI case definition for detecting ten different viruses were calculated and results were stratified by age. RESULTS: Of the 3,175 patients enrolled, 3,164 were eligible for this study, with a median age of 3.5 months, 60.4% male, and 82% virus-positive (44% RSV and 3.8% flu). The sensitivity and specificity of the SARI criteria for detecting virus-positive patients were 44% and 77.9%, respectively. Sensitivity of SARI criteria for any virus was lowest in children <3 months at 22.4%. Removing fever as a criterion improved the sensitivity by 65.3% for detecting RSV in children <3 months; whereas when cough was removed, the sensitivity improved by 45.5% for detecting flu in same age group. CONCLUSIONS: The SARI criteria have poor sensitivity for detecting RSV, flu, and other respiratory viruses-particularly in children <3 months. Researchers and policy makers should use caution if using the criteria to estimate burden of disease in children.","Klink, Thomas; Rankin, Danielle A; Piya, Bhinnata; Spieker, Andrew J; Faouri, Samir; Shehabi, Asem; Williams, John V; Khuri-Bulos, Najwa; Halasa, Natasha B",PLoS One,,77

A mixed methods online survey was used to examine these factors during social distancing mid-lockdown, July 2020. Participants were asked to state whether loneliness, wellbeing, social activity, and social support had changed since pre-social distancing, and to provide details of strategies used to keep socially active. A total of 1429 adults (84% aged 60+ years) living in Scotland took part. The majority reported that social distancing regulations made them experience more loneliness and less social contact and support. Loneliness during lockdown was higher than reported norms for this age group before the pandemic. A larger social network, more social contact, and better perceived social support seemed to be protective against loneliness and poor wellbeing. Positive coping strategies reported included increasing online social contact with both existing social networks and reconnecting with previous networks, as well as increasing contact with neighbours and people in the community. This underlines the importance of addressing loneliness and social support in older adults but particularly during situations where risk of isolation is high.","Tomaz, Simone A; Coffee, Pete; Ryde, Gemma C; Swales, Bridgitte; Neely, Kacey C; Connelly, Jenni; Kirkland, Andrew; McCabe, Louise; Watchman, Karen; Andreis, Federico; Martin, Jack G; Pina, Ilaria; Whittaker, Anna C",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,77
488018,Mindfulness-based interventions: an overall review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Several observational studies have reported elevated baseline D-dimer levels in patients hospitalized for moderate to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These elevated baseline D-dimer levels have been associated with disease severity and mortality in retrospective cohorts. OBJECTIVES: To review current available data on the association between D-Dimer levels and mortality in patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published studies using MEDLINE and EMBASE through 13 April 2020. Two authors independently screened all records and extracted the outcomes. A random effects model was used to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Six original studies enrolling 1355 hospitalized patients with moderate to critical COVID-19 (391 in the non-survivor group and 964 in the survivor group) were considered for the final pooled analysis. When pooling together the results of these studies, D-Dimer levels were found to be higher in non-survivors than in-survivors. The SMD in D-Dimer levels between non-survivors and survivors was 3.59µg/L (95% CI 2.79-4.40µg/L), and the Z-score for overall effect was 8.74 (P<0.00001), with a high heterogeneity across studies (I2=95%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high heterogeneity across included studies, the present pooled analysis indicates that D-Dimer levels are significantly associated with the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Early integration of D-Dimer testing, which is a rapid, inexpensive, and easily accessible biological test, can be useful to better risk stratification and management of COVID-19 patients.","Sakka, M; Connors, J M; Hékimian, G; Martin-Toutain, I; Crichi, B; Colmegna, I; Bonnefont-Rousselot, D; Farge, D; Frere, C",J Med Vasc,,77

METHODS: With data from Edoxaban Treatment in routiNe clinical prActice for patients with AF in Europe (ETNA-AF-Europe), a large prospective observational study, we compared clinical characteristics (including the dose reduction criteria for edoxaban: creatinine clearance 15-50â¯ml/min, weight &#8804;60â¯kg, and/or use of strong p­glycoprotein inhibitors) of patients from Belgium and the Netherlands (BeNe) with those from other European countries (OEC). RESULTS: Of all 13,639 patients in ETNA-AF-Europe, 2579 were from BeNe. BeNe patients were younger than OEC patients (mean age: 72.3 vs 73.9 years), and had lower CHA2DS2-VASc (mean: 2.8 vs 3.2) and HAS-BLED scores (mean: 2.4 vs 2.6). Patients from BeNe less often had hypertension (61.6% vs 80.4%), and/or diabetes mellitus (17.3% vs 23.1%) than patients from OEC. Moreover, relatively fewer patients in BeNe were prescribed the reduced dose of 30â¯mg edoxaban (14.8%) than in OEC (25.4%). Overall, edoxaban was dosed according to label in 83.1% of patients. Yet, 30â¯mg edoxaban was prescribed in the absence of any dose reduction criteria in 36.9% of 30â¯mg users (5.5% of all patients) in BeNe compared with 35.5% (9.0% of all patients) in OEC. CONCLUSION: There were several notable differences between BeNe and OEC regarding clinical characteristics and dosing practices in patients prescribed edoxaban, which are relevant for the local implementation of dose evaluation and optimisation.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the neurological decline of patients with dementia and the caregivers' burden during the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study. Caregivers of dementia patients following in the outpatient clinic were included. A structured telephone interview composed of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), Beck Depression (BDI) and Anxiety (BAI) Inventories to address cognitive, behavioral, and functional changes associated with social distancing during the Sars-Cov-2 outbreak. Patients were divided in two groups according to caregivers' report: with perceived Altered Cognition (AC) and Stable Cognition (SC). RESULTS: A total of 58 patients (median age: 57 years [21-87], 58.6%females) and caregivers (median age: 76.5 years [55-89], 79.3%females) were included. Cognitive decline was shown by most patients (53.4%), as well as behavioral symptoms (48.3%), especially apathy/depression (24.1%), and functional decline (34.5%).

490247,Longitudinal proteomic profiling reveals increased early inflammation and sustained apoptosis proteins in severe COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: Social determinants of health and racial inequalities impact healthcare access and subsequent coronavirus testing. Limited studies have described the impact of these inequities on rural minorities living in Appalachia. This study investigates factors affecting testing in rural communities. METHODS: PCR testing data were obtained for March through September 2020. Spatial regression analyses were fit at the census tract level. Model outcomes included testing and positivity rate. Covariates included rurality, percent Black population, food insecurity, and area deprivation index (a comprehensive indicator of socioeconomic status). RESULTS: Small clusters in coronavirus testing were detected sporadically, while test positivity clustered in mideastern and southwestern WV. In regression analyses, percent food insecurity (IRR = 3.69×109, [796, 1.92×1016]), rurality (IRR=1.28, [1.12, 1.48]), and percent population Black (IRR = 0.88, [0.84, 0.94]) had substantial effects on coronavirus testing. However, only percent food insecurity (IRR = 5.98 × 104, [3.59, 1.07×109]) and percent Black population (IRR = 0.94, [0.90, 0.97]) displayed substantial effects on the test positivity rate. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight disparities in coronavirus testing among communities with rural minorities. Limited testing in these communities may misrepresent coronavirus incidence.","Hendricks, Brian; Paul, Rajib; Smith, Cassie; Wen, Sijin; Kimble, Wes; Amjad, Ayne; Atkins, Amy; Hodder, Sally",Ann Epidemiol,,77
490590,Scapular surgery under combined thoracic paravertebral and interscalene blocks,2020,"Preventive procedures against COVID-19 pandemic have caused many changes in everyday life’s material aspects. Confinement and social distancing have certainly been the most impacting ones. Such condition highlighted that religions, usually taken as something private and transcendent, are actually very material, in the sense that they are made in contact with and through body practices. The interruption of rituals and gatherings for religious activities prompted new religious material forms, like the use of technology for virtual ceremonies and protection masks adorned with religious motifs, the main point of this paper. Masks with Christian and Afro-Brazilian religious motifs sold on the internet as well as the process of making masks for donation as an unexpected form of religious activity will be here investigated. The goal is to show that material forms are intrinsic to religion and when they are suppressed in a way, they come around in another, for people need materiality to make unreal, real. The use of Material Religion approaches to examine such object should reveal that the many changes in religion triggered by pandemic will have occurred not because of the ideas it may evoke but through the material changes it might have occasioned.","de Souza, Patrícia Rodrigues",Int.

A useful approach is a graded assessment of the public health risk. The Western Australia (WA) experience and associated observed pitfalls in implementing the prediction equation for the potential presence of SARS-CoV-2 on-board based on five COVID-19 outbreaks on commercial and cruise vessels during 2020 is described.Despite best efforts, the qualitative and quantitative predictors of SARS-CoV-2 circulating on-board commercial vessels are failing to deliver the required certainty, and to date, the only accepted method of ascertaining the presence of SARS-CoV-2 remains the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing reported by an accredited laboratory.Based on legal or regulatory requirements, germane processes, underpinned by robust and auditable processes and procedures, must be put in place to inform the risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2 circulating on-board vessels.","Codreanu, Tudor A; Armstrong, Paul K",Prehosp Disaster Med,,77
491914,"Impact of early detection and vaccination strategy in COVID-19 eradication program in Jakarta, Indonesia",2021,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate patient perceptions of COVID-19 precautions and how these precautions have affected their hand and upper extremity surgery experience. Methods: We sent an 18-item survey to 1,213 patients who underwent elective hand and upper extremity surgery at 1 academic institution from October 2020 to January 2021. The survey consisted of questions related to patient demographics, treatment delays due to COVID-19, and patient perceptions of COVID-19 precautions. Descriptive statistics were performed to analyze the survey responses. Responses for patients aged 18-50 and 51+ were compared using a chi-square analysis for categorical variables and a Student t-test for continuous variables. Results: Out of 1,213 invitations, 384 survey respondents completed the survey (31.6%). Of the respondents, 16.8% reported delaying medical treatment for an average of 123.2 days because of COVID-19. The preventative measures were found to be adequate by 95% of patients. Only 2.6% of patients reported experiencing surgical delays due to preoperative COVID-19 testing or other COVID-19-related precautions. COVID-19 testing was seen as necessary by 88% of patients, and 74% did not find COVID-19 testing to be a barrier to their surgery. Patients aged 51+ were more likely to delay seeking medical treatment than younger patients (19.3% vs 9.1%, respectively). Furthermore, those that did delay seeking treatment waited longer on average than their younger counterparts (136.1 vs 72.9 days, respectively). Conclusions: In conclusion, patients undergoing hand and upper extremity surgery typically do not find COVID-19 precautions to be a significant barrier to care and understand their importance. Despite this, many patients, particularly older ones, are delaying medical care for extended periods of time. It is important for hand surgeons to acknowledge their patients' perspectives and work to educate patients on evolving surgical safety guidelines. Clinical relevance: Patient perspectives of current COVID-19 precautions can help inform hand surgeons on areas for continued patient education.","Tawfik, Amr M; Silver, Jeremy M; Katt, Brian M; Patankar, Aneesh; Rivlin, Michael; Beredjiklian, Pedro K",,,77

Outcomes of ICU and non-ICU patients were compared, and a simple nomogram for predicting the probability of ICU transfer after hospital admission was developed based on initial laboratory data using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Differences in laboratory indices were observed between patients admitted to the ICU and those who were not admitted. Several independent predictors of ICU transfer in COVID-19 patients were identified including older age (&#8805;65 years) (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.02), hypertension (HR = 2.65), neutrophil count (HR = 1.11), procalcitonin level (HR = 3.67), prothrombin time (HR = 1.28), and D-dimer level (HR = 1.25). The lymphocyte count and albumin level were negatively associated with mortality (HR = 0.08 and 0.86, respectively). The developed model provides a means for identifying, at hospital admission, the subset of patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of progression and would require transfer to the ICU within 3 and 7 days after hospitalization. This method of early patient triage allows a more effective allocation of limited medical resources.","Zeng, Zihang; Ma, Yiming; Zeng, Huihui; Huang, Peng; Liu, Wenlong; Jiang, Mingyan; Xiang, Xudong; Deng, Dingding; Liao, Xin; Chen, Ping; Chen, Yan",J. med. virol,,77

This paper presents a shift in methodological thinking and deployment of participatory processes towards a more dynamic and resilient approach of user-centered design in a multi-year joint academia-industry design project. We moved beyond an overreliance on resource-intensive formal discrete events - such as in-person design workshops, focus groups, or traditional field studies and observations - towards including more continuous inputs to create a more sustainable and fluid approach within a living lab ecosystem. User-centered data collection methods were organized in a framework across three dimensions of interaction: 1) Communication;2) Timing;and 3) Presence. Expanding methodological options along these differing dimensions increased opportunities for more diversified inputs and sample recruitment, while increasing overall data and design feedback collected. Lowering participation and knowledge sharing thresholds enabled more continuous, inclusive involvement of key stakeholders throughout design processes.","Mallam, S.

The structure-activity relationship of these polyphenols revealed that the hydroxyl group in C3', C4', C5' in the B-ring, C3 in the C-ring, C7 in A-ring, the double bond between C2 and C3 in the C-ring, and glycosylation at C8 in the A-ring contributed to inhibitory effects of flavonoids on Mpro.","Nguyen, Thi Thanh Hanh; Jung, Jong-Hyun; Kim, Min-Kyu; Lim, Sangyong; Choi, Jae-Myoung; Chung, Byoungsang; Kim, Do-Won; Kim, Doman",Molecules (Basel),,77
494605,"From conifers to cognition: Microbes, brain and behavior",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most frequent cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the USA and worldwide. Recent experimental and clinical data suggest that the non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline (PTX) may decrease progression of chronic kidney disease. However, a large-scale randomised clinical trial is needed to determine whether PTX can reduce ESRD and death in DKD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Veterans Affairs (VA) PTXRx is a pragmatic, randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre VA Cooperative Study to test the hypothesis that PTX, when added to usual care, leads to a reduction in the time to ESRD or death in patients with type 2 diabetes with DKD when compared with usual care plus placebo. The study aims to enrol 2510 patients over a 4-year period with an additional up to 5-year follow-up to generate a total of 646 primary events. The primary objective of this study is to compare the time until ESRD or death (all-cause mortality) between participants randomised to PTX or placebo. Secondary endpoints will be: (1) health-related quality of life, (2) time to doubling of serum creatinine, (3) incidence of hospitalisations for congestive heart failure, (4) incidence of a three-point major adverse cardiovascular events composite (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke), (5) incidence of peripheral vascular disease, (6) change in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio from baseline to 6 months and (7) rate of annual change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during the study period. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the VA Central Institutional Review Board (cIRB/18-36) and will be conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The Hines Cooperative Studies Programme will finalise the study results, which will be published in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

494780,Pathogenesis guided therapeutic management of COVID-19: an immunological perspective,2020,"In the recent past, the policy response to informal settlement planning has predominately been to evict and relocate in the form of resettlement, rehabilitation, and redevelopment. Since the inception of the master plan preparation process, planning for informal settlements is still unaddressed or under-addressed. In addition, informal settlements and their workplace spatial dynamic for drawing planning guidelines are often not carried out. This is also evident from the mass exodus of millions of migrant laborers across India, after the Covid19 lockdown. In this research, spatial relation between informal settlement and their workplace dynamics with respect to landuse types has been exercised, with an intent to draw directions for inclusive informal settlement planning. Multi-regression analysis has been carried out between slum location (slum population) and landuse types for the entire Vijayawada Municipal Corporation area. Further, five identified informal settlements in Vijayawada, India, is studied as pilot cases. The study includes mapping of all the five informal settlements and extraction of their spatial correlation with workplaces using GIS. Overlay analysis and origin-destination matrix for pilot cases were performed to understand the spatial dynamics and location preferences of slum dwellers. Besides, random surveys from pilot cases were interviewed to comprehend and ascertain the socioeconomic status and the travel pattern of slum dwellers. The results indicate and reiterate that socioeconomic conditions of informal settlements force people to live as close as possible to their workplace and the need for inclusive policy and urban planning measures at a zonal scale. The study draws the attention of researchers, planners, and policy makers to carry out further research to include informal housing into city development plans. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Ekta, Chundeli F.

497810,"Distribution, contamination status and source of trace elements in the soil around brick kilns",2020,"The trafficking of membrane proteins including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) is an exciting area in pharmacology. Proteins, acting in a diverse array of physiological systems, can have differential signaling consequences depending on their subcellular localization. The objective of this work is the development of a universal method to study, under physiological conditions and in real-time, the different membrane protein internalization processes. This novel method to measure membrane protein internalization will accelerate the drug discovery process for a wide variety of diseases. Our hypothesis is that receptor trafficking can represent a universal feature of membrane proteins and can be exploited to study receptor pharmacology as well as drug development. Methods A short domain of the human endofin was synthesized and subcloned into the four NanoBiT vectors. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 6?104 cells per well. The following day, cells were transfected using four different endofin-receptor plasmid combinations. The combination with the highest signal was chosen for further experimentation. At 24 hr post-transfection, the medium was aspirated and replaced with 100?l OPTIMEM (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), which was then followed by the addition of 25?l substrate (furimazine). Luminescence measurements were taken once every minute for 10 min for signal stabilization. Finally, 10?l of ligand solution was added to each well, and luminescence measurements were immediately recorded. Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate, and each triplicate was averaged before calculating the s.e.m. Results In the quantitative pharmacological analysis of GPCRs, HEK293 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of ligand. The time course graph displays an increase in normalized luminescence over time with increasing ligand concentrations. The area under the curve analysis of this response demonstrates a clear concentration-dependent response to b2AR stimulation. We also explored the pharmacological analysis of a non-GPCR membrane protein, termed FAM19A5 Isoform II, and monitored its internalization by two monoclonal antibodies. Cells were treated with the antibodies A and B, with an EC50 value of 72.5±5nM for antibody A and 33.1±3nM for antibody B. Finally, we were also able to monitor virus entry in living cells via ACE2 internalization by binding with the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein in HEK293 cells treated with lentiviruses expressing the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein at their surface. Conclusions By using this novel approach we were able to characterize the trafficking of a wide variety of membrane proteins ranging from GPCRs to even antibody internalization and SARS-CoV2 virus entry in real-time living cells. We were also able to observe that internalization rates vary dramatically across different families of receptors, with the antibody-mediated internalization having the slowest kinetics. Compared to other technologies where specialized microscopes and fluorophores are required, our approach represents a simple low-cost universal assay to monitor the internalization of membrane proteins under physiological conditions.","Reyes-Alcaraz, Arfaxad Merlinsky Elizabeth McConnell Bradley",The FASEB Journal,,77
498017,Profiling systemic physiology through blood-based multidimensional RNAseq,2021,"The intent of this work was to examine the intersection of COVID-19 fear with social vulnerabilities and mental health consequences among adults living in the United States. Data are from a nationally representative sample (n = 10,368) of U.S. adults surveyed online during demographic subgroups (gender, age, income, race and ethnicity, geography). The sample week of March 23, 2020. The sample was poststratification weighted to ensure a balanced representation across social and demographic subgroups (gender, age, income, race or ethnicity, geography). The sample comprised 51% female; 23% non-White; 18% Hispanic; 25% of households with children under 18 years of age; 55% unmarried; and nearly 20% unemployed, laid off, or furloughed at the time of the interview. Respondents were fearful, averaging a score of nearly 7 on a scale of 10 when asked how fearful they were of COVID-19. Preliminary analysis suggests clear spatial diffusion of COVID-19 fear. Fear appears to be concentrated in regions with the highest reported COVID-19 cases. Significant differences across several U.S. census regions are noted (p < .01). Additionally, significant bivariate relationships were found between socially vulnerable respondents (female, Asians, Hispanic, foreign-born, families with children) and fear, as well as with mental health consequences (anxiety and depressive symptoms). Depressive symptoms, on average, were high (16+ on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), and more than 25% of the sample reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. More in-depth psychosocial research is needed using nationally representative samples that can help to inform potential mental health risks, as well as by targeting specific mental health interventions.

499380,Performance of prognostic markers in pediatric sepsis,2020,"During the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic, online grocery shopping experienced a never seen popularity in many countries. To study how the globally active online grocer Amazon Fresh reacted to this extraordinary demand increase, we analyzed a large dataset of daily price quotes for over 19,000 products for the customer location, Los Angeles. We found that contrary to the US consumer food price index, the overall price level at Amazon Fresh did not increase during the pandemic, but even slightly decreased for several product groups. Amazon seems to follow its low-price strategy also in the grocery sector, even in times of high demand. However, during the lockdown phase, there were more price increases for certain highly demanded product groups such as frozen and prepared foods. Moreover, fewer prices were communicated as promotional prices. Because this change did not influence the general price level, we conclude that such promotional prices are used more as a marketing tool than as a price-setting instrument.","Hillen, Judith",,,77

However, concerns have been raised regarding the pandemic´s impact and associated containment measures (e.g. curfew, lockdown) on non-COVID-19-related acute medical diseases. Objectives: To investigate changes in the incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the period prior to the pandemic and reference periods in previous years. Methods: In this single-center study, we explored all diagnostic imaging tests performed for suspected PE between week 1-17 of the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Incidence of PE (i.e. primary outcome) was analyzed. Secondary outcomes included number of imaging tests for suspected PE. Results: Compared to week 1-11, 2020, an abrupt decline in PE diagnosis (mean weekly rate: 5.2 [95%CI: 3.8-6.6] vs. 1.8 [0.0-3.6]) and imaging tests (32.5 [27.5-37.6] vs. 17.3 [11.6-23.1]) was observed from week 12, with beginning of the containment measures and public lockdown in Austria. Compared to week 12-17 of 2018 and 2019, PE incidence and imaging tests were similarly decreased from 5.3 [3.6-7.1] to 1.8 [0.0-3.6] and 31.5 [27.1-35.9] to 17.3 [11.6-23.1]), respectively. The median (IQR) sPESI score of PE patients during the pandemic was higher than in all other PE patients (3 [1-3] vs. 1 [0-2]; p=0.002). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that the Covid-19 pandemic has an impact on non-COVID-19-related acute diseases as shown by the decline in incidence of PE and imaging procedures for diagnostic work-up. Further studies from other hospitals are needed to confirm our findings.","Nopp, Stephan; Janata-Schwatczek, Karin; Prosch, Helmut; Shulym, Ihor; Königsbrügge, Oliver; Pabinger, Ingrid; Ay, Cihan",Res.

In many parts of the world, construction workers are at elevated risk of suicide. Here, we examine the extent to which construction workers may be differentially exposed to the economic effects of COVID-19. METHODS: A narrative review and synthesis of the literature was conducted. RESULTS: The economic and labour market shock resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a convergence of factors that may significantly exacerbate suicide risk among construction workers, particularly among those with lower skills. CONCLUSIONS: With important insights from previous financial crises, it is vital that governments, industry and workplaces act rapidly to mitigate suicide risk among vulnerable groups such as construction workers. Mental healthcare investment is needed, and must be complemented by prevention and control in the workplace and in the general community. Anticipating, preparing and acting to ameliorate this risk, particularly among low skilled construction workers, will save many livelihoods, as well as lives.","King, Tania L; Lamontagne, Anthony D",Scand J Public Health,,77

Methods A cross-sectional study utilizing a web-based survey was conducted in the period between 15 November 2020 and 22 December 2020. Depression, anxiety, and stress were determined using the 9-items patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scale, and the 22- item impact of event scale revised (IES-R), respectively. We calculated multivariable logistic regression to determine predictors of mental health outcomes among HCW. Results Proportions of the participants reporting symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were 12.4 (95%CI: 9.3-16.1), 14.2 (95%CI: 10.9-18.1), and 18.5% (95%CI: 14.8-22.7) respectively. Arabs had significantly more severe anxiety levels than non-Arabs (p=0.031), HCWs with high COVID-19 risk perception experienced more severe mental health outcomes (p&lt;0.001). The multivariable logistic regression showed that high risk perception was independently associated with depression (adjusted OR 4.62, 95%CI: 2.00-10.68), anxiety (adjusted OR 4.90, 95% CI: 2.24-10.68), and stress (adjusted OR 3.067, 95%CI: 1.62-5.79) with p≤ 0.001. Compared to nurses, technicians and paramedics were more likely to report anxiety symptoms with (adjusted OR 2.97, 95%CI: 1.23-7.17, p=0.015), and (adjusted OR 5.48, 95%CI: 1.86-16.12, p=0.002) respectively. Having a relative or a friend died of COVID-19 infection was significantly associated with depression symptoms (adjusted OR 2.54, 95% CI: 1.21-5.36, p=0.014). Not living with family was significantly associated with the presence of different mental health outcomes. Conclusion Relatively lower rates of mental health outcomes in this study compared to others could have several explanations related to the unique characteristics of our target population and their working environment.

Eight Canadian landfills of various sizes and shapes in different climatic conditions are studied to quantify the spatial extent of their bio-thermal zone. Land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are examined with respect to different Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classes. Within 1500 m of the sites, LST ranged from 18.3 °C to 29.5 °C and 21.3 °C-29.7 °C for forest land and agricultural land, respectively. Linear regression shows a decreasing LST trend in forest land for five out of seven landfills. A similar trend, however, is not observed for agricultural land. Both the magnitude and the variability of LST are higher in agricultural land. The size of the bio-thermal zone is sensitive to the respective LULC class. The approximate bio-thermal zones for forest class and agricultural classes are about 170 ± 90 m and 180 ± 90 m from the landfill perimeter, respectively. For the forest class, NDVI was negatively correlated with LST at six out of seven Canadian landfills, and stronger relationships are observed in the agricultural class. NDVI data has a considerably larger spread and is less consistent than LST. LST data appears more appropriate for identifying landfill bio-thermal zones. A subtle difference in LST is observed among six LULC classes, averaging from 23.9 °C to 27.4 °C. Geometric shape makes no observable difference in LST in this study; however, larger landfill footprint appears to have higher LST.","Karimi, Nima; Ng, Kelvin Tsun Wai; Richter, Amy; Williams, Jason; Ibrahim, Hussameldin",J Environ Manage,,77

Students are reported to have greater psychological impacts from COVID-19. This study aimed to survey international students to better understand their traumatic effects and psychological reactions from COVID-19, to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impact during the pandemic. METHOD: We conducted an online survey that collected information on the demographics, economic conditions, academic conditions, and health statuses of native Chinese students attending university in the U.S. Psychological impact was assessed by the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C) and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. RESULTS: This study included 261 Chinese international students. In total, 37.5% of respondents' PTSD PCL-C scores measured as moderate or severe. International students who were currently in China facing job-hunting or planning to continue studying abroad, severe economic pressure, and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with greater PTSD PCL-C scores and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, more than one-third of the respondents rated their PTSD PCL-C score as moderate-to-severe and nearly half of them reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors such as future academic plan, economic pressure, and health status are associated with higher levels of psychological impact and worse mental health status. These should receive attention and psychological interventions should be implemented to improve the mental health of international students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Song, Bijia; Zhao, Yilin; Zhu, Junchao",J Epidemiol Glob Health,,77

Here we describe a medulloblastoma model using Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived human neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells generated from a Gorlin syndrome patient carrying a germline mutation in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) receptor PTCH1. We found that Gorlin NES cells formed tumors in mouse cerebellum mimicking human medulloblastoma. Retransplantation of tumor-isolated NES (tNES) cells resulted in accelerated tumor formation, cells with reduced growth factor dependency, enhanced neurosphere formation in vitro, and increased sensitivity to Vismodegib. Using our model, we identified LGALS1 to be a GLI target gene that is up-regulated in both Gorlin tNES cells and SHH-subgroup of medulloblastoma patients. Taken together, we demonstrate that NES cells derived from Gorlin patients can be used as a resource to model medulloblastoma initiation and progression and to identify putative targets.","Susanto, Evelyn; Marin Navarro, Ana; Zhou, Leilei; Sundström, Anders; van Bree, Niek; Stantic, Marina; Moslem, Mohsen; Tailor, Jignesh; Rietdijk, Jonne; Zubillaga, Veronica; Hübner, Jens-Martin; Weishaupt, Holger; Wolfsberger, Johanna; Alafuzoff, Irina; Nordgren, Ann; Magnaldo, Thierry; Siesjö, Peter; Johnsen, John Inge; Kool, Marcel; Tammimies, Kristiina; Darabi, Anna; Swartling, Fredrik J; Falk, Anna; Wilhelm, Margareta",Proc.

Though vaccines are available, the virus is mutating to form new strains among which are the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 that demonstrate increased transmissivity and infectivity. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to explore the role of the mutations in the interaction of the virus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with the host receptor ACE2. We find that the hydrogen bond networks are rearranged in the variants and also that new hydrogen bonds are established between the RBD and ACE2 as a result of mutations. We investigated three variants: the wild-type (WT), B.1.1.7, and B.1.351. We find that the B.1.351 variant (also known as 501Y.V2) shows larger flexibility in the RBD loop segment involving residue K484, yet the RBD-ACE2 complex shows higher stability. Mutations that allow a more flexible interface that can result in a more stable complex may be a factor contributing to the increased infectivity of the mutated variants.","Bhattarai, Nisha; Baral, Prabin; Gerstman, Bernard S; Chapagain, Prem P",J Phys Chem B,,77

The one-hour session took place via Zoom with 12 first grade students at the Boys and Girls Club STEM Lab. The students were presented with an interactive PowerPoint presentation explaining the anatomy and physiology of the human digestive system. Following the presentation, the students were given the opportunity to ask questions before moving on to the hands-on activity. The purpose of the activity was to actively engage the students in learning about the role and importance of the digestive system. The students remained together in one room and they were put in groups of 2-3 around a large rectangular table. The STEM director was on-site to assist. The activity consisted of different stations where each station represented one component of the digestive system. To measure the students? comprehension, they were asked several questions before moving on to each new station and this continued throughout the duration of the activity. The students were taught about the important of keeping their digestive system healthy and ways to achieve this goal. As a homework assignment they were asked to tell one person about something the learned during the session. Outreach for K-6 students, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, is important because the students need to be exposed to STEM related subjects frequently for them to learn. It is important to continuously intellectually engage and interact with students via virtual learning and not wait until Face-to-Face opportunities are available.","Hodzic, Lejla Halpin Patricia",The FASEB Journal,,77

METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of children admitted to the fever ward of Xiangyang Central Hospital in Hubei province between January 1, 2020 and March 17, 2020. According to definite epidemiological history, patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test (NAT) positive detection were grouped as confirmed cases, and patients with two consecutive negative NATs were grouped as suspected cases. We compared the clinical characteristics of the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 47 (47/127, 37%) cases had a definite epidemiological history, of which 32 (68.1%) were suspected, with a median age of 5.5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.7–10.3), and 15 (31.9%) were confirmed, with a median age of 9 years (IQR: 4–14). Statistically significant differences in age, family cluster of infection, and numbers of patients with clinical symptoms and fever (P<0.05) were found between the two groups, but no statistically significant differences in leucocyte and lymphocyte counts were observed (P>0.05). Significant differences were found in the computed tomography (CT) manifestation of ground glass opacity (GGO) between the two groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Children of older age and from family clusters of infection were more easily diagnosed as having COVID-19. GGO changes on chest CT was more likely in confirmed cases. Although obvious clinical manifestations increase our awareness of COVID-19, children without manifestations of fever or cough should not be ignored as they may be asymptomatic carriers.","Song, Wenliang; Li, Junhua; Zou, Ning; Guan, Wenhe; Pan, Jiali; Xu, Wei",Infect Drug Resist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429617/; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s326279,77

While START-Play was developed and tested on children aged 7–16 months with motor delays, the theoretical construct can be applied to intervention in children of broader ages and skills levels. This study quantifies the impact of a broader START-Play intervention combined with Botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A) and phenol on the developmental trajectory of a 24 month-old child with bilateral spastic CP. In this AB +1 study, A consisted of multiple baseline assessments with the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 and the Assessment of Problem Solving in Play. The research participant demonstrated a stable baseline during A and changes in response to the combination of BoNT-A/phenol and 12 START-Play sessions during B, surpassing the minimal clinically important difference on the Gross Motor Function Measure-66. The follow-up data point (+1) was completed after a second round of BoNT-A/phenol injections. While the findings suggest the participant improved his gross motor skills with BoNT-A/phenol and START-Play, further research is needed to generalize these findings.","Stuyvenberg, Corri L.; Brown, Shaaron E.; Inamdar, Ketaki; Evans, Megan; Hsu, Lin-ya; Rolin, Olivier; Harbourne, Regina T.; Westcott McCoy, Sarah; Lobo, Michele A.; Koziol, Natalie A.; Dusing, Stacey C.",J Pers Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11030163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33673573/,77

Disruptions to the seasonal transmission patterns of these diseases may have consequences for the timing and severity of future outbreaks. Here we consider the implications of SARS-CoV-2 NPIs for two endemic infections circulating in the United States of America (USA): respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and seasonal influenza. Using laboratory surveillance data from 2020, we estimate that RSV transmission declined by at least 20% in the USA at the start of the NPI period. We simulate future trajectories of both RSV and influenza, using an epidemic model. As susceptibility increases over the NPI period, we find that substantial outbreaks of RSV may occur in future years, with peak outbreaks likely occurring in the winter of 2021-2022. Results for influenza broadly echo this picture, but are more uncertain; future outbreaks are likely dependent on the transmissibility and evolutionary dynamics of circulating strains.","Baker, R.

Based on the data obtained from the air quality monitoring station for the year 2019 and the first quarter of the year 2020, it was possible to develop an ANN model to simulate and predict the concentrations of three air pollutants, namely nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), and particulate matter with diameter less than 10 μm (PM(10)). Several ANN model configurations were tested to select the best model that could predict the concentration of the three air pollutants with meteorological parameters being used as input to the model. The results showed that the concentration of the pollutants during the coronavirus lockdown was declined by various percentages (from 29% for PM(10) to 72% for NO(2)) as compared to their concentration before the pandemic period. Furthermore, the developed ANN model could simulate and predict the concentration of the pollutants during the pandemic period with sufficient accuracy as judged by the values of the coefficient of determination and the mean square error. The study results indicate that properly trained and structured ANN can be a useful tool to predict air quality parameters with adequate accuracy.","Shatnawi, Nawras; Abu-Qdais, Hani",Air Qual Atmos Health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11869-020-00968-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520010/,77

While successful respiratory viruses overcome individual ISG effectors, analysis of the global ISG response and subsequent viral antagonism has yet to be examined. Employing models of the human airway, transcriptomics and proteomics datasets were used to compare ISG response patterns following highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) A virus, 2009 pandemic H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) infection. The results illustrated distinct approaches utilized by each virus to antagonize the global ISG response. In addition, the data revealed that highly virulent HPAI virus and MERS-CoV induce repressive histone modifications, which downregulate expression of ISG subsets. Notably, influenza A virus NS1 appears to play a central role in this histone-mediated downregulation in highly pathogenic influenza strains. Together, the work demonstrates the existence of unique and common viral strategies for controlling the global ISG response and provides a novel avenue for viral antagonism via altered histone modifications.","Menachery, Vineet D.; Eisfeld, Amie J.; Schäfer, Alexandra; Josset, Laurence; Sims, Amy C.; Proll, Sean; Fan, Shufang; Li, Chengjun; Neumann, Gabriele; Tilton, Susan C.; Chang, Jean; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Long, Casey; Green, Richard; Williams, Christopher M.; Weiss, Jeffrey; Matzke, Melissa M.; Webb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo; Schepmoes, Athena A.; Shukla, Anil K.; Metz, Thomas O.; Smith, Richard D.; Waters, Katrina M.; Katze, Michael G.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Baric, Ralph S.",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24846384/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01174-14,77

One key aspect of host immune evasion is performed by the uridine-directed endoribonuclease activity of nsp15. Here we describe the expression and purification of nsp15 recombinant protein. We have developed biochemical assays to follow its activity, and we have found evidence for allosteric behaviour. We screened a custom chemical library of over 5000 compounds to identify nsp15 endoribonuclease inhibitors, and we identified and validated NSC95397 as an inhibitor of nsp15 endoribonuclease in vitro.

Thus, this study aimed to identify tissue biomarkers associated with endothelial activation/dysfunction and the pyroptosis pathway in the lung samples of patients with COVID-19 and to compare them to pandemic influenza A virus H1N1 subtype 2009 and control cases. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Postmortem lung samples (COVID-19 group =6 cases; H1N1 group =10 cases, and control group =11 cases) were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and the following monoclonal primary antibodies: anti-IL (interleukin)-6, anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-α, anti-ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), and anticaspase-1. From the result, IL-6, TNF-α, ICAM-1, and caspase-1 showed higher tissue expression in the COVID-19 group than in the H1N1 and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated endothelial dysfunction and suggested the participation of the pyroptosis pathway in the pulmonary samples. These conditions might lead to systemic thrombotic events that could impair the clinical staff’s efforts to avoid fatal outcomes.

Whether adaptation to viruses typically involves only specialized antiviral proteins or affects a broad array of virus-interacting proteins is unknown. Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1300 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9900 proteins conserved in all sequenced mammalian genomes. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained proteins within the cellular functions they interact with and that (ii) despite this high constraint, virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions.

596722,Importance of preserving the resident microflora of the skin to improve immunological response,2021-05-10,"Corticosteroids are largely recommended in patients with severe COVID-19. However, evidence to support high-dose methylprednisolone (MP) pulses is not as robust as that demonstrated for low-dose dexamethasone (DXM) in the RECOVERY trial. This is a retrospective cohort study on severe, non-critically ill patients with COVID-19, comparing 3-day MP pulses ≥ 100 mg/day vs. DXM 6 mg/day for 10 days. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcomes were need of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Propensity-score matching (PSM) analysis was applied. From March 2020 to April 2021, a total of 2,284 patients were admitted to our hospital due to severe, non-critically ill COVID-19, and of these, 189 (8.3%) were treated with MP, and 493 (21.6%) with DXM. The results showed that patients receiving MP showed higher in-hospital mortality (31.2% vs. 17.8%, p < 0.001), need of ICU admission (29.1% vs. 20.5%, p = 0.017), need of IMV (25.9% vs. 13.8, p < 0.001), and median hospital length of stay (14 days vs. 11 days, p < 0.001). Our results suggest that treatment with low-dose DXM for 10 days is superior to 3 days of high-dose MP pulses in preventing in-hospital mortality and need for ICU admission or IMV in severe, non-critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Mora-Luján, José María; Tuells, Manel; Montero, Abelardo; Formiga, Francesc; Homs, Narcís A.; Albà-Albalate, Joan; Corbella, Xavier; Rubio-Rivas, Manuel",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640481/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10194465,77

The present study began as strict measures were enforced in response to the rising spread of the COVID-19 virus within Austria, Poland, Spain and Czech Republic. Here, we investigated quality of romantic relationships among 313 participants as movement restrictions were implemented and subsequently phased out cross-nationally. Participants completed self-report questionnaires over a period of 7 weeks, where we predicted relationship quality and change in relationship quality using machine learning models that included a variety of potential predictors related to psychological, demographic and environmental variables. On average, our machine learning models predicted 29% (linear models) and 22% (non-linear models) of the variance with regard to relationship quality. Here, the most important predictors consisted of attachment style (anxious attachment being more influential than avoidant), age, and number of conflicts within the relationship. Interestingly, environmental factors such as the local severity of the pandemic did not exert a measurable influence with respect to predicting relationship quality. As opposed to overall relationship quality, the change in relationship quality during lockdown restrictions could not be predicted accurately by our machine learning models when utilizing our selected features. In conclusion, we demonstrate cross-culturally that attachment security is a major predictor of relationship quality during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, whereas fear, pathogenic threat, sexual behavior, and the severity of governmental regulations did not significantly influence the accuracy of prediction.","Eder, Stephanie J.; Nicholson, Andrew A.; Stefanczyk, Michal M.; Pieniak, Michał; Martínez-Molina, Judit; Pešout, Ondra; Binter, Jakub; Smela, Patrick; Scharnowski, Frank; Steyrl, David",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366966/,77

Publication bias is the tendency to report favourable and significant results. Method and data triangulation, and the Solow-Swan model are applied. A sample from 1995 to 2018 is considered with Tonga as a case study. The approach consists of multiple methods, data frequencies, exchange rates, structural breaks, and an overall tourism index developed using principal component analysis (PCA). Consistent results across these dimensions are obtained with the PCA models. Tourism has small, positive, and statistically significant economic growth effects. Theoretically consistent values of the capital share and exchange rates are obtained. The results indicate the importance of multiple methods and the overall tourism index in assessing the tourism-growth relationship and minimising publication biases.

Here, we provide the credible evidence that its application in analysis can be extended to non-volatile sulfur-containing compounds, to which methionine (Met), homocysteine (Hcy), homocysteine thiolactone (HTL), and cysteine (Cys) belong. To prove this point, the first method, based on GC-MS, for the identification and quantification of Met-related compounds in human saliva, has been elaborated. The assay involves simultaneous disulfides reduction with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and acetonitrile (MeCN) deproteinization, followed by preconcentration by drying under vacuum and treatment of the residue with a derivatizing mixture containing anhydrous pyridine, N-trimethylsilyl-N-methyl trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA), and trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS). The validity of the method was demonstrated based upon US FDA recommendations. The assay linearity was observed over the range of 0.5–20 µmol L(−1) for Met, Hcy, Cys, and 1–20 µmol L(−1) for HTL in saliva. The limit of quantification (LOQ) equals 0.1 µmol L(−1) for Met, Hcy, Cys, while its value for HTL was 0.05 µmol L(−1). The method was successfully applied to saliva samples donated by apparently healthy volunteers (n = 10).","Piechocka, Justyna; Wieczorek, Monika; Głowacki, Rafał",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21239252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291575/,77

598118,Opening Up New Supply Chains,2020-05-06,"A number of different viruses interact with the cell cycle in order to subvert host-cell function and increase the efficiency of virus replication; examples can be found from DNA, retro, and RNA viruses. The majority of studies have been conducted on DNA and retroviruses whose primary site of replication is the nucleus, but increasingly a number of researchers are demonstrating that RNA viruses, whose primary site of replication is normally the cytoplasm, also interfere with the cell cycle. Viral interference with the cell cycle can have a myriad of different effects to improve virus infection, for example to promote replication of viral DNA genomes, or to delay the cell cycle to allow sufficient time for RNA virus assembly. Although cell cycle control is fairly well characterized in terms of checkpoints and control molecules (e.g., cyclins), in recent years several researchers have demonstrated that the nucleolus is also involved in cell cycle control. The nucleolus and associated subnuclear structures can sequester cell cycle regulatory complexes, and nucleolar proteins also have a direct and indirect effect on the cycling cell. Viruses also interact with the nucleolus. In order to study the interactions between a virus and the cell cycle and vice versa we have developed and adapted a number of different approaches and strategies. These include determinations of virus yield and measurements of virus replication to flow cytometry and confocal analysis of the host cell. Increasingly we have found that proteomic approaches allow the rapid analysis of a whole plethora of cell cycle proteins that may be affected by virus infection.","Emmett, Stevan R.; Dove, Brian; Mahoney, Laura; Wurm, Torsten; Hiscox, Julian A.",Cell Cycle Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15576934/,77

The determination of glycan composition is highly important regarding their development and production. Therefore, there is a demand for analytical techniques enabling rapid and reliable glycoprofiling of therapeutic proteins. For the investigation of changes in glycan structures, we have employed two platforms: lectin-based protein microarray, and MALDI-MS. In lectin-based microarray analysis, the samples of IgA were printed on the microarray slide, incubated with the set of lectins with various specificity and evaluation of changes in glycosylation was based on differences in reactivity of samples with lectins. MALDI-MS was used for N-glycan analysis of IgA1 samples. IgAs are effective as therapeutic agents in defense against viruses that use sialic acid as a receptor. Dimeric IgA1 antibodies were produced by stable cell line IgA1/2G9 on the basal medium at different conditions (different supplementation and feeding) and we also evaluated the effect of different conditions on lactate production, which correlates with IgA productivity. Decrease of lactate levels was observed during supplementation with succinic acid, asparagine, or with mannose feeding. We found by lectin-based microarray analysis that the metabolic shift from glutamine to asparagine or feeding with glucose caused increase of high mannose type glycans what was confirmed also by MALDI-MS. Among other changes in IgA glycosylation determined by lectin-based protein microarray were, for example, reduced galactosylation after supplementation with succinic acid and increase of both sialylation and galactosylation after supplementation with glutamine and feeding with mannose. The elucidation of mechanism of determined changes requires further investigation, but the described analytical approach represent effective platform for determination, screening and evaluation of glycosylation of therapeutic proteins.","Pažitná, Lucia; Nemčovič, Marek; Pakanová, Zuzana; Baráth, Peter; Aliev, Teimur; Dolgikh, Dmitry; Argentova, Victoria; Katrlík, Jaroslav",Journal of Biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2020.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298669/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168165620300729; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165620300729,77
599001,SPR Perspectives: scientific opportunities in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes Program,2021-05-25,"Background: Nations are imposing unprecedented measures at large-scale to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies indicate that measures such as lockdowns may have slowed down the growth of COVID-19. However, in addition to substantial economic and social costs, these measures also limit the exposure to Ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB). Emerging observational evidence indicate the protective role of UVB and vitamin D in reducing the severity and mortality of COVID-19 deaths. In this observational study, we empirically outline the independent protective roles of lockdown and UVB exposure as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI), whilst also examining whether the severity of lockdown is associated with a reduction in the protective role. Methods. We apply a log-linear fixed-effects model to a panel dataset of 162 countries over a period of 108 days (n=6049). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths as the dependent variable and isolate the mitigating influence of lockdown severity on the association between UVI and growth-rates of COVID-19 deaths from time-constant country-specific and time-varying country-specific potentially confounding factors. Findings: After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a unit increase in UVI and lockdown severity are independently associated with 17% [-1.8 percentage points] and 77% [-7.9 percentage points] decline in COVID-19 deaths growth rate, indicating their respective protective roles. However, the widely utilized and least severe lockdown (recommendation to not leave the house) already fully mitigates the protective role of UVI by 95% [1.8 percentage points] indicating its downside. Interpretation: We find that lockdown severity and UVI are independently associated with a slowdown in the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths. However, we find consistent evidence that increase in lockdown severity is associated with a significant reduction in the protective role of UVI in reducing COVID-19 deaths. Our results suggest that lockdowns in conjunction with adequate exposure to UVB radiation might have provided even more substantial health benefits, than lockdowns alone. For example, we estimate that there would be 21% fewer deaths on average with sufficient UVB exposure while people were recommended not to leave their house. Therefore, our study outlines the importance of considering UVB exposure, especially while implementing lockdowns and may support policy decision making in countries imposing such measures.","Kalippurayil Moozhipurath, R.; Kraft, L.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.30.20143586v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143586,77

The video is aimed at presenting the surgical management of persistent groin pain and inability to walk after transobturator sling placement and subsequent partial removal. METHODS: The featured patient is a 31-year-old woman unable to walk after transobturator sling implantation 2 years before. She reported left thigh pain immediately after surgery that was not responsive to postoperative medication. Six months later, suburethral portion excision was performed but no pain relief was obtained. She was unable to walk, and needed a wheelchair. Electromyography showed axonal injury of the left obturator nerve. After providing proper informed consent, the patient was admitted for combined transvaginal and transcutaneous transobturator tape arm removal. RESULTS: The featured procedure was completed in 120 min and blood loss was <100 ml. No surgical complications were observed. The patient is currently doing left leg rehabilitation, has regained the ability to walk with the aid of a crutch, and the need for chronic pain control medication is greatly reduced. CONCLUSION: This represents a valid surgical approach for the late management of this mesh-related complication.

601351,Tackling dengue fever: Current status and challenges,2015-12-09,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and associated social, economic, and clinical disruption have been widely speculated to affect pregnancy decision-making and outcomes. While a few US-based studies have examined subnational changes in fertility, preterm birth, and stillbirth, there remains limited knowledge of how the pandemic impacted childbearing and a broader set of perinatal health indicators at the national-level throughout 2020. Here, we use recently released national-level data to fill this gap. Importantly, we, unlike earlier work, use time-series methods to account for strong temporal patterning (e.g., seasonality, trend) that could otherwise lead to spurious findings. Methods: For the years 2015 to 2020, we obtained national monthly counts of births and rates (per 100 births) for six perinatal indicators: preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation), early preterm birth (<34 weeks gestation), late preterm birth (34-36 weeks gestation), low birth weight birth (<2500 g), very low birth weight birth (<1500 g), and cesarean delivery. We use an interrupted time-series approach to compare the outcomes observed after the pandemic began (March 2020) to those expected had the pandemic not occurred. Results: For total births as well as five of the six indicators (i.e., all but the rate of cesarean delivery), observed values fall well below expected levels (p<.0001 for each test) during the entire pandemic period. Declines in preterm birth and low birth weight were largest in magnitude in both early and later stages of the 2020 pandemic, while those for live births occurred at the end of the year. Discussion: Our findings provide some of the first national evidence of substantial reductions in live births and adverse perinatal outcomes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Only cesarean delivery appeared unaffected. These declines were not uniform across the pandemic, suggesting that several mechanisms, which require further study, may explain these patterns.","Gemmill, A.; Casey, J.

602429,Defeating Paediatric Tuberculous Meningitis: Applying the WHO “Defeating Meningitis by 2030: Global Roadmap”,2021-04-16,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) ensures regulation of the protein pool in the cell by ubiquitination of proteins followed by their degradation by the proteasome. It plays a central role in the cell under normal physiological conditions as well as during viral infections. On the one hand, the UPS can be used by the cell to degrade viral proteins, thereby restricting the viral infection. On the other hand, it can also be subverted by the virus to its own advantage, notably to induce degradation of cellular restriction factors. This makes the UPS a central player in viral restriction and counter-restriction. In this respect, the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and 2) represent excellent examples. Indeed, many steps of the HIV life cycle are restricted by cellular proteins, some of which are themselves components of the UPS. However, HIV itself hijacks the UPS to mediate defense against several cellular restriction factors. For example, the HIV auxiliary proteins Vif, Vpx and Vpu counteract specific restriction factors by the recruitment of cellular UPS components. In this review, we describe the interplay between HIV and the UPS to illustrate its role in the restriction of viral infections and its hijacking by viral proteins for counter-restriction.","Seissler, Tanja; Marquet, Roland; Paillart, Jean-Christophe",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29088112/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v9110322,77

Maternal health is a great concern when treating pregnant women fighting this triad of diseases, which is highly prevalent in South Africa. MicroRNAs are involved in fine-tuning of physiological processes. Disruptions to the balance of this minute protein can lead to various physiological changes that are sometimes pathological. RECENT FINDINGS: MicroRNAs have recently been implicated in PE and have been linked to the anti-angiogenic imbalance evident in PE. Recent in silico studies have identified potential host miRNAs with anti-viral properties against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies have demonstrated dysregulated expression of several miRNAs in HIV-1 infection along with the ability of HIV-1 to downregulate anti-viral host microRNAs. SUMMARY: This review has highlighted the significant gap in literature on the potential of miRNAs in women with HIV-associated PE in synergy with the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, this review has provided evidence of the critical role that the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of miRNA plays in viral infections and PE, thereby providing a foundation for further research investigating the potential of therapeutic miRNA development with fewer side-effects for pregnant women.","Abel, Tashlen; Moodley, Jagidesa; Naicker, Thajasvarie",Curr Hypertens Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33847825/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11906-021-01138-5,77

Detection of residual HCV in individuals with SVR after treatment of CHC can be significantly heightened by analyzing ex vivo mitogen‐activated T and B lymphocytes and applying sensitive nucleic acid amplification assays. However, it remained unknown if synergistic activation of lymphocytes and monocytes would further augment HCV detection, if viral replication becomes universally upregulated in treated cells, and if examining sequential sera and lymphoid cells would improve detection of occult infection. Using paired sera and lymphoid cells collected 1 year apart from 17 individuals with normal liver enzymes for up to 72 months after SVR, it was found that simultaneous activation of lymphocytes and monocytes enhanced identification of silent HCV infection and revealed that in some cases monocytes were the principal immune cell type where HCV persisted. Testing of serial samples further increased detection of occult infection. Ultimately, by combining the above two approaches, all individuals with SVR were found to be silent carriers of HCV. Clonal sequencing revealed HCV variations in sera and lymphoid cells and evolution of viral genomes confirming ongoing virus replication. Surprisingly, similar to those with CHC, naive lymphoid cells from some individuals carried ∼10(3) HCV copies/μg total RNA. HCV loads in naive lymphoid cells predetermined the outcome of ex vivo stimulation with respect to upregulation or inhibition of HCV replication. HCV RNA levels in occult infection were inversely proportional to the expression of IFNα and IFN‐inducible MxA, but not to IFNγ or tumour necrosis factor α in naive and mitogen‐treated lymphoid cells.","Pham, T.

DESIGN: Simulation agent based modeling study. SETTING: Simulated population based on real world US county. PARTICIPANTS: The simulation included 100 000 agents, with a representative distribution of demographics and occupations. Networks of contacts were established to simulate potentially infectious interactions though occupation, household, and random interactions. INTERVENTIONS: Simulation of standard covid-19 vaccination versus delayed second dose vaccination prioritizing the first dose. The simulation runs were replicated 10 times. Sensitivity analyses included first dose vaccine efficacy of 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% after day 12 post-vaccination; vaccination rate of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 1% of population per day; assuming the vaccine prevents only symptoms but not asymptomatic spread (that is, non-sterilizing vaccine); and an alternative vaccination strategy that implements delayed second dose for people under 65 years of age, but not until all those above this age have been vaccinated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative covid-19 mortality, cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections, and cumulative hospital admissions due to covid-19 over 180 days. RESULTS: Over all simulation replications, the median cumulative mortality per 100 000 for standard dosing versus delayed second dose was 226 v 179, 233 v 207, and 235 v 236 for 90%, 80%, and 70% first dose efficacy, respectively. The delayed second dose strategy was optimal for vaccine efficacies at or above 80% and vaccination rates at or below 0.3% of the population per day, under both sterilizing and non-sterilizing vaccine assumptions, resulting in absolute cumulative mortality reductions between 26 and 47 per 100 000. The delayed second dose strategy for people under 65 performed consistently well under all vaccination rates tested. CONCLUSIONS: A delayed second dose vaccination strategy, at least for people aged under 65, could result in reduced cumulative mortality under certain conditions.","Romero-Brufau, Santiago; Chopra, Ayush; Ryu, Alex J; Gel, Esma; Raskar, Ramesh; Kremers, Walter; Anderson, Karen S; Subramanian, Jayakumar; Krishnamurthy, Balaji; Singh, Abhishek; Pasupathy, Kalyan; Dong, Yue; O’Horo, John C; Wilson, Walter R; Mitchell, Oscar; Kingsley, Thomas C",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n1087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980718/,77

This study was conducted with an intent to identify anxiety, depression and quality of life and its predictors among nurses who are actively involved in caring of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out among nurses who were actively involved in COVID-19 duties at government tertiary health care institutes of India and data was collection through convenience sampling. Standardized tools (HADS, WHOQOL-BREF) were preferred for the assessment of participants' anxiety, depression and quality of life. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify predictors for anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Of 354 nurses, 12.1% were suffering from anxiety while 14.7% had depression. Mean score for physical, psychological, social and environmental domains were 14.75 ± 1.86, 14.92 ± 2.46, 15.21 ± 3.01, and 14.48 ± 2.38 respectively. Nurses' education was a significant predictor for anxiety (odds ratio [OR] = -0.262, 95% CI: -0.510- -0.014, and P value = 0.038). Similarly for depression, designation of nurses acts as a contributing factor (odds ratio [OR] = 0.287, 95% CI: 0.016- 0.557, and P value = 0.038).

In this study, we take advantage of spatial variation in Covid-19 mortality across US counties to construct an Ordinary Least Squares regression model estimating its relationship with all-cause mortality. We then examine how the extent of excess mortality not assigned to Covid-19 varies across subsets of counties defined by demographic, structural, and policy characteristics. We estimate that 20.4% [95% CI (13.7%, 27.2%)] of excess deaths between February 1 and August 26, 2020 were ascribed to causes of death other than Covid-19 itself. Excess deaths not assigned to Covid-19 were even higher than predicted by our model in counties with high income inequality, low median income, low homeownership, and high percentages of Black residents, showing a pattern related to socioeconomic disadvantage and structural racism. Our work suggests that inequities in excess deaths attributable to Covid-19 may be even greater than revealed by data reporting deaths assigned to Covid-19 alone.","Stokes, Andrew; Lundberg, Dielle J.; Hempstead, Katherine; Elo, Irma T.; Preston, Samuel H.",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.31.20184036; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.31.20184036v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32908999/,77

The current piece reviews a thematic series on surveillance-response systems for elimination of tropical diseases. Overall, 22 contributions covering a broad array of diseases are featured – i.e. clonorchiasis, dengue, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), H7N9 avian influenza, lymphatic filariasis, malaria, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), rabies, schistosomiasis and tuberculosis (TB). There are five scoping reviews, a commentary, a letter to the editor, an opinion piece and an editorial pertaining to the theme “Elimination of tropical disease through surveillance and response”. The remaining 13 articles are original contributions mainly covering (i) drug resistance; (ii) innovation and validation in the field of mathematical modelling; (iii) elimination of infectious diseases; and (iv) social media reports on disease outbreak notifications released by national health authorities. Analysis of the authors’ affiliations reveals that scientists from the People’s Republic of China (P.R. China) are prominently represented. Possible explanations include the fact that the 2012 and 2014 international conferences pertaining to surveillance-response mechanisms were both hosted by the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases (NIPD) in Shanghai, coupled with P.R.

617052,Nanoparticles as an Effective Drug Delivery System in Covid-19,2021-09-09,"Background Upper respiratory viral infections are common in the pediatric population. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) are rare, but devastating and life-threatening complications post hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). It has been suggested in work by others that IPS and BO are consequences of early inflammation, and recent data support this hypothesis (Versluys et al, Translational and Clinical Immunology, 2018). Respiratory viral infections early in the peri-transplant period may result in inflammation leading to development of IPS and BO post HSCT. Objectives The primary objective of this study was to determine whether pre-transplant respiratory viral infection or colonization increase incidence of IPS and BO. We hypothesized that patients who acquire respiratory viral infections in the peri-transplant period have increased incidence of IPS and BO. Methods We abstracted and analyzed clinically collected data and compared the frequency of post-transplant respiratory viral complications with the presence of upper respiratory viral infections within 30 days prior to transplant. A Broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) or a nasal swab were used to identify upper respiratory viral infections. Epstein Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other upper respiratory viral infections were tested in 181 patients, transplanted between 2008 and 2018. Outcomes studied included IPS, BO, transplant associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), graft versus host disease (GVHD), and overall survival (OS). Patients who did not have a BAL or a nasal swab within 30 days prior to transplant were excluded. Results Forty seven of 181 patients had a positive BAL or nasal swab prior to HSCT (group A). There were 53 documented respiratory viral infections in group A. Two tested positive for either coronavirus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) or para-influenza virus, 3 tested positive for adenovirus, human herpes 6, influenza, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), EBV and CMV were detected in 9 patients, 1 patient had human metapneumovirus and there were 16 rhino virus infections documented prior to HSCT. Some patients tested positive for more than 1 respiratory viral infection at the time of testing. Results of our study are summarized below in Figure 1. Conclusion Contrary to our hypothesis, our data do not support an association between upper respiratory viral infections prior to transplant and post-transplant IPS or BO. Our data may differ from the findings of others due to a relatively small number of events in our population, or to differences in patient populations being studied, or to differences in transplant strategies.","Kapadia, Malika; Perentesis, Emma MR; Lane, Adam; Dandoy, Christopher E; Davies, Stella M.",Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S108387911831382X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S108387911831382X,77

Is it an atypical form of a known disease? How should we communicate and report such cases? What is the pathogenesis? Which treatments are given, and which are effective? What are the short and long-term outcomes? We are all learning fast. The clinical and immunological patterns seen are unique. There are significant differences in both presentation and pathogenesis to any known condition, including Kawasaki’s disease. This implies that treatments are not necessarily transferrable: and indeed it is unknown which treatments are effective at all. Outcomes, as far as are known, are good, but long term data is lacking.

We analysed the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and T cell responses in previously infected (recovered) or uninfected (naive) individuals that received mRNA vaccines to SARS-CoV-2. While previously infected individuals sustained higher antibody titres than uninfected individuals post-vaccination, the latter reached comparable levels of neutralization responses to the ancestral strain after the second vaccine dose. T cell activation markers measured upon spike or nucleocapsid peptide in vitro stimulation showed a progressive increase after vaccination. Comprehensive analysis of plasma neutralization using 16 authentic isolates of distinct locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants revealed a range of reduction in the neutralization capacity associated with specific mutations in the spike gene: lineages with E484K and N501Y/T (e.g., B.1.351 and P.1) had the greatest reduction, followed by lineages with L452R (e.g., B.1.617.2). While both groups retained neutralization capacity against all variants, plasma from previously infected vaccinated individuals displayed overall better neutralization capacity when compared to plasma from uninfected individuals that also received two vaccine doses, pointing to vaccine boosters as a relevant future strategy to alleviate the impact of emerging variants on antibody neutralizing activity.","Lucas, C.; Vogels, C.

There is no strong evidence supporting that patients with asthma have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill from coronavirus disease 2019 (CO­VID-19), although recent reports from the USA and the UK suggest that asthma is much more common in children and adults with mild to severe COVID-19 than has previously been reported in Asia and in Europe. As in previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks, patients with asthma, especially children, appear to be less susceptible to the coronavirus with a low rate of asthma exacerbations. A different expression of viral receptors and T2 inflammation can be responsible for different outcomes. Future studies focused on asthma and on other allergic disorders are needed to provide a greater understanding of the impact of underlying asthma and allergic inflammation on COVID-19 susceptibility and disease severity.

Neutralization of cationic proteins (such as neutrophil extracellular trap/NET-derived histones) with polyanionic compounds has been suggested as a potential strategy for protecting the endothelium from such insults. Here, we report that the FDA-approved polyanionic agent defibrotide (a pleotropic mixture of oligonucleotides) directly engages histones and thereby blocks their pathological effects on endothelium. In vitro, defibrotide counteracted endothelial cell activation and cell death, whether triggered by purified NETs, COVID-19 serum containing high levels of NETs, or recombinant histone H4. In vivo, defibrotide stabilized the endothelium and protected against histone-accelerated inferior vena cava thrombosis in mice. Mechanistically, defibrotide demonstrated direct and tight binding to histone H4 as detected by both electrophoretic mobility shift assay and surface plasmon resonance. Taken together, these data provide insights into the potential role of polyanionic compounds in protecting the endothelium from thromboinflammation with potential implications for myriad NET- and histone-accelerated disease states.","Shi, H.; Gandhi, A.

The etiologic agent was initially identified as a coronavirus by thin-section electron microscopic examination of a virus isolate. Virions were spherical, 78 nm in mean diameter, and composed of a helical nucleocapsid within an envelope with surface projections. Herein, we show that infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus resulted in distinct ultrastructural features: double-membrane vesicles, nucleocapsid inclusions, and large granular areas of cytoplasm. These three structures and the coronavirus particles were shown to be positive for viral proteins and RNA by using ultrastructural immunogold and in situ hybridization assays. In addition, ultrastructural examination of a bronchiolar lavage specimen from a SARS patient showed numerous coronavirus-infected cells with features similar to those in infected culture cells.

622498,Methodological quality of COVID-19 clinical research,2021-02-11,"Genetic variability makes influenza virus to escape the immunity and causes yearly epidemics. Monitoring those changes is necessary for vaccine selection. In addition, H3N2 viruses were considered to be seeded from Southeast Asia before spreading globally. This study described the molecular epidemiology of influenza A during the post‐pandemic season 2010–2011 in Vietnam. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from children with respiratory infections at Children's Hospital 2, Ho Chi Minh City. The HA, NA, M genes were amplified, sequenced and analyzed. Thirty‐five of 1,082 (3.2%) patients were positive for influenza A, including 14 pandemic H1N1 2009 (H1N1pdm09) and 21 H3N2 infections. H3N2 was dominant in the rainy season (May–October 2010) while H1N1pdm09 was dominant in the dry season (November 2010–April 2011). Phylogenetic analysis showed that Vietnamese H1N1pdm09 sequences in 2010–2011 formed the distinct cluster, with other contemporary Asian and 2012‐American sequences, suggesting a possible common ancestor. All were oseltamivir‐sensitive except two strains carrying S247N and D199N in NA which reduced the neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility. The Vietnamese H3N2 viruses in mid‐2010 belonged to the emerging subclade Perth10/2010, which then spread worldwide in 2011. The Vietnamese influenza viruses were well matched with the Southern Hemisphere vaccine formulation. Mutations at antigenic sites were also identified in these viruses. Surveillance of influenza viruses in tropical countries is important not only for development of their prevention and control strategies but also for earlier identification of the newly emerged strains that may be selected for future vaccine.

622541,Individual freedom versus collective responsibility: too many rights make a wrong?,2006-10-02,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for antiviral treatments that can be deployed rapidly. Drug repurposing represents a promising means of achieving this objective, but repurposing efforts are often unsuccessful. A common hurdle to effective drug repurposing is a failure to achieve a sufficient therapeutic window in the new indication. A clear example is the use of ivermectin in COVID-19, where the approved dose (administered orally) fails to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the lungs. Our proposed solution to the problem of ineffective drug repurposing for COVID-19 antivirals is two-fold: to broaden the therapeutic window by reformulating therapeutics for the pulmonary route, and to select drug repurposing candidates based on their model-predicted therapeutic index for inhalation. In this article, we propose a two-stage model-driven screening and validation process for selecting inhaled antiviral drug repurposing candidates. While we have applied this approach in the specific context of COVID-19, this in vitro-in vivo translational methodology is also broadly applicable to repurposing drugs for diseases of the lower respiratory tract.","Stoddard, M.; Yuan, L.; Chakravarty, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.11.21253375v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253375,77
623108,From AACR 2020 (part 1),2020-05-13,"INTRODUCTION: The mechanism by which a suppressed immune system of a cancer patient makes them susceptible to COVID‐19 is still unclear. Any delay or discontinuation of cancer care due to the pandemic is expected to have a detrimental impact on the outcome of cancer. A few studies have addressed the incidence of COVID‐19 among cancer patients, but the small sample size of such studies makes it difficult to draw inference to the general population. METHODS: For our review, ‘Pubmed’ database and Google search engines were used for searching the relevant articles. The criterion used for review includes their relevance to the defined review question, which is the pathophysiological mechanism of COVID‐19 among cancer patients and the relevant therapeutic interventions therewith. This review includes 20 studies and other relevant literature which address the determinants of COVID‐19 among Cancer patients. RESULTS: Delay in cancer diagnosis will increase the stage progression of cancer patients and increased mortality in the future. A short delay in administering cancer related treatment to aid the odds of patient surviving the acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, should be at the discretion of the treating Physician. Oncologists dilemma in the current situation includes titrating the density of drug doses and intensity of treatment regimen, for the optimal management of metastatic and adjuvant cancer patients. Patients are thus subjected to suboptimal treatment and undetected disease recurrence, To circumvent the immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy, Providers need to consider staggered regimen or alternate therapies such as biological/immunotherapy, targeted therapy, anti‐angiogenic drugs, hormone therapy and/or antibody‐based therapeutics. CONCLUSION: This review provides insights on the pathogenesis of SARS‐CoV‐2, which could enable Physicians in formulating therapeutic strategies for the management of severe patients, more so in Oncology settings, thus reducing the mortality. The key is to balance the continuation of urgent cancer care, but rationing the elective treatment according to the circumstances.","Alipour, Vahid; Rezapour, Aziz; Shali, Mahboobeh; Harati Khalilabad, Touraj",Health Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532601/,77
623165,COVID-19: is fibrosis the killer?,2020-05-13,"With rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome- corona virus-2 (SARS-COV-2) globally, some new aspects of the disease have been reported. Recently, it has been reported the incidence of Kawasaki-like disease among children with COVID-19. Since, children had been known to be less severely affected by the virus in part due to the higher concentration of Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptor, this presentation has emerged concerns regarding the infection of children with SARS-COV2. ACE2 has anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferative characteristics through converting angiotensin (Ag)-II to Ang (1–7). ACE2 receptor is downregulated by the SARS-COV through the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S) via a process that is tightly coupled with Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production. TNF-α plays a key role in aneurysmal formation of coronary arteries in Kawasaki disease (KD). Affected children by COVID-19 with genetically-susceptible to KD might have genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor that might further decrease the expression of ACE2 due to the downregulation of the receptor by the virus in these patients. It appears that TNF- α might be the cause and the consequence of the ACE2 receptor downregulation which results in arterial walls aneurysm. Conclusion: Genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor in children with genetically-susceptible to KD who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 possibly further downregulates the ACE2 expression by TNF-α and leads to surge of inflammation including TNF-α and progression to Kawasaki-like disease.","Amirfakhryan, Hamideh",Med Hypotheses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32721809/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720317278; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110117; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720317278?v=s5,77

624826,The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic: how have immunology societies contributed?,2020-09-10,"The countries around the world are dealing with air quality issues for decades due to their mode of production and energy usages. The outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic and consequent global economic shutdown, for the first time, provided a base for the real-time experiment of the effect of reduced emissions across the globe in abetting the air pollution issue. The present study dealt with the changes in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), a marker of air pollution, because of global economic shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. The study considered the countries in south and south-east Asia (SSEA), Europe and the USA for their extended period of lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic. Daily Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and tropospheric column density of NO(2) and SO(2) from Ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) sensors, including meteorological data such as wind speed (WS) and relative humidity (RH) were analyzed during the pre-lockdown (2017 – 2019) and lockdown periods (2020). The average AOD, NO(2) and SO(2) during the lockdown period were statistically compared with their pre-lockdown average using Wilcoxon-signed-paired-rank test. The accuracy of the MODIS-derived AOD, including the changing pattern of AOD due to lockdown was estimated using AERONET data. The weekly anomaly of AOD, NO(2) and SO(2) was used for analyzing the space-time variation of aerosol load as restrictions were imposed by the concerned countries at the different points of time. Additionally, a random forest-based regression (RF) model was used to examine the effects of meteorological and emission parameters on the spatial variation of AOD. A significant reduction of AOD (-20%) was obtained for majority of the areas in SSEA, Europe and USA during the lockdown period. Yet, the clusters of increased AOD (30 - 60%) was obtained in the south-east part of SSEA, the western part of Europe and US regions. NO(2) reductions were measured up to 20 - 40%, while SO(2) emission increased up to 30% for a majority of areas in these regions. A notable space-time variation was observed in weekly anomaly. We found the evidence of the formation of new particles for causing high AOD under high RH and low WS, aided by the downward vertical wind flow. The RF model showed a distinguishable relative importance of emission and meteorological factors among these regions to account for the spatial variability of AOD. Our findings suggest that the continued lockdown might provide a temporary solution to air pollution; however, to combat persistent air quality issues, it needs switching over to the cleaner mode of production and energy. The findings of this study, thus, advocated for alternative energy policy at the global scale.","Acharya, Prasenjit; Barik, Gunadhar; Gayen, Bijoy Krishna; Bar, Somnath; Maiti, Arabinda; Sarkar, Ashis; Ghosh, Surajit; De, Sikhhendra Kisor; Sreekesh, S.",Environ Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120314110?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120314110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245884/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110514,77

However, it is unknown if inhaled corticosteroid use is associated with reduced morbidity of the disease. Methods In a nationwide cohort of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 test-positive individuals in Denmark, we estimated the 30-day hazard ratio of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death among users of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) compared with users of non-ICS inhalers ({beta}2-agonist/muscarinic-antagonists), or non-users of ICS, with Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, and other confounders. We repeated these analyses among influenza test-positive patients during 2010-2018. Results Among 2,180 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients, 282 were admitted to ICU and 421 died within 30 days. ICS use was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.25 (95% CI [CI], 0.60 to 2.61) for ICU admission and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.54 to 1.31) for death compared with non-ICS inhaler use. Compared with no ICS use, the hazard ratio of ICU admission or death was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.94) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.47), respectively. Among 10,279 hospitalized influenza patients, the hazard ratios were 1.43 (95% CI, 0.89 to 2.30) and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.46) for ICU admission, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.01) and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.22) for death compared with non-ICS inhaler use and no ICS use, respectively.

The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges between 5-30{degrees}C. In many countries that would benefit from SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, mean temperatures exceed 30{degrees}C. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including (i) long-term storage and testing at recommended conditions, (ii) recommended storage conditions followed by 10 minutes exposure to 37{degrees}C and testing at 37{degrees}C and (iii) 3 weeks storage followed by testing at 37{degrees}C. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 8.2x105-7.9x107 genome copies/ml of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 minutes pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37{degrees}C resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for 46% of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After 3 weeks of storage at 37{degrees}C, 73% of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity. Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture-derived human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 was not affected by storage and testing at 37{degrees}C. In summary, short- and long-term exposure to elevated temperatures likely impairs sensitivity of several SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs that may translate to false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with inter-individual transmission. Ensuring appropriate transport and storage conditions, and development of tests that are more robust across temperature fluctuations will be important for accurate use of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs in tropical settings.","Haage, V.

In our previous studies, the proteinase was identified as a 33-kDa protein in IBV-infected cells, and its catalytic center was shown to consist of H2820 and C2922 residues. It is released from the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins by autoprocessing at two Q–S dipeptide bonds (Q2779–S2780 and Q3086–S3087). In this report, further characterization of the two cleavage sites demonstrates that the N-terminal Q2779–S2780 site is tolerant to mutations at the P1 position. Deletion of the C-terminal region of the proteinase shows that a significant amount of the enzymatic activity is maintained upon deletion of up to 67 amino acids, suggesting that the extreme C-terminal region may be dispensable for the proteolytic activity of the proteinase. Analysis of the autoprocessing kinetics in vitro reveals that proteolysis at the Q2779–S2780 site is the first cleavage event mediated by this proteinase. This is followed by cleavage at the Q3086–S3087 site. The occurrence of both cleavage events in intact cells is potentially rapid and efficient, as no intermediate cleavage products covering the proteinase were detected in either IBV-infected or transfected cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation studies further show differential subcellular localization of the proteinase in IBV-infected cells and in cells expressing the 3C-like proteinase alone, indicating that additional roles in viral replication might be played by this protein. Finally, a Q–A (Q3379–A3380) dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 10,663 to 10,668 was demonstrated to be a cleavage site of the proteinase.","Ng, Lisa F.P.; Liu, D.

To date, nsP3 has been demonstrated to mediate many virus–host protein–protein interactions in several fundamental alphavirus mechanisms, particularly during the early stages of replication. However, the molecular pathways and proteins networks underlying these mechanisms remain poorly described. This is due to the low genetic sequence homology of the nsP3 protein among the alphavirus species, especially at its 3′ C-terminal domain, the hypervariable domain (HVD). Moreover, the nsP3 HVD is almost or completely intrinsically disordered and has a poor ability to form secondary structures. Evolution in the nsP3 HVD region allows the alphavirus to adapt to vertebrate and insect hosts. This review focuses on the putative roles and functions of indel, repetition, and duplication events that have occurred in the alphavirus nsP3 HVD, including characterization of the differences and their implications for specificity in the context of virus–host interactions in fundamental alphavirus mechanisms, which have thus directly facilitated the evolution, adaptation, viability, and re-emergence of these viruses.","Abdullah, Nurshariza; Ahemad, Nafees; Aliazis, Konstantinos; Khairat, Jasmine Elanie; Lee, Thong Chuan; Abdul Ahmad, Siti Aisyah; Adnan, Nur Amelia Azreen; Macha, Nur Omar; Hassan, Sharifah Syed",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13061021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071712/,77

628327,Spontaneous face- and eye-touching: Infection risk versus potential microbiome gain,2021-04-30,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has shown an exceptionally high spread rate across and within countries worldwide. Understanding the dynamics of such an infectious disease transmission is critical for devising strategies to control its spread. In particular, Rwanda was one of the African countries that started COVID-19 preparedness early in January 2020, and a total lockdown was imposed when the country had only 18 COVID-19 confirmed cases known. Using intensive contact tracing, several infections were identified, with the majority of them being returning travellers and their close contacts. We used the contact tracing data in Rwanda for understanding the geographic patterns of COVID-19 to inform targeted interventions. METHODS: We estimated the attack rates and identified risk factors associated to COVID-19 spread. We used Bayesian disease mapping models to assess the spatial pattern of COVID-19 and to identify areas characterised by unusually high or low relative risk. In addition, we used multiple variable conditional logistic regression to assess the impact of the risk factors. RESULTS: The results showed that COVID-19 cases in Rwanda are localised mainly in the central regions and in the southwest of Rwanda and that some clusters occurred in the northeast of Rwanda. Relationship to the index case, being male and coworkers are the important risk factors for COVID-19 transmission in Rwanda. CONCLUSION: The analysis of contact tracing data using spatial modelling allowed us to identify high-risk areas at subnational level in Rwanda. Estimating risk factors for infection with SARS-CoV-2 is vital in identifying the clusters in low spread of SARS-CoV-2 subnational level. It is imperative to understand the interactions between the index case and contacts to identify superspreaders, risk factors and high-risk places.

A cause, represented by certain values of prognostic factors, is considered necessary for an event if, without the cause, the event cannot develop. It is considered sufficient for an event if the event is unavoidable in the presence of the cause. The degrees of necessity and sufficiency, ranging from zero to one, are simple, intuitive functions of unconditional and conditional probabilities of an event such as disease or death. These probabilities often will be derived from logistic regression models; the measures, however, do not require any particular model. In addition, we study in detail the relationship between the proposed measures and the related explained variation summary for dichotomous outcomes, which are the common root for the developments for ordinal, nominal, and survival outcomes. We introduce and analyze the Austrian covid‐19 data, with the aim of quantifying effects of age and other potentially prognostic factors on covid‐19 mortality. This is achieved by standard regression methods but also in terms of the newly proposed measures. It is shown how they complement the toolbox of prognostic factor studies, in particular when comparing the importance of prognostic factors of different types. While the full model's degree of necessity is extremely high (0.933), its low degree of sufficiency (0.179) is responsible for the low proportion of explained variation (0.193).","Gleiss, Andreas; Henderson, Robin; Schemper, Michael",Stat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942333/; https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8961,77

The automation process, in which selectively functionalized monosaccharide building blocks are added sequentially to a growing oligosaccharide chain connected via an inert linker to a solid support, has been used to prepare a number of biologically relevant oligosaccharide-based constructs in record time and on scales that would have been impossible using standard solution-phase synthetic techniques. This review highlights recent developments in automated solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis including engineering advancements that have led to the design of a fully automated platform, new and improved linker strategies that have broadened the scope of the chemical reactions that can be used in automation, and recent developments in the synthesis of functionalized monosaccharide building blocks.

There is sudden need of statistical modeling due to onset of COVID-19 pandemic across the world. But health planning and policy requirements need the estimates of disease problem from clinical data. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to predict the declination of COVID-19 using recovery rate and case load rate on basis of available data form India. METHODS: The reported COVID-19 cases in the country were obtained from website (https://datahub.io/core/covid-19#resource-covid-19_zip/). The confirmed cases, recovered cases and deaths were used for estimating recovery rate, case load rate and death rate till date June 04, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 216919 confirmed cases were reported nationwide in India on June 04, 2020. It is found that the recovery rate increased to 47.99% and case load rate decreased to 49.21%. Death rate is found to be very low 2.80%. Accordingly, coincidence of the difference of cases load rate and recovery rate (delta) will reveal a declination in expected COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: The epidemic in the country was mainly caused by the movement of people from various foreign countries to India. Lockdown as restricting the migration of population and decision taken by the government to quarantine the population may greatly reduce the risk of continued spread of the epidemic in India. This study predicts that when the case load rate gets lesser than recovery rate, there after COVID-19 patients would be started to decline.","Bhattacharjee, Atanu; Kumar, Mukesh; Patel, Kamalesh Kumar",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2020.06.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213398420301615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838057/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398420301615?v=s5,77

We aim to summarize the clinical features of DM patients with COVID-19 and find out potential factors associated with severe disease. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, the medical records of patients with COVID-19 in Changsha, Hunan, China, from January 21, 2020, to February 19, 2020, were reviewed. Epidemiological information, clinical features, and outcomes were compared between DM patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or not. RESULTS: A total of 241 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were enrolled, including 19 DM patients. There were more patients in DM group admitted to the ICU than non-DM group (36.8% vs. 15.8%, P = 0.045). Compared with non-DM group in the ICU, there were more female patients from DM group in the ICU (85.7% vs. 31.4%, P = 0.024). On admission, the mean level of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was higher in the ICU DM patients than that in the non-ICU DM patients (8.5% vs. 7.1%). There were more DM patients with proteinuria in the ICU group than the non-ICU group (57.1% vs. 33.3%). Twelve DM patients (63.2%) changed diabetic therapy during hospitalization, and all DM patients admitted to the ICU used insulin. As of March 14, all 19 DM patients have been discharged, and no death occurred. CONCLUSIONS: DM patients with COVID-19 are vulnerable to severe disease, especially for female patients. High levels of HbA1c and proteinuria could be potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 in DM patients. In addition to timely systemic therapy, the control of blood glucose and proper diabetic therapy is essential to improve the prognosis of severe DM patients with COVID-19.","Guo, Ting; Shen, Qinxue; Ouyang, Xiaoli; Guo, Wei; Li, Jinhua; He, Wenlong; Yu, Bo; Wu, Chenfang; Zhou, Zhiguo; Luo, Hong; Peng, Hong",J Diabetes Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33506052/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/7830136,77

Evidence is building that its origin as a zoonotic spillover occurred prior to the officially accepted timing of early December, 2019. Here we provide novel methods to date the origin of COVID-19 cases. We show that six countries had exceptionally early cases, unlikely to represent part of their main case series. The model suggests a likely timing of the first case of COVID-19 in China as November 17 (95% CI October 4). Origination dates are discussed for the first five countries outside China and each continent. Results infer that SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in early October to mid-November, and by January, had spread globally. This suggests an earlier and more rapid timeline of spread. Our study provides new approaches for estimating dates of the arrival of infectious diseases based on small samples that can be applied to many epidemiological situations.","Roberts, David L.; Rossman, Jeremy S.; Jarić, Ivan",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34166465/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009620,77

DESIGN: Between 20 March and 29 July 2020, this cross-sectional case-control study collected data on father-child bonding quality, depression, anxiety and somatization in 30 Italian gay fathers (n=15 families) who were having or successfully had a child through cross-border surrogacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. These fathers were compared with a sociodemographically similar group of 50 Italian gay fathers (n=25 families) who had children through cross-border surrogacy prior to the pandemic. RESULTS: Although father-child bonding quality and the mental health symptoms of fathers scored below the clinical cut-off points in both groups, fathers who had or were having a child during the COVID-19 pandemic reported poorer father-child bonding (estimate 3.04, SE 1.47, P=0.044) and more depressive (estimate -1.47, SE 0.49, P=0.005), anxious (estimate -1.96, SE 0.55, P<0.001) and somatic symptoms (estimate -2.48, SE 0.52, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings call for the development of international guidelines for cross-border surrogacy and underline the need for tailored and ongoing psychological and legal support for intended gay fathers to ease their strain and anxiety related to having a child through cross-border surrogacy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Carone, Nicola; Manzi, Demetria; Barone, Lavinia; Lingiardi, Vittorio; Baiocco, Roberto; Bos, Henny M W",Reprod Biomed Online,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2021.05.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34417139/,77

Pathologic fibrosis of organs and vasculature leads to increased mortality and severely worsened quality of life. Inhibiting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), an immuno- and a fibrosis modulator, may attenuate these post-COVID sequelae. Current preclinical and clinical efforts are centered on the mechanisms and manifestations of COVID-19 and its presymptomatic and prodromal periods; by comparison, the postdrome, which occurs in the aftermath of COVID-19, which we refer to as persistent post-COVID-syndrome, has received little attention. Potential long-term effects from post-COVID syndrome will assume increasing importance as a surge of treated patients are discharged from the hospital, placing a burden on healthcare systems, patients’ families, and society in general to care for these medically devastated COVID-19 survivors.

630575,Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus and Elderly Acquired Hydrocephalus: Evaluation With Cerebrospinal Fluid Flow and Ventricular Volume Parameters,2020-10-30,"BACKGROUND: A recently published randomized trial (Boulware et al., 2020, NCT04308668) of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for post-exposure prophylaxis found a reduction in Covid-19 of 17%. In the context of ambitious powering to detect a 50% reduction, this non-statistically significant finding could translate to a reduction of 22,000/130,828 cases (CDC 8/12/20) among US health care workers (HCW), impacting trajectory and resource utilization models that drive decisions on lockdowns and social distancing. Data found only in the appendix of Boulware et al. suggested greater differences in the effect of HCQ among sub-groups. There were reductions (36%) in younger (<35 years) and increases (110%) in older (>50 years) subjects. Our preliminary analysis revealed a significant negative correlation (slope -0.211, CI -0.328-0.094, p=0.016) between treatment lag and disease reduction, reaching 49% when initiated within one day (RR 0.51, CI 0.176-1.46, p=0.249). There were also differences in disease reduction by HCQ by type of exposure (HCW - 8% vs. household contacts - 31%; RR 0.691, CI 0.398-1.2). The definitions of exposure severity did not discriminate between the numbers or duration (> 10 minutes) of exposures. Differences between exposure types may result from younger HCW and higher risks in less trained household contacts with little access to advanced PPE. The ex-protocol use of zinc and ascorbic acid were likely confounders, as was the possibly active folate placebo. Exploratory reanalysis of the raw dataset may inform an age- and stage- nuanced approach to COVID-19 using HCQ testable by prospective studies and may provide insight into the various proposed mechanisms of HCQ. OBJECTIVES: To conduct an exploratory re-analysis of the de-identified raw dataset from a randomized study of the use of HCQ for post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 with view to further defining: a) The time dependent effect of HCQ, b) The age dependent effect of HCQ; c) The sub-stratification of time- and age-dependent effects by exposure type and risk level, as well as by the use of zinc and ascorbic acid. d) The design of future clinical trials to test the hypotheses generated by this study. METHODS: Should granularity of data (by age, time-lag, level and type of exposure) be greater than that originally reported, Fisher Exact test will be used to compare the incidence of COVID-19 in HCQ- and control groups, for each sub-group stratification. Since the degree of loss of data granularity due to de-identification is yet unknown, exploratory analyses involving other demographic characteristics cannot be planned. Where sufficient data granularity exists, univariate regression analyses will be conducted to examine the effect of age- and time lag on any effect of HCQ. The possibility will be explored of conducting multivariate Cox regression analyses with propensity score matching to examine observational data relating to the use of zinc and ascorbic acid. This analysis will be expanded should a dataset from a similarly designed study (Mitja et al., 2020, NCT04304053), with directionally similar results, become available.

For filoviruses this includes plaque assay for quantitation of infectious virus, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for morphology and quantitation of virus particles, and real-time reverse transcription PCR for quantitation of viral RNA (qRT-PCR). The ViroCyt(®) Virus Counter (VC) 2100 (ViroCyt, Boulder, CO, USA) is a flow-based instrument capable of quantifying virus particles in solution. Using a proprietary combination of fluorescent dyes that stain both nucleic acid and protein in a single 30 min step, rapid, reproducible, and cost-effective quantification of filovirus particles was demonstrated. Using a seed stock of Ebola virus variant Kikwit, the linear range of the instrument was determined to be 2.8E+06 to 1.0E+09 virus particles per mL with coefficient of variation ranging from 9.4% to 31.5% for samples tested in triplicate. VC particle counts for various filovirus stocks were within one log of TEM particle counts. A linear relationship was established between the plaque assay, qRT-PCR, and the VC. VC results significantly correlated with both plaque assay and qRT-PCR. These results demonstrated that the VC is an easy, fast, and consistent method to quantify filoviruses in stock preparations.","Rossi, Cynthia A.; Kearney, Brian J.; Olschner, Scott P.; Williams, Priscilla L.; Robinson, Camenzind G.; Heinrich, Megan L.; Zovanyi, Ashley M.; Ingram, Michael F.; Norwood, David A.; Schoepp, Randal J.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v7030857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25710889/,77

632078,Vaccine Effectiveness Studies in the Field,2021-07-21,"This manuscript provides guidance on the management of thyroid dysfunction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Autoimmune thyroid diseases are not linked to increased risks of COVID-19. Uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis may result in more severe complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection, including thyroid storm. The management of patients with a new diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is best undertaken with a block-and-replace regimen due to limited biochemical testing availability. Antithyroid drug (ATD)-induced neutropenia may favour the progression of COVID-19 and symptoms of infection may be confused with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The withdrawal of ATDs and urgent measurement of neutrophils should be considered in case of flu-like manifestations occurring in the initial months of treatment. Urgent surgery or 131-I may be undertaken in selected cases of uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis. Patients with COVID-19 infection may present with conjunctivitis, which could cause diagnostic difficulties in patients with new or existing Graves’ ophthalmopathy. Patients who are on replacement treatment with thyroid hormones should ensure they have sufficient supply of medication. The usual advice to increase dosage of levothyroxine during pregnancy should be adhered to. Many newly presenting and previously diagnosed patients with thyroid dysfunction can be managed through virtual telephone or video clinics supported by a dedicated nurse-led service, depending on available facilities.","Boelaert, Kristien; Visser, W Edward; Taylor, Peter Nicholas; Moran, Carla; Léger, Juliane; Persani, Luca",Eur J Endocrinol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438340/; https://doi.org/10.1530/eje-20-0445,77

OBJECTIVE: To examine the proportions of Latinx immigrants who endorse statements about the potential negative immigration ramifications of seeking and using COVID-19–related testing and treatment services and engaging in contact tracing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional survey study, 25 COVID-19–related items were incorporated into the online Spanish-language survey of an ongoing study. Data were collected between July 15 and October 9, 2020, in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and Phoenix, Arizona. A nonrandom sample of 379 adult, Spanish-speaking, noncitizen Latinx immigrants (with either documented or undocumented immigration status) were sent surveys. Of those, 336 individuals (88.7% participation rate) returned surveys, and 43 individuals did not. An additional 213 individuals were screened but ineligible. Descriptive statistics were computed, and mean comparisons and bivariate correlations between sociodemographic variables, indices of immigration risk, and COVID-19–related survey items were conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Items elicited agreement or disagreement with statements about immigrants’ access to COVID-19–related testing and treatment services and the potential immigration ramifications of using these services. Willingness to identify an undocumented person during contact tracing was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 336 Latinx immigrants completed surveys. The mean (SD) age of participants was 39.7 (8.9) years; 210 participants (62.5%) identified as female, and 216 participants (64.3%) had undocumented immigration status. In total, 89 participants (26.5%) agreed that hospital emergency departments were the only source of COVID-19 testing or treatment for uninsured immigrants, and 106 participants (31.6%) agreed that using public testing and health care services for COVID-19 could jeopardize one’s immigration prospects. A total of 96 participants (28.6%) and 114 participants (33.9%), respectively, would not identify an undocumented household member or coworker during contact tracing. Reluctance to identify an undocumented household member or coworker was associated with having had deportation experiences (r = −0.17; 95% CI, −0.06 to 0.27; P = .003) but not with the number of years lived in the US (r = 0.07; 95% CI, −0.16 to 0.17; P = .15) or immigration status (r = 0.03; 95% CI, −0.07 to 0.13; P = .56). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional survey study, a substantial number of immigrants endorsed statements about immigrants’ restricted access to COVID-19–related testing and treatment services and the potential negative immigration ramifications of using these services. These results suggest that programs for COVID-19–related testing, contact tracing, and vaccine administration that are designed to allay immigration concerns are needed.","Galletly, Carol L.; Lechuga, Julia; Dickson-Gomez, Julia B.; Glasman, Laura R.; McAuliffe, Timothy L.; Espinoza-Madrigal, Iván",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34279648/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.17049,77

This paper proposes a wearable device with the Internet of Things (IoT) integration for real-time monitoring of body temperature the indoor condition via an alert system to the person in quarantine. The alert is transferred when the body thermal exceeds the allowed threshold temperature. Moreover, an algorithm Repetition Spikes Counter (RSC) based on an accelerometer is employed in the role of human activity recognition to realize whether the quarantined person is doing physical exercise or not, for auto-adjustment of threshold temperature. The real-time warning and stored data analysis support the family members/doctors in following and updating the quarantined people’s body temperature behavior in the tele-distance. The experiment includes an M5stickC wearable device, a Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) accelerometer, an infrared thermometer, and a digital temperature sensor equipped with the user’s wrist. The indoor temperature and humidity are measured to restrict the virus spread and supervise the room condition of the person in quarantine. The information is transferred to the cloud via Wi-Fi with Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) broker. The Bluetooth is integrated as an option for the data transfer from the self-isolated person to the electronic device of a family member in the case of Wi-Fi failed connection.

Identification of efficient inhibitors to treat and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection is a predominant focus. Encouragingly, using X-ray crystal structures of therapeutically relevant drug targets (PLpro, Mpro, RdRp, and S glycoprotein) offers a valuable direction for anti–SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery and lead optimization through direct visualization of interactions. Computational analyses based primarily on MMPBSA calculations have also been proposed for assessing the binding stability of biomolecular structures involving the ligand and receptor.

634461,Evaluation of an Online Interactive IMNCI Training Program in Nursing Students,2020-11-04,"Background African American have been severely affected by COVID-19 noted with the rising mortality rates within the African American community. Health disparities, health inequities and issues with systemic health access are some of the pre-existing issues African American were subjected to within the southern states in the United States. Second, social distancing is a critical non-pharmacological intervention to reduce the spread of COVID-19. However, social distancing was not practical and presented a challenge within the African American community, specifically, in the southern states. Objective This article assesses the effect of COVID-19 on African American in the southern states. Methodology This short communication queried the publicly available Department of Health statistics on COVID-19 related mortality and underlying health conditions in four southern states (Alabama [AL], Georgia [GA], Louisiana [LA] and Mississippi [MS]) with a high proportion of African American residents. Second, unacast COVID-19 toolkit was used to derive a social distancing (SD) grade for any given state, based on three different metrics: (i) percent change in average distance travelled (ii) percent change in non-essential visits and (iii) decrease in human encounters (compared to national baseline). Results Across the four states, on average, as many as 54% of COVID-19 related deaths are in the African American community, although this minority group comprises only 32% of the population cumulatively. This article finds that all four southern states received a social distancing grade of F. COVID-19 have demonstrated that adverse outcomes are higher in individuals with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or pre-existing pulmonary compromise. Conclusion Recognizing that there is a great need for African American representation or diversity in the health workforce would be able to better address the health disparities. In addition, the lack of diversity in the healthcare system causes the morbidity and mortality rates to increase in the African American communities because it is not able to address its primary obligations within the African American communities in the southern states during COVID-19 pandemic. These primary obligations are to restore, protect, improve health and to suppress health disparities and inequalities of COVID-19 within in the African American communities.

636086,Risk Perceptions Related to SARS and Avian Influenza: Theoretical Foundations of Current Empirical Research,2009-02-12,"AIM: The aim of this study is to assess whether anxiety symptoms are associated with alcohol abuse in Brazilian undergraduate dental students during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHOD: A cross‐sectional study was conducted. A semi‐structured questionnaire addressing the variables of interest was hosted on Google Forms and shared with dental undergraduate students from all Brazilian regions between July 8 and 27, 2020. Alcohol abuse was measured using the Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye opener (CAGE) questionnaire score of ≥2. All participants responded to the seven‐item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD‐7). Hierarchical logistic regression was also conducted. RESULTS: Among the 1050 students evaluated, 18.7% (n = 196) had a positive screening for alcohol abuse during the pandemic. The prevalence of mild (GAD‐7 = 5–9), moderate (GAD‐7 = 10–14), and severe (GAD‐7 ≥15) anxiety among students were 31.3%, 29.6%, and 24.2%, respectively. The final hierarchical logistic regression model showed that during the COVID‐19 pandemic, anxiety levels predict the likelihood of alcohol abuse among students with moderate (OR 10.05 [95% IC: 4.12–24.52]) or severe (OR 15.82 [95% IC: 6.46–38.73]) anxiety, especially for male students (moderate anxiety: OR 17.06 [95% CI: 8.36–34.78]; severe anxiety: OR 28.38 [95% CI: 8.62–38.24]). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of alcohol abuse and moderate or severe anxiety in Brazilian undergraduate dental students during the COVID‐19 pandemic was high. Male students may be more sensitive to the presence of anxiety symptoms in this period, thus contributing to higher levels of alcohol consumption, in comparison to female students. Intervention strategies that promote the adoption of healthier lifestyles can enable the effective management of anxiety symptoms during the pandemic and thus, hold the potential to reduce exacerbated alcohol intake in this population.","Fernandez, Matheus dos Santos; Vieira, Igor Soares; da Silva, Nathalia Ribeiro Jorge; Cardoso, Taiane de Azevedo; Bielavski, Camilla Hübner; Rakovski, Coral; Silva, Alexandre Emidio Ribeiro",J Dent Educ,https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268733/,77
636115,Effect of Intravenous IgM-Enriched Immunoglobulins on Presepsin and Other Sepsis Biomarkers,2021-09-08,"Primary human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) cultures represent a universal platform to propagate respiratory viruses and characterize their host interactions in authentic target cells. To further elucidate specific interactions between human respiratory viruses and important host factors in airway epithelium, it is important to make hAEC cultures amenable to genetic modification. However, the short and finite lifespan of primary cells in cell culture creates a bottleneck for the genetic modification of these cultures. In the current study, we show that the incorporation of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632) during cell propagation extends the life span of primary human cells in vitro and thereby facilitates the incorporation of lentivirus-based expression systems. Using fluorescent reporters for FACS-based sorting, we generated homogenously fluorescent hAEC cultures that differentiate normally after lentiviral transduction. As proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that host gene expression can be modulated post-differentiation via inducible short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated knockdown. Importantly, functional characterization of these transgenic hAEC cultures with exogenous poly(I:C), as a proxy for virus infection, demonstrates that such modifications do not influence the host innate immune response. Moreover, the propagation kinetics of both human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were not affected. Combined, these results validate our newly established protocol for the genetic modification of hAEC cultures thereby unlocking a unique potential for detailed molecular characterization of virus – host interactions in human respiratory epithelium.","Jonsdottir, Hulda R.; Marti, Sabrina; Geerts, Dirk; Rodriguez, Regulo; Thiel, Volker; Dijkman, Ronald",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/694380,77

638327,The burden of pneumonia in children: an Australian perspective,2005-05-21,"The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has motivated an intensive analysis of its molecular epidemiology following its worldwide spread. To understand the early evolutionary events following its emergence, a data set of 985 complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences was assembled. Variants showed a mean of 5.5 to 9.5 nucleotide differences from each other, consistent with a midrange coronavirus substitution rate of 3 × 10(−4) substitutions/site/year. Almost one-half of sequence changes were C→U transitions, with an 8-fold base frequency normalized directional asymmetry between C→U and U→C substitutions. Elevated ratios were observed in other recently emerged coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]-CoV), and decreasing ratios were observed in other human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, -OC43, -229E, and -HKU1) proportionate to their increasing divergence. C→U transitions underpinned almost one-half of the amino acid differences between SARS-CoV-2 variants and occurred preferentially in both 5′ U/A and 3′ U/A flanking sequence contexts comparable to favored motifs of human APOBEC3 proteins. Marked base asymmetries observed in nonpandemic human coronaviruses (U ≫ A > G ≫ C) and low G+C contents may represent long-term effects of prolonged C→U hypermutation in their hosts. The evidence that much of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses may be driven by a host APOBEC-like editing process has profound implications for understanding their short- and long-term evolution. Repeated cycles of mutation and reversion in favored mutational hot spots and the widespread occurrence of amino acid changes with no adaptive value for the virus represent a quite different paradigm of virus sequence change from neutral and Darwinian evolutionary frameworks and are not incorporated by standard models used in molecular epidemiology investigations. IMPORTANCE The wealth of accurately curated sequence data for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), its long genome, and its low substitution rate provides a relatively blank canvas with which to investigate effects of mutational and editing processes imposed by the host cell. The finding that a large proportion of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 in the initial months of the pandemic comprised C→U mutations in a host APOBEC-like context provides evidence for a potent host-driven antiviral editing mechanism against coronaviruses more often associated with antiretroviral defense. In evolutionary terms, the contribution of biased, convergent, and context-dependent mutations to sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 is substantial, and these processes are not incorporated by standard models used in molecular epidemiology investigations.","Simmonds, P.",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00408-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32581081/,77
638911,Dehiscence of an Infected Composite Ascending Graft with Systolic Extrinsic Compression,2020-09-10,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections impose a significant burden on the health care system. Current methods for detecting these infections are constrained by combinations of high cost, long processing times, and imperfect accuracy, reducing their effectiveness. METHODS: We examine whether the quantity of time a patient spends in a ward with other patients clinically-suspected of infection, which we call co-presence, can be used as a tool to predict subsequent healthcare-associated infection. Compared to contact tracing, this leverages passively-collected electronic data rather than manually-collected data, allowing for improved monitoring. We abstracted all 133,304 inpatient records between 2011 and 2015 from a healthcare system in the UK. We calculate the AUROC for each of five pathogens based on co-presence time, the sensitivity and specificity for the test, and how much earlier co-presence would have predicted infection for the true positives. FINDINGS: Across the five pathogens, AUROC ranged from 0.92 to 0.99, and was 0.52 for the negative control. Optimal cut-points of co-presence ranged from 25 to 59 hours, and would have led to detection of true positives up to an average of one day earlier. INTERPRETATION: These findings show that co-presence time would help predict healthcare-acquired infection, and would do so earlier than the current standard of care. Using this measure prospectively in hospitals based on real-time data could limit the consequences of infection, both by being able to treat individual infected patients earlier, and by preventing potential secondary infections stemming from the original infected patient.","Rewley, Jeffrey; Koehly, Laura; Marcum, Christopher Steven; Reed-Tsochas, Felix",J Hosp Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.07.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32745591/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120303625; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120303625?v=s5,77
639381,"Discounting, Cognitive Inflexibility, and Antisocial Traits as Predictors of Adolescent Drug Involvement",2021-06-17,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly around the world, and some patients present gastrointestinal symptoms. The existence of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract makes digestive endoscopy a high-risk operation, which associated with an increased risk of infection rate in healthcare workers. This study aimed at exploring current knowledge, practice and attitudes of healthcare workers in endoscopy units in China regarding the status of occupational protection during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study of a national online survey involving 717 healthcare workers in endoscopy units from 94 medical structures in 24 provinces and municipalities around China was conducted online via a questionnaire platform called Wenjuanxing (wjx.cn). The data were analyzed using correlation approaches, Kruskal-Wallis test for independent samples, and linear regression models. Results: Most Chinese healthcare workers in endoscopy units had a good knowledge of COVID-19 (median: 10; range: 7–12), showed a strikingly positive attitude (median: 65; range: 39–65), and carried out good practice (median: 47; range: 14–50) in strengthening the protection, disinfection and management of COVID-19. In terms of attitudes, female staff was more concerned about protection against COVID-19 than male staff (KW = 8.146, P = 0.004). Nurses performed better in both attitude (KW = 2.600, P = 0.009) and practice (KW = 6.358, P < 0.001) than endoscopic physicians when carrying out personal protection, patient care and environmental disinfection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. More positive attitudes in protection were related to better protective behavior in endoscopic daily medical work (r = 0.312; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that Chinese endoscopy healthcare workers have an excellent mastery of knowledge about COVID-19, which is transformed into positive beliefs and attitudes, contributing to good practice during daily endoscopic procedures. Medical staff may benefit from further education. With the gradual normalization amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, protection and management in endoscopy units may be changed accordingly.","Tian, Yuan; Nian, Bixiao; Ma, Yongchen; Guo, Xinyue; Wang, Feng; Rong, Long",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829007/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.632608,77

To reveal the missing information, we investigated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in the cities of Wuhan, Shenzhen, and Shijiazhuang of China. Design Cross-sectional study Setting Three blood centers, located in the central, south and north China, respectively, recruiting from January to April 2020. Participants 38,144 healthy blood donors donated in Wuhan, Shenzhen and Shijiazhuang were enrolled, who were all met the criteria for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Main outcome measures Specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 including total antibody (TAb), IgG antibody against receptor-binding domain of spike protein (IgG-RBD) and nucleoprotein (IgG-N), and IgM. Pseudotype lentivirus-based neutralization test was performed on all TAb-positive samples. In addition, anonymous personal demographic information, including gender, age, ethnicity, occupation and educational level, and blood type were collected. Results A total of 519 samples from 410 donors were confirmed by neutralization tests. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors was 2.29% (407/17,794, 95%CI: 2.08% to 2.52%) in Wuhan, 0.029% (2/6,810, 95%CI: 0.0081% to 0.11%) in Shenzhen, and 0.0074% (1/13,540, 95%CI: 0.0013% to 0.042%) in Shijiazhuang, respectively. The earliest emergence of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in blood donors was identified on January 20, 2020 in Wuhan. The weekly prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Wuhan's blood donors changed dynamically and were 0.08% (95%CI: 0.02% to 0.28%) during January 15 to 22 (before city lockdown), 3.08% (95%CI: 2.67% to 3.55%) during January 23 to April 7 (city quarantine period) and 2.33% (95%CI: 2.06% to 2.63%) during April 8 to 30 (after lockdown easing). Female and older-age were identified to be independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among donors in Wuhan. Conclusions The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among blood donors in China was low, even in Wuhan city. According to our data, the earliest emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan's donors should not earlier than January, 2020. As most of the population of China remained uninfected during the early wave of COVID-19 pandemic, effective public health measures are still certainly required to block viral spread before a vaccine is widely available.","Chang, L.; Hou, W.; Zhao, L.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, Y.; Wu, L.; Xu, T.; Wang, L.; Wang, J.; Ma, J.; Zhao, J.; Xu, J.; Dong, J.; Yan, Y.; Yang, R.; Li, Y.; Guo, F.; Cheng, W.; Su, Y.; Zeng, J.; Han, W.; Cheng, T.; Zhang, J.; Yuan, Q.; Ningshao, X.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.13.20153106v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.13.20153106,77

640961,Neurological telemedicine in the COVID-19 era,2020-11-30,"In addition to its canonical functions, vitamin D has been proposed to be an important mediator of the immune system. Despite ample sunshine, vitamin D deficiency is prevalent (>80%) in the Middle East, resulting in a high rate of supplementation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the specific regimen prescribed and the potential factors affecting an individual’s response to vitamin D supplementation are not well characterized. Our objective is to describe the changes in the blood transcriptome and explore the potential mechanisms associated with vitamin D3 supplementation in one hundred vitamin D-deficient women who were given a weekly oral dose (50,000 IU) of vitamin D3 for three months. A high-throughput targeted PCR, composed of 264 genes representing the important blood transcriptomic fingerprints of health and disease states, was performed on pre and post-supplementation blood samples to profile the molecular response to vitamin D3. We identified 54 differentially expressed genes that were strongly modulated by vitamin D3 supplementation. Network analyses showed significant changes in the immune-related pathways such as TLR4/CD14 and IFN receptors, and catabolic processes related to NF-kB, which were subsequently confirmed by gene ontology enrichment analyses. We proposed a model for vitamin D3 response based on the expression changes of molecules involved in the receptor-mediated intra-cellular signaling pathways and the ensuing predicted effects on cytokine production. Overall, vitamin D3 has a strong effect on the immune system, G-coupled protein receptor signaling, and the ubiquitin system. We highlighted the major molecular changes and biological processes induced by vitamin D3, which will help to further investigate the effectiveness of vitamin D3 supplementation among individuals in the Middle East as well as other regions.","Garand, Mathieu; Toufiq, Mohammed; Singh, Parul; Huang, Susie Shih Yin; Tomei, Sara; Mathew, Rebecca; Mattei, Valentina; Al Wakeel, Mariam; Sharif, Elham; Al Khodor, Souhaila",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22095041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34068701/,77
641469,Validation Checklist for Massive Vaccination Centers.,2021,"OBJECTIVE: In view of the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the increasing global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is likely that many patients with OSA get exposed to this virus. Besides theoretical assumptions, there is no evidence that OSA may favor SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or may lead to a more severe disease. Taking the opportunity of the Atahualpa Project cohort, we aimed to assess the relationship between previously diagnosed OSA and SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adults living in rural Ecuador. PATIENTS AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were determined in 180 individuals aged >60 years that underwent polysomnography previously to this novel pandemic. Those with OSA remained untreated due to income limitations. Exposure-effect models were fitted with OSA as the exposure, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and symptomatology as the outcomes, and confounders – age, gender, obesity, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, individuals per house, home confinement – as independent variables. RESULTS: A total of 87 (48%) individuals were seropositive to SARS-CoV-2, 77% of whom were symptomatic. The mean apnea/hypopnea index was 11.1±11.7 episodes per hour, with 83 (46%) individuals having mild, and 38 (21%) moderate-to-severe OSA. Exposure-effect models demonstrated lack of relationship between OSA and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows no relationship between history of OSA and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity or symptomatology, opposing previous suggestions that persons with OSA are more prone to acquire the infection and have a more severe disease.","Del Brutto, Oscar H.; Mera, Robertino M.; Castillo, Pablo R.; Recalde, Bettsy Y.; Costa, Aldo F.",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2021.106639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33901750/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303846721001669; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303846721001669?v=s5,77

642299,Implementing genomic screening in diverse populations,2021-02-05,"BACKGROUND: Clerkship is a challenging transition for medical students where they learn to apply functional knowledge and diagnostic reasoning skills learned in the pre–clinical phase into the clinical environment. Rather than a smooth continuum to facilitate application of knowledge, clerkship blocks are discrete, fragmented structures with little integration. Developments in cognitive psychology and increasing attention to the student learning environment are driving more purposeful integration in medical education. We sought to enhance knowledge transfer in the Family Medicine clerkship by developing an e-learning pathway with both asynchronous and synchronous components to integrate pre-clerkship problem-based learning (PBL) cases into more complex clinical scenarios. METHODS: A parallel-convergent mixed methods evaluation was conducted, which included comparison of learning outcomes (exit exams) relative to the prior class, knowledge check quiz performance, and qualitative analysis of student and faculty perceptions. RESULTS: Analyses revealed no significant difference between exit exam scores of the intervention and pre-intervention clerks (p = 0.30). There were statistically significant differences in mean quiz scores over the rotation (p = 0.0001). Moreover, learners and faculty each perceived the integration components as facilitating the transfer of pre-clinical learning into clerkship activities. CONCLUSION: The novel e-learning pathway firmly anchored FM clerkship learning and will continue to ensure learners are ideally primed to optimize their direct clinical learning opportunities.","Bracken, Keyna; Levinson, Anthony J.; Mahmud, Meera; Allice, Ilana; Vanstone, Meredith; Grierson, Lawrence",Med Sci Educ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40670-021-01348-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34178422/,77

Potential new practices and social forms being facilitated by the pandemics are having impacts on energy demand and consumption. Spatial and temporal heterogeneities of impacts appear gradually due to the dynamics of pandemics and mitigation measures. This paper overviews the impacts and challenges of COVID-19 pandemics on energy demand and consumption and highlights energy-related lessons and emerging opportunities. The discussion on energy-related issues is divided into four main sections: emergency situation and its impacts, environmental impacts and stabilising energy demand, recovering energy demand, and lessons and emerging opportunities. The changes in energy requirements are compared and analysed from multiple perspectives according to available data and information. In general, although the overall energy demand declines, the spatial and temporal variations are complicated. The energy intensity has presented apparent changes, the extra energy for COVID-19 fighting is non-negligible for stabilising energy demand, and the energy recovery in different regions presents significant differences. A crucial issue has been to allocate and find energy-related emerging opportunities for the post pandemics. This study could offer a direction in opening new avenues for increasing energy efficiency and promoting energy saving.","Jiang, Peng; Fan, Yee Van; Klemeš, Jiří Jaromír",Appl Energy,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030626192100009X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519038/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030626192100009X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116441,77

643146,Association of Delayed Surgery With Oncologic Long-term Outcomes in Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Not Responding to Preoperative Chemoradiation,2021,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents an important problem of global health. The damage related to TBI is first due to the direct injury and then to a secondary phase in which neuroinflammation plays a key role. NLRP3 inflammasome is a component of the innate immune response and different diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, are characterized by NLRP3 activation. This review aims to describe NLRP3 inflammasome and the consequences related to its activation following TBI. NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 are significantly upregulated after TBI, therefore, the use of nonspecific, but mostly specific NLRP3 inhibitors is useful to ameliorate the damage post-TBI characterized by neuroinflammation. Moreover, NLRP3 and the molecules associated with its activation may be considered as biomarkers and predictive factors for other neurodegenerative diseases consequent to TBI. Complications such as continuous stimuli or viral infections, such as the SARS-CoV-2 infection, may worsen the prognosis of TBI, altering the immune response and increasing the neuroinflammatory processes related to NLRP3, whose activation occurs both in TBI and in SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review points out the role of NLRP3 in TBI and highlights the hypothesis that NLRP3 may be considered as a potential therapeutic target for the management of neuroinflammation in TBI.","Irrera, Natasha; Russo, Massimo; Pallio, Giovanni; Bitto, Alessandra; Mannino, Federica; Minutoli, Letteria; Altavilla, Domenica; Squadrito, Francesco",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32867310/,77

643636,Humans: the ultimate animal models,2020-08-07,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to impact health systems throughout the world with serious medical challenges being imposed on many African countries like Nigeria. Although emerging studies have identified lymphopenia as a driver of cytokine storm, disease progression, and poor outcomes in infected patients, its immunopathogenesis, as well as environmental and genetic determinants, remain unclear. Understanding the interplay of these determinants in the context of lymphopenia and COVID-19 complications in patients in Africa may help with risk stratification and appropriate deployment of targeted treatment regimens with repurposed drugs to improve prognosis. OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to investigate the role of vitamin D status, vasculopathy, apoptotic pathways, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms in the immunopathogenesis of lymphopenia among African people infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This cross-sectional study will enroll 230 participants, categorized as “SARS-CoV-2 negative” (n=69), “COVID-19 mild” (n=32), “hospitalized” (n=92), and “recovered” (n=37), from two health facilities in Lagos, Nigeria. Sociodemographic data, travel history, and information on comorbidities will be obtained from case files and through a pretested, interview-based structured questionnaire. Venous blood samples (5 mL) collected between 8 AM and 10 AM and aliquoted into EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and plain tubes will be used for complete blood count and CD4 T cell assays to determine lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1000 cells/µL) and CD4 T lymphocyte levels, as well as to measure the concentrations of vitamin D, caspase 3, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) using an autoanalyzer, flow cytometry, and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) techniques. Genomic DNA will be extracted from the buffy coat and used as a template for the amplification of apoptosis-related genes (Bax, Bcl-2, BCL2L12) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genotyping of VDR (Apa1, Fok1, and Bsm1) gene polymorphisms by the PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism method and capillary sequencing. Total RNA will also be extracted, reverse transcribed, and subsequently quantitated by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to monitor the expression of apoptosis genes in the four participant categories. Data analyses, which include a test of association between VDR gene polymorphisms and study outcomes (lymphopenia and hypovitaminosis D prevalence, mild/moderate and severe infections) will be performed using the R statistical software. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium analyses for the alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of the genotyped VDR gene will also be carried out. RESULTS: A total of 45 participants comprising 37 SARS-CoV-2–negative and 8 COVID-19–recovered individuals have been enrolled so far. Their complete blood counts and CD4 T lymphocyte counts have been determined, and their serum samples and genomic DNA and RNA samples have been extracted and stored at –20 °C until further analyses. Other expected outcomes include the prevalence and distribution of lymphopenia and hypovitaminosis D in the control (SARS-CoV-2 negative), confirmed, hospitalized, and recovered SARS-CoV-2–positive participants; association of lymphopenia with CD4 T lymphocyte level, serum vitamin D, sVCAM-1, sFasL, and caspase 3 levels in hospitalized patients with COVID-19; expression levels of apoptosis-related genes among hospitalized participants with COVID-19, and those with lymphopenia compared to those without lymphopenia; and frequency distribution of the alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes of VDR gene polymorphisms in COVID-19–infected participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study will aid in the genotypic and phenotypic stratification of COVID-19–infected patients in Nigeria with and without lymphopenia to enable biomarker discovery and pave the way for the appropriate and timely deployment of patient-centered treatments to improve prognosis.

Cytokine storms (CSs) are associated with various pathologies, as observed in infectious diseases, certain acquired or inherited immunodeficiencies and autoinflammatory diseases, or following therapeutic interventions. Despite the role of CS in tissue damage and multiorgan failure, a systematic understanding of its underlying molecular mechanisms is lacking. Recent studies demonstrate a positive feedback loop between cytokine release and cell death pathways; certain cytokines, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), can activate inflammatory cell death, leading to further cytokine secretion. Here, we discuss recent progress in innate immunity and inflammatory cell death, providing insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of CSs and therapeutics that might quell ensuing life-threatening effects.","Karki, Rajendra; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi",Trends Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2021.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34217595/,77

This time-consuming responsibility affects their physical and psychosocial health. Therefore, mothers as caregivers are required to receive special training to take care of their children. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a developed web-based intervention for daily care training of children with CP on their mothers’ quality of life (QOL), anxiety, depression, stress, and their musculoskeletal pain. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: This study was a single blind randomized controlled trial. 91 mothers of children with CP with Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels III, IѴ, and Ѵ, who aged from 4 to 12 years were assigned to the intervention and control groups using block randomization. Mothers in the control group received their routine face to face occupational therapy intervention and mothers in the intervention group received 12 weeks web-based intervention. QOL, depression, anxiety, stress, and pain were measured before and after the intervention in both groups. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The results of analysis of covariance showed that after controlling the mean score of pretest of pain, the mean score of post-tests in the intervention and control groups was significantly different (P < 0.05). The mean scores of physical health and total QOL scores of post-tests in the intervention group were significantly higher than the control group with controlling pretest scores. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Designed web-based intervention affects the caregivers’ QOL and pain significantly. This intervention can be used to provide daily care training for mothers of children with CP.","Nobakht, Z.; Rassafiani, M.; Hosseini, S.A.; Hosseinzadeh, S.",Res Dev Disabil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32659699/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2020.103731; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S089142222030161X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089142222030161X,77

We observed a decrease of HIV diagnosis during this period. Interestingly, median age at HIV diagnosis decreased of one decade and percentage of female patients was higher. In addition, more patients received diagnosis during hospitalization and more AIDS-defining conditions, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia, were detected.

Here, we randomly assigned participants (N = 97) to either a poignant experience of forecasted economic anxiety or a no-anxiety control condition. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we then examined how source-localized, anxiety-specific neural activation modulated risky decision making and strategic behavior in the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Previous research demonstrates opposing effects of anxiety on risk-taking, leading to contrasting predictions. On the one hand, activity in the dorsomedial PFC/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula, brain regions linked with anxiety and sensitivity to risk, should mediate the effect of economic anxiety on increased risk-averse decision-making. On the other hand, activation in the ventromedial PFC, a brain region important in emotion regulation and subjective valuation in decision-making, should mediate the effect of economic anxiety on increased risky decision-making. Results revealed evidence related to both predictions. Additionally, anxiety-specific activation in the dmPFC/ACC and the anterior insula were associated with disrupted learning across the task. These results shed light on the neurobiology of antecedent anxiety and risk-taking and provide potential insight into understanding how real-world anxieties can impact decision-making processes.","Nash, Kyle; Leota, Josh; Tran, Alex",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33514841/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82229-w,77

We propose here the first model, explaining how the outcome of first, crucial 10‐15 days after infection, hangs on the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, Mannose Binding Lectin ). If SARS‐CoV‐2 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens. The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm) leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal. Low‐moderate physical activity can still be recommended. However, extreme physical activity and hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID‐19, facilitates early direct penetration of high numbers of virus particles in the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airway’s mucosae covered by neutralizing antibodies. This allows the virus bypassing the efficient immune barrier of the upper airways mucosa in already infected, young and otherwise healthy athletes. In conclusion, whether the virus or the adaptative immune response reach the lungs first, is a crucial factor deciding the fate of the patient. This “quantitative and time‐sequence dependent” model has several implications for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID‐19 at all ages.","Matricardi, Paolo Maria; Dal Negro, Roberto Walter; Nisini, Roberto",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32359201/; https://doi.org/10.1111/pai.13271,77

Some very low death rate settings such as Eastern Asia, Central Europe, the Balkans and Africa have a common feature of eating large quantities of fermented foods whose intake is associated with the activation of the Nrf2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2) anti-oxidant transcription factor. There are many Nrf2-interacting nutrients (berberine, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein, quercetin, resveratrol, sulforaphane) that all act similarly to reduce insulin resistance, endothelial damage, lung injury and cytokine storm. They also act on the same mechanisms (mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin, PPARγ:Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, NFκB: Nuclear factor kappa B, ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinases and eIF2α:Elongation initiation factor 2α). They may as a result be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19, acting through the endoplasmic reticulum stress or ACE-Angiotensin-II-AT(1)R axis (AT(1)R) pathway. Many Nrf2-interacting nutrients are also interacting with TRPA1 and/or TRPV1. Interestingly, geographical areas with very low COVID-19 mortality are those with the lowest prevalence of obesity (Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia). It is tempting to propose that Nrf2-interacting foods and nutrients can re-balance insulin resistance and have a significant effect on COVID-19 severity. It is therefore possible that the intake of these foods may restore an optimal natural balance for the Nrf2 pathway and may be of interest in the mitigation of COVID-19 severity.","Bousquet, Jean; Cristol, Jean-Paul; Czarlewski, Wienczyslawa; Anto, Josep M.; Martineau, Adrian; Haahtela, Tari; Fonseca, Susana C.; Iaccarino, Guido; Blain, Hubert; Fiocchi, Alessandro; Canonica, G.

However, there has been limited research on such trends among people with pre-existing mental health conditions, leaving mental health services ill equipped to plan for current and future lockdowns. METHODS: Mean weekly scores on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 between 01/01/2020-22/06/2020 (n=9,538 individuals) for all patients of two psychological treatment services (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) in London, were compared to mean weekly scores from the same time periods in 2017-2019 (n=37,849). The proportion of scores which were above the clinical thresholds for ‘caseness’ each week were compared, and scores between groups based on gender, age group, and ethnicity, were also compared. RESULTS: Confirmed community transmission in the UK (26/02/2020-03/03/2020) and the announcement of the national ‘lockdown’ (23/03/2020) were associated with significant increases in anxiety symptom scores. ‘Lockdown’ was associated with a decrease in depression scores. These changes were not maintained during lockdown. Significant increases in depression and anxiety were observed at week 23, as restrictions were eased. LIMITATIONS: This was an exploratory analysis in two services only. Residual confounding and selection biases cannot be ruled out. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the weekly average symptom scores were short-term; they did not continue throughout ‘lockdown’ as might have been expected, except among older people. Replication of this study in other settings and investigating the potential benefits of more regular reviews or more intensive treatments for at-risk groups, are warranted.","Saunders, Rob; Buckman, Joshua E.J.; Leibowitz, Judy; Cape, John; Pilling, Stephen",J Affect Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962366/,77

653504,Editor's Notebook: September 2021,2021,"Background Today’s residency applicants submit more applications than those in the past. To facilitate holistic review, many program directors have encouraged applicants to submit fewer applications. However, whether programs provide sufficient information to help applicants determine where to apply is unclear. Objective To evaluate the frequency of missing information on residency program websites and in the Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA). Methods We used FREIDA to identify all categorical pediatric residency programs in the United States. We noted the presence of information programs reported in each FREIDA data field. We compared information available on the program website for consistency with the information in FREIDA and additionally searched for current resident information and any description of the qualities of applicants/residents desired on the program website. Results Two hundred and eleven pediatric residency programs were included in FREIDA. Approximately 25% of programs did not include basic information such as number of first year residents, salary, work hours, or consideration of applicants requiring work visas. Over half of programs did not report minimum licensing examination scores required for interview consideration. Discrepancies between information on program websites and FREIDA related to work visas occurred in 6-8% of programs. While 88% of program websites included information on current residents, only 17% included any description of the applicant attributes sought by the program. Conclusions Many pediatric residency programs do not provide much of the information that applicants need to help determine if a program is a good fit or whether their application is competitive.","Kirkendoll, Shelbie D; Carmody, J.

654356,The Effect of Centralized Financial and Social Incentives on Cooperative Behavior and Its Underlying Neural Mechanisms,2021-03-02,"A trend towards drier conditions during the April to October ‘cool’ season across southern Australia has been observed in the past few decades. Frequent and prolonged droughts have a significant impact on the financial stability of affected farming communities. Forecast-based Financing (FbF) is a novel proactive aid approach that provides support measures to increase resilience during the window between drought early warnings, and the actual onset and intensification of drought. Using the Northern Murray-Darling Basin as a case study, we investigated whether FbF combined with a user-centred Integrated Early Warning System (I-EWS) for drought has the potential to increase the drought resilience of Australian farming communities. This study shows that farming businesses most impacted by drought have three common factors: (i) lower levels of business management skills, (ii) lower levels of pre-drought preparedness during non-drought periods, and (iii) slower responses when the intensity of drought increases. The results suggest that FbF in its current form is not recommended for a market economy such as Australia, as forms of direct assistance may have adverse long-term effects through disrupting the market itself and may not encourage farm operators to regularly assess and adapt their drought management strategies. Results also suggest that providing farmers, service providers, and all levels of government with tools that incorporate a user-centred I-EWS for drought can improve overall decision-making before, during, and even after drought. This change from a reactive to a proactive approach to managing drought impacts can be a highly effective form of increasing the drought resilience of farming communities.","Asghari, Atifa; Kuleshov, Yuriy; Watkins, Andrew B.; Bhardwaj, Jessica; Aitkenhead, Isabella",Nat Hazards (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421219/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-021-04876-6,77

Medline and ScienceDirect databases were searched for prospective observational studies that screened hospitalized patients with ARI for hMPV by RT-PCR, with data available at December 27, 2014. The risk of bias was assessed regarding participation rate, definition of ARI, description of diagnostic technique, method of inclusion identical for all subjects, standardized and identical sampling method for all subjects, analysis performed according to the relevant subgroups, and presentation of data sources. Random-effect meta-analysis with arcsine transformation and meta-regressions was used. In the 75 articles included, the prevalence of hMPV among hospitalized ARI was 6.24% (95% CI 5.25–7.30). An effect of the duration of the inclusion period was observed (p = 0.0114), with a higher prevalence of hMPV in studies conducted during periods of 7–11 months (10.56%, 95% CI 5.97–16.27) or complete years (7.55%, 95% CI 5.90–9.38) than in periods of 6 months or less (5.36%, 95% CI 4.29–6.54). A significant increase in the incidence with increasing distance from the equator was observed (p = 0.0384). hMPV should be taken into account as a possible etiology in hospitalized ARI.","Lefebvre, Annick; Manoha, Catherine; Bour, Jean-Baptiste; Abbas, Rachid; Fournel, Isabelle; Tiv, Michel; Pothier, Pierre; Astruc, Karine; Aho-Glélé, Ludwig Serge",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27337518/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2016.05.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653216301184; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653216301184,77

Whether antibodies are important for the adaptive immune responses against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection needs to be determined. Here, 26 cases of COVID‐19 in Jinan, China, were examined and shown to be mild or with common clinical symptoms, and no case of severe symptoms was found among these patients. Strikingly, a subset of these patients had SARS‐CoV‐2 and virus‐specific IgG coexist for an unexpectedly long time, with two cases for up to 50 days. One COVID‐19 patient who did not produce any SARS‐CoV‐2–bound IgG successfully cleared SARS‐CoV‐2 after 46 days of illness, revealing that without antibody‐mediated adaptive immunity, innate immunity alone may still be powerful enough to eliminate SARS‐CoV‐2. This report may provide a basis for further analysis of both innate and adaptive immunity in SARS‐CoV‐2 clearance, especially in nonsevere cases.","Wang, Bin; Wang, Li; Kong, Xianggen; Geng, Jin; Xiao, Di; Ma, Chunhong; Jiang, Xue‐Mei; Wang, Pei‐Hui",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343415/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25946,77

AIM: To assess how university students experienced the sudden shift to online teaching after closure of campus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Students in Public Health Nutrition answered questionnaires two and 12 weeks (N = 79: response rate 20.3% and 26.6%, respectively) after the lockdown in Norway on 12 March 2020 and participated in digital focus group interviews in May 2020 (mixed methods study). FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: Two weeks into the lockdown, 75% of students reported that their life had become more difficult and 50% felt that learning outcomes would be harder to achieve due to the sudden shift to online education. Twelve weeks into the lockdown, the corresponding numbers were 57% and 71%, respectively. The most pressing concerns among students were a lack of social interaction, housing situations that were unfit for home office purposes, including insufficient data bandwidth, and an overall sense of reduced motivation and effort. The students collaborated well in digital groups but wanted smaller groups with students they knew rather than being randomly assigned to groups. Most students agreed that pre-recorded and streamed lectures, frequent virtual meetings and student response systems could improve learning outcomes in future digital courses. The preference for written home exams over online versions of previous on-campus exams was likely influenced by student’s familiarity with the former. The dropout rate remained unchanged compared to previous years. CONCLUSION: The sudden shift to digital teaching was challenging for students, but it appears that they adapted quickly to the new situation. Although the concerns described by students in this study may only be representative for the period right after campus lockdown, the study provide the student perspective on a unique period of time in higher education.","Almendingen, Kari; Morseth, Marianne Sandsmark; Gjølstad, Eli; Brevik, Asgeir; Tørris, Christine",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464386/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250378,77
657593,Evaluation of adverse effects of particulate matter on human life,2021-02-17,"Hydroxyapatite- or calcium phosphate-coated iron oxide nanoparticles have a high potential for use in many biomedical applications. In this study, a co-precipitation method for the synthesis of hydroxyapatite-coated nanoparticles (SPION(HAp)), was used. The produced nanoparticles have been characterized by dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction, vibrating sample magnetometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, atomic emission spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, selected area diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results showed a successful synthesis of 190 nm sized particles and their stable coating, resulting in SPION(HAp). Potential cytotoxic effects of SPION(HAp) on EL4, THP-1, and Jurkat cells were tested, showing only a minor effect on cell viability at the highest tested concentration (400 µg Fe/mL). The results further showed that hydroxyapatite-coated SPIONs can induce minor TNF-α and IL-6 release by murine macrophages at a concentration of 100 µg Fe/mL. To investigate if and how such particles interact with other substances that modulate the immune response, SPION(HAp)-treated macrophages were incubated with LPS (lipopolysaccharides) and dexamethasone. We found that cytokine release in response to these potent pro- and anti-inflammatory agents was modulated in the presence of SPION(HAp). Knowledge of this behavior is important for the management of inflammatory processes following in vivo applications of this type of SPIONs.","Friedrich, Bernhard; Auger, Jean-Philippe; Dutz, Silvio; Cicha, Iwona; Schreiber, Eveline; Band, Julia; Boccacccini, Aldo R.; Krönke, Gerhard; Alexiou, Christoph; Tietze, Rainer",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33923700/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22084143,77

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been proven to be used by SARS-CoV-2 for host cell entry. Considering that angiotensin receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) upregulate the expression of ACE2 in animal studies, there may be a concern about whether these drugs may increase COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Recently, there has been a debate among clinicians about whether to continue or to stop ACEIs and angiotensin receptor blockers in the context of COVID-19. Also, some media outlets and health systems have called for the discontinuation of these drugs in the context of suspected COVID-19. This has necessitated an urgent release of guidance on the use of such medications in COVID-19 patients. To date, multiple theories relating to the pure effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors on COVID-19 infections have been postulated. Favorable effects include blocking the ACE2 receptors, preventing viral entry into the heart and lungs, and protecting against lung injury in COVID-19. Adverse effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism that upregulates ACE2 receptors. This review provides greater insight into the role of the RAAS axis in acute lung injury and the effects of RAAS inhibitors on SARS-CoVs. The hypothesis that RAAS inhibitors facilitate viral insertion and the alternative hypothesis of the beneficial role of these drugs are discussed. Up-to-date published data concerning the RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 are summarized.","Albashir, Ahmed Abdalazim Dafallah",South Med J,https://doi.org/10.14423/smj.0000000000001200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398362/,77

[...]it is imperative that we seek to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 with every tool in our arsenal. Viral replication is also under circadian control, and though it has not been reported to our knowledge, SARS-CoV-2 almost certainly interacts with the host circadian system. [...]if the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and clinical outcomes are the result of a battle between viral replication and host immune response, enhancing circadian health in humans and capitalizing on temporal vulnerabilities of the virus via deliberately timed vaccination and treatment may also allow us to boost their efficacy and further reduce the severity of symptoms in those with COVID-19 (Besedovsky et al., 2019;Haspel et al., 2020;Schneider et al., 2020). [...]treatment with melatonin may improve immune system function, provide protection from damage to cells under inflammatory conditions, and prevent pathogenic inflammation that may lead to autoimmunity (Besedovsky et al., 2019;Haspel et al., 2020;Schneider et al., 2020).

The application of tissue engineering-related transplantation, stem cells, and local changes in the microenvironment is expected to solve major medical problems. Currently, most studies focus on tissue repair and regeneration, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are among the most common research topics. MSCs are applicable as seed cells, and they represent one of the current hot topics in regenerative medicine research. However, due to storage limitations and because cell senescence occurs during in vitro expansion, their clinical application is challenging. Exosomes, which are secreted by MSCs through paracrine signalling, not only have the same effects as MSCs, but they also have the advantages of targeted delivery, low immunogenicity, and high repairability.

A high-quality and easy-to-use prognostic model to predict in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients could support physicians to make better clinical decisions. METHODS: Fine-Gray models were used to derive a prognostic model to predict in-hospital mortality (treating discharged alive from hospital as the competing event) in COVID-19 patients using two retrospective cohorts (n = 1008) in Wuhan, China from January 1 to February 10, 2020. The proposed model was internally evaluated by bootstrap approach and externally evaluated in an external cohort (n = 1031). RESULTS: The derivation cohort was a case-mix of mild-to-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients (43.6% females, median age 55). The final model (PLANS), including five predictor variables of platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex, had an excellent predictive performance (optimism-adjusted C-index: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.87; averaged calibration slope: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.08). Internal validation showed little overfitting. External validation using an independent cohort (47.8% female, median age 63) demonstrated excellent predictive performance (C-index: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.89; calibration slope: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.12). The averaged predicted cumulative incidence curves were close to the observed cumulative incidence curves in patients with different risk profiles.

660560,"Covid19, beyond just the lungs: a review of multisystemic involvement by Covid19",2021-02-16,"BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and defecation-related anxiety, which can result in reduced productivity and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQL). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce symptoms of IBS and to improve HRQL, but access to qualified therapists is limited. Smartphone-based digital therapeutic interventions have potential to increase access to guided CBT at scale, but require careful study to assess their benefits and risks. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a novel app, Zemedy, as a mobile digital therapeutic that delivers a comprehensive CBT program to individuals with IBS. METHODS: This was a crossover randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited online and randomly allocated to either immediate treatment (n=62) or waitlist control (n=59) groups. The Zemedy app consists of 8 modules focusing on psychoeducation, relaxation training, exercise, the cognitive model of stress management, applying CBT to IBS symptoms, reducing avoidance through exposure therapy, behavioral experiments, and information about diet. Users interact with a chatbot that presents the information and encourages specific plans, homework, and exercises. The treatment was fully automated, with no therapist involvement or communication. At baseline and after 8 weeks, participants were asked to complete the battery of primary (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life [IBS-QOL], Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale [GSRS]) and secondary (Fear of Food Questionnaire [FFQ], Visceral Sensitivity Index [VSI], Gastrointestinal Cognition Questionnaire [GI-COG], Depression Anxiety Stress Scale [DASS], and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) outcome measures. Waitlist controls were then offered the opportunity to crossover to treatment. All participants were assessed once more at 3 months posttreatment. RESULTS: Both intention-to-treat and completer analyses at posttreatment revealed significant improvement for the immediate treatment group compared to the waitlist control group on both primary and secondary outcome measures. Gains were generally maintained at 3 months posttreatment. Scores on the GSRS, IBS-QoL, GI-COG, VSI, and FFQ all improved significantly more in the treatment group (F(1,79)=20.49, P<.001, Cohen d=1.01; F(1,79)=20.12, P<.001, d=1.25; F(1,79)=34.71, P<.001, d=1.47; F(1,79)=18.7, P<.001, d=1.07; and F(1,79)=12.13, P=.001, d=0.62, respectively). Depression improved significantly as measured by the PHQ-9 (F(1,79)=10.5, P=.002, d=1.07), and the DASS Depression (F(1,79)=6.03, P=.02, d=.83) and Stress (F(1,79)=4.47, P=.04, d=0.65) subscales in the completer analysis but not in the intention-to-treat analysis. The impact of treatment on HRQL was mediated by reductions in catastrophizing and visceral sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its relatively benign physical profile, IBS can be an extraordinarily debilitating condition. Zemedy is an effective modality to deliver CBT for individuals with IBS, and could increase accessibility of this evidence-based treatment.

In search for key targets of effective therapeutics, robust animal models mimicking COVID-19 in humans are urgently needed. Here, we show that productive SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of mice is limited and restricted by early type I interferon responses. In contrast, we show that Syrian hamsters are highly permissive to SARS- CoV-2 and develop bronchopneumonia and a strong inflammatory response in the lungs with neutrophil infiltration and edema. Moreover, we identify an exuberant innate immune response as a key player in pathogenesis, in which STAT2 signaling plays a dual role, driving severe lung injury on the one hand, yet restricting systemic virus dissemination on the other.

In response, preclerkship medical education curricula are adapting to meet these demands, often by reducing the time for foundational sciences. This descriptive study compares preclerkship pharmacology education curricular practices from seven allopathic medical schools across the United States. We compare factors and practices that affect how pharmacology is integrated into the undergraduate medical education curriculum, including teaching techniques, resources, time allocated to pharmacology teaching, and assessment strategies. We use data from seven medical schools in the United States, along with results from a literature survey, to inform the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches and to raise important questions that can guide future research regarding integration of foundational sciences in medical school and health professions’ curricula. In this comparative study, we found that there is significant heterogeneity in the number of hours dedicated to pharmacology in the preclerkship curriculum, whereas there was concordance in the use of active learning pedagogies for content delivery. Applying the ICAP (Interactive, Constructive, Active, Passive) Framework for cognitive engagement, our data showed that pharmacology was presented using more highly engaging pedagogies during sessions that are integrated with other foundational sciences. These findings can serve as a model that can be applied beyond pharmacology to other foundational sciences such as genetics, pathology, microbiology, biochemistry, etc.","Quesnelle, Kelly M.; Zaveri, Naunihal T.; Schneid, Stephen D.; Blumer, Joe B.; Szarek, John L.; Kruidering, Marieke; Lee, Michael W.",Pharmacol Res Perspect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974344/; https://doi.org/10.1002/prp2.762,77
660759,Facial paralysis and vaccinations: a vaccine adverse event reporting system review,2021-06-29,"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the global pandemic of COVID-19, is an abundant, heavily glycosylated surface protein that plays a key role in receptor binding and host cell fusion, and is the focus of all current vaccine development efforts. Variants of concern are now circulating worldwide that exhibit mutations in the spike protein. Protein sequence and glycosylation variations of the spike may affect viral fitness, antigenicity, and immune evasion. Global surveillance of the virus currently involves genome sequencing, but tracking emerging variants should include quantitative measurement of changes in site-specific glycosylation as well. In this work, we used data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry to quantitatively characterize the five N-linked glycosylation sites of the glycoprotein standard alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), as well as the 22 sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that DIA compared favorably to DDA in sensitivity, resulting in more assignments of low-abundance glycopeptides. However, the reproducibility across replicates of DIA-identified glycopeptides was lower than that of DDA, possibly due to the difficulty of reliably assigning low-abundance glycopeptides confidently. The differences in the data acquired between the two methods suggest that DIA outperforms DDA in terms of glycoprotein coverage but that overall performance is a balance of sensitivity, selectivity, and statistical confidence in glycoproteomics. We assert that these analytical and bioinformatics methods for assigning and quantifying glycoforms would benefit the process of tracking viral variants as well as for vaccine development.

660878,Epidemiology of necrotizing enterocolitis,2008-01-21,"Intraviral protein-protein interactions are crucial for replication, pathogenicity, and viral assembly. Among these, virus assembly is a critical step as it regulates the arrangements of viral structural proteins and helps in the encapsulation of genomic material. SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins play an essential role in the self-rearrangement, RNA encapsulation, and mature virus particle formation. In SARS-CoV, the membrane protein interacts with the envelope and spike protein in Endoplasmic Reticulum Golgi Intermediate Complex (ERGIC) to form an assembly in the lipid bilayer, followed by membrane-ribonucleoprotein (nucleocapsid) interaction. In this study, using protein-protein docking, we tried to understand the interaction of membrane proteins interaction with envelope, spike and nucleocapsid proteins. Further, simulation studies performed up to 100ns agreed that protein complexes M-E, M-S, and M-N were stable. Moreover, the calculated free binding energy and dissociation constant values support the protein complex formation. The interaction identified in the study will be of great importance, as it provides valuable insight into the protein complex, which could be the potential drug targets for future studies.","Kumar, Amit; Kumar, Prateek; Garg, Neha; Giri, Rajanish",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.30.363002,77

We present a comprehensive report of Covid-19 patients in Iran. Methods One hundred hospitalized patients with Covid-19 were studied. Data on potential source of exposure, demographic, clinical, and paraclinical features, therapy outcome, and post-discharge follow-up were analyzed. Results The median age of the patients was 58 years, and the majority of the patients (72.7%) were above 50 years of age. Fever was present in 45.2% of the patients on admission. The most common clinical symptoms were shortness of breath (74%) and cough (68%). Most patients had elevated C-reactive protein (92.3%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (82.9%), lymphocytopenia (74.2 %) on admission. Lower lobes of the lung were most commonly involved, and ground-glass opacity (81.8%) was the most frequent finding in CT scans. The administration of hydroxychloroquine improved the clinical outcome of the patients. Lopinavir/ritonavir was efficacious at younger ages. Of the 70 discharged patients, 40% had symptom relapse, (8.6%) were readmitted to the hospital, and 3 patients (4.3%) died. Conclusion This report demonstrates a heterogeneous nature of clinical manifestations in patients affected with Covid-19. The most common presenting symptoms are non-specific, so attention should be made on broader testing, especially in age groups with the greatest risk and younger individuals who can serve as carriers of the disease. Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (in younger age group) can be potential treatment options. Finally, patients discharged from the hospital should be followed up because of potential symptom relapse.","Ashraf, Mohammad Ali; Shokouhi, Nasim; Shirali, Elham; Davari-tanha, Fateme; Memar, Omeed; Kamalipour, Alireza; Azarnoush, Ayein; Mabadi, Avin; Ossareh, Adele; Sanginabadi, Milad; Mokhtari Azad, Talat; Aghaghazvini, Leila; Ghaderkhani, Sara; Poordast, Tahereh; Pourdast, Alieh; Nazemi, Pershang",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20072421v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.20072421,77
662064,5G-enabled ultra-sensitive fluorescence sensor for proactive prognosis of COVID-19,2021-06-01,"In this study, aloe-emodin was identified as a potential interferon (IFN)-inducer by screening compounds from Chinese herbal medicine. Aloe-emodin showed low cytotoxicity to human HL-CZ promonocyte cells and TE-671 medulloblastoma cells and significantly activated interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and gamma-activated sequence (GAS)-driven cis-reporting systems. Moreover, aloe-emodin upregulated expression of IFN-stimulated genes such as dsRNA-activated protein kinase and 2′,5′-oligoisoadenylate synthase. Aloe-emodin resulted in significant activation of nitric oxide production. The antiviral activity of aloe-emodin against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) was evaluated using dose- and time-dependent plaque reduction assays in HL-CZ cells and TE-671 cells. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of aloe-emodin ranged from 0.50 μg/mL to 1.51 μg/mL for JEV and from 0.14 μg/mL to 0.52 μg/mL for EV71. Aloe-emodin showed clearly potent virus inhibitory abilities and achieved high therapeutic indices, in particular for HL-CZ cells. Therefore, the study demonstrated dose- and time-dependent actions of aloe-emodin on the inhibition of JEV and EV71 replication via IFN signalling responses.","Lin, Cheng-Wen; Wu, Chia-Fang; Hsiao, Nai-Wan; Chang, Ching-Yao; Li, Shih-Wein; Wan, Lei; Lin, Ying-Ju; Lin, Wei-Yong",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18701259/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857908002045; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2008.04.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857908002045,77

The reasons for this should be sought in the processes of aging and chronic latent inflammation, i.e. immunosenescence and inflammaging. Laboratory medicine specialists are currently focused on proving the presence of the virus and defining biomarkers that would enable the prediction of disease progression. For now, it has been shown that useful biomarkers can include general biomarkers of inflammation (parameters of complete blood count, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, procalcitonin), biomarkers of myocardial damage (high sensitivity troponin I/T, B-type natriuretic peptide, and N-terminal B type natriuretic peptide), and vascular biomarkers (D-dimer, prothrombin time, fibrinogen). Their actual diagnostic specificity, sensitivity and predictive value need to be tested on a larger number of subjects.

Especially of interest is aligning model development and data collection to support response efforts at each stage of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented in terms of real-time collection and dissemination of a number of diverse datasets, ranging from disease outcomes, to mobility, behaviors, and socio-economic factors. The data sets have been critical from the perspective of disease modeling and analytics to support policymakers in real time.

Drawing on a subset of data from a large contemporaneous research study, this report explores the experiences of 36 women students with and without reported pre-existing mental health diagnoses during the first UK lockdown, in spring 2020. Specifically, the data explored self-reported coping with the restrictions, with the abrupt move to online learning, and the loss of support; as well as students' perceived strengths and difficulties in balancing their student role with family roles such as being a partner and/or a parent. Students with a pre-existing mental health diagnosis reported higher levels of loneliness compared to a matched sample of non-students, and more avoidant coping and negative emotional coping than students without a diagnosis. Qualitative data illustrate how parenting intersects with well-being and stress as both a protective and risk factor for women university students. This research report adds to the evidence base on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the student population, and how pre-existing mental health diagnoses intersect with coping behaviours and vulnerability in women students. Exploration of potential vulnerabilities can provide opportunities for targeted support, and identifying effective coping has the potential to inform effective interventions.","Misca, Gabriela; Thornton, Gemma",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995205/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648533,77

Recent studies have revealed evidences that indicate that LLPS plays a vital role in human health and diseases. In this review, we describe our current understanding of LLPS and summarize its physiological functions. We further describe the role of LLPS in the development of human diseases. Additionally, we review the recently developed methods for studying LLPS. Although LLPS research is in its infancy—but is fast-growing—it is clear that LLPS plays an essential role in the development of pathophysiological conditions. This highlights the need for an overview of the recent advances in the field to translate our current knowledge regarding LLPS into therapeutic discoveries.","Wang, Bin; Zhang, Lei; Dai, Tong; Qin, Ziran; Lu, Huasong; Zhang, Long; Zhou, Fangfang",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00678-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334791/,77
664065,Effect of 24 hours light on circadian rhythms of secretory enzymes and morphology of rat von Ebner’s glands,1999-10-05,"In epidemiology, there are still outdated myths associated with the spread of respiratory infections. Recently, we have witnessed the origination of a new misconception, to the effect that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in the open air by way of particulate air pollution (atmospheric particulate matter (PM)). There is no evidence to support the idea behind this misconception. Nevertheless, more and more people are involved in animated debate and the number of studies concerning atmospheric PM as a carrier of SARS-CoV-2 is growing rapidly. In this work, the origin of the misconception was investigated, and the published papers which have contributed to the spread of this myth were analyzed. The results show that the following factors lie behind the origin and spread of the misconception: a) The specific terminology is not always clearly defined or consistently used by scientists. In particular, the terms ‘particulate matter’, ‘atmospheric aerosol particles’, ‘air pollutants’, and ‘atmospheric aerosols’ need to be clarified, and besides they are often equated to ‘infectious aerosols’, ‘virus-bearing aerosols’, ‘bio-aerosols’, ‘virus-laden particles’, ‘respiratory aerosol/droplets’, and ‘droplet nuclei’. b) Authors misinterpret statistical data and information from other sources. Interpretation of the correlation between PM levels and the increasing incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection, is often changed from “PM may reflect the indirect action of certain atmospheric conditions that maintain infectious nuclei suspended for prolonged periods, parameters that also act on atmospheric pollutants” to “PM could cause an increase in infectious droplets/aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2.” This is a dramatic change to the meaning. Moreover, it is often not taken into account that PM may reflect activities in areas with high population density and this population density at the same time contributes to the spread COVID-19. c) Skewed citation practices. Many authors cite a hypothetical conclusion from an original study, then other authors cite the papers of these authors as primary sources. This practice leads to the effect that there are many witnesses to a ‘phenomenon’ that did not ever occur. Thus, the terminology used in interdisciplinary communications should be more nuanced and defined precisely. Authors should be more careful when citing unconfirmed data (and hypotheses) as well as in interpreting statistical data so as to avoid confusion and spreading false information. This is especially important now in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ishmatov, Alexander",Environ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34562486/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.112116; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121014171; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121014171,77

Notable members include West Nile virus, Dengue virus, Chikungunya, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus and enteroviruses of the Picornaviridae family.Unfortunately, prophylactic and therapeutic treatments against these pathogens are limited. +RNA viruses have limited coding capacity and thus rely extensively on host factors for successful infection and propagation. A common feature among these viruses is their ability to dramatically modify cellular membranes to serve as platforms for genome replication and assembly of new virions. These viral replication complexes (VRCs) serve two main functions: To increase replication efficiency by concentrating critical factors and to protect the viral genome from host anti-viral systems.

This PAg-activation which is TCR and butyrophilin BTN3A dependent can be modulated by NKG2D ligands, immune checkpoint ligands, adhesion molecules, and costimulatory molecules. This could explain the immune-resistance observed in certain clinical trials based on Vγ9Vδ2 T cells therapies. In NSCLC, encouraging responses were obtained with zoledronate administrations for 50% of patients. According to the in vivo results, we showed that the in vitro Vγ9Vδ2 T cell reactivity depends on the NSCLC cell line considered. If the PAg-pretreated KRAS mutated A549 is highly recognized and killed by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, the EGFR mutated PC9 remains resistant to these killers despite a pre-treatment either with zoledronate or with exogenous BrHPP. The immune resistance of PC9 was shown not to be due to immune checkpoint ligands able to counterbalance NKG2D ligands or adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 highly expressed by PC9. RHOB has been shown to be involved in the Vγ9Vδ2 TCR signaling against these NSCLC cell lines, in this study we therefore focused on its intracellular behavior. In comparison to a uniform distribution of RHOB in endosomes and at the plasma membrane in A549, the presence of large endosomal clusters of RHOB was visualized by a split-GFP system, suggesting that RHOB rerouting in the PC9 tumor cell could impair the reactivity of the immune response.","Laplagne, Chloé; Meddour, Sarah; Figarol, Sarah; Michelas, Marie; Calvayrac, Olivier; Favre, Gilles; Laurent, Camille; Fournié, Jean-Jacques; Cabantous, Stéphanie; Poupot, Mary",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32733462/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01396,77

When coupled with the omission and underrepresentation of disadvantaged groups in randomized controlled trials, many trials fail to obtain data that accurately represents the true diversity of their target population. Policies and practices have been implemented to increase representation of disadvantaged groups in many randomized controlled trials, with some trials specifically targeting such groups. To our knowledge, no systematic review has quantified the enrollment metrics and effectiveness of inclusion and retention strategies in randomized controlled trials focused on disadvantaged populations specifically. METHODS: We will conduct a systematic search across EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL as well as grey literature, conference proceedings, research monographs, and Google Scholar from inception onwards. We will include randomized controlled trials where at least 50% of enrolled participants are considered to be disadvantaged, as per the RCT authors’ definition and in line with our inclusion criteria. Two independent researchers per article will conduct preliminary title and abstract screening, subsequent full text review, and data extraction for the selected trials, with a third reviewer available to resolve conflicts. We will assess the quality of all included studies using specific criteria regarding data reporting, external validity, and internal validity. We will combine all selected studies and conduct a narrative synthesis to assess enrollment metrics. If there is sufficient homogeneity and sufficient trials comparing recruitment strategies within disadvantaged populations, we will conduct a random effects meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies designed to maximize the inclusion of disadvantaged populations in randomized controlled trials. DISCUSSION: The findings of this systematic review will establish baseline recruitment and enrollment metrics of trials targeting disadvantaged populations to elucidate the scope of the challenge of recruiting such populations. We hope that our findings will promote future research on the distinct barriers that may prevent disadvantaged populations from participating in health intervention research, will encourage more trials exploring effective, tailored recruitment strategies, and will establish a foundation to track future progress in the recruitment of disadvantaged populations.

We formulate it as a classification problem where each room is a class; the objective is to estimate the exact room, trying to maximize the area and number of rooms, but also trying to minimize the number of BLE beacons. The room estimation engine is based on a kNN (k-nearest neighbors) classifier. We evaluate the accuracy in two real scenarios and empirically measure the room estimation success related to the number of BLE beacons. As a proof-of-concept, a laptop and a Raspberry Pi are used as BLE scanners to test different hardware.

Due to the absence of simultaneous real-world data for these vaccines, we aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity between vaccines using a dynamic national monitoring strategy. METHODS: From March 12, 2021, 28 testing stations for SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection were installed in hotspots based on cellular-phone mobility tracking within the most populated cities in Chile. Individuals voluntarily approaching the testing stations were invited to do a lateral flow test by finger prick and respond to a questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, vaccination status (including type of vaccine if one was received), variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and comorbidities. We compared the proportion of individuals testing positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG across sites by week since vaccination between recipients of CoronaVac and BNT162b2. Unvaccinated participants served as a control population and were matched to vaccinated individuals on the basis of date of presentation to the testing station, gender, and age group. Individuals were excluded from the analysis if they were younger than 18 years, had no declared gender, had an invalid IgG test result, had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection on PCR, could not recall their vaccination status, or had been immunised against COVID-19 with vaccines other than CoronaVac or BNT162b2. Here, we report data collected up to July 2, 2021. FINDINGS: Of 64 813 individuals enrolled, 56 261 were included in the final analysis, of whom 33 533 (59·6%) had received at least one dose of the CoronaVac vaccine, 8947 (15·9%) had received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, and 13 781 (24·5%) had not received a vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity during week 4 after the first dose of CoronaVac was 28·1% (95% CI 25·0–31·2; 220 of 783 individuals), reaching a peak of 77·4% (75·5–79·3; 1473 of 1902 individuals) during week 3 after the second dose. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity during week 4 after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine was 79·4% (75·7–83·1; 367 of 462 individuals), increasing to 96·5% (94·9–98·1; 497 of 515 individuals) during week 3 after the second dose and remaining above 92% until the end of the study. For unvaccinated individuals, IgG seropositivity ranged from 6·0% (4·4–7·6; 49 of 810 individuals) to 18·7% (12·5–24·9; 28 of 150 individuals) during the 5 month period. Regression analyses showed that IgG seropositivity was significantly lower in men than women and in people with diabetes or chronic diseases for CoronaVac vaccine recipients (p<0·0001), and for individuals aged 60 years and older compared with people aged 18–39 years for both vaccines (p<0·0001), 3–16 weeks after the second dose. INTERPRETATION: IgG seropositivity was lower after CoronaVac than after BNT162b2 and declined over time since vaccination for CoronaVac recipients but not BNT162b2 recipients. Prolonged IgG monitoring will allow further evaluation of seropositivity overtime, providing data, in conjunction with effectiveness studies, for possible future re-assessment of vaccination strategies.

Nevertheless, few studies have been conducted to identify the key challenges and critical success factors (CSFs) of blockchain implementation in the maritime industry. A case study approach based on Singapore’s maritime industry is adopted. Four interviews are conducted to establish the face validity of the survey questionnaire before data are collected from 30 maritime professionals from Singapore’s maritime industry. In addition to analytic hierarchical process (AHP), a fishbone diagram and PESTEL analysis are also adopted to organize and discuss the results. The results show that there are six key challenges and six CSFs for blockchain implementation. Using a fishbone diagram, the six identified challenges along with 13 personal concerns are categorized into five dimensions related to people, methods, organization, external environment, and technology. The CSFs are sufficient capital, staff training, ease of local legislation, support from the shipping community, support from the senior management, and professional consultation and assistance. This study implicates marine policy formulation in relation to subsidies and investments, blockchain talent and knowledge acquisition, and workforce training and education to accelerate blockchain implementation in the maritime industry.","Zhou, Yusheng; Soh, Ying Shan; Loh, Hui Shan; Yuen, Kum Fai",Mar Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106727/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0308597X20309118; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104265; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X20309118,77
668122,How mu-Opioid Receptor Recognizes Fentanyl,2020-09-09,"Background Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) for SARS-CoV-2 offer new opportunities for the quick and laboratory-independent identification of infected individuals for control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Despite the potential benefits, nasopharyngeal sample collection is frequently perceived as uncomfortable by patients and requires trained healthcare personnel with protective equipment. Therefore, anterior nasal self-sampling is increasingly recognized as a valuable alternative. Methods We performed a prospective, single-center, point of care validation of an Ag-RDT using a polypropylene absorbent collector for standardized self-collected anterior nasal swabs. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) from combined oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs served as a comparator. Primary endpoint was sensitivity of the standardized Ag-RDT in symptomatic patients with medium or high viral concentration ([≥] 1 million RNA copies on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2). Results Between February 12 and March 22, 2021, 388 participants were enrolled. After exclusion of 9 patients for which no PCR result could be obtained, the novel Ag-RDT was evaluated based on 379 participants, of which 273 were symptomatic and 106 asymptomatic. In 61 samples from symptomatic patients with medium or high viral load ([≥] 1 million RNA copies), the sensitivity of the standardized Ag-RDT was 96.7% (59/61; 95%CI: 88.7-99.6%) for the primary endpoint. In total, 62 positive Ag-RDT results were detected out of 70 RT-PCR positive individuals, yielding an overall sensitivity of 88.6% (95%CI: 78.7-94.9%). Specificity was 99.7% (95%CI: 98.2-100%) in 309 RT-PCR negative individuals. Conclusion Here, we present a validation of a novel Ag-RDT with a standardized sampling process for anterior nasal self-collection, which meets WHO criteria of [≥]80% sensitivity and [≥]97% specificity. Although less sensitive than RT-PCR, this assay could be beneficial due to its rapid results, ease of use, and suitability for standardized self-testing. (Funded by Dragerwerk AG & Co.

We report herewith the isolation of the P.2 variant (B.1.1.28.2) from international travelers and further its pathogenicity evaluation and comparison with D614G variant (B.1) in hamster model. Methods Virus isolation was performed in Vero CCL81 cells and genomic characterization by next generation sequencing. The pathogenicity of the isolate was assessed in Syrian hamster model and compared with B.1 variant. Results B.1.1.28.2 variant was isolated from nasal/throat swabs of international travelers returned to India from United Kingdom and Brazil. The B.1.1.28.2 variant induced body weight loss, viral replication in the respiratory tract, lung lesions and caused severe lung pathology in infected Syrian hamster model in comparison, with B.1 variant infected hamsters. The sera from B.1.1.28.2 infected hamsters efficiently neutralized the D614G variant virus whereas 6-fold reduction in the neutralization was seen in case of D614G variant infected hamsters’ sera with the B.1.1.28.2 variant. Conclusions B.1.1.28.2 lineage variant could be successfully isolated and characterization could be performed. Pathogenicity of the isolate was demonstrated in Syrian hamster model and in comparison, with B.1 variant was found more pathogenic. The findings of increased disease severity and neutralization reduction is of great concern and point towards the need for screening the vaccines for efficacy.","Yadav, Pragya; Mohandas, Sreelekshmy; Sarkale, Prasad; Nyayanit, Dimpal; Shete, Anita; Sahay, Rima; Potdar, Varsha; Baradkar, Shreekant; Gupta, Nivedita; Sapkal, Gajanan; Abraham, Priya; Panda, Samiran; Bhargava, Balram",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.24.445424,77
669061,Exaggerating Harmful Drug Effects on the Brain Is Killing Black People,2020-07-01,"The current scale of public and private testing cannot be expected to meet the emerging need for higher levels of community-level and repeated screening of asymptomatic Canadians for SARS-CoV-2. Rapid point-of-care techniques are increasingly being offered to fill the gap in screening levels required to identify undiagnosed individuals with high viral loads. However, rapid, point-of-care tests often have lower sensitivity in practice. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 has proven sensitive and specific and provides visual results in minutes. Using a commercially available kit for RT-LAMP and primer set targetting nucleocapsid (N), we tested a blinded set of 101 archived nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples with known RT-PCR results. RT-LAMP reactions were incubated at 65 °C for 30 minutes, using heat-inactivated nasopharyngeal swab sample in viral transport medium, diluted tenfold in water, as input. RT-LAMP agreed with all RT-PCR defined negatives (N = 51), and all positives with cycle threshold (Ct) less than 20 (N = 24), 65% of positives with Ct between 20-30 (N = 17), and no positives with Ct greater than 30 (N = 9). RT-LAMP requires fewer and different core components, so may not compete directly with the mainline testing workflow, preserving precious central laboratory resources for those with the greatest need. Careful messaging must be provided when using less-sensitive tests, so that people are not falsely reassured by negative results, but this caveat must be weighed against the clear benefits of reliably identifying those with high levels of virus in prioritized samples at the point of care.","Schellenberg, John J.; Ormond, Margaret; Keynan, Yoav",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653221000317; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653221000317?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33636553/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104764,77

Even though the rate of echinocandins resistance remains low (<3%), sporadic cases are emerging. Here, we present a case of bloodstream infection by a pan-echinocandin-resistant Candida albicans affecting a critically ill patient, who died in an intensive care unit following therapeutic failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. This case highlights the need to suspect pan-echinocandin resistance in patients with prolonged echinocandin exposure, particularly in the presence of urinary tract colonization.

We characterized relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and disease severity, clinical deterioration, and specific EPCs. METHODS: We used quantitative (qPCR) and digital (dPCR) PCR to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from plasma in 191 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with COVID-19. We recorded patient symptoms, laboratory markers, and clinical outcomes, with a focus on oxygen requirements over time. We collected longitudinal plasma samples from a subset of patients. We characterized the role of RNAemia in predicting clinical severity and EPCs using elastic net regression. RESULTS: 23.0% (44/191) of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had viral RNA detected in plasma by dPCR, compared to 1.4% (2/147) by qPCR. Most patients with serial measurements had undetectable RNAemia within 10 days of symptom onset, reached maximum clinical severity within 16 days, and symptom resolution within 33 days. Initially RNAaemic patients were more likely to manifest severe disease (OR 6.72 [95% CI, 2.45 – 19.79]), worsening of disease severity (OR 2.43 [95% CI, 1.07 – 5.38]), and EPCs (OR 2.81 [95% CI, 1.26 – 6.36]). RNA load correlated with maximum severity (r = 0.47 [95% CI, 0.20 – 0.67]). CONCLUSIONS: dPCR is more sensitive than qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, which is a robust predictor of eventual COVID-19 severity and oxygen requirements, as well as EPCs. Since many COVID-19 therapies are initiated on the basis of oxygen requirements, RNAemia on presentation might serve to direct early initiation of appropriate therapies for the patients most likely to deteriorate.","Ram-Mohan, Nikhil; Kim, David; Zudock, Elizabeth J; Hashemi, Marjan M; Tjandra, Kristel C; Rogers, Angela J; Blish, Catherine A; Nadeau, Kari C; Newberry, Jennifer A; Quinn, James V; O’Hara, Ruth; Ashley, Euan; Nguyen, Hien; Jiang, Lingxia; Hung, Paul; Blomkalns, Andra L; Yang, Samuel",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33949665/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab394,77

While many countries have opted for suspension of lessons, this cannot continue indefinitely and alternative means to continue lessons must be developed. While online and blended learning (including MOOCs) have been an active subject of research and discourse during the pre-pandemic days, onset of the pandemic has suddenly created an immediacy to such means of course delivery, better than any administrator or teaching committee could have done. This creates both a gap and tension in terms of successful and engaging content delivery, where traditional modes of synchronous content delivery is now forced to be brought online. Yet, the situation provides educators with an opportunity to explore the merits and weaknesses of online learning. Thus, this article seeks to outline the challenges and paradigm shifts involved in such synchronous online learning as a replacement for traditional classroom learning, following our experience at SUTD of conducting a full 13-week online physics course between May to August 2020. At the same time, we reflect on the merits brought about by the availability of such technologies that can potentially be translated to the physical physics classrooms.","Tan, Da Yang; Chen, Jer-Ming",Physics Teacher,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02705v1.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1119/5.0028641,77
672498,The Relationship Between Dry Eye Disease and Digital Screen Use,2021-09-10,"BACKGROUND: Sodium valproate (VPA) has been associated with a reduced risk of head and neck cancer development. The potential protective mechanism of action is believed to be via inhibition of histone deacetylase and subsequent epigenetic reprogramming. SAVER is a phase IIb open-label, randomised control trial of VPA as a chemopreventive agent in patients with high-risk oral epithelial dysplasia (OED). The aim of the trial is to gather preliminary evidence of the clinical and biological effects of VPA upon OED and assess the feasibility and acceptability of such a trial, with a view to inform a future definitive phase III study. METHODS: One hundred and ten patients with high-risk OED will be recruited from up to 10 secondary care sites in the UK and randomised into either VPA or observation only for 4 months. Women of childbearing potential will be excluded due to the teratogenic properties of VPA. Tissue and blood samples will be collected prior to randomisation and on the last day of the intervention/observation-only period (end of 4 months). Clinical measurement and additional safety bloods will be taken at multiple time points during the trial. The primary outcome will be a composite, surrogate endpoint of change in lesion size, change in grade of dysplasia and change in LOH profile at 8 key microsatellite regions. Feasibility outcomes will include recruitment targets, compliance with the study protocol and adverse effects. A qualitative sub-study will explore patient experience and perception of the trial. DISCUSSION: The current management options for patients with high-risk OED are limited and mostly include surgical resection and clinical surveillance. However, there remains little evidence whether surgery can effectively lead to a notable reduction in the risk of oral cancer development. Similarly, surveillance is associated with concerns regarding delayed diagnosis of OED progressing to malignancy. The SAVER trial provides an opportunity to investigate the effects of a repurposed, inexpensive and well-tolerated medication as a potential chemopreventive strategy for patients with high-risk OED. The clinical and biological findings of SAVER will inform the appropriateness, design and feasibility of a definitive phase III trial.

However, as a result of lack of direct public funding and skilled personnel, direct research on gene therapy in Africa is currently limited and resources to support the endeavor are modest. A strength of the technology is that it is based on principles of rational design, and the tools of gene therapy are now highly versatile. For example gene silencing and gene editing may be used to disable viral genes for therapeutic purposes. Gene therapy may thus lead to cure from infections with HIV-1, hepatitis B virus and Ebola virus, which are of significant public health importance in Africa. Although enthusiasm for gene therapy is justified, significant challenges to implementing the technology remain. These include ensuring efficient delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids to target cells, limiting unintended effects, cost and complexity of treatment regimens. In addition, implementation of effective legislation that will govern gene therapy research will be a challenge. Nevertheless, it is an exciting prospect that gene therapy should soon reach the mainstream of medical management.

Participants All cases of COVID-19 in Scotland in adults ages 21 to 65 (n = 83,817) and a random sample of controls matched on age, sex and general practice (n = 841,708). Exposure Individuals identified as actively teaching in a Scottish school by the General Teaching Council for Scotland, and household members of such individuals identified via the Unique Property Reference Number. Comparator Individuals identified as healthcare workers in Scotland, their household members, and the remaining ""general population"" of working-age adults. Main outcomes The primary outcome was hospitalisation with COVID-19 defined in anyone testing positive with COVID-19 in hospital, admitted to hospital within 28 days of a positive test, and/or diagnosed with COVID-19 on discharge from hospital. Severe COVID-19 was defined as individuals admitted to intensive care or dying within 28 days of a positive test or assigned COVID-19 as a cause of death. Results Most teachers were young (mean age 42), female (80%) and had no underlying conditions (84%). The cumulative incidence (risk) of hospitalisation with COVID-19 was below 1% for all of the working age adults. In the period after school re-opening, compared to the general population, in conditional logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, general practice, deprivation, underlying conditions and number of adults in the household, the relative risk in teachers (among 18,479 cases and controls) for hospitalisation was rate ratio (RR) 0.97 (95%CI 0.72-1.29) and for severe COVID-19 was RR 0.27 (95%CI 0.09-0.77). Equivalent rate ratios for household members of teachers were 0.97 (95%CI 0.74-1.27) and 0.67 (95%CI 0.36-1.24), and for healthcare workers were 1.82 (95%CI 1.55-2.14) and 1.76 (95%CI 1.22-2.56), respectively.

This study aimed to: (1) identify situations that are most amenable to the use of telemedicine for the provision of palliative care to patients in nursing homes; and (2) understand how telemedicine could best be integrated into the routine practice of mobile palliative care teams. METHODS: A qualitative study based on semi-structured focus groups (n = 7) with professionals (n = 33) working in mobile palliative care teams in France. RESULTS: Between June and July 2019, 7 mobile palliative care teams participated in one focus group each. Using thematic analysis, we found that telemedicine use in palliative care is about navigating between usual and new practices. Several influencing factors also emerged, which influence the use of telemedicine for palliative care, depending on the situation. Finally, we built a use-case model of palliative care to help mobile palliative care teams identify circumstances where telemedicine could be useful, or not. CONCLUSIONS: The potential utility of telemedicine for delivering palliative care in nursing homes largely depends on the motive for calling on the mobile palliative care team. Requests regarding symptoms may be particularly amenable to telemedicine, whereas psycho-social distress may not. Further studies are warranted to assess the impact of influencing factors on real-life palliative care practices. Telemedicine could nonetheless be a useful addition to the mobile palliative care teams’ armamentarium.

The predicted lead compound was further subjected to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to check the stability of the leads compound with the evolution of time. RESULTS: In pharmacophore-based virtual screening, 2,361 compounds were retained out of 30,927. In the structure-based screening, the lead compounds were filtered based on their docking scores. Among the 2,360 compounds, 12 lead compounds were selected based on their docking score. Kazinol T with NPASS ID: NPC474104 showed the highest docking score of -14.355 and passed criteria of Lipinski’s drug-like parameters. Monitoring ADMET properties, Kazinol T showed its safety for consumption. Docking of Kazinol T with two Asian mutants (R60C and I152V) showed variations in binding and energy parameters. Normal mode analysis for ligand-bound and unbound form of protease along with its mutants, revealed displacement and correlation parameters for C-alpha atoms. MD simulation results showed that all ligand-protein complexes remained intact and stable in a dynamic environment with negative Gibbs free energy. CONCLUSIONS: The natural product Kazinol T was a predicted lead compound against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and will be the possible treatment for COVID-19.","Muhammad, Ijaz; Rahman, Noor; Gul-e-Nayab; Niaz, Sadaf; Basharat, Zarrin; Rastrelli, Luca; Jayanthi, Sivaraman; Efferth, Thomas; Khan, Haroon",Comput Biol Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521001566?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33894500/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521001566; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104362,77

Anticoagulant therapy is currently recommended to reduce thrombotic risk, leading to potentially severe complications like spontaneous bleeding (SB). Percutaneous transcatheter arterial embolization (PTAE) can be life-saving in critical patients, in addition to medical therapy. We report a major COVID-19 Italian Research Hospital experience during the pandemic, with particular focus on indications and technique of embolization. Methods: We retrospectively included all subjects with SB and with a microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, over one year of pandemic, selecting two different groups: (a) patients treated with PTAE and medical therapy; (b) patients treated only with medical therapy. Computed tomography (CT) scan findings, clinical conditions, and biological findings were collected. Results: 21/1075 patients presented soft tissue SB with an incidence of 1.95%. 10/21 patients were treated with PTAE and medical therapy with a 30-days survival of 70%. Arterial blush, contrast late enhancement, and dimensions at CT scan were found discriminating for the embolization (p < 0.05). Conclusions: PTAE is an important tool in severely ill, bleeding COVID-19 patients. The decision for PTAE of COVID-19 patients must be carefully weighted with particular attention paid to the clinical and biological condition, hematoma location and volume.","Riu, Pascale; Albarello, Fabrizio; Di Stefano, Federica; Vergori, Alessandra; D’Abramo, Alessandra; Cerini, Carlo; Nocioni, Martina; Morucci, Maurizio; Tetaj, Nardi; Cristofaro, Massimo; Schininà, Vincenzo; Campioni, Paolo; Petrone, Ada; Fusco, Nicoletta; Marchioni, Luisa; Antinori, Andrea; Nicastri, Emanuele; Cianni, Roberto; Ianniello, Stefania",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575230/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10184119,77
680454,Altered high-density lipoprotein composition and functions during severe COVID-19,2021-01-27,"BACKGROUND: Quarantine has been adopted as a key public health measure to support the control of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in many countries Uganda adopted institutional quarantine for individuals suspected of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to be placed in institutions like hotels and/or hostels of institutions for at least 14 days. This study explored experiences of individuals who underwent institutional quarantine in Uganda to inform measures to increase its effectiveness and reduce its associated negative impact. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative description study using in-depth interviews with 20 purposively selected individuals who had spent time in institutional quarantine facilities. These were mainly phone-based interviews that were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Electronic data coding was conducted using Atlas.ti 7 software. Thematic content analysis was used to synthesize the findings with similar codes grouped to form sub-themes and ultimately study themes. The findings are presented thematically with typical participant quotes. RESULTS: Study participants spent between 14 to 25 days in institutional quarantine. Four themes emerged describing the experiences of study participants during institutional quarantine, which determined whether participants’ experiences were positive or negative. These themes were: quarantine environment including facility related factors and compliance with COVID-19 measures; quarantine management factors of entity paying the costs, communication and days spent in quarantine; individual factors comprising attitude towards quarantine, fears during and post-quarantine and coping mechanisms; and linkage to other services such as health care and post-quarantine follow-up. CONCLUSION: The planning, management and implementation of the quarantine process is a key determinant of the experiences of individuals who undergo the measure. To improve the experience of quarantined individuals and reduce its associated negative impact, the pre-quarantine process should be managed to comply with standards, quarantined persons should be provided as much information as possible, their quarantine duration should kept short and costs of the process ought to be minimised. Furthermore, quarantine facilities should be assessed for suitability and monitored to comply with guidelines while avenues for access to healthcare for the quarantined need to be arranged and any potential stigma associated with quarantine thoroughly addressed.

The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has risen steeply in recent weeks and a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.617, is believed to be responsible for many of these cases. The spike protein of B.1.617 harbors two mutations in the receptor binding domain, which interacts with the ACE2 receptor and constitutes the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, we analyzed whether B.1.617 is more adept in entering cells and/or evades antibody responses. B.1.617 entered two out of eight cell lines tested with slightly increased efficiency and was blocked by entry inhibitors. In contrast, B.1.617 was resistant against Bamlanivimab, an antibody used for COVID-19 treatment. Finally, B.1.617 evaded antibodies induced by infection or vaccination, although with moderate efficiency. Collectively, our study reveals that antibody evasion of B.1.617 may contribute to the rapid spread of this variant.","Hoffmann, Markus; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Krüger, Nadine; Kempf, Amy; Nehlmeier, Inga; Graichen, Luise; Sidarovich, Anzhalika; Moldenhauer, Anna-Sophie; Winkler, Martin S.; Schulz, Sebastian; Jäck, Hans-Martin; Stankov, Metodi V.; Behrens, Georg M.

To date, there is limited knowledge on the composition of the T and B cell immune receptor repertoires [T cell receptors (TCRs) and B cell receptors (BCRs)] and transcriptomes in convalescent COVID-19 patients of different age groups. Here, we utilize single-cell sequencing (scSeq) of lymphocyte immune repertoires and transcriptomes to quantitatively profile the adaptive immune response in COVID-19 patients of varying age. We discovered highly expanded T and B cells in multiple patients, with the most expanded clonotypes coming from the effector CD8(+) T cell population. Highly expanded CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell clones show elevated markers of cytotoxicity (CD8: PRF1, GZMH, GNLY; CD4: GZMA), whereas clonally expanded B cells show markers of transition into the plasma cell state and activation across patients. By comparing young and old convalescent COVID-19 patients (mean ages = 31 and 66.8 years, respectively), we found that clonally expanded B cells in young patients were predominantly of the IgA isotype and their BCRs had incurred higher levels of somatic hypermutation than elderly patients. In conclusion, our scSeq analysis defines the adaptive immune repertoire and transcriptome in convalescent COVID-19 patients and shows important age-related differences implicated in immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","Bieberich, Florian; Vazquez-Lombardi, Rodrigo; Yermanos, Alexander; Ehling, Roy A.; Mason, Derek M.; Wagner, Bastian; Kapetanovic, Edo; Di Roberto, Raphael Brisset; Weber, Cédric R.; Savic, Miodrag; Rudolf, Fabian; Reddy, Sai T.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.701085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322127/,77

OBJECTIVES: To assess medical students’ current knowledge of sex and gender specific health (SGSH) concepts compared to results from the same survey in 2012 to better inform development of curricular materials for medical education. METHODS: A previously designed survey tool, which assessed current knowledge of sex and gender-based medicine of medical students, was emailed to all Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine (MCASOM) students on Minnesota, Arizona, and Florida campuses in 2020. Descriptive and qualitative thematic results were compared to the same survey administered in 2012 to students enrolled in MCASOM. Changes in the inclusion of SGSH topics were assessed over the eight years. RESULTS: One hundred and one of 365 (27.7% response rate) surveys were returned with 2:1 female to male respondents with representation from all 4 years. The definitions of the terms “sex” and “gender” were correctly identified by most respondents (93.1%). However, only 36% (12/33) of questions related to other medical knowledge on SGSH topics had more than a 50% correct response rate. More than half of the students reported that SGSH topics were included in Gynecology, Cardiology, Pediatrics, and Immunology. SGSH topics were reported as not being routinely covered in Neurology and Nephrology, although more students said they were in 2020 then 2012. Sixty-two percent of students favored increasing SGSH in the current curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students appear to understand the definition of and importance of SGSH in education. While some improvements in coverage by subject matter and topic area appear to have occurred as reported by medical students, opportunity remains to more fully integrate SGSH concepts in medical school curricula.

One of the most important subjects is the “stress-strength reliability” term which always refers to the quantity P (X > Y) in any statistical literature. It resamples a system with random strength (X) that is subjected to a random strength (Y) such that a system fails in case the stress exceeds the strength. In this study, we consider stress-strength reliability where the strength (X) follows Rayleigh-half-normal distribution and stress (Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), and Y(4)) follows Rayleigh-half-normal distribution, exponential distribution, Rayleigh distribution, and half-normal distribution, respectively. This effort comprises determining the general formulations of the reliabilities of a system. Also, the maximum likelihood estimation approach and method of moment (MOM) will be utilized to estimate the parameters. Finally, reliability has been attained utilizing various values of stress and strength parameters.","Alamri, Osama Abdulaziz; El-Raouf, M. M.

682481,"The LNT Issue Is About Politics and Economics, Not Safety",2020-09-02,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that broke out in China in December 2019 rapidly became a worldwide pandemic. In Mexico, the conditions requiring the declaration of a sanitary emergency were reached by the last week of March 2020, and health authorities’ limited mobility and imposed social isolation were the main strategies to keep the virus from spreading. Thus, daily living conditions changed drastically in a few days, generating a stressful situation characterized by an almost complete lack of mobility, social isolation, and forced full-time interactions with family members. Soon, complaints of sleep disturbances, anxiety, and symptoms of depression were reported. The present study reports the results of an online survey performed during the first two months of isolation. Questionnaires exploring sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression were sent to people who responded to an open invitation. A total of 1230 participants filled out the sleep questionnaire, 812 responded to the anxiety questionnaire, and 814 responded to the depression questionnaire. Both men and women reported poor sleep quality, but women showed a higher proportion (79%) than men (60%); young women were more likely to be affected by social isolation. Concerning anxiety and depression, both sexes reported high similar symptoms. These data suggest that stressful conditions related to social isolation and the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic may induce mental health disturbances, which may become worse with sleep restriction.","Terán-Pérez, Guadalupe; Portillo-Vásquez, Angelica; Arana-Lechuga, Yoaly; Sánchez-Escandón, Oscar; Mercadillo-Caballero, Roberto; González-Robles, Rosa Obdulia; Velázquez-Moctezuma, Javier",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33801928/,77
682557,The Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan: an evolution to the approach for national communicable disease emergencies,2004-06-30,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a rise in healthcare demands leading to significant restructuring of hospital emergency departments worldwide. The aim of the present study is twofold: firstly, to discern any differences in regard to reason for surgical emergency department (SED) attendance and hospital admission during the pandemic and pre-pandemic eras in Greece, and secondly, to assess the impact of the lockdown measures implemented during the pandemic on SED patient attendance. METHODS: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece (1 March 2020) and up to 15 December 2020, the charts of all adult patients arriving at the SED of the third surgical department of the “Attikon” University Hospital (a tertiary referral center for surgical and COVID-19 cases) were retrospectively reviewed and broken down in four periods reflecting two nationwide lockdown (period A 1/3/2020 to 30/4/2020 and period D 16/10/2020 to 15/12/2020) and two interim (period B 1/5/2020 to 15/6/2020 and period C 15/9/2020 to 30/10/2020) periods. Demographic and clinical data were compared to those obtained from the same time periods of the year 2019. RESULTS: The total number of patients attending the SED decreased by 35.9% during the pandemic (from 2839 total patients in 2019 to 1819 in 2020). During the first lockdown, there was statistically significant reduction of motor vehicle accidents (p=0.04) and torso injuries (p=0.01). Contrarily, the rate of head injuries (p<0.001) and abdominal pain (p=0.04) were significantly increased. The same effect was observed regarding the rate of hospital admissions (p=0.002), although in terms of absolute numbers, admissions remained unchanged. During the second lockdown, there was a reduction in the number of perianal abscess cases (p=0.04) and hernia-related problems (p=0.001). An increase in the rate of fall injuries was also demonstrable (p=0.02). Overall, application of the lockdown led to a significant decrease in minor (p<0.001) and torso (p=0.001) injuries. CONCLUSION: The burden of the new COVID-19 disease has left a noticeable imprint in the function of emergency departments worldwide. In Greece, SED attendance was significantly reduced during the pandemic, an effect that was even more pronounced during the lockdown implementation; nevertheless, the overall rate of hospital admissions remained the same, denoting that patient care was not altered.","Pikoulis, Emmanouil; Koliakos, Nikolaos; Papaconstantinou, Dimitrios; Pararas, Nikolaos; Pikoulis, Andreas; Fotios-Christos, Stavratis; Nastos, Constantinos; Bagias, Georgios; Boutati, Eleni; Coccolini, Federico; Catena, Fausto",World J Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962622/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13017-021-00364-1,77

684093,Obituary for Professor Dr. Jan Evangelista Dyr,2021-04-15,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome with increased morbidity and mortality due to multiorgan involvement. COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), ranging from asymptomatic to potentially fatal presentations. Predictors of VTE in COVID-19 are not fully defined, and the role of anticoagulation in these patients is debatable. Here we discuss two cases of COVID-19, who initially presented with mild COVID-19 symptoms and later with potentially fatal VTE within 30 days of initial presentation. The first case is of a 42-year-old gentleman with a history of sarcoidosis and a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia who was in isolation at home and presented with syncope and worsening shortness of breath. He was hemodynamically unstable and resuscitated with fluid management in the emergency department. The chest angiogram imaging studies showed massive pulmonary embolism with right heart strain, which was confirmed with bedside point-of-care ultrasound. The patient deteriorated clinically and received an intravenous tissue plasminogen activator in the emergency. He was discharged home under stable condition on oral anticoagulation. The second patient is a 63-year-old gentleman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, sleep apnea, and a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, which was complicated with an ischemic stroke, who presented with worsening complaints of shortness of breath and palpitation. The chest angiogram imaging showed bilateral pulmonary embolism. An echocardiogram showed mild right heart strain. The lower extremity duplex ultrasound showed bilateral deep vein thrombosis. The patient underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis and discharged on oral anticoagulation. There is a need to develop stronger predictors to provide thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 pneumonia to prevent life-threatening VTE.","Chopra, Siddharth; Kaur, Jasmeet; Kaur, Mehrvaan",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104583/,77

Single blue dye technique for sentinel lymph node biopsy during the COVID pandemic,2021-05-31,"Objectives: Our objective was to explore the incidence and early predictive factors of acute kidney injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Method: We established a retrospective cohort of 408 patients who were admitted to Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, between January 1 and March 31, 2020. Clinical outcomes and renal function were monitored until April 12, 2020, with a median follow-up duration of 21 days [interquartile range (IQR) = 14–33]. Results: When first admitted to hospital (baseline), 19.36% (79/408) presented renal dysfunction [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 ml/min/1.73 m(2)]. During follow-up, 3.9% (16/408) developed acute kidney injury (AKI). Age ≥60 years [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.78, 95% CI = 1.10–20.69], PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio <300 (HR = 3.48, 95% CI = 1.04–11.62), and higher creatinine (HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01–1.07) at baseline independently predicted the risk of AKI. Respectively, 25.0% (102/408), 3.9% (16/408), 0.5% (2/408), 1.0% (4/408), and 0.2% (1/408) experienced G2, G3a, G3b, G4, and G5 as their most severe category during hospitalization, while 69.4% (283/408) had normal eGFRs throughout the follow-up period. When finally discharged from hospital, there were 12.5% (51/408) of patients with abnormal eGFRs. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients can be at risk of AKI and continuous eGFR decline during hospitalization, which can be early predicted by baseline factors.

To understand industry sectors impacted by workplace outbreaks in the first wave of the pandemic, and the additional burden of illness through household transmission, we analyzed public health declared workplace outbreaks between January 21 to June 30, 2020, and their associated cases from January 21 to July 28. MethodsNumber, size and duration of outbreaks were described by sector, and outbreak cases were compared to sporadic cases in the same time frame. Address matching identified household cases with onset [â¥]2 days before, [â¥]2 days after, or within 1 day of the workplace outbreak case. ResultsThere were 199 outbreaks with 1245 cases, and 68% of outbreaks and 80% of cases belonged to i) Manufacturing, ii) Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, Hunting, iii) Transportation and Warehousing. Median size of outbreaks was 3 cases (range: 1-140), and lasted median 7days (range: 0-119). Outbreak cases were significantly more likely to be male, younger, healthier, and have better outcomes. There were 608 household cases associated with 339 (31%) outbreak cases with valid addresses, increasing the burden of illness by 56%. The majority of household cases (368, 60%) occurred after the outbreak case. ConclusionsWorkplace outbreaks primarily occurred in three sectors. COVID-19 prevention measures should target industry sectors at risk by preventing introduction from exposed employees, spread in the workplace, and spread outside of the workplace. What is already known about this topic?COVID-19 outbreaks occur within workplaces and can spread to the community What is added by this report?From January 21 - June 30, 2020, there were 199 workplace outbreaks in Ontario, Canada; 68% of outbreaks and 80% of outbreak-associated COVID-19 case were in three industry sectors: Manufacturing, Agriculture/Forestry/Fishing/Hunting, and Transportation/Warehousing. Household transmission occurred among 31% of outbreak cases, resulting in a 56% increase in workplace outbreak-associated cases when burden of household transmission is considered.

This study, therefore, explored the healthy behaviors of Nigerians during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of COVID-19 related news on healthy behaviors. Thirty-three (17 females and 16 males) participants from the general Nigerian population with age range of 23-64 years were recruited via social media using the snowball technique. Responses were elicited using semi-structured questions and subjected to thematic analysis. The healthy behaviors identified included; social distancing, changes in nutrition, hand washing or sanitizing, exercise, increased vigilance from those with comorbidities, and use of facemask. In another analysis, the impacts of COVID-19 related news on healthy behaviors were; behavior modification, anxious impacts, and fake news about COVID-19 caused people to stop listening to COVID-19 related news. Findings generated practical implications for enhancing healthy behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Blood examination revealed an increased creatine kinase (CK) level, and his urinary dipstick tested positive for blood, indicative of acute rhabdomyolysis. Serum creatinine levels were normal. Rhabdomyolysis due to strenuous physical activity was ruled out and further diagnostics excluded an autoimmune cause. Under repeated treatment with intravenous fluid resuscitation (outpatient treatment), his symptoms resolved and peak CK levels of 44,180 U/L returned to almost normal levels within two weeks. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare, potentially fatal vaccine-induced reaction. Further research is needed to better understand the underlying pathomechanism and to investigate whether subcutaneous injection of vaccines may be able to prevent rhabdomyolysis.","Gelbenegger, Georg; Cacioppo, Filippo; Firbas, Christa; Jilma, Bernd",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9090956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579193/,77

Late referral to higher levels of care may be one of the factors associated with higher mortality. Therefore, we aimed to find simple demographic and laboratory parameters which predict the requirement of admission to a critical care unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case–control study was undertaken in adult age population >18 years, admitted in a dedicated COVID hospital in South India. A total of 50 patients with severe disease (cases) were compared with 143 mild or asymptomatic cases (controls). Those demographic and laboratory parameters that were found to be significant on univariate analysis were used for multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Univariate analysis of demographic and laboratory data showed higher age, male sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, higher values of C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer, neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and lactate dehydrogenase to be significantly associated with cases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of these significant variables showed NLR and ferritin to be the independent predictors of the requirement of admission to a critical care unit. The receiver-operating characteristic curve showed an NLR value of 5.2 and a ferritin value of 462 μg/L that were able to predict the requirement of admission in critical care units. CONCLUSION: High ferritin and NLR were independent predictors of the requirement of admission in critical care units. NLR is a simple tool that can be used in resource-limited settings for triage and early referral to higher levels of care.

687717,Great future or greedy venture: Precision medicine needs philosophy,2021-09-14,"NmrA-like proteins are NAD(P)(H) interacting molecules whose structures are similar to that of short-chain dehydrogenases. In this review, we focus on an NADP(H) sensor, HSCARG (also named NMRAL1), which is a NmrA-like protein that is widely present in mammals, and provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge of its structure and physiological functions. HSCARG selectively binds to the reduced form of type II coenzyme NADPH via its Rossmann fold domain. In response to reduction of intracellular NADPH concentration, HSCARG transforms from homodimer to monomer and exhibits enhanced interactions with its binding partners. In the cytoplasm, HSCARG negatively regulates innate immunity through impairing the activities of NF-κB and RLR pathways. Besides, HSCARG regulates redox homeostasis via suppression of ROS and NO generation. Intensive and persistent oxidative stress leads to translocation of HSCARG from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it regulates the DNA damage response. Taken together, HSCARG functions as a linkage between cellular redox status and other signaling pathways and fine-tunes cellular response to redox changes.","Zang, Weicheng; Zheng, Xiaofeng",Free Radic Biol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32950687/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584920312533?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891584920312533; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.09.016,77

It may be feasible to extract pharmacogenomic (PGx) information from biorepositories for clinical use. We sought to characterize the potential value of multigene PGx testing among individuals hospitalized with COVID‐19 in the United States. We performed a cross‐sectional analysis of electronic health records from consecutive individuals hospitalized with COVID‐19 at a large, urban academic health system. We characterized medication orders, focusing on medications with actionable PGx guidance related to 14 commonly assayed genes (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, DPYD, G6PD, HLA‐A, HLA‐B, IFNL3, NUDT15, SLCO1B1, TPMT, UGT1A1, and VKORC1). A simulation analysis combined medication data with population phenotype frequencies to estimate how many treatment modifications would be enabled if multigene PGx results were available. Sixty‐four unique medications with PGx guidance were ordered at least once in the cohort (n = 1,852, mean age 60.1 years). Nearly nine in 10 individuals (89.7%) had at least one order for a medication with PGx guidance and 427 patients (23.1%) had orders for 4 or more actionable medications. Using a simulation, we estimated that 17 treatment modifications per 100 patients would be enabled if PGx results were available. The genes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 were responsible for the majority of treatment modifications, and the medications most often affected were ondansetron, oxycodone, and clopidogrel. PGx results would be relevant for nearly all individuals hospitalized with COVID‐19 and would provide the opportunity to improve clinical care.","Stevenson, James M.; Alexander, G.

Secondary metabolites are produced by plants as ecological chemical mediators, and can therefore possess intrinsic physiological properties against other organisms. These benefits are far from being fully explored. In particular, attention is here focused on the multipurpose neem tree (Azadirachta indica), reporting several experiments of applications in the field of seed oil and neem cake. The latter product seems to be promising because of the low cost, the possible production on a large scale, and the selection of effects in favor of beneficial organisms. Neem cake is able to act on different sites, as required by integrated pest management. Several utilizations of neem products are reported and their potentiality evidenced. Some considerations in this chapter may appear distant from the title of the book, but only by applying the general natural rules can the reason of the single phenomenon be understood. Other studies on resistance mechanisms of Plasmodium are enabling new possible methods of control always based on natural products activity.","Nicoletti, Marcello",Insect-Borne Diseases in the 21st Century,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128187067000073; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128187067000073,77

As such, a successful and sustainable return to sport will require extensive modifications to the current operations of sporting organizations. In this article we argue that methods from the realm of sociotechnical systems (STS) theory are highly suited for this purpose. The aim of the study was to use such methods to develop a model of an Australian Football League (AFL) club’s football department. The intention was to identify potential modifications to the club’s operations to support a return to competition following the COVID-19 crisis. Subject Matter Experts from an AFL club participated in three online workshops to develop Work Domain Analysis and Social Organization and Cooperation Analysis models. The results demonstrated the inherent complexity of an AFL football department via numerous interacting values, functions and processes influencing the goals of the system. Conflicts within the system were captured via the modeling and included pursing goals that may not fully reflect the state of the system, a lack of formal assessment of core values, overlapping functions and objects, and an overemphasis on specialized roles. The current analysis has highlighted potential areas for modification in the football department, and sports performance departments in general.","McLean, Scott; Rath, David; Lethlean, Simon; Hornsby, Matt; Gallagher, James; Anderson, Dean; Salmon, Paul M.",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.588959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551908/,77

The Department of Laboratory Medicine of La Paz University Hospital in Madrid (LMD-HULP) was designated to provide laboratory services. Due to the emergency, the IFEMA field hospital had to be prepared for patient admission in less than 1 week and the laboratory professionals had to collaborate in a multidisciplinary group to assure that resources were available to start on time. The LMD-HULP participated together with the managers in the design of the tests portfolio and the integration of the healthcare information systems (IS) (hospital IS, laboratory IS and POCT management system). Laboratorians developed a strategy to quickly train clinicians and nurses on test requests, sample collection procedures and management/handling of the POCT blood gas analyser both by written materials and training videos. The IFEMA´s preanalytical unit managed 3782 requests, and more than 11,000 samples from March 27th to April 30th. Furthermore, 1151 samples were measured by blood gas analysers. In conclusion, laboratory professionals must be resilient and have to respond timely in emergencies as this pandemic. The lab’s personnel selection, design and monitoring indicators to maintain and further improve the quality and value of laboratory services is crucial to support medical decision making and provide better patient care.","Díaz–Garzón, Jorge; Oliver, Paloma; Crespo, Gema; Duque, Marta; Fernandez-Calle, Pilar; Gómez, Marta; Mora, Roberto; Moreno, Isabel; Pascual, Lydia; Qasem, Ana-Laila; Rodriguez-Fraga, Olaia; Simón, Manuela; Buño, Antonio",Biochem Med (Zagreb),https://doi.org/10.11613/bm.2020.030403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071554/,77
