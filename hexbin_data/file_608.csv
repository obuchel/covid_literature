11082,The performance of biological and tertiary wastewater treatment procedures for rotaviruses A removal,2019-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Bubble continuous positive airway pressure is an established therapy for infants in respiratory distress. In resource-limited settings, few treatment options exist for infants requiring further respiratory support. A bubble bilevel device has been developed to provide nonelectric, time-cycled, pressure-limited respiratory support. We compared the efficacy of bubble bilevel ventilation with conventional mechanical ventilation in sedated rabbits. METHODS: Six adult rabbits under inhaled isoflurane general anesthesia were ventilated by alternating intervals of conventional and bubble bilevel ventilation for three 10−15-min periods. During each period, interval arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements were obtained after at least 10 min on the respective mode of ventilation. RESULTS: The bubble bilevel system was able to deliver the following pressures: 20/7, 15/5, 12/5, 8/5 cm H(2)O. The estimated differences in arterial blood gas values on bubble bilevel vs. ventilator were as follows (normalized values): pH 7.41 vs. 7.40, pCO(2) 37.7 vs. 40, pO(2) 97.6 vs. 80. In addition, the bubble bilevel ventilation delivered consistent pressure waveforms without interruption for over 60 min on two rabbits. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates promising in vivo results on the efficacy of a novel bubble bilevel device, which may prove useful for infants in respiratory distress. IMPACT: Given the lack of personnel, funds or infrastructure to provide neonatal mechanical ventilation in resource-limited settings, additional low-cost, low-tech treatments are necessary to save infant lives. Bubble bilevel ventilation reliably delivers two levels of airway pressure to anesthetized rabbits resulting in normalization of blood gases comparable to those achieved on a traditional ventilator. If proven effective, simple technologies like this device have the potential to significantly impact neonatal mortality due to respiratory distress globally.","John, Stephen C.; Mohammed, Azmath; Church, Joseph T.; John, Anna V.; Perkins, Elena M.; McLeod, Jennifer S.; Carr, Benjamin D.; Smith, Sue; Barnett, Joseph; Gustafson, Peter A.; Dick, Macdonald; John, Sunil P.",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223040/,608
15524,Alleviating Cr(VI) stress in horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum Var. Madhu) by native Cr-tolerant nodule endophytes isolated from contaminated site of Sukinda,2021-02-20,"Peptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRRT) has evolved as an important second-line treatment option in the management of inoperable and metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN). Though high radiation doses can be delivered to the tumors, complete remission is still rare. Radiosensitization prior to PRRT is therefore considered to be a promising strategy to improve the treatment effect. In this study, effect and mechanism of mTOR inhibitors were investigated in a comprehensive panel of five NEN cell lines (BON, QGP-1, LCC-18, H727, UMC-11), employing assays for cellular proliferation, clonogenic survival, cell cycle modification and signaling. mTOR inhibition lead to growth arrest with a biphasic concentration-response pattern: a partial response at approximately 1 nM and full response at micromolar concentrations (8–48 µM). All cell lines demonstrated elevated p70S6K phosphorylation yet also increased phosphorylation of counterregulatory Akt. The pulmonary NEN cell line UMC-11 showed the lowest induction of phospho-Akt and strongest growth arrest by mTOR inhibitors. Radiation sensitivity of the cells (50% reduction versus control) was found to range between 4 and 8 Gy. Further, mTOR inhibition was employed together with irradiation to evaluate radiosensitizing effects of this combination treatment. mTOR inhibition was found to radiosensitize all five NEN cells in an additive manner with a moderate overall effect. The radiation-induced G2/M arrest was diminished under combination treatment, leading to an increased G1 arrest. Further investigation involving a suitable animal model as well as radioligand application such as (177)Lu-DOTATATE or (177)Lu-DOTATOC will have to demonstrate the full potential of this strategy for radiosensitization in NEN.","Exner, Samantha; Arrey, Gerard; Prasad, Vikas; Grötzinger, Carsten",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7897674/,608
16136,"A study on the relationships of place attachment and individual attributes of residents in different vulnerable districts in Taipei, Taiwan",2021-03-13,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are a promising immunotherapy that specifically target and kill cancer cells and stimulate anti-tumor immunity. While different OVs are endowed with distinct features, which enhance their specificity towards tumor cells; attributes of the cancer cell also critically contribute to this specificity. Such features comprise defects in innate immunity, including antiviral responses, and the metabolic reprogramming of the malignant cell. The tumorigenic features which support OV replication can be intrinsic to the transformation process (e.g., a direct consequence of the activity of a given oncogene), or acquired in the course of tumor immunoediting—the selection process applied by antitumor immunity. Oncogene-induced epigenetic silencing plays an important role in negative regulation of immunostimulatory antiviral responses in the cancer cells. Reversal of such silencing may also provide a strong immunostimulant in the form of viral mimicry by activation of endogenous retroelements. Here we review features of the cancer cell that support viral replication, tumor immunoediting and the connection between oncogenic signaling, DNA methylation and viral oncolysis. As such, this review concentrates on the malignant cell, while detailed description of different OVs can be found in the accompanied reviews of this issue. ABSTRACT: Cell autonomous immunity genes mediate the multiple stages of anti-viral defenses, including recognition of invading pathogens, inhibition of viral replication, reprogramming of cellular metabolism, programmed-cell-death, paracrine induction of antiviral state, and activation of immunostimulatory inflammation. In tumor development and/or immunotherapy settings, selective pressure applied by the immune system results in tumor immunoediting, a reduction in the immunostimulatory potential of the cancer cell. This editing process comprises the reduced expression and/or function of cell autonomous immunity genes, allowing for immune-evasion of the tumor while concomitantly attenuating anti-viral defenses. Combined with the oncogene-enhanced anabolic nature of cancer-cell metabolism, this attenuation of antiviral defenses contributes to viral replication and to the selectivity of oncolytic viruses (OVs) towards malignant cells. Here, we review the manners by which oncogene-mediated transformation and tumor immunoediting combine to alter the intracellular milieu of tumor cells, for the benefit of OV replication. We also explore the functional connection between oncogenic signaling and epigenetic silencing, and the way by which restriction of such silencing results in immune activation. Together, the picture that emerges is one in which OVs and epigenetic modifiers are part of a growing therapeutic toolbox that employs activation of anti-tumor immunity for cancer therapy.","Ehrlich, Marcelo; Bacharach, Eran",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7956656/,608
16262,"Piperazine-substituted chalcones: a new class of MAO-B, AChE, and BACE-1 inhibitors for the treatment of neurological disorders",2021-03-20,"BACKGROUND: Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) is an opportunistic pathogen that infects immunodeficient children. The aim of the study is to determine the clinical features and peripheral immune state of Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) infections in children for early detection and diagnosis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 21 pediatric patients who were diagnosed with T. marneffei infections and were followed up in the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center from January 2010 to January 2020. For each patient, we collected and analyzed clinical characteristics, peripheral immunological results, genetic tests, complications and prognosis. RESULTS: Common clinical features of the patients included fever (20/21, 95.24%), cough (17/21, 80.95%) and hepatomegaly (17/21, 80.95%). Severe complications included septic shock (12/21, 57.14%), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) (11/21, 52.38%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (10/21, 47.62%), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (9/21, 42.86%), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (7/21, 33.33%). Eleven children (11/21, 52.38%) eventually died of T. marneffei infections. All patients were HIV negative. Seven cases revealed reduced antibody levels, especially IgG. Higher levels of IgE were detected in 9 cases with an obvious increase in two patients. Ten patients showed decreased complement C3 levels, some of whom had low C4 levels. Three patients displayed decreased absolute T lymphocyte counts, including the CD 4+ and CD 8+ subsets. A reduction in NK cells was present in most patients. No patient had positive nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) test results. Nine patients were screened for common genetic mutations. Of the cases, one case had no disease-specific gene mutation. Four children had confirmed hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome (HIGM) with CD40LG variation, one case had severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and one case had hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES). One patient was identified as having a heterozygous mutation in STAT3 gene; however, he showed no typical clinical manifestations of HIES at his age. One patient had a mutated COPA gene with uncertain pathogenic potential. Another patient was diagnosed with HIES that depended on her clinical features and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) scoring system. CONCLUSIONS: T. marneffei infections in HIV-negative children induced severe systemic complications and poor prognosis. Children with T. marneffei infections commonly exhibited abnormal immunoglobulin levels in peripheral blood, particularly decreased IgG or increased IgE levels, further suggesting possible underlying PIDs in these patients.

16659,Human beta-defensin-1 rs2738047 polymorphism is associated with shisha smoking risk among Saudi population,2021-04-07,"BACKGROUND: Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is an inflammatory condition of the kidney and its treatment most often involves a combination of antibiotics and nephrectomy. This study aimed to define the clinical features and management of XGP, focusing on microbiological aspects and antibiotic therapy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 27 cases of XGP diagnosed between January 2001 and January 2020 to analyse their clinical and management characteristics. In addition, a literature review was conducted of XGP case series covering the period from 2000–2020. We searched PubMed for case series through April 2020 without language restrictions. Studies reporting case series of XGP (more than ten cases) were included if they were relevant to this study. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were diagnosed with XGP, and 26 of them were histologically proven to have XGP. A total of 81.5% of the patients were female and the mean age was 59.6 years (SD 19.2). The most frequent symptoms were flank pain (70.4%) and fever (59.3%), while 77.8% of patients had renal stones. Proteus mirabilis was detected in the urine culture in 18.5% of patients, followed by detection of Escherichia coli in 14.8% of patients. The computed tomography (CT) findings included perirenal (29.6%) or pararenal (29.6%) involvement in the majority of patients. Twenty-six patients underwent nephrectomy. Piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriaxone were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for treatment. The reported piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriaxone resistance rates were 14.3% and 16.6%, respectively. Twenty-six case series were included in the literature review, reporting 693 cases in total. CONCLUSION: We found well-established characteristics of XGP patients among series in terms of previous history, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings, and operative and postoperative outcomes. It is important to know the clinical presentation and potential severity of XGP, as well as the most frequently involved microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance profiles, to select the most appropriate antibiotic therapy.

20156,Forecasting of China’s solar PV industry installed capacity and analyzing of employment effect: based on GRA-BiLSTM model,2021-08-19,"BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infection outbreaks are difficult to control and sometimes require cohorting of CRAB-positive patients or temporary ward closure for environmental cleaning. We aimed at controlling the deadly 2018 CRAB outbreak in a 12 bed- intensive care unit (ICU) including 9 beds in a 220 m(2) open space. We implemented a new multimodal approach without ward closure, cohorting or temporarily limiting admissions. METHODS: A five-component bundle was introduced in 2018 including reinforcement of hand hygiene and sample extension of screening, application of contact precautions to all patients, enhanced environmental sampling and the one-time application of a cycling radical environmental cleaning and disinfection procedure of the entire ICU. The ICU-CRAB incidence density (ID), ICU alcohol-based hand rub consumption and antibiotic use were calculated over a period of 6 years and intervention time series analysis was performed. Whole genome sequencing analysis (WGS) was done on clinical and environmental isolates in the study period. RESULTS: From January 2013, nosocomial ICU-CRAB ID decreased from 30.4 CRAB cases per 1000 patients-days to zero cases per 1000 patients-days. Our intervention showed a significant impact (-2.9 nosocomial ICU-CRAB cases per 1000 bed-days), while no influence was observed for antibiotic and alcohol-based hand rub (AHR) consumption. WGS demonstrated that CRAB strains were clonally related to an environmental reservoir which confirms the primary role of the environment in CRAB ICU spreading. CONCLUSION: A five-component bundle of continuous hand hygiene improvement, extended sampling at screening including the environment, universal contact precautions and a novel cycling radical environmental cleaning and disinfection procedure proved to be effective for permanently eliminating CRAB spreading within the ICU. Cohorting, admission restriction or ICU closure were avoided.

However, a review of literature reveals no blueprint to guide this systematically in practice. This Statement of Intent proposes how diverse trials may be integrated within or alongside Generation Victoria (GenV), a whole-of-state Australian birth cohort in planning, and delineates potential processes and opportunities. METHODS: Parents of all newborns (estimated 160,000) in the state of Victoria, Australia, will be approached for two full years from 2021. The cohort design comprises four elements: (1) consent soon after birth to follow the child and parent/s until study end or withdrawal; retrospective and prospective (2) linkage to clinical and administrative datasets and (3) banking of universal and clinical biosamples; and (4) GenV-collected biosamples and data. GenV-collected data will focus on overarching outcome and phenotypic measures using low-burden, universal-capable electronic interfaces, with funding-dependent face-to-face assessments tailored to universal settings during the early childhood, school and/or adult years. RESULTS: For population or registry-type trials within GenV, GenV will provide all outcomes data and consent via traditional, waiver, or Trials Within Cohorts models. Trials alongside GenV consent their own participants born within the GenV window; GenV may help identify potential participants via opt-in or opt-out expression of interest. Data sharing enriches trials with outcomes, prior data, and/or access to linked data contingent on custodian’s agreements, and supports modeling of causal effects to the population and between-trials comparisons of costs, benefits and utility. Data access will operate under the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) and Care and Five Safes Principles. We consider governance, ethical and shared trial oversight, and expectations that trials will adhere to the best practice of the day. CONCLUSIONS: Children and younger adults can access fewer trials than older adults. Integrating trials into mega-cohorts should improve health and well-being by generating faster, larger-scale evidence on a longer and/or broader horizon than previously possible. GenV will explore the limits and details of this approach over the coming years.","Wake, Melissa; Hu, Yanhong Jessika; Warren, Hayley; Danchin, Margie; Fahey, Michael; Orsini, Francesca; Pacilli, Maurizio; Perrett, Kirsten P.; Saffery, Richard; Davidson, Andrew",BMC Med Res Methodol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7512047/,608

44272,Evaluating the sustainability of big data centers using the analytic network process and fuzzy TOPSIS,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Growing recognition of the importance of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a substantial expansion of testing from symptomatic to asymptomatic patients, and particularly those with risk factors for infection. Viral burden in asymptomatic individuals can differ from symptomatic patients, which can impact test performance. We therefore evaluated the impact of expanded testing indications upon the sensitivity and specificity of molecular diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of laboratory results from 5,122 emergency room patients and inpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 05/03/2020 and 06/13/2020 using the Hologic Panther Fusion and the Cepheid Xpert assays at the Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA. Descriptive analyses were performed for trends in testing volume, rates of positivity and cycle thresholds (Cts) over time based on symptom status. We calculated the proportion of new diagnoses made on a patient’s first test as an indirect measure of sensitivity. We calculated the proportion of first tests that are positive with a Ct value < 35 as an indirect measure of specificity. RESULTS: The overall rate of positivity over the study period was 8.7% (599/7,510 tests; 440/4,795 people) and declined by 1.8% (95% CI -2.2% - -1.4%, P< 0.0001) each week. Relative to tests in symptomatic people, the asymptomatic population had a higher mean Ct value (35.1 vs 32.3; P < 0.0001). Ct values increased by 0.7 (95% CI -0.1 - +1.4, P=0.07) and 0.8 (95% CI +0.3 - +1.4; p=0.01), sensitivity declined by 4% (95% CI -9% - +1%, P=0.08) and 12% (95% CI -20% - -5%, P-0.01) and specificity declined by 8% (95% CI -3% to 20%; P=0.13) and 9% (95% CI 7% - 11%; P=0.0002), over the time period of the study for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, respectively. Figure 1: Trends in Ct values by symptoms [Image: see text] Figure 2: Trends in diagnosis by first versus second test by symptoms [Image: see text] Figure 3: Trends in proportion of people with their first test having Ct < 35 by symptoms [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: We show that the proportion of patients with low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads has increased as testing has expanded to the asymptomatic population and as transmission wanes in the community. This negatively impacts the performance of molecular assays by increasing the risk of false negatives and the detection of non-viable virus. Decision algorithms based on molecular assay results may need re-evaluation in light of these dynamics.

Recently, the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide, as many patients have required hospitalization for the management of respiratory failure similar in nature to ARDS. In addition to lung-protective ventilation strategies aimed to maintain an oxygen saturation >90%, a ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen >200, a pH of 7.25-7.40, and a plateau pressure <35 cm H2 O, prone positioning has emerged as an effective treatment strategy for severe ARDS by improving oxygenation and secretion clearance.

332080,Detection and removal of microplastics in wastewater: evolution and impact,2021,"Abnormal aortic adventitial fibroblasts (AFs) play essential roles in the development of vascular remodeling and disorders. Previous studies revealed that microRNA-122 (miR-122) levels were elevated in the aortic adventitia of hypertensive rats with vascular injury. Here, we aim to evaluate the biological effects and underlying mechanisms of miR-122 in rat AFs. Exposure to angiotensin II (ATII) in rat AFs resulted in decreased levels of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), elabela (ELA), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Additionally, stimulation with ATII contributed to a decline in autophagic flux and obvious increases in cellular migration, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, which were exacerbated by the transfection of miR-122-5p mimic but were rescued by miR-122-5p inhibitor, exogenous replenishment of ELA, and recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing SIRT6 (rAAV-SIRT6), respectively. Moreover, stimulation with miR-122-5p mimic led to a marked reduction in the levels of SIRT6 and ELA in rat AFs, which were elevated by stimulation with rAAV-SIRT6. Furthermore, miR-122-5p inhibitor-mediated pro-autophagic, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects in rat AFs were partially suppressed by 3-methyladenine, SIRT6 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and ELA siRNA, which were linked with the downregulation in the protein levels of LC3-II, beclin-1, and ACE2 and the upregulation of p62 expression and bax/bcl-2 ratio. Our findings indicated that miR-122-5p inhibition prevented ATII-mediated loss of autophagy, and the promotion of apoptosis and oxidative stress via activating the SIRT6-ELA-ACE2 signaling. MiR-122-5p may be a novel predictive biomarker of adventitial injury, and targeting the SIRT6-ELA-ACE2 signaling may have the potential therapeutic importance of controlling vascular remodeling and disorders.","Song, Juan-Juan; Yang, Mei; Liu, Ying; Song, Jia-Wei; Wang, Juan; Chi, Hong-Jie; Liu, Xiao-Yan; Zuo, Kun; Yang, Xin-Chun; Zhong, Jiu-Chang",Eur J Pharmacol,,608

From these patients, the demographic data, symptoms, cardiac biomarkers, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Four patients in the non-survivor group were selected, and their cardiac biomarkers were collected and analyzed. Among the 148 patients, the incidence of cardiovascular complications was 19 (12.8%). Five of them were survivors (5.2%), and 14 of them were non-survivors (26.9%). Compared with the survivors, the non-survivors had higher levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB, myoglobin, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (P < 0.05). The occurrence of cardiovascular events began at 11-15 days after the onset of the disease and reached a peak at 14-20 days. COVID-19 not only is a respiratory disease but also causes damage to the cardiovascular system. Cardiac biomarkers have the potential for early warning and prognostic evaluation in patients with COVID-19. It is recommended that cardiac biomarker monitoring in patients with COVID-19 should be initiated at least from the 11th day of the disease course.","Tuo, Hu; Li, Wenjing; Tang, Lizhen; He, Bing; Yao, Baozhen; Mao, Ping; Tang, Qizhu",Int Heart J,,608

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) have been described to be highly increased during COVID-19, however, their role remains elusive. We performed an in depth analysis of MDSC in 128 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSC expanded during COVID-19, in particular in patients who required intensive care treatments, and correlated with IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&#945; plasma levels. PMN-MDSC inhibited T-cells IFN-Î³ production upon SARS-CoV-2 peptides stimulation, through TGF-ß- and iNOS-mediated mechanisms, possibly contrasting virus elimination. Accordingly, a multivariate regression analysis found a strong association between PMN-MDSC percentage and fatal outcome of the disease. The PMN-MDSC frequency was higher in non-survivors than survivors at the admission time, followed by a decreasing trend. Interestingly, this trend was associated with IL-6 increase in non-survivors but not in survivors. In conclusion, this study indicates PMN-MDSC as a novel factor in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection, and open up to new therapeutic options.","Sacchi, Alessandra; Grassi, Germana; Bordoni, Veronica; Lorenzini, Patrizia; Cimini, Eleonora; Casetti, Rita; Tartaglia, Eleonora; Marchioni, Luisa; Petrosillo, Nicola; Palmieri, Fabrizio; D039,; Offizi, Gianpiero; Notari, Stefania; Tempestilli, Massimo; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Nicastri, Emanuele; Maeurer, Markus; Zumla, Alimuddin; Locatelli, Franco; Antinori, Andrea; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Agrati, Chiara",Cell Death Dis,,608

Precisely, we move from the idea that the volume of Google searches about""coronavirus""can be considered as a proxy of the anxiety and, jointly with the stock index prices, can be used to produce mood indicators -- in terms of pessimism and optimism -- at country level. We analyse the""very high human developed countries""according to the Human Development Index plus China and their respective main stock market indexes. Namely, we propose both a temporal and a global measure of pessimism and optimism and provide accordingly a classification of indexes and countries. The results show the existence of different clusters of countries and markets in terms of pessimism and optimism. Moreover, specific regimes along the time emerge, with an increasing optimism spreading during the mid of June 2020. Furthermore, countries with different government responses to the pandemic have experienced different levels of mood indicators, so that countries with less strict lockdown had a higher level of optimism.","Cerqueti, Roy; Ficcadenti, Valerio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01649v1.pdf,608

Drawing on a longitudinal case study of the interaction between social enterprises operating in emerging economy settings, it uncovers factors which influence the transfer of a social innovation from a dense, population-rich setting to one where beneficiaries are geographically dispersed and the costs of service delivery are correspondingly elevated. Evidence from the case study suggests that institutional bricolage—the crafting of improvised solutions in resource-constrained settings—can serve as potent driving force in driving innovation transfer, and that this process of re-combining available resources may be facilitated by the extent to which the values between partner social enterprises are aligned. With such alignment, social enterprise partners may be able to increase trust, develop a smoother knowledge-transfer process, and find practical solutions which facilitate the transfer of life-enhancing social innovations to neglected rural settings.","Chowdhury, Imran",Agric Human Values,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041500/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10460-020-10132-7,608

In one case-patient, SARS-CoV persisted in stool for at least 26 days after symptom onset. The highest amounts of virus were in the day-14 sputum sample and a day-14 stool sample. Residual respiratory symptoms were still present in recovered SARS case-patients 2 months after illness onset. Possible transmission of SARS-CoV occurred in one household contact, but this person had also traveled to a SARS-affected area. The data suggest that SARS-CoV is not always transmitted efficiently.

Ils appartiennent au genre Betacoronavirus et sont génétiquement très différents d’autres HCoV incluant les HCoV-229E et -NL63. De plus, il a été décrit que l’épidémiologie et la symptomatologie associées à leurs infections différent de celle des autres HCoV. Depuis 2017, nous réalisons au laboratoire de microbiologie et virologie clinique de notre centre hospitalo-universitaire (CHU) l’identification des HCoVs. Nous décrivons ici les caractéristiques épidémiologiques et cliniques des infections à HCoV-OC43 diagnostiquées au cours des trois dernières années. Matériels et méthodes Les prélèvements respiratoires testés pour la présence du HCoV-OC43 ont été ceux adressés de janvier 2017 à décembre 2019 pour recherche de virus respiratoire au laboratoire de diagnostic microbiologique et virologique de notre CHU. Le diagnostic de HCoV-OC43 a été réalisé par PCR en temps réel avec les trousses FTD Respiratory pathogens 21 (Fast Track Diagnosis, Luxembourg) ou Biofire Filmarray Respiratory panel 2 plus (Biomérieux, France). Résultats Un total de 16 357 prélèvements respiratoires de 11 976 patients ont été testés au cours de la période de l’étude (3 ans). Un HCoV a été détecté dans 554 prélèvements (3,4 %) obtenus de 483 patients (4 %). HCoV-OC43 a été détecté dans 157 prélèvements (1,0 % ; 29 % de ceux HCoV-positifs) de 136 patients (1,1 % ; 28 % des patients HCoV-positifs) : 66 femmes et 70 hommes (sex-ratio H :F=1,1). L’âge moyen des patients HCoV-OC43-positifs était de 36±34 ans (min.–max. : 0–97 ans) avec respectivement 26 (19 %), 26 (19 %), 7 (5 %), 4 (3 %), 9 (7 %), 23 (17 %), 17 (12 %) et 24 (18 %) patients de<1, 1–5, 5–15, 15–25, 25–45, 45–65, 65–75 et>75 ans. Deux pics d’incidence ont été observés en octobre 2017 lorsqu’ils ont représenté 83 % des infections à HCoV et en septembre-octobre 2018 (81 %). Douze patients HCoV-OC43-positifs (9 %) ont été admis en réanimation. Trois (2,2 %) sont décédés : une femme de 95 ans institutionnalisée ayant présenté une pneumopathie sans co-infection, un nourrisson de 10 mois ayant présenté hypoxie d’étiologie inconnue, et un homme de 77 ans ayant présenté une pneumopathie sur cancer pulmonaire et co-infecté par Streptococcus pneumoniae. Conclusion Cette large série de cas montre que les HCoV-OC43 sont dans notre CHU une cause non négligeable d’infections respiratoires touchant particulièrement les âges extrêmes et pour lesquelles il n’existe pas actuellement de médicament actif approuvé. Ces résultats justifient d’inclure systématiquement dans le diagnostic des infections respiratoires le dépistage et l’identification des HCoV-OC43 qui restent des virus négligés. Ceci permettra de mieux caractériser l’épidémiologie, la symptomatologie, les co-infections et la mortalité associés à leurs infections.","Boschi, C.; Dambo, M.; Aubry, C.; Chaudet, H.; Zandotti, C.; Parola, P.; Ninove, L.; Raoult, D.; La Scola, B.; Colson, P.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0399077X20305138; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0399077X20305138,608
631157,A bibliometric and visualized analysis of research progress and frontiers on health effects caused by PM(2.5),2021-04-28,"Background: New emerging infections have no known treatment. Assessing potential drugs for safety and efficacy enables clinicians to make evidence-based treatment decisions, and contributes to overall outbreak control. However, it is difficult to launch clinical trials in the unpredictable environment of an outbreak. We conducted a bibliometric systematic review for the 2009 influenza pandemic to determine the speed, and quality of evidence generation for treatments. This informs approaches to high-quality evidence generation in this and future pandemics. Methods: We searched PubMed for all clinical data (including clinical trial, observational and case series) describing treatment for patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and ClinicalTrials.gov for research that aimed to enrol patients with the disease. Results: 33869 treatment courses for patients hospitalised with A(H1N1)pdm09 were detailed in 160 publications. Most were retrospective observational studies or case series. 592 patients received treatment (or placebo) as participants in a registered interventional clinical trial with results publicly available. None of these registered trial results were available during the timeframe of the pandemic, and the median date of publication was 213 days after the Public Health Emergency of International Concern ended. Conclusion: Patients were frequently treated for pandemic influenza with drugs not registered for this indication, but rarely under circumstances of high-quality data capture. The result was a reliance on use under compassionate circumstances, resulting in continued uncertainty regarding the potential benefits and harms of anti-viral treatment. Rapid scaling of clinical trials is critical for generating a quality evidence base during pandemics.","Rojek, A.; Martin, G.; Horby, P.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.20094839; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.20094839v1?rss=1,608

However, the accuracy of rapid antigen tests in real-life clinical settings is unclear because adequately designed diagnostic accuracy studies are essentially lacking. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid antigen test to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in a primary/ secondary care testing facility. METHODS: Consecutive individuals presented at a COVID-19 testing facility affiliated to a Swiss University Hospital were recruited (n=1’465%). Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained, and the Roche/ SD Biosensor rapid antigen test was conducted in-parallel with two real-time PCR (reference standard). RESULTS: Among 1’465 patients recruited, RT-PCR was positive in 141 individuals, corresponding to a prevalence of prevalence 9.6%. The Roche/ SD Biosensor rapid antigen test was positive in 94 patients (6.4%), and negative in 1’368 individuals (93.4%). The overall sensitivity of the rapid antigen test was 65.3% (95% confidence interval, CI, 56.8, 73.1), the specificity was 99.9% (95%CI 99.5, 100.0). In asymptomatic individuals, the sensitivity was 44.0% (95%CI 24.4, 65.1). CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic accuracy of the SARS-CoV-2 Roche/SD Biosensor rapid antigen test to diagnose a SARS-CoV-2 infection in a primary/ secondary care testing facility was considerably lower compared to manufacturers’ data.

Here, we evaluated a pooling method to determine if this could improve screening efficiency and reduce costs while maintaining accuracy in Guangzhou, China. We evaluated 8097 throat swap samples collected from individuals who came for a health check-up or fever clinic in The Third Affiliated Hospital, Southern Medical University between March 4, 2020 and April 26, 2020. Samples were screened for CoViD-19 infection using the WHO-approved quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) primers. The positive samples were classified into two groups (high or low) based on viral load in accordance with the CT value of COVID-19 RT-qPCR results. Each positive RNA samples were mixed with COVID-19 negative RNA or ddH2O to form RNA pools. Samples with high viral load could be detected in pool negative samples (up to 1/1000 dilution fold). In contrast, the detection of RNA sample from positive patients with low viral load in a pool was difficult and not repeatable. Our results show that the COVID-19 viral load significantly influences in pooling efficacy. COVID-19 has distinct viral load profile which depends on the timeline of infection. Thus, application of pooling for infection surveillance may lead to false negatives and hamper infection control efforts.","Gan, Y.; Du, L.; Damola, F.

Wearing a mask will significantly alter the airflow and particle dynamics near the face, which can change the inhalability of ambient particles. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of wearing a surgical mask on inspiratory airflow and dosimetry of airborne, virus-laden aerosols on the face and in the respiratory tract. A computational model was developed that comprised a pleated surgical mask, a face model, and an image-based upper airway geometry. The viral load in the nose was particularly examined with and without a mask. Results show that when breathing without a mask, air enters the mouth and nose through specific paths. When wearing a mask, however, air enters the mouth and nose through the entire surface of the mask at lower speeds, which favors the inhalation of ambient aerosols into the nose. With a 65% filtration efficiency (FE) typical for a three-layer surgical mask, wearing a mask reduces dosimetry for all micrometer particles except those of size 1 µm–3 µm, for which equivalent dosimetry with and without a mask in the upper airway was predicted. Wearing a mask reduces particle penetration into the lungs, regardless of the FE of the mask. The results also show that mask-wearing protects the upper airway (particularly the nose and larynx) best from particles larger than 10 µm while protecting the lungs best from particles smaller than 10 µm.","Xi, Jinxiang; Si, Xiuhua April; Nagarajan, Ramaswamy",Phys Fluids (1994),https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0034580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33362401/,608

Patients were also admitted to this site after diagnosis in residential care. AIMS: To describe the early symptoms and the outcomes of COVID‐19 in older adults. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 at the facility in July or August 2020 were identified and their medical records were examined to identify symptoms present before and after their diagnosis and to determine their outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 106 patients were identified as having COVID‐19, with median age of 84.3 years (range 41–104 years); 64 were diagnosed as hospital inpatients after a median length of stay of 49 days, 31 were transferred from residential aged care facilities with a known diagnosis and 11 were diagnosed after discharge. There were 95 patients included in an analysis of symptom type and timing onset. Overall, 61 (64.2%) were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis of COVID‐19, having been diagnosed through screening initiated on site. Of these, 88.6% developed symptoms of COVID‐19 within 14 days. The most common initial symptom type was respiratory, but there was wide variation in presentation, including fever, gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, many initially not recognised as being due to COVID‐19. Of 104 patients, 32 died within 30 days of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: COVID‐19 diagnosis is challenging due to the variance in symptoms.

670017,COVID-19 and stock exchange return variation: empirical evidences from econometric estimation,2021-06-21,"Dentists are exposed to contamination by SARS-CoV-2 due to dental interventions, leading to a state of alert and potential risk of negative impact in mental health and sleep quality, associated with Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) and bruxism. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the psychosocial status, sleep quality, symptoms of TMD, and bruxism in Brazilian dentists (DSs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: The sample (n=641 DSs) was divided into three groups (quarantined DSs; DSs in outpatient care; and frontline professionals), which answered an electronic form containing the TMD Pain Screening Questionnaire (Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders – DC/TMD), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the sleep and awake bruxism questionnaire. ANOVA test and Mann Whitney post-test were used, with Bonferroni adjustment (p<0.016) and a 95% confidence level. RESULTS: Probable TMD was found in 24.3% (n=156) of the participants, while possible sleep and awake bruxism were diagnosed in 58% (n=372) and 53.8% (n=345) of them, respectively. Among all variables evaluated, only symptoms of depression were significantly greater in the quarantined DSs group when compared to those who were working at the clinical care (p=0.002). Working DSs were significantly less likely (OR=0.630, p=0.001) to have depressive symptoms. Those who were not worried or less worried about the pandemic were less likely to experience stress (OR=0.360), anxiety (OR=0.255), and poor sleep quality (OR=0.256). Sleep had a strong positive and moderate correlation with psychological factors on frontline workers and DSs in outpatient care, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results suggest confinement may have a more negative impact on the life of DSs than the act of being actively working. The concern about Covid-19 and poor sleep quality was significantly prevalent and may negatively affect the quality of life of DSs. Thus, further research on the topic is needed.","Peixoto, Karen Oliveira; de Resende, Camila Maria Bastos Machado; de Almeida, Erika Oliveira; Almeida-Leite, Camila Megale; Conti, Paulo César Rodrigues; Barbosa, Gustavo Augusto Seabra; Barbosa, Juliana Stuginski",J. appl. oral sci,https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-7757-2020-1089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34320119/,608
671921,Mapping green technologies literature published between 1995 and 2019: a scientometric review from the perspective of the manufacturing industry,2021-04-11,"OBJECTIVES: Elastomeric half-mask respirator (EHMR) use in healthcare increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Concern for potential release of infectious aerosols from EHMR exhalation valves prompted recommendations to cover them with surgical masks (SMs), thereby improving source control. The physiological and subjective effects of wearing a SM over the exhalation valve of an EHMR, however, are unknown. METHODS: Twelve healthy healthcare worker volunteers completed a 30-min series of simulated healthcare-related tasks, including resting, talking, walking, and bending, proning and supinating a weighted manikin, and performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This series recurred three times with different mask configurations—SM only, EHMR only, or EHMR with SM covering the exhalation valve. A transcutaneous sensor continuously measured carbon dioxide (tcPCO(2)), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and heart rate (HR) from each subject. Subjects scored their rates of perceived exertion (RPE) and levels of discomfort after each round. Physiological parameters and subjective scores were analyzed using mixed linear models with a fixed effect for mask type, activity, age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. Analysis also tested for interaction between mask type and activity. RESULTS: Physiological parameters remained within normal ranges for all mask configurations but varied by task. Statistically significant but small decreases in mean tcPCO(2) (37.17 versus 37.88 mmHg, P < 0.001) and SpO(2) (97.74 versus 97.94%, P < 0.001) were associated with wearing EHMR with SM over the exhalation valve compared with EHMR alone. Mean HR did not differ between these mask configurations. Wearing SM only was associated with lower RPE and level of discomfort compared with EHMR, but these subjective scores did not differ when comparing EHMR with SM to EHMR only. Age, BMI, and gender had no significant effect on any outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Wearing a SM over an EHMR did not produce clinically significant changes in tcPCO(2), SpO(2), or HR compared with uncovered EHMR during healthcare-related tasks. Covered EHMR use also did not affect perceived exertion or discomfort compared with uncovered EHMR use. Covering the exhalation valve of an EHMR with a SM for source control purposes can be done safely.","Zhuang, Eileen; Thurman, Paul; Chen, Hegang H; McDiarmid, Melissa A; Hines, Stella E",Ann Work Expo Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34585722/; https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxab069,608

Clinician scientists attempting to start or continue work both related and unrelated to the disease itself have faced ethical, oversight, or regulatory challenges. No aspect of the clinical trial enterprise was unaffected. These narratives detail some of the barriers encountered and how the investigators coped (or didn't cope). Common themes emerged, ranging from a need to contribute, which drove the researchers to frustration with real and perceived obstructions (both old and new). The narratives disclose common ethical issues related to research during a pandemic: issues both qualitatively and quantitatively different from other human subject research; challenges both new and novel, as well as those previously seen, but writ large in the face of the crisis. The narratives also offer words of advice from the trenches and speak to successes, both large and small, and to the value of teamwork and focus on a common goal.","Gordon, Bruce",Narrat Inq Bioeth,https://doi.org/10.1353/nib.2021.0019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334467/,608

METHODS: Geolocated tweets from U.S. counties (N = 115,330) were analyzed using MALLET LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation) topic modeling techniques to correlate with prospective individual survey data (N = 3005) about vaccine attitudes, actual vaccination, and real-life discussions about vaccines with family and friends during the 2018–2019 influenza season. RESULTS: Ten topics were common across U.S. counties during the 2018–2019 influenza season. In the overall analyses, two of these topics (i.e., Vaccine Science Matters and Big Pharma) were associated with attitudes and behaviors. The topic concerning vaccine science in November-February was positively correlated with attitudes in February-March, r = 0.09, BF(10) = 3. Moreover, among respondents who did not discuss the influenza vaccine with family and friends, the topic about vaccine fraud and children in November-February was negatively correlated with attitudes in February-March and with vaccination in February-March, and April-May (rs = −0.18 to −0.25, BF(10) = 4–146). However, this was absent when participants had discussions about the influenza vaccine with family and friends. DISCUSSION: Regional vaccine content correlated with prospective measures of vaccine attitudes and actual vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Social media have demonstrated strong associations with vaccination patterns. When the associations are negative, discussions with family and friends appear to eliminate them. Programs to promote vaccination should encourage real-life conversations about vaccines.","Chan, Man-pui Sally; Jamieson, Kathleen Hall; Albarracin, Dolores",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X20309853; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20309853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32792251/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.054,608

686682,Risk assessment and analysis of harmful residues in edible agricultural products in China—take Anhui Province as an example,2021-08-16,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate machine learning classifiers and interpretable models using chest CT for detection of COVID-19 and differentiation from other pneumonias, interstitial lung disease (ILD) and normal CTs. METHODS: Our retrospective multi-institutional study obtained 2446 chest CTs from 16 institutions (including 1161 COVID-19 patients). Training/validation/testing cohorts included 1011/50/100 COVID-19, 388/16/33 ILD, 189/16/33 other pneumonias, and 559/17/34 normal (no pathologies) CTs. A metric-based approach for the classification of COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and random forests. A deep learning–based classifier differentiated COVID-19 via 3D features extracted directly from CT attenuation and probability distribution of airspace opacities. RESULTS: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are the percentage of airspace opacity and peripheral and basal predominant opacities, concordant with the typical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering compares feature distribution across COVID-19 and control cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC = 0.83, sensitivity = 0.74, and specificity = 0.79 versus respectively 0.93, 0.90, and 0.83 for the DL-based classifier. Most of ambiguity comes from non-COVID-19 pneumonia with manifestations that overlap with COVID-19, as well as mild COVID-19 cases. Non-COVID-19 classification performance is 91% for ILD, 64% for other pneumonias, and 94% for no pathologies, which demonstrates the robustness of our method against different compositions of control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our new method accurately discriminates COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia, ILD, and CTs with no pathologies, using quantitative imaging features derived from chest CT, while balancing interpretability of results and classification performance and, therefore, may be useful to facilitate diagnosis of COVID-19. KEY POINTS: • Unsupervised clustering reveals the key tomographic features including percent airspace opacity and peripheral and basal opacities most typical of COVID-19 relative to control groups. • COVID-19-positive CTs were compared with COVID-19-negative chest CTs (including a balanced distribution of non-COVID-19 pneumonia, ILD, and no pathologies). Classification accuracies for COVID-19, pneumonia, ILD, and CT scans with no pathologies are respectively 90%, 64%, 91%, and 94%. • Our deep learning (DL)–based classification method demonstrates an AUC of 0.93 (sensitivity 90%, specificity 83%). Machine learning methods applied to quantitative chest CT metrics can therefore improve diagnostic accuracy in suspected COVID-19, particularly in resource-constrained environments.
