11028,Acquisition of Information About Innovative Practices in Outpatient Mental Health Clinics,2020-03-10,"Background The incidence of head and neck cancers is increasing, alongside a decrease in associated mortality. Currently, medical and dental practitioners can refer patients to be seen urgently within two weeks. The appropriateness of these referrals has been disputed. In 2020, the Department of Health aims for patients to be given cancer diagnoses within 28 days from referral. Methods A retrospective audit was conducted for all patients referred under the two-week wait pathway in a six-month period. In the first cycle of this audit, one month's worth of urgent referrals were analysed; given the small sample size, very few recommendations could be made. The audit cycle was repeated and it analysed six months' worth of data, which gave a much more representative study. All patients were analysed to see if the 14-day period had been breached. Positive cancer patients were further assessed to see if their diagnosis had been given within 28 days and treatments within 62 days. Results Of the 569 patients seen, there was a positive malignancy diagnostic yield of 7.38%. Nineteen patients breached the 14-day wait. Of the positive patients, 45.2% received their diagnosis more than 28 days from referral, and 22.2% of these patients received treatment after 62 days. Conclusion The department performed well despite the high number of referrals. This audit has touched on some key issues which have been discussed in detail in this article. Furthermore, this audit recommends a concerted effort to improve oral cancer detections skills among GDPs and GMPs. While all referrals may be appropriate from a primary care point of view, this audit makes it apparent that better differentiation is needed between malignant and routinely manageable lesions. All secondary care units alongside general practitioners can learn from the findings of this audit.","Araghi, Ariyan S.; Harris, Yasmin; Kyzas, Panayiotis",Br Dent J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222898/,607
14118,Of gratitude and hope in trying times,2020-10-08,"Treatment for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is hampered mainly by drug toxicity, their high cost, and parasite resistance. Drug development is a long and pricey process, and therefore, drug repositioning may be an alternative worth pursuing. Cardenolides are used to treat cardiac diseases, especially those obtained from Digitalis species. In the present study, cardenolide digitoxigenin (DIGI) obtained from a methanolic extract of Digitalis lanata leaves was tested for its antileishmanial activity against Leishmania infantum species. Results showed that 50% Leishmania and murine macrophage inhibitory concentrations (IC(50) and CC(50), respectively) were of 6.9 ± 1.5 and 295.3 ± 14.5 μg/mL, respectively. With amphotericin B (AmpB) deoxycholate, used as a control drug, values of 0.13 ± 0.02 and 0.79 ± 0.12 μg/mL, respectively, were observed. Selectivity index (SI) values were of 42.8 and 6.1 for DIGI and AmpB, respectively. Preliminary studies suggested that the mechanism of action for DIGI is to cause alterations in the mitochondrial membrane potential, to increase the levels of reactive oxygen species and induce accumulation of lipid bodies in the parasites. DIGI was incorporated into Pluronic® F127-based polymeric micelles, and the formula (DIGI/Mic) was used to treat L. infantum–infected mice. Miltefosine was used as a control drug. Results showed that animals treated with either miltefosine, DIGI, or DIGI/Mic presented significant reductions in the parasite load in their spleens, livers, bone marrows, and draining lymph nodes, as well as the development of a specific Th1-type response, when compared with the controls. Results obtained 1 day after treatment were corroborated with data corresponding to 15 days after therapy. Importantly, treatment with DIGI/Mic induced better parasitological and immunological responses when compared with miltefosine- and DIGI-treated mice. In conclusion, DIGI/Mic has the potential to be used as a therapeutic agent to protect against L. infantum infection, and it is therefore worth of consideration in future studies addressing VL treatment.","Freitas, Camila S.; Oliveira-da-Silva, João A.; Lage, Daniela P.; Costa, Rafaella R.; Mendonça, Débora V.

15924,Racial and ethnic equality is also about healthcare,2021-02-05,"INTRODUCTION: Radical cystectomy remains the standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer and high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Postoperative ostomy education is common, but patients struggle to maintain self-management practices. A preoperative ostomy education program was developed to meet this need, and we conducted a qualitative study with participating patient-caregiver dyads to evaluate the educational and psychosocial impacts of the program and examine alignment with program objectives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted utilizing a thematic analysis approach. Sixteen patients, eighteen caregivers, and three program educators completed semi-structured interviews from 3 to 18 months post the program. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Thirteen end-of-course surveys from the initial educational program cohort were transcribed, coded, analyzed; this data was triangulated with patient, caregiver, and educator interviews. RESULTS: Analysis uncovered three themes: (1) Patient and caregiver motivation to attend the program, (2) attitudes toward this life-changing event, and (3) education. For theme 1, patients and caregivers cited lack of knowledge, fear, and concern about ostomy surgery and care as motivation. For theme 2, there were a variety of attitudes toward the ostomy, ranging from avoidance to acceptance, and a similar breadth of attitudes toward caregiving, with some patients and caregivers describing ongoing dependence and other patients seeking complete independence. For theme 3, the interactive curriculum was determined to be effective, and the patient advocate was cited as the most memorable program component. CONCLUSIONS: A formal preoperative ostomy education program employing an interactive educational approach and featuring a patient advocate can prepare bladder cancer patients and caregivers for ostomy self-management and post-ostomy life.","Wulff-Burchfield, Elizabeth Marie; Potts, Maryellen; Glavin, Katherine; Mirza, Moben",Support Care Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7930519/,607

The national call for transforming primary care requires innovation in the education of prelicensure nursing students. PROBLEM To ensure future RNs can function in the primary care setting and assume enhanced roles within the interprofessional team, prelicensure nursing students need to be exposed to primary care. A key barrier to providing this essential education is the lack of partnerships with primary care facilities. APPROACH The purpose of this project was to collaborate with rural practice partners to provide a primary care clinical experience for prelicensure nursing students. OUTCOMES Collaboration between academic-practice partners to develop a clinical experience for prelicensure nursing students allowed exposure to the role of RNs in rural primary care. CONCLUSIONS By sharing the process for planning the clinical experience, other interested academic institutions may replicate similar opportunities.","Mennenga, Heidi A; Brown, Robin J; Horsley, T Leann; Abuatiq, Alham A; Plemmons, Christina",Nurse educator,https://doi.org/10.1097/nne.0000000000000876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530901/,607

Res. 155 March 2020 104876].",2021-04-28,"BACKGROUND Indoor and outdoor mould exposure can affect respiratory symptoms, but its contribution to COPD outcomes such as exacerbation rates or antibiotics courses is not well defined. Some patients with COPD develop chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), but the contribution of environmental exposure is not known. METHODS We correlated activities or exposures related to mould with COPD outcomes in patients with COPD with or without CPA using a questionnaire. RESULTS One hundred and forty patients were included and 60 had CPA in addition to COPD. Seventy-six were male and mean age was 66.9 years (range 40-87). Thirty-nine (28%) were active cigarette smokers. On multivariate analysis, occupational contact with agricultural resources (p = 0.017), vacuuming once weekly or more often (p = 0.026) and not asking visitors to remove shoes on home entry (p = 0.035) were significantly more common in participants reporting ≥ 4 office visits for COPD symptoms in the last year. Living within one mile of industrial composting sites (p = 0.013), vacuuming once weekly or more often (p = 0.016) and not asking visitors to remove shoes on home entry (p = 0.028) were significantly more common in participants reporting ≥4 antibiotics courses in the last year. Patients with CPA showed a trend for residence within one mile of farms or agricultural areas (P = 0.088, OR 2, 95% CI 0.9-4.4). CONCLUSION Activities potentially leading to mould exposure were common in a population with COPD with or without CPA and were associated with adverse COPD outcomes. Environmental mould exposure may play a role in the development of CPA in patients with COPD.","Kosmidis, Chris; Hashad, Rola; Mathioudakis, Alexander G; McCahery, Thomas; Richardson, Malcolm D; Vestbo, Jørgen",Pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pulmoe.2021.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130917/,607
63273,When and why health care personnel respond to a disaster: the state of the science.,2014,"Dinonylnaphthalene sulfonic acids (NSAs) are high production volume chemicals that are used primarily as additives in a wide range of industrial products (i.e., coatings, sealants, fuels, metal-extractants, paints, rubber materials). This study examined the effect of three NSA congeners on freshwater organisms: barium dinonylnaphthalene sulfonate (BaDNS), calcium dinonylnaphthalene sulfonate (CaDNS), and dinonylnaphthalene disulfonic acid (DNDS). Chronic effects were characterized by exposing fertilized fathead minnow eggs to sediment-associated NSAs and measuring various developmental and growth endpoints for 21 d. No effects in hatch success and larval growth were observed when fathead minnow eggs were exposed to CaDNS and DNDS concentrations up to 246 and 798 μg/g dry weight, respectively, in spiked sediment (~2% organic carbon). However, when NSAs were associated with substrate containing no organic carbon (sand), EC50s for fathead minnow hatch success, larval growth, biomass production, and overall survival were 58.3, 18.8, 15.5, and 13.8 μg/L, respectively, for CaDNS. Acute effect characterization was also conducted in water-only exposures for the three NSA congeners using the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca, the pulmonate snail Planorbella pilsbryi, and larval freshwater mussels Lampsilis cardium and Lampsilis siliquoidea. The sulfonate salts (BaDNS and CaDNS) were significantly more acutely toxic to all tested invertebrates in the water-only exposures, with LC50s ranging from 0.47 to 12.1 μg/L, compared to DNDS (LC50s ≥ 98.2 μg/L). This is the first study to provide empirical data on the aquatic toxicity of three NSA congeners.","Matten, K J; Parrott, J L; Bartlett, A J; Gillis, P L; Milani, D; Toito, J; Balakrishnan, V K; Prosser, R S",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886965/,607

Incorporation of hPRR was confirmed in recombinant BmNPV (rBmNPV) but not in cysteine protease-deleted rBmNPV. hPRR1 was observed in ER, but hPRR2 and hPRR4 were observed around the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in its periphery. rBmNPV-hPRR1 and -hPRR2, carrying hPRR1 and hPRR2 respectively, showed binding affinity to human renin, but rBmNPV-hPRR4 did not. The presence of hPRR4 of rBmNPV-hPRR4 was confirmed in western blotting under nonreducing conditions, suggesting that although hPRR4 was incorporated in rBmNPV-hPRR4, it behaved as a non-functional aggregate.

74346,Contraception in Person-Contraception Online (CiP-CO) cohort study.,2021-08-27,"BACKGROUND Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is highly prevalent among reproductive-aged women and has a substantial negative impact on fertility. Currently, there is no specific treatment for Hashimoto thyroiditis. We hypothesize that acupuncture can halt or delay the progression of HT and improve fertility in child-bearing period female. We therefore designed a randomized controlled trial to test this hypothesis by comparing the therapeutic effect of acupuncture vs sham acupuncture in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis. METHODS In this randomized controlled study, a total of 284 eligible patients will be assigned to acupuncture group (n = 142) or sham acupuncture group (n = 142) in a 1:1 ratio. All patients will receive 36 sessions in total for 12 consecutive weeks with the same acupoint prescription (RN23, ST9, RN17, RN4, RN6, ST36, SP6, KI6). The primary assessment is the titers of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb). Secondary outcomes include the thyroid function, ovarian function, the rate of primary ovarian insufficiency, and pregnancy outcome. The thyroid function and thyroid antibodies tests will be measured at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 after randomization. The ovarian function will be examined on the 2nd to 4th day of the menstrual period in the 1st month, 2nd month and 3rd month compared with baseline. Both the pregnancy outcome and the rate of primary ovarian insufficiency will be evaluated 1 year after treatment. DISCUSSION This will be the first large-scale trial specifically evaluating acupuncture therapy in child-bearing period female with Hashimoto thyroiditis. If the study confirms the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment, more consistent acupuncture therapy can be set up for clinical practice.

75095,Returning to the Classroom: A Look at Mental Health Needs as Children Go Back to School.,2021-06-01,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Abdominal wall closure after intestinal transplantation (ITX) or multivisceral transplantation (MVTX) is challenging because of the loss of abdominal domain and wall elasticity as a result of previous operations and donor-to-recipient weight and height mismatch. RECENT FINDINGS We report on abdominal wall closure management in 30 ITX and MVTX recipients. In 60% of patients (n = 18), a primary abdominal closure (PAC) was achieved, in 40% (n = 12) a staged closure (SAC) was necessary. Patients with PAC had undergone less pretransplant operations and required less posttransplant relaparotomies. They were mainly ITX recipients or more abdominal domain because of a longer intestinal remnant. A literature review revealed different strategies to overcome a failed primary closure. They focus on graft reduction or an enlargement of the abdominal domain. The latter includes temporary coverage with prosthetic materials for SAC. Definite abdominal closure is achieved by skin only closure, or by using acellular dermal matrix, rotational flaps, rectus muscle fascia or abdominal wall grafts. SUMMARY Abdominal wall reconstruction after ITX/MVTX is commonly demanded and can be conducted by different strategies. The technique should be easy to use in a timely manner and should prevent abdominal infections, intestinal fistulation, incisional hernias, and wound dehiscence.","Gerlach, Undine A; Pascher, Andreas",Current opinion in organ transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0b013e3283534d7b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22476222/,607
77043,Patient Reported Outcome Measures of Sleep Quality in Fibromyalgia: A COSMIN Systematic Review.,2020-04-26,"BACKGROUND In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic put the world in crisis on both physical and psychological health. Simultaneously, a myriad of unverified information flowed on social media and online outlets. The situation was so severe that the World Health Organization identified it as an infodemic in February 2020. OBJECTIVE We want to study the propagation patterns and textual transformation of COVID-19 related rumors on a closed-platform. METHODS We obtained a dataset of suspicious text messages collected on Taiwan's most popular instant messaging platform, LINE, between January and July 2020. We proposed a Classification-based Clustering algorithm that could efficiently cluster messages into groups, with each group representing a rumor. For ease of understanding, a group is referred to as a ""rumor group"". Messages in a rumor group could be identical or within limited textual differences with one another. Therefore, each message in a rumor group is a form of the rumor. RESULTS A total of 936 rumor groups with at least 10 messages were discovered among 114,124 text messages collected from LINE. Among 936 rumors, 396 (42.3%) were related to COVID-19. Of 396 COVID-related rumors, 134 (33.8%) had been fact-checked by IFCN-certified agencies in Taiwan to be false or misleading. Studying the prevalence of Simplified Chinese characters or phrases that originated in China in the messages, we found that COVID-related messages, compared to non-COVID-related messages, were more likely to have been written by non-Taiwanese. The association was statistically significant with p < .01 by the chi-squared independence test. The qualitative investigations of the 3 most popular COVID-19 rumors revealed that key authoritative figures, mostly medical personnel, were often misquoted in the messages. In addition, these rumors resurfaced multiple times after being fact-checked, usually preceded by major societal events or textual transformations. CONCLUSIONS To fight infodemic, it is crucial that we first understand why and how a rumor becomes popular. While social media gives rise to an unprecedented number of unverified rumors, it also provides a unique opportunity for us to study rumor propagations and the interactions with society. Therefore, we must put more effort in the areas.

Schools and universities provide rich resources for adolescents and young adults to develop significant coping mechanisms. AIM This study assessed the perceptions of risk, fear, mental health status, and coping strategies among Saudi student nurses amid the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Using an online survey, the mental health of the students was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale short form version, whereas the coping was assessed by the Brief-Coping Orientation of Problem Experienced scale. RESULTS The students had modest risk perception and fear of contracting COVID-19. ""Religion"" was reported as the most frequently used coping strategy. Approximately 43.3%, 37.2%, and 30.9% of the respondents manifested some degree of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Poor COVID-19 knowledge, perceived seriousness of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, and the use of some coping strategies were predictors of fear. Knowing someone infected with COVID-19, fear, and several coping strategies predicted students' mental health.

86315,Triage in mass-casualty events: the Haitian experience.,2011,"BACKGROUND Nasal packing is routinely used after septoplasty because it is believed to decrease risk of postoperative bleeding, hematomas, and adhesions. Multiple studies have shown, however, that there are numerous complications associated with nasal packing. The purpose of this work was to perform a meta-analysis on the existing literature to evaluate the role of nasal packing after septoplasty. METHODS Two independent reviewers conducted a literature search using EMBASE, OVID, Medline, PubMed, Google scholar, Cochrane Library, and reference list review from 1966 to August 2010 to identify studies assessing nasal packing after septoplasty. All papers were reviewed for study design, results, and were assigned an Oxford level of evidence grade, Detsky score, and Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies (MINORS) score. RESULTS Sixteen papers were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Eleven papers were randomized control trials, 3 were prospective, and 2 were retrospective studies. Nasal packing did not show benefit in reducing postoperative bleeding, hematomas, septal perforations, adhesions, or residual deviated nasal septum. There was, however, an increase in postoperative infections. Two studies using fibrin products as nasal packing showed a decreased bleeding rate. CONCLUSION Nasal packing after septoplasty does not show any postoperative benefits. Fibrin products show a possibility of decreasing postoperative bleeding. Routine use of nasal packing after septoplasty is not warranted. This is the first meta-analysis conducted on this topic.","Banglawala, Sarfaraz M; Gill, Mandeep; Sommer, Doron D; Psaltis, Alkis; Schlosser, Rodney; Gupta, Michael",International forum of allergy & rhinology,https://doi.org/10.1002/alr.21110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23136013/,607

Thanks to a combination of experiments on lipid vesicles supported by colloidal scaffolds and theoretical work, we demonstrate that the local geometry and global chemical composition of the bilayer determine both the spatial arrangement and the amount of mixing of the lipids. In the mixed phase, a strong geometrical anisotropy can give rise to an antimixed state, where the lipids are mixed, but their relative concentration varies across the membrane. After phase separation, the bilayer organizes in multiple lipid domains, whose location is pinned in specific regions, depending on the substrate curvature and the bending rigidity of the lipid domains. Our results provide critical insights into the phase separation of cellular membranes and, more generally, two-dimensional fluids on curved substrates.","Rinaldin, Melissa; Fonda, Piermarco; Giomi, Luca; Kraft, Daniela J",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17432-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887878/,607

Our results indicated that 48.70 percent of the respondents wanted to use the app. The model explained 39 percent of the variance in app use intention. The most important predictor was performance expectancy, followed by facilitating conditions and social influence. Effort expectancy was not related to intention. Moreover, individuals' innovativeness was positively related with app use intention, whereas app-related privacy concerns negatively influenced intention.

Our procedure-related complication rates are similar to other reports. No patient required emergent open surgical tracheostomy, and there were no deaths related to PDT. We required minimal to no backup support from our surgical colleagues in performing PDT. CONCLUSIONS We successfully developed a medical intensivist-driven PDT service, sharing our unique successes and challenges, to facilitate the care of our patients requiring prolonged ventilator support.","Giri, Paresh C; Bellinghausen Stewart, Amy; Dinh, Vi A; Chrissian, Ara A; Nguyen, H Bryant",Journal of critical care,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2014.10.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25481435/,607
138152,Taxonomic Profiling of Bacteria and Fungi in Freshwater Sewer Receiving Hospital Wastewater.,2020-10-15,"BACKGROUND Pendelluft phenomenon is defined as the displacement of gas from a more recruited nondependent (ND) lung region to a less recruited dependent (D) lung region. This phenomenon may cause lung injury. Thus, a lung model for pendelluft was established, and the effects of ventilatory settings on pendelluft were examined. METHODS Two sets of the twin-bellow-type training test lung (TTL) model were utilized. One bellow simulated the diaphragm, and the other simulated the lung. One TTL model represented the ND region, and the other represented the D region. The lung bellows were connected to each other and were ventilated with 1 ventilator. The diaphragm bellows were ventilated with 2 synchronized ventilators that regulated pleural pressure levels. We simulated pendelluft by applying different pleural pressure levels to the D and ND bellows. The increment of the tidal volume in the D region from the ""no breathing effort"" condition was defined as the pendelluft volume. The effects of ventilator settings, such as ventilatory modes, triggering sensitivity, inspiratory pressurization, and inspiratory cycling-off, were examined. The changes in tidal volumes in the D region based on the control settings were compared to assess the severity of pendelluft. RESULTS The gas flow from the D region to the ND region was found to be essential in pendelluft, but the severity of this phenomenon was not always proportional to gas flows. The severity increased with the increase in the differences in pleural pressure levels between the ND and D regions, and it was amplified by the difference in lung mechanics between the ND and D regions. However, the ventilator settings had minimal effect on the severity of pendelluft. CONCLUSIONS The pendelluft was affected by the heterogeneity of lung mechanics and pleural pressure. Furthermore, a minimal association was observed between the ventilator settings and the severity of pendelluft.","Enokidani, Yusuke; Uchiyama, Akinori; Yoshida, Takeshi; Abe, Ryuichiro; Yamashita, Tomonori; Koyama, Yukiko; Fujino, Yuji",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.07880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900913/,607

MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective review of imaging-guided RFA of Bosniak III and IV cysts from one institution. Thirty-eight subjects (19 men and 19 women; mean age, 71 years; age range, 46-95 years) underwent RFA of 40 cystic neoplasms (Bosniak III, n = 25; Bosniak IV, n = 15). Percutaneous biopsy was performed in 90% (36/40) of lesions. For patients with imaging follow-up of at least 1 year (n = 21), the mean duration of surveillance was 2.8 years (range, 1-6.5 years). The electronic medical record was reviewed for complications related to the procedure. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured before RFA and at the last follow-up visit more than 6 months after the RFA session. RESULTS According to percutaneous biopsy, 61.1% (22/36) of lesions were malignant, and 38.9% (14/36) of biopsies were inconclusive. There was no local tumor progression, and no subjects developed metastatic disease. One subject developed a new solid renal mass during the course of follow-up. Minor complications occurred in 5.3% (2/38) of ablations and included dysuria and mild hydronephrosis related to a blood clot in the ureter. There was one major complication (2.6%), a case of flash pulmonary edema. On average, estimated GFR decreased by 2.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2). CONCLUSION Imaging-guided RFA is an effective and safe treatment of Bosniak III and IV cystic renal neoplasms with outcomes comparable to those of surgical therapies.","Allen, Brian C; Chen, Michael Y; Childs, David D; Zagoria, Ronald J",AJR.

The overall exposure of the population also depends, however, on indoor air quality and human mobility and activities. Here, by integrating real-time mobility data and a questionnaire survey on time-activity patterns during the pandemic, we show that despite a decrease in ambient PM2.5 during the quarantine, the total population-weighted exposure to PM2.5 considering both indoor and outdoor environments increased by 5.7 μg m-3 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-11.0 μg m-3). The increase in population-weighted exposure was mainly driven by a nationwide urban-to-rural population migration before the Spring Festival coupled with the freezing of the migration backward due to the quarantine, which increased household energy consumption and the fraction of people exposed to rural household air pollution indoors. Our analysis reveals an increased inequality of air pollution exposure during the quarantine and highlights the importance of household air pollution for population health in China.","Shen, Huizhong; Shen, Guofeng; Chen, Yilin; Russell, Armistead G; Hu, Yongtao; Duan, Xiaoli; Meng, Wenjun; Xu, Yang; Yun, Xiao; Lyu, Baolei; Zhao, Shunliu; Hakami, Amir; Guo, Jianping; Tao, Shu; Smith, Kirk R",Nature human behaviour,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-01018-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398145/,607

Along with direct contact and droplet contaminations, the possibility of infections through contaminated surfaces and fomites is investigating. This study aims to assess SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA's prevalence by real-time one-step reverse transcriptase PCR on banknotes circulating in Bangladesh. We also evaluated the persistence of the virus on banknotes spiked with SARS-CoV-2 positive diluted human nasopharyngeal samples. Among the 425 banknote samples collected from different entities, 7.29% (n = 31) were tested positive for targeted genes. Twenty-four positive representative samples were assessed for n gene fragments by conventional PCR and sequenced. All the samples that carry viral RNA belonged to the GR clade, the predominantly circulating clade in Bangladesh. In the stability test, the n gene was detected for up to 72 h on banknotes spiked with nasopharyngeal samples, and CT values increase significantly with time (p < 0.05). orf1b gene was observed to be less stable, especially on old banknotes, and usually went beyond detectable limit within 8 to 10 h. The stability of virus RNA well fitted by the Weibull model and concave curve for new banknotes and convex curve for old banknotes revealed. Handling banknotes is unavoidable; hence, these findings imply that proper hygiene practice is needed to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission through banknotes.","Akter, Selina; Roy, Pravas Chandra; Ferdaus, Amina; Ibnat, Habiba; Alam, A S M Rubayet Ul; Nigar, Shireen; Jahid, Iqbal Kabir; Hossain, M Anwar",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740558/,607
157006,"Using search engine data to gauge public interest in mental health, politics and violence in the context of mass shootings.",2020,"Collagen gel is a poroelastic/biphasic system consisting of a fibrillar loose lattice structure filled with >99% fluid. Its mechanical behaviour is governed by the inherent viscoelasticity of the fibrils, and their interaction with the fluid. This study investigated the underlying mechanisms of plastic compression (PC), a recently introduced technique for the production of dense collagen matrices for tissue engineering. Unconfined compressive loading results in the rapid expulsion of the fluid phase to produce scaffolds with improved mechanical properties potentially suitable for direct implantation and suturing. The controllability of the PC, as a single or multi-stage process was investigated in terms of fluid loss, remaining protein concentration, and morphological characteristics. Time dependent analysis, and quasi-static mechanical (compressive and tensile) properties of hyper-hydrated and PC collagen, produced by single (SC) and double (DC) compression, were also investigated on the non-covalently cross-linked gels. Under unconfined compressive creep, the behaviour of hyper hydrated gel was dictated by the fluid movement relative to the solid ( poroelasticity) with negligible recovery upon load removal. Similar behaviour was achieved in multiple compressed gels; however, these progressively dense matrices displayed an instantaneous recovery that was in line with the increase in fibrillar collagen concentration. Under tension, where the mechanical response of the gels is dominated by the fibrils, there was significant increase in both break strength and modulus with increasing fibril concentration due to multiple compression as DC provided greater opportunity for physical interaction between the nano-sized fibrils.","Abou Neel, Ensanya A; Cheema, Umber; Knowles, Jonathan C; Brown, Robert A; Nazhat, Showan N",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b609784g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680187/,607

Mortality attributed to COVID-19 in high-altitude populations. High Alt Med Biol. 00:000-000, 2020. Background: Since partial oxygen pressure decreases as altitude increases, environmental hypoxia could worsen Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient's hypoxemia. We compared COVID-19 mortality at different altitudes. Methods: Retrospective analysis of population-level data on COVID-19 deaths was conducted in the United States (1,016 counties) and Mexico (567 municipalities). Mixed-model Poisson regression analysis of the association between altitude and COVID-19 mortality was conducted using individual-level data from 40,168 Mexican subjects with COVID-19, adjusting for multiple covariates. Results: Between January 20 and April 13, 2020, mortality rates were higher in U.S. counties located at ≥2,000 m elevation versus those located <1,500 m (12.3 vs. 3.2 per 100,000; p < 0.001). In Mexico, between March 13 and May 13, 2020, mortality rates were higher in municipalities located at ≥2,000 m versus those located <1,500 m (5.3 vs. 3.9 per 100,000; p < 0.001). Among Mexican subjects younger than 65 years, the risk of death was 36% higher in those living at ≥2,000 m versus those living at <1,500 m (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 1.36; confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05-1.78; p = 0.022).

This study aimed to assess and compare the levels of psychological well-being among students from both Santarém and Leiria Polytechnic Institutes. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional correlational study was performed in the period immediately after the first lockdown. Participants were 775 students (females = 73.5%), aged between 17 and 55 years. All of them completed measures of the Psychological Well-Being Manifestation Scale (PWBMS;or EMMBEP, in the Portuguese version, by Monteiro, Tavares e Pereira, 2012) measuring six dimensions, components of the eudaimonic model of well-being. Collected data were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows software, Version 27.0. Results The results obtained revealed differences of quality in the scores of the six measured dimensions. If subjective experiences on Mental Balance and Sociability are the best indicators of the well-being, the perception of the lack of Social Involvement and low Happiness appear to be limitative factors to the perceived well-being. We also found significant differences in terms of polytechnic institute attended, gender, age categories, and marital status. Conclusions The obtained results provide the basis to design and develop a targeted intervention main program focused on the empowerment of higher education students. Build a literacy program with health education strategies, starting from their own perceptions and responses to the experienced situations, allows their easy engagement in the promotion of the psychological well-being.","Gonzaga, Luís Silva Mário Figueiredo Maria do Carmo Rosa Marta Matos Rui Amendoeira José",European Journal of Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab120.035,607

METHOD We analyzed data from a survey conducted by the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology Task Force on Airway Management on endotracheal intubation in 98 patients with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed through nucleic acid testing and chest computed tomography. The multivariate logistic model with stepwise selection was used for selecting the predictive factors significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the corresponding anesthesiologists. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the corresponding anesthesiologists was 20.41% after intubation in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Univariate analysis indicated that intubation for elective treatment, intubation in an operating room or isolation ward, and routine rapid induction with continuous positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) for intubation were associated with a lower SARS-CoV-2 risk in the anesthesiologists. Multivariate analysis revealed that intubation for elective treatment was associated with a significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 risk (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14-0.68, P < 0.0001), and coughing by patients during endotracheal intubation was associated with a significantly increased SARS-CoV-2 risk (aOR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.39-2.97, P = 0.0404) in the anesthesiologists. CONCLUSION Endotracheal intubation for elective treatments, intubation in an operating room or isolation ward, and routine rapid induction with continuous PPV for patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 are associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in practicing anesthesiologists, and coughing by patients during intubation increases the risk.","Sun, Mingyang; Zhang, Jiaqiang; Zhang, Weijia; Li, Ningtao; Zuo, Mingzhang; Qin, Lei; Wu, Szu-Yuan",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34017367/,607

At Salisbury Foundation Trust (SFT), during phase one of the NHS response to Covid-19, the decision to treat upper limb trauma patients in-person or remotely was made using clinical screening criteria. For many patients, audio-visual appointments offered a practical, time efficient way of accessing their reconstructive team for assessment, advice and post-operative care. However, a subset of patients was identified by the team as requiring at least one in-person consultation to minimize perceived clinical risk and to optimize quality outcomes. In order to understand more fully the challenges and successes of technology-enabled care to date, a national survey of practice across hand units in the UK was conducted. We present here some of our key findings and propose the need to develop nationally agreed screening criteria to determine how and when technology enabled outpatient care can be used in the management of acute upper limb trauma. The results of this survey forms part of a series of projects currently underway looking at the efficacy of audio-visual care in upper limb trauma, including a multicentre observational study.","McMullen, E J; Robson, M; Valand, P; Sayed, L; Steele, J",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,,607

RECENT FINDINGS: In cardio-oncology, molecular and multimodality imaging studies confirm that sex differences do exist, affecting the therapeutic cardioprotective strategies and, therefore, the long-term outcomes. Interestingly, compelling evidences suggest that sex-specific characteristics in drug toxicity might predict differences in the therapeutic response, most likely due to the tangled interplay between cancer and HF, which probably share common underlying mechanisms. Cardiovascular diseases show many sex-related differences in prevalence, etiology, phenotype expression, and outcomes. Complex molecular mechanisms underlie this diverse pathological manifestations, from sex-determined differential gene expression to sex hormone interaction with their receptors in the heart. Non-ischemic DCM is an umbrella definition that incorporates several etiologies, including chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathies.

219613,The SHAMISEN Recommendations on preparedness and health surveillance of populations affected by a radiation accident,2020,"The early use of antimicrobial therapy has been introduced in many farms to prevent diarrhea and respiratory disease in young calves; however, there is controversy about whether this practice has a beneficial effect on the health of these animals. This study evaluated the influence of the early use of antimicrobials on the health and performance of neonatal Holstein calves. Twenty-six Holstein calves were screened and divided into two groups, according to the administration (ATB+), or not (ATB-) of tulathromycin (2.5mg/kg, subcutaneously) within the first 12 hours of life. Calves were evaluated by general clinical examination, fecal score, respiratory score, and external palpation of the umbilical region, besides fecal output of dry matter. Anemia was determined by using an automatic system and, also, using a commercial kit for iron dosage. Diarrhea was diagnosed by a centrifuge-flotation technique using a sugar solution (Cryptosporidium) and multiplex semi-nested RT-PCR (rotavirus/coronavirus). The performance of the calves was estimated by Daily Weight Gain (DWG). The young dairy calves were evaluated within 12 hours of birth (&#8804;12h) and at 3-5th (D3-5), 7-9th (D7-9), 13-15th (D13-15), 20-23rd (D20-23), and 27-30th (D27-30) days of life. No difference was noted between the ATB+ and ATB- groups concerning heart rate, respiratory frequency, and rectal temperature. Erythrogram showed a higher frequency of anemia in ATB- group (P=0.016) at the D3-5 check-up; lower values of serum iron were also observed simultaneously (P=0.051). Thirteen cases of respiratory disease were detected during this study; however, no significant difference was observed between the groups in this regard. The frequency of diarrhea (fecal score 2-3) was high in both groups, peaking at D13-D15. No differences were noted between the groups regarding the frequency of diarrhea when considering the dry fecal matter. The predominant etiological agent for diarrhea was Cryptosporidium spp.. The DWG was similar between groups, with maximum weight reduction on D13-15. The administration of tulathromycin in prophylactic dose (2.5mg/kg) at birth decreased the frequency of anemia but did not influence weight gain or the prevalence of diarrhea.(AU)","Martin, Camila C; Basqueira, Natália S; Ramos, Jean S; Silva, Karen N; Baccili, Camila C; Brandão, Paulo E; Gomes, Viviani",Pesqui. vet. bras,,607

Insights into this capping system may provide new ideas for therapeutic interventions and drug discovery. In this work, we employ a previously developed Py-FLINT screening approach to study the inhibitory effects of compounds against the cap guanine N7-methyltransferase enzyme, which is involved in SARS-CoV-2 mRNA capping. We screened five commercially available libraries (7039 compounds in total) to identify 83 inhibitors with IC50 &lt; 50 μM, which were further validated using RP HPLC and dot blot assays. Novel fluorescence anisotropy binding assays were developed to examine the targeted binding site. The inhibitor structures were analyzed for structure-activity relationships in order to define common structural patterns.

METHOD: We enrolled all the patients diagnosed as COVID-19 in the Guangzhou No. 8 People's Hospital. The patients' demographic, and epidemiologic data were collected, including chief complaints, lab results and imaging examination. RESULTS: The characteristics of the patients in Guangzhou are different from that in Wuhan. They were younger in age, female dominated, not commonly combined with other disease. 75% of patients suffered fever on admission, followed by cough occurring in 62% patients. By comparing the mild/normal and severe/critical patients, male, aged, combined with hypertension, abnormal in blood routine result, raised creatine kinase, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, CRP, procalcitonin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, APTT, and positive in proteinuria can be candidate of early warning indicators to severe disease. CONCLUSION: The patients in outside epidemic areas showed different characteristics from that in Wuhan. The abnormal laboratory parameters were markedly changed in 4 weeks after admission, and also shown different between the mild and severe patients. The highest specificity and sensitivity potential early warning indicators of severe disease need more evidence to confirm.","Wang, Yubing; Hu, Zhongwei; Luo, Jie; Zhang, Fuchun; Huang, Lianjiao; Li, Hao; Wen, Xueliang; Pan, Yuejun; Chen, Meihong; Ying, Ruosu; Jiang, Huirong; Chen, Sirui; Pan, Zhilin; Chen, Hongkun; Xu, Huimin; Lei, Chunliang; Han, Yajuan",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,607

The developed biomedical device, Mobile XMI, is validated by testing in the ophthalmologist-and-patient-in-the-loop telemedicine system. The preliminary results showed that the cloud-based teleophthalmology architecture provides a potential tool for the early detection and diagnosis of the corneal related symptoms and diseases. Additionally, the developed medical platform facilitates the remote eye examination of the patients with disability or patients who locate far away from the ophthalmologist or hospital.","Cinay, D.; Murat, H.

265897,"A Cross-Sectional Survey to Assess Health Care Workers' Grief Counseling for Bereaved Families of COVID-19 Victims in Wuhan, China",2021,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination therapy is often prescribed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is warranted because both medications cause corrected QT-interval (QTc) prolongation. Whether QTc duration significantly varies during the day, potentially requiring multiple ECGs, remains to be established. METHODS: We performed 12­lead ECGs and 12­lead 24-h Holter ECG monitoring in all patients aged <80 years admitted to our medical unit for COVID-19, in oral therapy with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, twice daily) and azithromycin (500 mg, once daily) for at least 3 days. A group of healthy individuals matched for age and sex served as control. RESULTS: Out of 126 patients, 22 (median age 64, 82% men) met the inclusion criteria. ECG after therapy showed longer QTc-interval than before therapy (450 vs 426 ms, p = .02). Four patients had a QTc &#8805; 480 ms: they showed higher values of aspartate aminotransferase (52 vs 30 U/L, p = .03) and alanine aminotransferase (108 vs 33 U/L, p < .01) compared with those with QTc < 480 ms. At 24-h Holter ECG monitoring, 1 COVID-19 patient and no control had &#8805;1 run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (p = .4). No patients showed ""R on T"" premature ventricular beats. Analysis of 24-h QTc dynamics revealed that COVID-19 patients had higher QTc values than controls, with no significant hourly variability. CONCLUSION: Therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin prolongs QTc interval in patients with COVID-19, particularly in those with high levels of transaminases. Because QTc duration remains stable during the 24 h, multiple daily ECG are not recommendable.","Cipriani, Alberto; Zorzi, Alessandro; Ceccato, Davide; Capone, Federico; Parolin, Matteo; Donato, Filippo; Fioretto, Paola; Pesavento, Raffaele; Previato, Lorenzo; Maffei, Pietro; Saller, Alois; Avogaro, Angelo; Sarais, Cristiano; Gregori, Dario; Iliceto, Sabino; Vettor, Roberto",Int J Cardiol,,607

In this study heating SARS-CoV-2/England/2/2020 to 56 °C and 60 °C for 15, 30 and 60 min reduced the virus titre by between 2.1 and 4.9 log10 pfu/mL (as determined by plaque assay). Complete inactivation did not occur and there was significant variability between replicates. Viable virus was detected by plaque assay after heat-treatment at 80 °C for 15 or 30 min but not 60 or 90 min. After heat-treatment at 80 °C for 60 min infectious virus was only detected by more sensitive virus culture. No viable virus was detected after heating to 80 °C for 90 min or 95 °C for 1 or 5 min. RT-PCR sensitivity was not compromised by heating to 56 °C and 60 °C. However, RT-PCR sensitivity was reduced (&#8805;3 Ct value increase) after heating the virus to 80 °C for 30 min or longer, or 95 °C for 1 or 5 min. In summary we found that the efficacy of heat-inactivation varies greatly depending on temperature and duration.

We investigated statistically the incidence of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and of transient ischemic attacks, at a large Italian tertiary stroke center during the pandemic. We analyzed statistically the number of transient ischemic attacks (TIA), ischemic strokes (IS) and hemorrhagic strokes (HS) between March 8 and May 2, 2020, the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and compared them with the identical period of 2019. We also analyzed the concentration of small particulate matter (PM10) in 2019 and 2020, to see if it could account for modified incidence of strokes or TIA. We found a large, significant drop in TIA (- 51%) during the pandemic compared to the same period of 2019. By contrast, the number of HS was identical, and IS showed a not significant - 24% decrease. PM10 concentration, already low in 2019, did not further decrease in 2020. Patients kept seeking hospital care when experiencing permanent neurological symptoms (stroke), but they tended not go to the hospital when their symptoms were transient (TIA). The fact that we did not observe a significant decrease in strokes may be explained by the fact that in our city the concentration of small particulate matter did not change compared to 2019.","Balestrino, Maurizio; Coccia, Alberto; Boffa, Alessandra Silvia; Furgani, Andrea; Bermano, Francesco; Finocchi, Cinzia; Bandettini di Poggio, Monica Laura; Malfatto, Laura; Farinini, Daniele; Schenone, Angelo",Intern. emerg. med,,607

At this stage, fast, accurate, and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. In general, there are two issues to overcome: (1) Current deep learning-based works suffer from multimodal data adequacy issues; (2) In this scenario, multimodal (e.g., text, image) information should be taken into account together to make accurate inferences. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal knowledge graph attention embedding for COVID-19 diagnosis. Our method not only learns the relational embedding from nodes in a constituted knowledge graph but also has access to medical knowledge, aiming at improving the performance of the classifier through the mechanism of medical knowledge attention. The experimental results show that our approach significantly improves classification performance compared to other state-of-the-art techniques and possesses robustness for each modality from multi-modal data. Moreover, we construct a new COVID-19 multi-modal dataset based on text mining, consisting of 1393 doctor-patient dialogues and their 3706 images (347 X-ray + 2598 CT + 761 ultrasound) about COVID-19 patients and 607 non-COVID-19 patient dialogues and their 10754 images (9658 X-ray + 494 CT + 761 ultrasound), and the fine-grained labels of all.

310361,A Web- and App-Based Connected Care Solution for COVID-19 In- and Outpatient Care: Qualitative Study and Application Development,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that people understand and comply with self-isolation guidelines. We tested whether a simplified version of the guidelines and a simplified version with visual aids would affect comprehension and intention to self-isolate during the containment phase of the pandemic in the UK, in March 2020, compared to the standard guidelines. METHODS: We conducted an online, three-armed parallel randomized controlled trial. Participants were English and over 18. The survey software randomized them into conditions; they were blind to condition. The control group read the 7-page standard guidelines (the current version at the time of the trial). The intervention groups were given either a 3-page simplified version, with a summary box on the front page and numbered bullet points, or the same simplified version with pictograms illustrating the points in the box. Primary outcomes were comprehension of the guidelines, as measured by the number of correct answers given to six questions about the content, and the proportion who answered that they would 'definitely' stay at home for 7 days if symptomatic. FINDINGS: Recruitment was from 13 to 16 March 2020, with 1845 participants randomised and all data analysed. The Control group averaged 4.27 correct answers, the Simplified 4.20, and the Simplified + visual aids 4.13, out of a possible total of 6 correct answers. There were no differences in comprehension in the unadjusted models; however, when the model was adjusted for demographic variables, there was lower comprehension in the simplified + visual aids condition than in the control, (ß = - 0.16, p = 0.04998). There were no statistically significant differences in intention to stay home: Control was 85%, Simplified 83%, and Simplified + visual aids condition 84%. CONCLUSION: Simplified guidance did not improve comprehension compared to the standard guidance issued in the containment phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, and simplified guidance with visual aids may even have worsened comprehension. Simplified guidance had no effect on intention to stay home if symptomatic. This trial informed COVID-19 policy and provides insights relevant to guidance production in the acute phase of a major public health emergency.","Gold, Natalie; Watson, Robin; Weston, Dale; Greaves, Felix; Amlôt, Richard",BMC Public Health,,607
315927,Maryland SUD treatment center offering expanded MH services,2020,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious avian coronavirus. IBV causes substantial worldwide economic losses in the poultry industry. Vaccination with live-attenuated viral vaccines, therefore, are of critical importance. Live-attenuated viral vaccines, however, exhibit the potential for reversion to virulence and recombination with virulent field strains. Therefore, alternatives such as subunit vaccines are needed together with the identification of suitable adjuvants, as subunit vaccines are less immunogenic than live-attenuated vaccines. Several glycan-based adjuvants directly targeting mammalian C-type lectin receptors were assessed in vitro using chicken bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs). The β-1-6-glucan, pustulan, induced an up-regulation of MHC class II (MHCII) cell surface expression, potentiated a strong proinflammatory cytokine response, and increased endocytosis in a cation-dependent manner. Ex vivo co-culture of peripheral blood monocytes from IBV-immunised chickens, and BM-DCs pulsed with pustulan-adjuvanted recombinant IBV N protein (rN), induced a strong recall response. Pustulan-adjuvanted rN induced a significantly higher CD4 +blast percentage compared to either rN, pustulan or media. However, the CD8 +and TCRγδ +blast percentage were significantly lower with pustulan-adjuvanted rN compared to pustulan or media. Thus, pustulan enhanced the efficacy of MHCII antigen presentation, but apparently not the cross-presentation on MHCI. In conclusion, we found an immunopotentiating effect of pustulan in vitro using chicken BM-DCs. Thus, future in vivo studies might show pustulan as a promising glycan-based adjuvant for use in the poultry industry to contain the spread of coronaviridiae as well as of other avian viral pathogens.","Larsen, Frederik T.; Guldbrandtsen, Bernt; Christensen, Dennis; Pitcovski, Jacob; Kjærup, Rikke B.; Dalgaard, Tina S.",Vaccines,,607

It is associated with age, comorbidities and a weakened immune system. Typically, lymphopenias have been evidenced in severe cases and an excessive production of inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm), which would explain the role of the hyperinflammatory response in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Secondary inflammatory responses from virus reinfections may induce antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a viremic phenomenon that may be an alternative mechanism of cellular infection and should be considered when designing vaccines or immunotherapies involving the stimulation of neutralizing antibodies or the use of monoclonal antibodies. Currently, no vaccines or treatments demonstrate safety and efficacy in patients with COVID-19. However, the results from phase III clinical trials which involve the application of an mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) nucleic acid vaccine and an antiviral drug (remdisivir), are yet to be concluded. For the time being, the best measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is by implementing social isolation, this measure has been adopted by several countries as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).","Lozada-Requena, Iván; Núñez Ponce, César",Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica,,607
345267,Olmstead anniversary underscores need for more planning,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 variants could induce immune escape by mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD). Here we report the humoral immune response to circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as 501Y.V2 (B.1.351), of the plasma and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) elicited by CoronaVac (inactivated vaccine), ZF2001 (RBD-subunit vaccine) and natural infection. Among 86 potent NAbs identified by high-throughput single-cell VDJ sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vaccinees and convalescents, near half anti-RBD NAbs showed major neutralization reductions against the K417N/E484K/N501Y mutation combination, with E484K being the dominant cause. VH3-53/VH3-66 recurrent antibodies respond differently to RBD variants, and K417N compromises the majority of neutralizing activity through reduced polar contacts with complementarity determining regions. In contrast, the 242-244 deletion (242-244&#916;) would abolish most neutralization activity of anti-NTD NAbs by interrupting the conformation of NTD antigenic supersite, indicating a much less diversity of anti-NTD NAbs than anti-RBD NAbs. Plasma of convalescents and CoronaVac vaccinees displayed comparable neutralization reductions against pseudo- and authentic 501Y.V2 variants, mainly caused by E484K/N501Y and 242-244&#916;, with the effects being additive. Importantly, RBD-subunit vaccinees exhibit markedly higher tolerance to 501Y.V2 than convalescents, since the elicited anti-RBD NAbs display a high diversity and are unaffected by NTD mutations. Moreover, an extended gap between the third and second doses of ZF2001 leads to better neutralizing activity and tolerance to 501Y.V2 than the standard three-dose administration. Together, these results suggest that the deployment of RBD-vaccines, through a third-dose boost, may be ideal for combating SARS-CoV-2 variants when necessary, especially for those carrying mutations that disrupt the NTD supersite.","Cao, Yunlong; Yisimayi, Ayijiang; Bai, Yali; Huang, Weijin; Li, Xiaofeng; Zhang, Zhiying; Yuan, Tianjiao; An, Ran; Wang, Jing; Xiao, Tianhe; Du, Shuo; Ma, Wenping; Song, Liyang; Li, Yongzheng; Li, Xiang; Song, Weiliang; Wu, Jiajing; Liu, Shuo; Li, Xuemei; Zhang, Yonghong; Su, Bin; Guo, Xianghua; Wei, Yangyang; Gao, Chuanping; Zhang, Nana; Zhang, Yifei; Dou, Yang; Xu, Xiaoyu; Shi, Rui; Lu, Bai; Jin, Ronghua; Ma, Yingmin; Qin, Chengfeng; Wang, Youchun; Feng, Yingmei; Xiao, Junyu; Xie, Xiaoliang Sunney",Cell Res,,607

METHODS: A total of 302 discharged COVID-19 patients were included. Discharged patients were followed up for 14 days to 6 months. The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, Borg rating of perceived exertion, and manual muscle testing (MMT) scores on day 14 and at 6 months after discharge were compared between the redetectable positive (RP) and non-RP (NRP) groups. Prognoses of respiratory and physical function were compared between patients who recovered from moderate and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the study patients, 7.6% were RP. The proportion of patients who used antiviral drugs was significantly lower in the RP group than in the NRP group. There were no differences in mMRC, Borg, or MMT scores within the RP and NRP groups. The mMRC, Borg, and MMT scores were worse for patients with severe disease when compared to those with moderate disease at both follow-up time points. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients who did not take antiviral drugs were more likely to be RP after discharge. The recovery of respiratory and physical function was not related to re-positivity during rehabilitation, but was related to disease severity during hospitalization.","Wu, Qian; Hou, Xinwei; Li, Hongwei; Guo, Jing; Li, Yajie; Yang, Fangfei; Zhang, Yan; Xie, Yi; Li, Li",Int J Infect Dis,,607

It initiates when the virus attaches to the host cell and ends when the viral contents reach the cytosol.

Once released into aquatic environments, these pollutants will interact with various substances including suspended particles, colloidal or nano particles, which will greatly influence their distribution and ultimate fate. Understanding these interactions in aquatic environments continues to be an important issue because of their possible risk. In this study, bisphenol A (BPA) in the water column of Bentong River, Malaysia, was investigated in both its soluble and colloidal phase. A spatially explicit hydrological model was established to illustrate the associated dispersion processes of colloidal-bound BPA. Modelling results demonstrated the significance of spatial detail in predicting hot spots or peak concentrations of colloidal-bound BPA in the sediment and water columns as well. The magnitude and setting of such spots were system based and depended mainly on flow conditions. The results highlighted the effects of colloidal particles' concentration and density on BPA's removal from the water column. It also demonstrated the tendency of colloidal particles to aggregate and the impact all these processes had on BPA's transport potential and fate in a river water. All scenarios showed that after 7.5-10 km mark BPA's concentration started to reach a steady state with very low concentrations which indicated that a downstream transport of colloidal-bound BPA was less likely due to minute BPA levels.","Shehab, Zakariya Nafi039; Jamil, Nor Rohaizah; Aris, Ahmad Zaharin",J Environ Manage,,607
365227,Improving Detection of Disease Re-emergence Using a Web-Based Tool (RED Alert): Design and Case Analysis Study,2021,"With the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 now in its second year, there remains an urgent need for diagnostic testing that can identify infected individuals, particularly those who harbor infectious virus. Various RT-PCR strategies have been proposed to identify specific viral RNA species that may predict the presence of infectious virus, including detection of transcriptional intermediates (e.g. subgenomic RNA [sgRNA]) and replicative intermediates (e.g. negative-strand RNA species). Using a novel primer/probe set for detection of subgenomic (sg)E transcripts, we successfully identified 100% of specimens containing culturable SARS-CoV-2 from a set of 126 clinical samples (total sgE CT values ranging from 12.3-37.5). This assay showed superior performance compared to a previously published sgRNA assay and to a negative-strand RNA assay, both of which failed to detect target RNA in a subset of samples from which we isolated live virus. In addition, total levels of viral RNA (genome, negative-strand, and sgE) detected with the WHO/Charite primer-probe set correlated closely with levels of infectious virus. Specifically, infectious virus was not detected in samples with a CT above 31.0. Clinical samples with higher levels of viral RNA also displayed cytopathic effect (CPE) more quickly than those with lower levels of viral RNA. Finally, we found that the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 samples is significantly dependent on the cell type used for viral isolation, as Vero E6 cells expressing TMRPSS2 extended the analytical sensitivity of isolation by more than 3 CT compared to parental Vero E6 cells and resulted in faster isolation. Our work shows that using a total viral RNA Ct cut-off of >31 or specifically testing for sgRNA can serve as an effective rule-out test for viral infectivity.","Bruce, Emily A; Mills, Margaret G A; Sampoleo, Reigran; Perchetti, Garrett A.; Huang, Meeili; Despres, Hannah W; Shirley, David J; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alex L; Botten, Jason W",,,607

Within approximately 30 days, the total number of confirmed cases climbed up to 1, 000, accompanied by a doubling period of less than 3 days. About one week later, after this number exceeded 4, 000 cases, and following some extreme lockdown measures taken by the Israeli government, the daily infection rate started a sharp decrease from the peak value of 1, 131 down to slightly more than 100 new confirmed cases on April 30. Motivated by this encouraging data, similar to the trends observed in many other countries, along with the growing economic pressures, the Israeli government has quickly lifted most of its emergency regulations. Throughout May, the daily number of new cases stayed at a very low level of 20-40 until at the end of May it started a steady increase, exceeding 1, 000 by the end of June and 2, 000 on July 22. As suggested by some experts and popular media, this disturbing trend may be even a part of a ""second wave"". This article attempts to analyze the data available on Israel at the end of July 2020, compared to three European countries (Greece, Italy, and Sweden), in order to understand the local dynamics of COVID-19, assess the effect of the implemented intervention measures, and discuss some plausible scenarios for the foreseeable future.","Last, Mark",PLoS One,,607
368988,Teaching residents how to deliver active learning during didactic lectures,2021,"Washing hands properly and frequently is the simplest and most cost-effective interventions to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. People are often ignorant about proper handwashing in different situations and do not know if they wash hands properly. Smartwatches are found to be effective for assessing the quality of handwashing. However, the existing smartwatch based systems are not comprehensive enough in terms of achieving accuracy as well as reminding people to handwash and providing feedback to the user about the quality of handwashing. On-device processing is often required to provide real-time feedback to the user, and so it is important to develop a system that runs efficiently on low-resource devices like smartwatches. However, none of the existing systems for handwashing quality assessment are optimized for on-device processing. We present iWash, a comprehensive system for quality assessment and context-aware reminder for handwashing with real-time feedback using smartwatches. iWash is a hybrid deep neural network based system that is optimized for on-device processing to ensure high accuracy with minimal processing time and battery usage. Additionally, it is a context-aware system that detects when the user is entering home using a Bluetooth beacon and provides reminders to wash hands. iWash also offers touch-free interaction between the user and the smartwatch that minimizes the risk of germ transmission. We collected a real-life dataset and conducted extensive evaluations to demonstrate the performance of iWash. Compared to the existing handwashing quality assessment systems, we achieve around 12% higher accuracy for quality assessment, as well as we reduce the processing time and battery usage by around 37% and 10%, respectively.","Samyoun, Sirat; Shubha, Sudipta Saha; Mondol, Md Abu Sayeed; Stankovic, John A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10317v1.pdf,607

We use daily new case counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health administrations from different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize a model that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We then introduce a time-varying control input that represents the level of social distancing imposed on the population of a given area and solve an optimal control problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing on the economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level of suppression for the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with the exception of the initial time and of the final time, the optimal control input is well approximated by a constant, specific to each area, which is in contrast with the current system of reopening `in phases'. For all the areas considered, this optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the level estimated from data. Proper selection of the time period for application of the control action optimally is important: depending on the particular MSA this period should be either short or long or intermediate. Finally, we see that small deviations from the optimal solution can lead to dramatic violations of the constraints.","Shirin, Afroza; Lin, Yen Ting; Sorrentino, Francesco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03753v1.pdf,607

The secondary objective was to investigate the status of systemic inflammatory parameters, such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and platelet-monocyte ratio (PMR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of patients with primary TCBC who underwent transurethral resection were retrospectively evaluated. The relationship of DRR and systemic inflammatory parameters with clinicopathological findings, recurrence, and progression status was evaluated separately. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the DRR according to the clinicopathological findings, recurrence, and progression. Significant differences were found between the NLR and the patient groups for tumor diameter, tumor stage, tumor grade, and progression. In univariate analysis, the LMR was found to be associated with progression, and also the PLR and LMR were found to be associated with recurrence. Decrease in LMR and increase in LMR score demonstrated by multiple analysis was shown as independent predictors of progression and recurrence development. CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows a positive correlation between poor prognosis in TCBC and the systemic inflammatory markers, namely NLR, LMR, PLR, and PMR, but not DRR.","Batur, Ali Furkan; Aydogan, Muhammed Furkan; Kilic, Ozcan; Korez, Muslu Kazim; Gul, Murat; Kaynar, Mehmet; Goktas, Serdar; Akand, Murat",Int J Clin Pract,,607
381481,Measures to strengthen primary health-care systems in low- and middle-income countries,2020,"Decoherence corrections increase the accuracy of mixed quantum-classical nonadiabatic molecular dynamics methods, but they typically require explicit knowledge of the potential energy surfaces of all occupied electronic states. This requirement renders them impractical for applications in which large numbers of electronic states are occupied. The authors recently introduced the collapse to a block (TAB) decoherence correction [M. P. Esch and B. G. Levine, J. Chem. Phys. 152, 234105 (2020)], which incorporates a state-pairwise definition of decoherence time to accurately describe dynamics on more than two electronic states. In this work, TAB is extended by introduction of a scheme for efficiently computing a small number of approximate eigenstates of the electronic Hamiltonian, eliminating the need for explicit knowledge of a large number of potential energy surfaces. This adaptation of TAB for dense manifolds of states (TAB-DMS) is systematically improvable by increasing the number of computed approximate eigenstates. Application to a series of one-dimensional model problems demonstrates that TAB-DMS can be accurate when even a very modest number of approximate eigenstates are computed (four in all models tested here). Comparison of TAB simulations to exact quantum dynamical simulations indicates that TAB is quite accurate so long as the decoherence correction is carefully parameterized.","Esch, Michael P; Levine, Benjamin G",J Chem Phys,,607

Further analysis suggests that the central region made some progress in LCD due to the decline of potential energy intensity. Nonetheless, the west must pay attention to the high potential energy intensity and deteriorating industry structure for the persistent poor LCD. And the provincial results indicate that the poorer the economy, the worse the LCD. The LCD formation and evolution mechanism of the various provinces are highly heterogeneous. Overall, we underscore the comprehensive investigation of inequality issues of LCD and provide insights for other regions desiring to develop the low-carbon economy.","Liu, Ying; Wang, Miao; Feng, Chao",J Environ Manage,,607

METHODS: The ABC score from 2-hourly measurements of FEV1 was compared between workers with confirmed OA and asthmatics without occupational exposure to identify the optimum separation using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Separate analyses were made for plots using clock time and time from waking to allow for use in shift workers. Minimum record criteria were &#8805;6 readings per day, >4 day shifts and >4 rest days (or >9 days for controls). RESULTS: A retrospective analysis identified 22 workers with OA and 30 control asthmatics whose records reached the quality standards. Median FEV1 diurnal variation was 20.3% (IQR 16.1-32.6) for OA and 19.5% (IQR 14.5-26.1) for asthmatic controls. ROC curve analysis identified that a difference of 0.056 L/hour gave a ROC score of 0.821 for clock time and 0.768 for time from waking with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 93% for the diagnosis of OA. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of OA requires objective confirmation. Unsupervised serial FEV1 measurements are more difficult to obtain reliably than measurements of peak expiratory flow, which are likely to remain the standard for general use. A FEV1 ABC score >0.056 L/hour provides a valid cut-off for those who wish to use FEV1 rather than peak expiratory flow.","Parkes, Edward D; Moore, Vicky C; Walters, Gareth I; Burge, Peter Sherwood",Occup. environ. med,,607

CASE REPORT: This case is about a 20-year old male with a severe COVID-19, hospitalized in a Reanimation and Intensive Care Unit with an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, thromboembolic complication and secondary bacterial infection. This patient had a non-specific neurological disorder with a pseudobulbar palsy, (MRI, ENMG and lumbar puncture were normal), associated 4 months later with persistent left shoulder motor deficit and respiratory failure. Respiratory and neurological check-up led to a diagnosis of the Parsonage-Turner syndrome or neuralgic amyotrophy affecting C5-C6 nerve roots, the lateral pectoral and phrenic nerves at the origin of the scapular belt, amyotrophy and left diaphragm paralysis. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that persistant dyspnoea after COVID 19 infection should lead to a search for a diaphragmatic cause which is not always the result of Reanimation Neuropathy but may also indicate a neuralgic amyotrophy. It is the fourth case of neuralgic amyotrophy following COVID-19. This brings the medical community to consider the risk of diaphragm paralysis apart from critical illness polyneuropathy.

The objective of this study was to analyse the efficacy of telemedicine (by telephone) in monitoring patients in a coloproctology unit, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Prospective descriptive study of consecutive patients in a single centre. The result of the teleconsultation was classified as discharge, resolved visit or reprogramming and was analysed by different diagnostic groups. RESULTS: From March 19th to April 17th, 2020, the teleconsultation of 190 patients was carried out. The response rate was 94.2% (179). The diagnostic categories of the patients attended were: 51 (26.9%) colorectal neoplasia, 48 (25.3%) proctological pathology, 72 (37.9%) pelvic floor dysfunctions and 19 (10%) other benign pathologies. 105 (55.26%) could be recited as if they had come in person. Eleven (5.8%) patients were discharged. No significant differences were found between the different diagnostic categories and the resolution of the teleconsultation. The reasons for reprogramming are analyzed in the study. CONCLUSION: In the context of a pandemic, teleconsultation has allowed 61% of follow-up visits to be definitively solved, avoiding the reprogramming of 116 patients. The new social and health paradigm after the pandemic will require a rethinking of our healthcare model, and in many aspects, telemedicine can offer tools for this.","Muñoz-Duyos, Arantxa; Abarca-Alvarado, Natalia; Lagares-Tena, Laura; Sobrerroca, Laura; Costa, Daniel; Boada, Mercè; Ureña, Dolors; Delgado-Rivilla, Salvadora",Cir.

430256,Pragmatic application of AUC-based monitoring recommendations from the 2020 vancomycin consensus guidelines,2021,"PURPOSE: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) rates have increased substantially in the recent decades worldwide, with Germany being one of the leading countries in the prevalence of TKA. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of treatment changes during the last decade and to project the expected burden of primary and revision TKA (rTKA) for the next 30 years. METHODS: Comprehensive nationwide data from Germany was used to quantify primary and revision TKA rates as a function of age and gender. Projections were performed with use of a Poisson regression models and a combination of exponential smoothing and autoregressive integrated moving average models on historical procedure rates in relation to official population projections from 2020 to 2050. RESULTS: The incidence rate of primary TKAs is projected to increase by around 43% to 299 per 100,000 inhabitants [95% CI 231-368], leading to a projected total number of 225,957 primary TKAs in 2050 (95% CI 178,804-276,442). This increase has been related to a growing number of TKA performed in male patients, with the highest increase modelled in patients between 50 and 65 years of age. At the same time, the annual total number of revision procedures is forecast to increase even more rapidly by almost 90%, accounting for 47,313 (95% CI 15,741-78,885; IR = 62.7 per 100,000, 95% CI 20.8-104.5) procedures by 2050. Those numbers are primarily associated with a rising number of rTKAs secondary to periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). CONCLUSIONS: Using this country- specific forecast approach, a rising number of primary TKA and an even more rapidly growing number of rTKA, especially for PJI, has been projected until 2050, which will inevitably provide a huge challenge for the future health care system. As many other industrialized nations will face similar demographic and procedure-specific developments, these forecasts should be alarming for many health care systems worldwide and emphasize the tremendous need for an appropriate financial and human resource management in the future.

This implies an innovation, being the degree of satisfaction of patients unknown. Methods: A telephonic survey was conducted with the validated in the Spanish tool Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (Telehealth Usability Questionnaire; rating from 1-7) of all candidate patients assisted consecutively in the Coloproctology Unit. We included demographic variables, education level, job status, diagnosis and consultation type. A descriptive study was done. The relationship between the willingness of consultation model in the future (telemedicine vs traditional) and the categorical variables was analysed through the chi-squared test. Results: A total of 115 patients were included. The average age was 59.9 years, being 60% women. The average score in each of the survey items was higher than 6 in all the questions but 1. 26.1% of the surveyed patients confessed being advocated to tele-assistance in the future. The only factors related to greater willingness to tele-assistance were male gender (37% vs 18.8%; P = .03) and a higher academic preparation level in favour of higher technical studies (35.9%) and university studies (32.4%) opposite to the rest (P = .043).

437921,Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on Western Australian Children’s Physical Activity and Screen Time,2021,"The procurement and maintenance cost of high-end ventilators preclude their stockpiles sufficient for the mass emergency situations. Therefore, there is a significant demand for mechanical ventilators in such situations. Herein, a low-cost, portable, yet high-performance design for a volume-controlled mechanical ventilator is proposed. Pneumatic artificial muscles, such as air cylinders, are used in the inverse mode of operation to achieve mechanical ventilation. With the current design, the two fundamental modes of operation (controlled mode and assisted mode) are demonstrated. Unlike most intensive care unit ventilators, the proposed device does not need a high-pressure air pipeline to operate. The device is capable of mechanical ventilation for respiration rate ranging from 10 to 30 b min-1 with a tidal volume (VT) range of 150-1000 mL and the I:E ratio of 1:1-1:5. A total cost of less than $400 USD is achieved to make one device. The cost to produce the device in larger volumes can be estimated to be less than $250 USD.","Mirvakili, Seyed M; Sim, Douglas; Langer, Robert",Adv Intell Syst,,607

This new rapidly spreading virus causes enormous stress to healthcare systems as large number of patients present with respiratory failure, needing intubation and mechanical ventilation. While the industry is racing to meet the rising demand for ventilators, all the alternative respiratory support modalities are employed to save lives in hospitals around the globe. We hereby report 6 patients who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with continuous positive airway pressure in a negative pressure isolated room in a tertiary center in western Greece. The rapid progression of mild flu-like symptoms to respiratory failure in all patients was controlled with the use of continuous positive airway pressure making this strategy a reasonable alternative to respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 as it may avert intubation and mechanical ventilation.","Velissaris, Dimitrios; Aretha, Diamanto; Tsiotsios, Konstantinos; Gogos, Charalambos; Karamouzos, Vasileios",Adv Respir Med,,607

The crystal structure of eEF1A2 protein purified from rabbit skeletal muscle reveals a post-translationally modified dimer that provides information about the sites of interaction with numerous binding partners, including itself, and maps these mutations onto the dimer and tetramer interfaces. The spatial locations of the side chain carboxylates of Glu301 and Glu374, to which phosphatidylethanolamine is uniquely attached via an amide bond, define the anchoring points of eEF1A2 to cellular membranes and interorganellar membrane contact sites. Additional bioinformatic and molecular modeling results provide novel structural insight into the demonstrated binding of eEF1A2 to SH3 domains, the common MAPK docking groove, filamentous actin, and phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase IIIß. In this new light, the role of eEF1A2 as an ancient, multifaceted, and articulated G protein at the crossroads of autophagy, oncogenesis and viral replication appears very distant from the ""canonical"" one of delivering aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome that has dominated the scene and much of the thinking for many decades.","Carriles, Alejandra A; Mills, Alberto; Muñoz-Alonso, María-José; Gutiérrez, Dolores; Domínguez, Juan M; Hermoso, Juan A; Gago, Federico",Chembiochem,,607
450535,Voluntary Reduction of Social Interaction during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Taiwan: Related Factors and Association with Perceived Social Support,2020,"Cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 requires the binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike protein and the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As such, RBD has become the major target for vaccine development, while RBD-specific antibodies are pursued as therapeutics. Here, we report the development and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific VHH/nanobody (Nb) from immunized alpacas. Seven RBD-specific Nbs with high stability were identified using phage display. They bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with affinity KD ranging from 2.6 to 113 nM, and six of them can block RBD-ACE2 interaction. The fusion of the Nbs with IgG1 Fc resulted in homodimers with greatly improved RBD-binding affinities (KD ranging from 72.7 pM to 4.5 nM) and nanomolar RBD-ACE2 blocking abilities. Furthermore, the fusion of two Nbs with non-overlapping epitopes resulted in hetero-bivalent Nbs, namely aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7, with significantly higher RBD binding affinities (KD of 59.2 pM and 0.25 nM) and greatly enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing potency. The 50% neutralization dose (ND50) of aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7 was 1.22 ng/mL (â¼0.043 nM) and 3.18 ng/mL (â¼0.111 nM), respectively. These high-affinity SARS-CoV-2 blocking Nbs could be further developed into therapeutics as well as diagnostic reagents for COVID-19.ImportanceTo date, SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous loss of human life and economic output worldwide. Although a few COVID-19 vaccines have been approved in several countries, the development of effective therapeutics, including SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies, remains critical. Due to their small size (13-15 kDa), high solubility, and stability, Nbs are particularly well suited for pulmonary delivery and more amenable to engineer into multivalent formats than the conventional antibody. Here, we report a series of new anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nbs isolated from immunized alpaca and two engineered hetero-bivalent Nbs. These potent neutralizing Nbs showed promise as potential therapeutics against COVID-19.","Ma, Huan; Zeng, Weihong; Meng, Xiangzhi; Huang, Xiaoxue; Yang, Yunru; Zhao, Dan; Zhou, Peigen; Wang, Xiaofang; Zhao, Changcheng; Sun, Yong; Wang, Peihui; Ou, Huichao; Hu, Xiaowen; Xiang, Yan; Jin, Tengchuan",J. virol,,607

458362,Estimation of COVID-19 epidemiology curve of the United States using genetic programming algorithm,2021,"SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, has been spreading rampantly. The global scientific community has responded rapidly to understand immune correlates of protection to develop vaccines and immunotherapeutics against the virus. The major goal of this mini review is to summarize current understanding of the structural landscape of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of viral spike (S) glycoprotein. The RBD plays a critical role in the very first step of the virus life cycle. Better understanding of where and how nAbs bind the RBD should enable identification of sites of vulnerability and facilitate better vaccine design and formulation of immunotherapeutics. Towards this goal, we compiled 38 RBD-binding nAbs with known structures. Review of these nAb structures showed that (1) nAbs can be divided into five general clusters, (2) there are distinct non-neutralizing faces on the RBD, and (3) maximum of potentially four nAbs could bind the RBD simultaneously. Since most of these nAbs were isolated from virus-infected patients, additional analyses of vaccine-induced nAbs could facilitate development of improved vaccines.","Niu, Ling; Wittrock, Kathryn N; Clabaugh, Gage C; Srivastava, Vikram; Cho, Michael W",Front Immunol,,607

It examines their training, impact, and the institutional use implicit in the performance audit. From an anthropological perspective, the audit could traditionally be considered as “Rituals of Verification,” recognizing the procedure and the evaluation of social effects, in public management. Therefore, sampling represents an effective and efficient tool for carrying out the statutory audit activity in the health care facilities where the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) virus is treated. However, the performance established a regulatory dimension compared to the concept of verification. In addition, auditing practices may often seem “trivial, inevitable part of a bureaucratic process,” but taken together and over time, they are probably part of a distinct cultural artifact. As we have seen, the reasons that justify the activation of a clinical audit can be numerous: patient complaints, occurrence of adverse events such as the case of COVID-19, performance with inadequate results, publication of new guidelines;however, the “bet” is that in the future the awareness that auditing is an irreplaceable part of professional practice will mature among professionals. © The Author(s) 2021.","de Nichilo, S.",Journal of Patient Experience,,607

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of SNF patients using 100% Medicare inpatient claims and Minimum Data Set resident assessment data. Linear probability models were used to estimate the probability of successful discharge based on patient and staff beliefs about the patient's ability to improve in function and patients and staff beliefs together. Estimates were adjusted for demographic, health status, functional characteristics, and SNF fixed effects. PARTICIPANTS: Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged &#8805;66 years who were discharged to a SNF following hospitalization for stroke, hip fracture or TBI. INTERVENTIONS: Not Applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Successful community discharge (discharged alive within 90 days of SNF admission and remaining in the community for &#8805; 30 days without dying or health care facility readmission). RESULTS: Patients with positive beliefs about their capability to increase independence with ADLs had a higher adjusted probability of successful discharge than patients with negative beliefs (positive: 63.8%, negative: 57.8%, difference: 6.0%, 95%CI=5.4, 6.6%). This remained true regardless of staff beliefs, but the difference in successful discharge probability between patients with positive and negative beliefs was larger when staff had positive beliefs. Conversely, the association between staff beliefs and successful discharge varied based on patient beliefs: if patients had positive beliefs, the difference in the probability of successful discharge between positive and negative staff beliefs was 2.5% (95%CI=1.0, 4.0). If patients had negative beliefs, the difference between positive and negative staff beliefs was -4.6% (95%CI=-6.0, -3.2). CONCLUSIONS: Patients' beliefs have a significant association with the probability of successful discharge. Understanding patients' beliefs is critical to appropriate goal-setting, discharge planning and quality SNF care.","Evans, Emily; Kosar, Cyrus M; Thomas, Kali S",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,,607

Objective: To describe the epidemiology, clinical, and laboratory features of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at a children's hospital and to compare these parameters between patients hospitalized with and without severe disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective review of electronic medical records from a tertiary care academically affiliated children's hospital in New York City, New York, included hospitalized children and adolescents (&#8804;21 years) who were tested based on suspicion for COVID-19 between March 1 to April 15, 2020, and had positive results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Exposures: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal specimen using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severe disease as defined by the requirement for mechanical ventilation. Results: Among 50 patients, 27 (54%) were boys and 25 (50%) were Hispanic. The median days from onset of symptoms to admission was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-5 days). Most patients (40 [80%]) had fever or respiratory symptoms (32 [64%]), but 3 patients (6%) with only gastrointestinal tract presentations were identified. Obesity (11 [22%]) was the most prevalent comorbidity. Respiratory support was required for 16 patients (32%), including 9 patients (18%) who required mechanical ventilation. One patient (2%) died. None of 14 infants and 1 of 8 immunocompromised patients had severe disease. Obesity was significantly associated with mechanical ventilation in children 2 years or older (6 of 9 [67%] vs 5 of 25 [20%]; P = .03). Lymphopenia was commonly observed at admission (36 [72%]) but did not differ significantly between those with and without severe disease. Those with severe disease had significantly higher C-reactive protein (median, 8.978 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10] vs 0.64 mg/dL) and procalcitonin levels (median, 0.31 ng/mL vs 0.17 ng/mL) at admission (P < .001), as well as elevated peak interleukin 6, ferritin, and D-dimer levels during hospitalization. Hydroxychloroquine was administered to 15 patients (30%) but could not be completed for 3. Prolonged test positivity (maximum of 27 days) was observed in 4 patients (8%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series study of children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19, the disease had diverse manifestations. Infants and immunocompromised patients were not at increased risk of severe disease. Obesity was significantly associated with disease severity.

This research aims to investigate the influences of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, utilitarian and hedonic motivations on consumer intention to buy books online. It conceptualizes the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as situational influences, which involve the closure of physical bookstores, health risks associated with visiting such stores, online shopping trend and additional marketing efforts from online bookstores during the pandemic. Data were collected from 275 Vietnamese consumers using an online survey. Multivariate data analysis reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic situation has a positive and significant impact on consumer intention toward online book shopping. Furthermore, while utilitarian motivation exerts a strong effect on consumer intention to purchase books online, the relationship between hedonic motivation and online purchase intention is positive but insignificant. These findings would assist key stakeholders such as publishers and online bookstores to improve the quality of their websites as well as develop their marketing campaigns.","Nguyen, Hoang Viet; Tran, Hiep Xuan; Van Huy, Le; Nguyen, Xuan Nhi; Do, Minh Thanh; Nguyen, Ninh",Publ.

501879,Possible dulaglutide-associated cholecystitis with safe continuation post cholecystectomy,2021,"Health information sharing has become especially important during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic because people need to learn about the disease and then act accordingly. This study examines the perceived trust of different COVID-19 information sources (health professionals, academic institutions, government agencies, news media, social media, family, and friends) and sharing of COVID-19 information in China. Specifically, it investigates how beliefs about sharing and emotions mediate the effects of perceived source trust on source-specific information sharing intentions. Results suggest that health professionals, academic institutions, and government agencies are trusted sources of information and that people share information from these sources because they think doing so will increase disease awareness and promote disease prevention. People may also choose to share COVID-19 information from news media, social media, and family as they cope with anxiety, anger, and fear. Taken together, a better understanding of the distinct psychological mechanisms underlying health information sharing from different sources can help contribute to more effective sharing of information about COVID-19 prevention and to manage negative emotion contagion during the pandemic.","Lu, Linqi; Liu, Jiawei; Yuan, Y Connie; Burns, Kelli S; Lu, Enze; Li, Dongxiao",Health Educ Behav,,607

In this study, we aimed to compare the butanol olfactory threshold values between COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers.A cross-sectional study was designed. A total of 53 patients were included in the COVID-19 group and the control group. The definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 was made with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Frequency of odor and taste dysfunction and other head and neck system-specific and other symptoms were recorded. Afterward, olfactory threshold values determined according to Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) test principle for study groups. 21 patients included in the COVID-19 group and 32 patients in the control group. Symptom onset time was 7.1 ± 3.1 (min: 3, max: 14) days for COVID-19 patients. The most common symptom in the otolaryngology system was olfactory dysfunction (n = 15, 71.4%). The butanol olfactory threshold value was determined as an average of 4.4 ± 1.9 in the COVID-19 group and 6.4 ± 0.8 in the control group (p < 0.001, 95% CI 2.9-1.0). The sensitivity of the butanol threshold test for COVID-19 related olfactory dysfunction was 80.0% and the specificity was 66.6%. For differential, early and initial, diagnosis of COVID-19, complaint of the smell dysfunctions, and impairment butanol threshold may be a distinctive indicator.","Islek, Akif; Balci, Mustafa Koray",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,607

CONTENT: Potentially eligible original research articles were identified through a systematic search in PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science and WHO Virtual Health Library from 2000 to 2018. From the initial search, a total of 7,258 research articles were obtained. Duplicate studies were identified and removed. Observational studies on children and adolescents (5-19 years) of any gender, ethnicity and country were included in which the outcome measured was either a scoring of/ association between nutrition knowledge and practices. After screening using the inclusion criteria, 13 studies were selected for this paper. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK: Four studies reported non-significant association between overall nutrition knowledge and practices. Only two studies found a significant association, out of which one showed a weak association highlighting that nutrition knowledge is not sufficient to result in healthy eating. Other factors which showed significant but weak associations with knowledge/practices included age, gender, nutritional status and lifestyle, peer influence, parents'/guardians' knowledge, education and occupation level. The causal relationship couldn't be examined in the present review due to the cross-sectional nature of the studies. Besides imparting knowledge through nutrition education interventions, there is a need for holistic behaviour change strategies including supporting food skills like menu planning, food shopping and cooking to encourage healthy eating habits among children. These interventions should target children from an early age, involving family/parents, teachers and peers to facilitate improvement in the food environment for sustainable change.","Thakur, Sunaina; Mathur, Pulkit",Int. j. adolesc. med. health,,607

It is known that a healthy intestinal flora is closely related to the maintenance of pulmonary and systemic health by regulating the host immune homeostasis.

At the NHS Nightingale Hospital, London, the staff underwent a training programme prior to entering the clinical environment with simulation being a core component. This paper describes the rationale for choosing an initial debriefing model which evolved overtime to consider multiple contextual factors: demands of the clinical environment, the diverse participants and their learning needs, the variable experience of faculty, and the dynamic nature of available debriefing time. The new approach, termed here as the Dynamic Plus-Delta model, blends the traditional Plus-Delta approach with specific dynamic elements which considers the unique demands of rapidly training large number of staff. We outline the core features of this model and detail specific considerations around psychological safety. This debriefing approach can be used in similar simulation intervention settings where rapid training of participants is required with multiple and varying contextual factors.","Kainth, Ranjev",Adv Simul (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1186/s41077-021-00185-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620251/,607

Each viral pathogen has unique, frequently nuanced, aspects to its replication, which affects the host response and as a consequence the capacity of the virus to produce disease. There are, however, common features to the T cell response to viruses, which produce acute limited infection. This is true whether virus replication is restricted to a single site, for example, the respiratory tract (RT), CNS etc., or replication is in multiple sites throughout the body. In describing below the acute T cell response to virus infection, we employ acute virus infection of the RT as a convenient model to explore this process of virus infection and the host response. We divide the process into three phases: the induction (initiation) of the response, the expression of antiviral effector activity resulting in virus elimination, and the resolution of inflammation with restoration of tissue homeostasis.","Kim, Taeg S.; Sun, Jie; Legge, Kevin L.; Braciale, Thomas J.",Encyclopedia of Immunobiology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123742797140111; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123742797140111,607

By assessing the ability of health systems to manage COVID-19 from the perspective of two key approaches to global health policy—global health security and universal health coverage—important lessons can be drawn for how to align varied priorities and objectives in strengthening health systems. This Health Policy paper compares three types of health systems (ie, with stronger investments in global health security, stronger investments in universal health coverage, and integrated investments in global health security and universal health coverage) in their response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and synthesises four essential recommendations (ie, integration, financing, resilience, and equity) to reimagine governance, policies, and investments for better health towards a more sustainable future.","Lal, Arush; Erondu, Ngozi A; Heymann, David L; Gitahi, Githinji; Yates, Robert",Lancet,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)32228-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275906/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673620322285; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620322285,607
604371,A review of mental health and wellbeing under climate change in small island developing states (SIDS),2021-03-03,"BACKGROUND: Survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is dependent on early recognition, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation. The purpose of CPR is to maintain some blood flow until the arrival of the emergency medical services (EMS). Our concern is that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on the number of patients who get CPR before EMS arrival. The aim of this study is to compare the incidence of bystander CPR during the pandemic with data from before the pandemic. METHODS: The protocol is for a retrospective cohort study where data from existing registries will be used. All participating registries will share aggregated data from 2017 to 2020, and the study team will compare the results from 2020 to results from 2017 to 2019. Due to the General Data Protection Regulation, each participating registry will check for completeness and plausibility, and perform all aggregation of data locally. In the following analysis different registries will be considered as random samples and analysed by means of a generalized linear mixed effects model with Poisson distribution for the outcome, the population covered as offsets, and different registries as random factors. DISCUSSION: This study does not present the prospect of direct benefit to the patient, but does provide an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of bystander CPR for OHCA patients during a pandemic. By comparing data during the pandemic with already collected information in established registries we believe we can gain valuable information about changes in public response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of NSI as a preoperative management and to identify the percentage of patients who ultimately underwent ESS for recalcitrant CRS despite being on NSI. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients presenting with CRS who underwent a trial of NSI for at least six weeks. Pre‐irrigation and post‐irrigation outcomes measured included Lund‐Mackay scores (LMS), SNOT‐22 scores, and whether or not the patient underwent ESS. RESULTS: Of the 90 patients who underwent NSI, 32 patients underwent ESS, while 58 patients had a significant enough improvement in symptoms to avoid ESS. The likelihood of decision for surgery did not differ between the mometasone and budesonide groups (p=0.3094), comorbid asthma status (p=0.3585), smoking status (p=0.2256), polyp status (p=0.7288), or history of prior ESS (p=0.5803). SNOT scores significantly improvement following NSI in the group of patients that did not go on to ESS (p<0.0001) and in the group that did (p<0.0001). LMS also improved following NSI, but this was only statistically significant in the patients that ultimately went on to ESS (p=0.0102). CONCLUSIONS: After a trial of NSI, 64.4% of patients with CRS no longer met candidacy for ESS and had a significant improvement in SNOT‐22 scores. This supports the use of nasal steroid irrigations in the medical management of CRS with and without surgical intervention and with and without nasal polyposis.

Based on a statistical test, the distributions of the doubling time of these two groups were significantly different (p=0.007). Miller et al. reported the relationship between BCG vaccination and mortality for COVID-19 based on deaths per million inhabitants. However, they did not take into account the differences in COVID-19 detection rates among the countries and the epidemic stages of the countries. Therefore we used a doubling time of the death toll as a more stable indicator instead. We also investigated the dependency of the BCG strains. Among the 42 BCG-vaccinated countries, the median doubling time of the eight countries using ""Tokyo 172-1"" strain at least partially (Japan, Iraq, Malaysia, South Korea, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) was 7.2 days, and that of the other 34 vaccinated countries was 5.5 days.

This can be achieved using standardised evidence-based national treatment protocols for common childhood cancers. The aim of the study was to describe the development and implementation of the SACCSG NB-2017 neuroblastoma (NB) treatment protocol as part of the treatment harmonisation process of the South African Children’s Cancer Study Group. METHODS: The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to identify factors that could influence the implementation of the national NB protocol as a health care intervention. The evaluation was done according to five interactive domains for implementation: intervention characteristics, inner setting, outer setting, individual or team characteristics and the implementation process. RESULTS: The protocol was developed over 26 months by 26 physicians involved in childhood cancer management. The process included an organisational phase, a resource identification phase, a development phase and a research ethics approval phase. Challenges included nationalised inertia, variable research ethical approval procedures with delays and uncoordinated clinical trial implementation. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the national NB protocol demonstrated the complexity of the implementation of a national childhood cancer treatment protocol.

The interleukin-6 (IL-6), acting as a pleiotropic cytokine, play key roles in main autoimmune disorders. The recombinant anti-IL-6R fusion proteins (VHH-0031) constructed and obtained in our lab is a dual target-directed single domain-based fusion protein against the interleukin-6 receptor. This study aims to explore the renoprotective effect of VHH-0031 in diabetic nephropathy. VHH-0031 treatment alleviated renal inflammation, morphologic injury and renal insufficiency in both Goto-Kakizaki rats and STZ-induced Sprague Dawley rats. These renoprotective effects of VHH-0031 are associated with alleviating inflammation and suppression of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. The mesangial cells treated with VHH-0031 exhibited anti-proliferation, anti-inflammation and inactivation of JAK2/STAT3 pathway under high glucose condition. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that VHH-0031 exhibited a potent protective effect in kidney of diabetic rats and its mechanism may be concerned with the inhibition of the IL-6R/JAK2/STAT3 pathway of glomerular mesangial cells.","Zhang, Nanwen; Zheng, Qingmei; Wang, Yaduan; Lin, Juan; Wang, He; Liu, Rui; Yan, Mengru; Chen, Xiaofeng; Yang, Juhua; Chen, Xiaole",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.681424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054555/,607

COVID-19 anti-Asian racism signifies the relevance of race and racism during public health crises and highlights the importance of examining the psychological impacts of racialized stress and avenues for resilience during a pandemic. This article describes a conceptual model that emphasizes the importance of rechanneling the experience of COVID-19 anti-Asian racism toward resilience. Specifically, the proposed model identifies a tripartite process of collective psychosocial resilience, comprised of (a) critical consciousness of discrimination as a common fate, (b) critical consciousness-informed racial/ethnic identity, and (c) advocacy, for empowering Asian Americans and protecting them against the harmful effects of COVID-19 anti-Asian racism during and beyond the pandemic. Theoretical and empirical underpinnings of the proposed tripartite process for cultivating resilience against COVID-19 anti-Asian racism are delineated.

614461,Pharmacist intervention on prescribing errors: Use of a standardized approach in the inpatient setting,2021-07-20,"INTRODUCTION ‐: COVID19 has become one of the world's leading problems. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV)‐2 enters the human body through droplet transmission and oroanal route. The pathological manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 is mediated through key proteins involved in viral entry into the host and replication of the virus within the host. Specifically, the RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) employs a replicative function in multiplying and transmitting the virus, aided by other nsps, nsp7 and 8 forming functional complex; similarly, the spike protein is necessary for the virus to enter the host by binding to ACE receptors. Given the limited available treatments and urgency for the development of prophylactic agents and therapeutic drugs for the control of SARS‐CoV‐2 and treatment of COVID19, traditional treatment methods using natural resources are decisive. To address the pandemic, a drug targeting the function of these key proteins and protein complexes will be potentially more successful and effective. Use of medically important plants with antiviral activity including, Glycyrrhiza glabra (G glabra) and isolation of potential natural active ingredients is more beneficial and effective. Here we elucidated the potential interactions of known phytochemicals from G glabra and key SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins. METHODS ‐: A molecular docking algorithm, PatchDock, was used to study the interactions between viral target proteins and phytochemicals of G. glabra. The molecular display program, Chimera was used to display the interactions between the phytochemicals of G. glabra and viral proteins. RESULTS ‐: Of the 20 reported compounds (GG1 ‐ GG20) that we used for our studies, 13 of the compounds have effectively bound to inhibit the SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins, nsp7/8/12 complex including RdRp and/or spike protein. Specifically, the compounds GG3 and GG4 achieved lower ACE scores than ‐100 binding to all three key proteins of the SARS‐COV‐2. Compound GG4 binds to the Spike Protein that mediate binding of SARS‐COV‐2 to the ACE Receptor of host cell, thereby inhibiting the entry of virus. GG4 also binds to close to the active site of nsp‐complex. However, GG3 binds close to the active site of the RdRp where the thumb, finger, and palm domains meet. GG3 also binds close to the nsp7/8/12 complex in which chains 7 and 12 join together, forming a more effective complex to inhibit the viral replication. Our additional docking studies of phytochemicals of G. glabra and viral proteins will show effective binding of phytochemicals with viral proteins that inhibit either the entry and/or replication and transmission of the SARS‐CoV‐2. CONCLUSION –: In conclusion, GG3 and GG4 from Glycyrrhiza glabra have demonstrated the ability to prevent the entry and replication of SARS‐COV‐2 proteins by inhibiting the functions of Spike and RdRp proteins in silico.","Kona, Abhishek; Kona, Abhinav; Aramgam, Sreelatha; Muppuru, Kesavulu; Badri, Kameswara",FASEB J,https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2021.35.s1.05050,607
614651,Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS): An Innovative Tool for Prompt Identification of Infectious Diseases during Outbreaks,2021-03-20,"Pathogens pose a continuous challenge for the survival of the host species. In response to the pathogens, the host immune system mounts orchestrated defense responses initiating various mechanisms both at the cellular and molecular levels, including multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) leading to the initiation of signaling pathways. The network of such pathways results in the recruitment of various innate immune components and cells at the site of infection and activation of the adaptive immune cells, which work in synergy to combat the pathogens. Ubiquitination is one of the most commonly used PTMs. Host cells utilize ubiquitination for both temporal and spatial regulation of immune response pathways. Over the last decade, ubiquitin family proteins, particularly small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMO), have been widely implicated in host immune response. SUMOs are ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins transiently conjugated to a wide variety of proteins through SUMOylation. SUMOs primarily exert their effect on target proteins by covalently modifying them. However, SUMO also engages in a non-covalent interaction with the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in target proteins. Unlike ubiquitination, SUMOylation alters localization, interactions, functions, or stability of target proteins. This review provides an overview of the interplay of SUMOylation and immune signaling and development pathways in general. Additionally, we discuss in detail the regulation exerted by covalent SUMO modifications of target proteins, and SIM mediated non-covalent interactions with several effector proteins. In addition, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on the importance of the SUMO pathway in the development and maintenance of a robust immune system network of the host. We also summarize how pathogens modulate the host SUMO cycle to sustain infectability. Studies dealing mainly with SUMO pathway proteins in the immune system are still in infancy. We anticipate that the field will see a thorough and more directed analysis of the SUMO pathway in regulating different cells and pathways of the immune system. Our current understanding of the importance of the SUMO pathway in the immune system necessitates an urgent need to synthesize specific inhibitors, bioactive regulatory molecules, as novel therapeutic targets.","K., Sajeev T.; Joshi, Garima; Arya, Pooja; Mahajan, Vibhuti; Chaturvedi, Akanksha; Mishra, Ram Kumar",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336833/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.681057,607

SARS-CoV-2 usually enters the human body from the respiratory tract and gradually causes systemic disease. The disease is mild in 81% and severe in the balance. The virus causes multiorgan damage and primarily damages airway epithelium, small intestine epithelium, and vascular endothelium, which are organs with high angiotensin-converting enzyme (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 [ACE2] expression). The most affected organ is the lungs, and the cardiovascular system follows it closely. Symptomatic hypoxic patients are initially treated with oxygen supplementation, but those with severe hypoxia need mechanical ventilation support.

CSF has four major functions: physical support of neural structures, excretion and “sink” action, intracerebral transport, and control of the chemical environment of the central nervous system. CSF provides a “water jacket” of physical support and buoyancy. The CSF is protective because its volume changes reciprocally with changes in the volume of intracranial contents, particularly blood. Thus, the CSF protects the brain from changes in arterial and central venous pressure associated with posture, respiration, and exertion. Acute or chronic pathological changes in intracranial contents can be accommodated, to a point, by changes in the CSF volume. The direct transfer of brain metabolites into the CSF provides excretory function. This capacity is important because the brain lacks a lymphatic system. The lymphatic function of the CSF is also manifested in the removal of large proteins and cells, such as bacteria or blood cells, by bulk CSF absorption. The “sink” action of the CSF arises from the restricted access of water-soluble substances to the CSF and the low concentration of these solutes in the CSF.","Vernau, William; Vernau, Karen A.; Sue Bailey, Cleta",Clinical Biochemistry of Domestic Animals,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012370491700026X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012370491700026X,607

The laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection has relied on nucleic acid tests. However, there are many limitations of nucleic acid tests, including low throughput and high rates of false negatives. More sensitive and accurate tests to effectively identify infected patients are needed. METHODS: This study has developed fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIA) to determine IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum. The assay performance has been evaluated at 10 hospitals. Clinical specificity was evaluated by measuring 972 hospitalized patients with diseases other than COVID-19, and 586 donors of a normal population. Clinical sensitivity was assessed on 503 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and 52 suspected cases. RESULTS: The assays demonstrated satisfied assay precision with coefficient of variation (CV) of less than 4.45%. Inactivation of specimen does not affect assay measurement. SARS-CoV-2 IgM shows clinical specificity of 97.33% and 99.49% for hospitalized patients and normal population respectively. SARS-CoV-2 IgG shows clinical specificity of 97.43% and 99.15% for the hospitalized patients and the normal population respectively. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG show clinical sensitivity of 85.88% and 96.62% respectively for confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection with RT-PCR, of 73.08% and 86.54% respectively for suspected cases.

From a migration perspective, the pandemic is a source of insecurities that challenge migrants, their livelihoods and migration governance. Meanwhile, curtailment in movement has led to economic decline affecting labour markets. For migrant origin and hosting countries, this poses multidimensional development challenges. Analysis from March to August 2020 of China, Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Morocco, Nepal and Thailand highlights the varying ways in which they are all severely affected by the disruptions in migration, suggesting a potentially emerging complex situation in migration patterns and pathways. The disruptions in migration and remittances have had a profound impact on migrants and migrant-sending households. The uncertainty of migration returning to pre-pandemic levels and the potential of lasting consequences on migrants and migration patterns and pathways, suggests a future of greater risk and exploitation, and a wider gap between formal and informal migration.

Testing serves many purposes: isolating the COVID-19 positive tested individuals, identifying the contacts at the risk, and locating the hotspots and safe zones for administrative planning. However, it is a challenging task to identify the right individuals for the test in view of the high COVID -19 spread, a large number of presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and limited testing capabilities. The individuals for COVID -19 are identified based on direct-contact, travel history, and symptoms, which are more individualized and do not explicitly include a group risk assessment, and in turn, do not preclude the transmission from the superspreaders. Policymakers need to limit testing in the shortage of test resources, and focus on gaining the most information from the tests performed. In this work, we introduce a protocol for the identification of the group of individuals to be tested for acquiring maximum risk information of a community with minimum individual tests. Firstly, an algorithm is proposed to determine the risk profile of all the individuals in the community by incorporating serial and parallel pathways of the infection transmission considering multiple steps of transmission. Next, we consider several potential groups that could be tested from the community, and analyze them one by one for their comparison. In a group, few individuals can be positive, and the remaining few can be negative, generating sets of several test-outcomes with unequal probability. The protocol involves the probability calculation and reassessment of the network's risk profile in all the test output cases. Finally, the best group is identified in all the groups studied, in which risk profiles between post and pre-test are maximally different. The analysis shows that in general, information increases with an increase in the group size. Notably, a strategically chosen small group may provide more information from the test results, than a standard larger group. The proposed systematic strategy would help in the selection of the right individuals for the testing, and in extracting far more information from the minimum samples, to effectively aid the epidemic mitigation. The protocol is generic, and can also be applied to any other epidemic spread in the future.","Kumar, A.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.30.20240762; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.30.20240762v1?rss=1,607

631964,Loneliness and Social Engagement in Older Adults Based in Lombardy during the COVID-19 Lockdown: The Long-Term Effects of a Course on Social Networking Sites Use,2020-10-28,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Companion animals (pets) may reduce loneliness and promote the well-being of their guardians (owners). This is important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as companion animal guardians may be less negatively affected by the pandemic. This research examined the influence of companion animals, and specifically ornamental fishes, on mental well-being and loneliness during the pandemic. Data were collected via an online survey and interviews with companion animal guardians. Companion animal guardianship alone was not linked to loneliness or well-being during the pandemic, but there was evidence that people who interacted more with their dogs (and to a lesser extent cats) were lonelier and had poorer well-being; possibly, these individuals spent more time with their dogs/cats because they were more isolated. Open-ended survey responses and interview data identified that most people felt their companion animals were a positive influence during the pandemic, but ornamental fishes were perceived as having a less positive effect than other companion animals, possibly because they cannot provide comfort via physical touch. Consistent with past research, these findings indicate that people believe their companion animals positively influenced their lives during the pandemic, but there is a lack of quantitative evidence to support these beliefs. ABSTRACT: To reduce the spread of COVID-19, countries worldwide placed limitations on social interaction, which is anticipated to have severe psychological consequences. Although findings are inconsistent, prior research has suggested that companion animals may positively influence human well-being and reduce loneliness. In the context of COVID-19, this has important implications, as companion animal guardians may be less negatively affected by the pandemic. The primary aim of this research was to investigate the influence of companion animals on mental well-being and loneliness during the pandemic, with specific interest in the role of ornamental fishes. A mixed-methods study was conducted, using an international sample. Quantitative data were collected via an online survey (n = 1199) and analysed using robust hierarchical multiple regression analyses; the influence of level of engagement with companion animals was examined for dogs, cats and ornamental fishes. There was no evidence that companion animal guardianship was associated with loneliness and mental well-being during the pandemic but spending more time engaging physically or socially with dogs (and to a lesser extent cats) was generally associated with poorer outcomes. Qualitative data were collected through open-ended survey responses (n = 757) and semi-structured interviews (n = 25) and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Two themes were developed—one related to companion animals as providers of social and emotional support, and the other to companion animals as providers of purpose and perspective. Concerns regarding the impact of the pandemic on animal welfare were also identified. Compared to other animal types, more participants expressed indifference regarding the impact of their fishes on their well-being during the pandemic, possibly because fishes cannot provide comfort via physical touch. The findings of this study reflect the wider field of human–animal interaction; although qualitative data suggest guardians believe their companion animals are a positive influence in their lives, there is little convincing quantitative data to support these beliefs. This highlights the need to refine theories regarding which aspects of companion animal guardianship may influence human well-being; the findings from this research may be useful in the refinement of such theories.","Clements, Heather; Valentin, Stephanie; Jenkins, Nicholas; Rankin, Jean; Gee, Nancy R.; Snellgrove, Donna; Sloman, Katherine A.",Animals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11082349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34438806/,607

Blood samples from subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection either admitted to health institutions or outpatients, were enrolled. Highly exposed seronegative individuals, were also enrolled. Longitudinal samples were obtained in a subset of donors, including persons who donated plasma for therapeutic purposes (plasma donors). SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG levels, IgG titers and IgG viral neutralization capacity were determined. Out of 825 donors, 57.1% were females and median age was 41 years (IQR 32–53 years). Donors were segregated as acute or convalescent donors, and mild versus moderate/severe disease donors. Seventy-eight percent showed seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Specific IgM and IgG showed comparable positivity rates in acute donors. IgM detectability rate declined in convalescent donors while IgG detectability remained elevated in early (74,8%) and late (83%) convalescent donors. Among donors with follow-up samples, IgG levels seemed to decline more rapidly in plasma donors. IgG levels were higher with age, disease severity, number of symptoms, and more durable in moderate/severe disease donors. Levels and titers of anti-spike/RBD IgG strongly correlated with neutralization activity against WT virus. The BBEI-COVID19 collection serves a dual role in this SARS-CoV-2 global crisis. First, it feeds researchers and developers transferring samples and data to fuel research projects. Second, it generates highly needed local data to understand and frame the regional dynamics of the infection.","Longueira, Yesica; Polo, María Laura; Turk, Gabriela; Laufer, Natalia",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642643/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S240584402102243X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240584402102243X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08140,607

Interpersonal distance (IPD) plays a critical role in a human being’s social life, especially during interpersonal interaction, and IPD is non-verbal social information and not only provides silent cues but also provides a secure space for personal relationships. IPD has been a research field of neural studies from the recent decade, researches had provided behavior and neural correlates of IPD. Objectives. This review aims to summarize the experimental paradigms of IPD-neural research, to reveal the neural activity processes associated with it, and to explore the correlation between IPD-neural activity and IPD-behavior. Methods. We conducted a standardized systematic review procedure, including the formal search method be adopted to seek out any type of studies related to IPD and brain, then devised them into categories to make a systematic review. Results. 17 articles met the inclusion criteria of the review, 5 event-related potential (ERP) studies measured the amplitude and latencies of ERPs, and 12 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies provided the neural activation during IPD tasks. In addition, the passive IPD experimental paradigm is the main experimental paradigm for exploring neural activity in IPD cognition, with the parietal lobe, motor areas, prefrontal lobe, and amygdala being the main brain areas involved. Functional connections between the identified brain regions were found and have a moderate correlation with IPD behavior. Conclusions. This review provides the neural activity of the IPD interaction process. However, the insufficient ecological validity of IPD tasks and ignore the initiative of people in IPD interaction. Therefore, there is a large research space on this topic. The work of the current systematic review contributed to linking the external performance and inner neural activities of IPD.","Huang, Xinxin; Izumi, Shin-Ichi",Brain Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11081015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439634/,607
638782,Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Medical Student Career Perceptions: Perspectives from Medical Students in China,2021-05-11,"Oral and/or intranasal inoculation of susceptible mouse genotypes with the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM) consistently results in T cell dysfunction as reflected by in vitro proliferative responses to mitogens or allogeneic cells. One approach to examining the mechanism responsible for the observed functional T cell suppression is to determine whether virus replication is required for its induction. To this end, mice were inoculated oronasally with MHV-JHM that was inactivated with short-wave ultraviolet light, betapropiolactone or psoralen. Mice were also inoculated with live MHV-JHM after recovery from homotypic or heterotypic MHV infection. Spleen cells from BALB mice inoculated oronasally with inactivated MHV-JHM yielded extremely variable in vitro proliferative responses after concanavalin A stimulation. MHV-susceptible mice exposed oronasally or intraperitoneally to virus inactivated by any of the minimum effective treatments failed to seroconvert. Immunization with psoralen-treated virus intraperitoneally in Freund's complete adjuvant or oronasally failed to protect from live virus challenge, but survivors had elevated virus-specific serum IgG antibody titers compared to mock-immunized controls at two weeks post-challenge. Spleen cells from mice that were challenged after recovery from homotypic live virus infection did not exhibit the profound in vitro T cell suppression normally observed during the acute stage of primary infection. In contrast, MHV-JHM challenge of mice vaccinated with heterotypic live MHV-S resulted in significantly depressed in vitro T cell function. The combined data suggest that either virus replication or exposure to more concentrated antigen may be required for induction of the dramatic T cell dysfunction that occurs as a consequence of MHV-JHM infection as well as for a detectable MHV-specific humoral response.","Smith, A.

639697,Lack of Informations about COVID-19 Vaccine: From Implications to Intervention for Supporting Public Health Communications in COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-06-07,"Damage to intestinal epithelial cells and the induction of cellular apoptosis are characteristics of inflammatory bowel disease. The C-type lectin receptor family member LSECtin promotes apoptotic cell clearance by macrophages and induces the production of anti-inflammatory/tissue growth factors, which direct intestinal repair in experimental colitis. However, the mechanisms by which the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells triggers the pro-repair function of macrophages remain largely undefined. Here, using immunoprecipitation in combination with mass spectrometry to identify LSECtin-interacting proteins, we found that LSECtin interacted with mTOR, exhibiting a role in activating mTORC1. Mechanistically, apoptotic cells enhance the interaction between LSECtin and mTOR, and increase the activation of mTORC1 induced by LSECtin in macrophages. Elevated mTORC1 signaling triggers macrophages to produce anti-inflammatory/tissue growth factors that contribute to the proliferation of epithelial cells and promote the reestablishment of tissue homeostasis. Collectively, our findings suggest that LSECtin-dependent apoptotic cell clearance by macrophages activates mTORC1, and thus contributes to intestinal regeneration and the remission of colitis.","Li, Qian; cheng, Hanxing; Liu, Yuanping; Wang, Xiaowen; He, Fuchu; Tang, Li",Cell Death Dis,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-03114-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106485/,607
639777,The Association Between Chronic Disease and Serious COVID-19 Outcomes and Its Influence on Risk Perception: Survey Study and Database Analysis,2021-01-12,"During a comparison of the infectivity of mNDK, a CD4-independent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain, to various cell lines, we found that HeLa cells were much less susceptible than 293T and TE671 cells. Hybridoma cells between HeLa and 293T cells were as susceptible as 293T cells, suggesting that cellular factors enhance the mNDK infection in 293T cells. By screening a cDNA expression library in HeLa cells, cystatin C was isolated as an enhancer of the mNDK infection. Because cathepsin B protease, a natural ligand of cystatin C, was upregulated in HeLa cells, we speculated that the high levels of cathepsin B activities were inhibitory to the CD4-independent infection and that cystatin C enhanced the infection by impairing the excessive cathepsin B activity. Consistent with this idea, pretreatment of HeLa cells with 125 µM of CA-074Me, a cathepsin B inhibitor, resulted in an 8-fold enhancement of the mNDK infectivity. Because cathepsin B is activated by low pH in acidic endosomes, we further examined the potential roles of endosomes in the CD4-independent infection. Suppression of endosome acidification or endocytosis by inhibitors or by an Eps15 dominant negative mutant reduced the infectivity of mNDK in which CD4-dependent infections were not significantly impaired. Taken together, these results suggest that endocytosis, endosomal acidification, and cathepsin B activity are involved in the CD4-independent entry of HIV-1.","Yoshii, Hiroaki; Kamiyama, Haruka; Goto, Kensuke; Oishi, Kazunori; Katunuma, Nobuhiko; Tanaka, Yuetsu; Hayashi, Hideki; Matsuyama, Toshifumi; Sato, Hironori; Yamamoto, Naoki; Kubo, Yoshinao",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21541353/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019352,607

STUDY DESIGN: Cross‐sectional cohort comparison. METHODS: A national anonymous survey was used to query participants regarding nasal symptoms and chemosensory dysfunction including sensitivity levels, and presence or absence of distortions and phantoms within the 6‐week time window surrounding their COVID‐19 testing and survey completion. RESULTS: Three‐hundred and sixty‐four respondents who reported COVID‐19 positive (COVID+; n = 176) or COVID‐19 negative (COVID−; n = 188) test results completed the survey. The COVID+ cohort had higher occurrence rates for: (a) chemosensory sensitivity impairments (67.0% vs 30.3%; P < .01), where the rate of complete loss of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia) was higher (35.8% vs 4.8%; P < .01), and (b) chemosensory distortions (39.8% vs 19.1%; P < .01), where the rate of anosmia or ageusia with distortions was also higher in the COVID+ cohort (19.9% vs 2.7%; P < .01). Occurrence rates in the two cohorts were similar for chemosensory phantoms (COVID+ 17.0%, COVID− 18.6%; P = .70) and nasal discharge or stuffiness in the presence of sensitivity impairment (COVID+ 63.6%, COVID− 52.6%; P = .17). CONCLUSION: Chemosensory dysfunction in COVID‐19 is associated with higher rates of smell or taste sensitivity impairments and distortions. Higher rates of anosmia and ageusia drive these key findings. Chemosensory phantoms and nasal symptoms in the presence of sensitivity impairment occur at rates that should demand clinical attention, but they do not appear to be specific to COVID‐19 positivity.

However, due to limited resources, re-assessment of treatment paradigms in the wake of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is urgently required. In this rapid review, we described contemporary oncological outcomes for OSCC using non-surgical modalities. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted for articles published between January 1, 2010 and April 1, 2020 on MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL. Studies were included if they contained patients with OSCC treated with either neoadjuvant, induction, or definitive radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or combination thereof, and an outcome of overall survival. RESULTS: In total, 36 articles were identified. Definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were the focus of 18 articles and neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were the focus of the other 18 articles. In early stage OSCC, definitive radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, was associated with a significantly increased hazard of death compared to definitive surgery (HR: 2.39, 95% CI: 1.56 - 3.67, I(2): 63%). The hazard of death was non-significantly increased with definitive chemoradiotherapy in studies excluding early disease (HR: 1.98, 95% CI: 0.85 - 4.64, I(2): 84%). Two recent randomized control trials have been conducted, demonstrating no survival advantage to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that primary radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy are inferior to surgical management for OSCC. Strategies for surgical delay warranting consideration are sparse, but may include several neoadjuvant regimens, recognizing these regimens may not offer a survival benefit over definitive surgery alone.","Forner, David; Noel, Christopher W.; Wu, Vincent; Parmar, Ambica; Chan, Kelvin K.Y.; de Almeida, John R.; Husain, Zain; Eskander, Antoine",Oral Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599499/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1368837520302852?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1368837520302852; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.104849,607

Following re-opening, schools resumed operation at a reduced level for nine weeks. During this phase, we aimed at assessing, among students and teachers, infection status, symptoms, individual behaviour, and institutional infection prevention measures. Twenty-four primary and secondary school classes, randomly selected across Berlin, were examined. Oro-nasopharyngeal swabs and capillary blood samples were collected to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR) and specific IgG (ELISA), respectively. Medical history, household characteristics, leisure activities, fear of infection, risk perception, hand hygiene, facemask wearing, and institutional preventive measures were assessed. Descriptive analysis was performed. Among 535 participants (385 students, 150 staff), one teenager was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.2%), and seven individuals exhibited specific IgG (1.3%). Compared to pre-pandemic times, screen time (e.g., TV, gaming, social media) increased, and the majority of primary school students reported reduced physical activity (42.2%). Fear of infection and risk perception were relatively low, acceptance of adapted health behaviors was high. In this post-lockdown period of low SARS-CoV-2 incidence in Berlin, individual and school-level infection prevention measures were largely adhered to.

Concomitantly, visual and quantitative scores have been proposed for disease extent assessment to ameliorate disease management. PURPOSE: To compare the performance of density histograms (mean lung attenuation, skewness, and kurtosis) and visual scores, along with lung function correlations, in IPF patients submitted to incremental or volumetric thorax HRCT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical data and CT scans of 89 newly diagnosed and therapy-naive IPF patients were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-six incremental and 43 volumetric CT scans were reviewed. No differences of density histograms and visual scores estimates were found by comparing two HRCT techniques, with an optimal inter-operator agreement (concordance correlation coefficient >0.90 in all instances). Single-breath diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO(sb)) was inversely related with the Best score (r = −00.416; p = 0.014), the Kazerooni fibrosis extent (r = −0.481; p = 0.004) and the mean lung attenuation (r = −0.382; p = 0.026), while a positive correlation was observed with skewness (r = 0.583; p = 0.001) and kurtosis (r = 0.543; p = 0.001) in the incremental HRCT sub-group. Similarly, in the volumetric CT sub-cohort, DLCO(sb) was significantly associated with skewness (r = 0.581; p = 0.007) and kurtosis (r = 0.549; p = 0.018). Correlations with visual scores were not confirmed. Forced vital capacity significantly related to all density indices independently on HRCT technique. CONCLUSIONS: Density histograms and visual scores similarly perform in incremental and volumetric HRCT. Density quantification displays an optimal reproducibility and proves to be superior to visual scoring as more strongly correlated with lung function.","Rea, Gaetano; De Martino, Marina; Capaccio, Annalisa; Dolce, Pasquale; Valente, Tullio; Castaldo, Sabrina; Canora, Angelo; Lassandro, Francesco; Bocchino, Marialuisa",Radiol Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-020-01307-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252712/,607

In this regard, lichen metabolites may offer a vast reservoir for the discovery of antiviral drug candidates. Therefore, to find novel compounds against COVID-19, we created a library of 412 lichen compounds and subjected to virtual screening against the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease (Mpro). All the ligands were virtually screened, and 27 compounds were found to have high affinity with Mpro. These compounds were assessed for drug-likeness analysis where two compounds were found to fit well for redocking studies. Molecular docking, drug-likeness, X-Score, and toxicity analysis resulting in two lichen compounds, Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid with Mpro-inhibiting activity. These compounds were finally subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to compare the dynamics behavior and stability of the Mpro after ligand binding. The binding energy was calculated by MM-PBSA method to determine the intermolecular protein–ligand interactions. Our results showed that two compounds; Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid had the binding free energy of − 42.42 kJ mol/1 and − 57.85 kJ mol/1 respectively as compared to reference X77 (− 91.78 kJ mol/1). We concluded that Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid show considerable structural and pharmacological properties and they can be used as hit compounds to develop potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. These lichen compounds may be a suitable candidate for further experimental analysis.

A variety of pathogens could be causative agents for pneumonia, but walking pneumonia is mostly caused by Mycoplasma with slow development and mild symptoms. The aim of this study was to identify mycoplasmas from camels (Camelus dromedarius) and extending the arsenal of factors implicated in pathogenicity of M. arginini to shed light on the current knowledge gap. 460 lung samples (pneumonic; n=210 and apparently healthy; n=250) were randomly collected from the one-humped camels (C. domedarius) that have been imported from Sudan and slaughtered at Cairo Slaughterhouse. 48 out of 210 isolates (22.9%) recovered from the pneumonic lungs were recorded as M. arginini. Positive PCR results were obtained for all 48 isolates. On the other hand, infection with the organism was not detected in the apparently healthy lungs. Hemolysis and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) production, a compound that has previously not been identified as a virulence factor in M. arginini, was evident in 100% of the isolates. The 48 M. arginini isolates were weak in their ability to form biofilm on polystyrene surfaces. All isolates were 100% susceptible to florfenicol and streptomycin and 100% resistant to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to lincomycin, spiromycin, tylosin, doxacyclin and erythromycin was observed at different frequencies. 13 different combinations of antibiotics representing one to four classes were evident with the Macrolide erythromycin being the most represented. It also should be noted that the ciprofloxacin, doxacyclin, lincomycin, erythromycin combination was the most noted in 21/48 isolates. Surprisingly, none of the virulence genes (vsp, uvrC and gapA) and quinolone resistance genes (parC and gyrA) were detected by PCR.","Abdelazeem, Walaa Mohammed; Zolnikov, Tara Rava; Mohammed, Zeinab Roshdy; Saad, Alaa; Osman, Kamelia M",Acta Trop,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001706X20302394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330451/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105500; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X20302394?v=s5,607

653581,Assessment of Mental Health Factors among Health Professionals Depending on Their Contact with COVID-19 Patients,2020-08-12,"BACKGROUND: Effective countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases require an understanding of transmission rate and basic reproduction number (R(0)). R(0) for severe acute respiratory syndrome is generally considered to be >1, whereas that for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is considered to be <1. However, this does not explain the large-scale outbreaks of MERS that occurred in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and South Korean hospitals. Aim: To estimate R(0) in nosocomial outbreaks of MERS. METHODS: R(0) was estimated using the incidence decay with an exponential adjustment model. The KSA and Korean outbreaks were compared using a line listing of MERS cases compiled using publicly available sources. Serial intervals to estimate R(0) were assumed to be six to eight days. Study parameters [R(0) and countermeasures (d)] were estimated by fitting a model to the cumulative incidence epidemic curves using Matlab. FINDINGS: The estimated R(0) in Korea was 3.9 in the best-fit model, with a serial interval of six days. The first outbreak cluster in a hospital in Pyeongtaek had an R(0) of 4.04, and the largest outbreak cluster in a hospital in Samsung had an R(0) of 5.0. Assuming a six-day serial interval, the KSA outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh had R(0) values of 3.9 and 1.9, respectively. CONCLUSION: R(0) for the nosocomial MERS outbreaks in KSA and South Korea was estimated to be in the range of 2–5, which is significantly higher than the previous estimate of <1.

One patient in the control group discontinued lopinavir–ritonavir because of biochemical hepatitis. No patients died during the study. INTERPRETATION: Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir–ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Future clinical study of a double antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b as a backbone is warranted.

656189,Gender inequity and sexual harassment in the pharmacy profession: Evidence and call to action,2021-07-07,"Fruit of Citrus wilsonii Tanaka called as “Xiang yuan” in Chinese, which means fragrant and round. It was widely used in the pharmaceutical and food industries. This fruit has well-known health benefits such as antioxidant, radical scavenging, and anti-inflammatory. Naringin, deacetylnomilin, citric acid, limonin, and nomilin were the characteristic components of Citrus wilsonii Tanaka. Although the fruit of Citrus wilsonii Tanaka possessed many applications, there was a lack of research on the growth period and drying process. In this study, plant metabolomics was used to analyze the biomarkers of the growth period, and appearance indicators and metabolites abundance were combined for the analysis of change regularities of the growth period. The representative differential metabolites of naringin, citric acid, and limonin were screened out, and the abundance of these components was relatively highest in the middle of the growth period. Therefore, the fruit of Citrus wilsonii Tanaka should be harvested before it turned yellow completely, which could effectively ensure the content of potential active ingredients. In the comparison of different drying methods, citric acid and naringin were considered to be representative differential components, but limonoids were relatively stable and not easily affected by drying methods. Naringin was an index component that could not only be reflected the maturity but also related to different drying methods. Considering its physical and chemical properties and its position, naringin had the potential to be a biomarker of Citrus wilsonii Tanaka.","Yan, Hui; Pu, Zong-Jin; Zhang, Zhen-Yu; Zhou, Gui-Sheng; Zou, Dong-Qian; Guo, Sheng; Li, Chao; Zhan, Zhi-Lai; Duan, Jin-Ao",Front Plant Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335665/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.700367,607

Pharmacological inhibition of essential viral proteins, mostly enzymes, is an effective therapeutic alternative in the absence of effective vaccines. However, this strategy commonly encounters drug resistance mechanisms that allow these pathogens to evade control. Due to the dependency on host factors for viral replication, pharmacological disruption of the host-pathogen protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is an important therapeutic alternative to block viral replication. In this review we discuss salient aspects of PPIs implicated in viral replication and advances in the development of small-molecules that inhibit viral replication through antagonism of these interactions.","Llano, Manuel; Peña-Hernandez, Mario A.","Protein-Protein Interactions in Human Disease, Part B",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876162317300676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29459033/; https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.apcsb.2017.11.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876162317300676,607
658605,Development of Summit Recommendations,2021,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Schwannomas are uncommon tumors of the omentum with only 16 reported cases originating from the greater omentum in the literature. We report for the first time a synchronous presentation of an omental schwannoma and cervical cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old female presented with an abdominal mass and heavy vaginal bleeding. An 11.5 × 14.6 × 16.6 cm complex omental mass and 5.4 × 6.2 × 4.4 cm lobulated heterogeneous cervical mass were noted on CT-scan. Wide excision of the complex mass and radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection was performed. The final biopsy revealed benign omental schwannoma and poorly differentiated cervical adenocarcinoma. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Schwannomas originating from the greater omentum are less common than in the lesser omentum due to the paucity of nervous tissue in the former. They can undergo malignant transformation and the most common presentation is abdominal pain/discomfort. Larger tumors may cause catastrophic bleeding. Prompt surgery should be offered and wide local excision with sufficient margins be performed when there is suspicion of malignancy. Schwannomas presenting with multiple or synchronous lesions are commonly associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, schwannomatosis, and Carney's complex. Whether this co-occurrence is simply incidental or has a causal relationship remains to be established. CONCLUSION: Benign schwannoma of the greater omentum is rare and only requires complete tumor excision. However, surgeons should be aware that synchronous presentation of cervical cancer is possible and that thorough examination of both sites should be undertaken when either primary tumor presents.","Yap, Ralph Victor; Santos, Al Marion; Roble, Vincent Matthew",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.105961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33991847/,607
659668,Population Health and Health Services: Old Challenges and New Realities in the COVID-19 Era,2021-02-09,"Diabetes, obesity and hypertension are common comorbidities associated with increased severity and mortality rates from Corona Virus Disease (COVID)-19 [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)]. In this narrative review (using the PubMed database), we discuss epidemiological data and pathophysiological links between diabetes and COVID-19. The potential effects of glycaemic control on the prevalence of COVID-19, and vice versa, are also reviewed, as well as the role of telemedicine and diabetes self-management in the post-COVID-19 era. Finally, we comment on the possible impact of certain antidiabetic drugs on COVID-19 prevention and management. Diabetes has been linked to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, although further research is needed to elucidate this association. In the meantime, physicians should be aware of the potential rise in the prevalence of diabetes, its severity and complications and focus on achieving optimal diabetes prevention and management. Telemedicine and diabetes self-management may help towards this direction. Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may affect viral entry and infection, and thus COVID-19 outcomes, as shown in observational studies. The results of ongoing randomized clinical trials will shed more light on this field.","Katsiki, Niki; Gómez-Huelgas, Ricardo; Mikhailidis, Dimitri P; Pérez-Martínez, Pablo",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34510676/,607
672658,A Wake-up Call for Burnout in Portuguese Physicians During the COVID-19 Outbreak: National Survey Study,2021-06-09,"The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the effectiveness of contactless vital sign monitors that utilize a consumer-friendly camera versus medical grade instruments. A multiple database search was conducted from inception to September 2020. Inclusion criteria were as follows: studies that used a consumer-grade camera (smartphone/webcam) to examine contactless vital signs in adults; evaluated the non-contact device against a reference medical device; and used the participants’ face for measurement. Twenty-six studies were included in the review of which 16 were included in Pearson’s correlation and 14 studies were included in the Bland–Altman meta-analysis. Twenty-two studies measured heart rate (HR) (92%), three measured blood pressure (BP) (12%), and respiratory rate (RR) (12%). No study examined blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)). Most studies had a small sample size (≤ 30 participants) and were performed in a laboratory setting. Our meta-analysis found that consumer-grade contactless vital sign monitors were accurate in comparison to a medical device in measuring HR. Current contactless monitors have limitations such as motion, poor lighting, and lack of automatic face tracking. Currently available consumer-friendly contactless monitors measure HR accurately compared to standard medical devices. More studies are needed to assess the accuracy of contactless BP and RR monitors. Implementation of contactless vital sign monitors for clinical use will require validation in a larger population, in a clinical setting, and expanded to encompass other vital signs including BP, RR, and SpO(2).

However, an inappropriate activation of the complement system has been related to an inflammatory response in multiple diseases, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as Zika infection and radiotherapy. In addition, C1q and C3 (initial activation components of the complement cascade) have been shown to play a key beneficial role in the refinement of synaptic circuits during developmental stages and adult plasticity. Nevertheless, excessive synaptic pruning in the adult brain can be detrimental and has been associated with synaptic loss in several pathological conditions. In this brief review, we will discuss the role of the complement system in synaptic pruning as well as its contribution to neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits. We also mention potential therapeutic approaches to target the complement system to treat several neuroinflammatory diseases and unintended consequences of radiotherapy.","Gomez-Arboledas, Angela; Acharya, Munjal M; Tenner, Andrea J",Immunotargets Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595138/; https://doi.org/10.2147/itt.s305420,607
